In February the company <a href=\"http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=17304&amp;mid=431\">recalled airbag controllers</a> in 112,001 cars due to a problem with a desiccant \u2013 a substance added to keep its workings safe from moisture. That recall was related to <a href=\"http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/acms/cs/jaxrs/download/doc/UCM497033/RCLRPT-16V047-3587.PDF\">an investigation</a> by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) into airbag controllers manufactured by Continental Automotive Systems.</p> <p>But the problem with desiccants in airbag systems is wider spread than a single supplier or even a single automaker: Takata, the Japanese manufacturer of airbag inflators that supplies Toyota, Nissan and Honda, used ammonium nitrate to expand airbags. When that company did not include desiccants in some inflators, the moisture sometimes caused the inflator to explode into shrapnel. The resulting recall of cars containing Takata inflators affected one in every four cars in the US.</p> <p>In a May press conference, NHTSA administrator Mark Rosekind asked reporters to urge their readers to act rapidly if they discovered they had a vehicle affected by the Takata recall: \u201cPlease, as you report your stories, include this: Vehicle owners who have received notice that there are parts available for their repair should take action immediately.\u201d</p> <p>The cars affected in the current Chrysler recall include the 2010 Chrysler Sebring, the 2011-2014 Chrysler 200s, the 2010-2012 Dodge Calibers, the 2010-2014 Dodge Avengers and the 2010-2014 Jeep Patriots and Compasses.</p> <p>In Canada, an additional 142,959 vehicles are recalled; in Mexico 81,901 will be recalled, including the 2010 Chrysler Cirrus compact car.

  "<p>Glenn Stevens is leaving his post as governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and is passing the torch of monetary leadership to Philip Lowe. When it comes to leadership transitions at central banks, there is a track record of incumbents spruiking the property market before retiring just at the right time to leave things for the new guy who \u201ccouldn\u2019t see it coming\u201d.</p> <p>For instance, after 19 years heading the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan retired from his post in 2006 and was replaced by Ben Bernanke. <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/phil-lowe-of-reserve-bank-talks-down-housing-bubble-fears/news-story/bb80a8db18bc56d137479895bda32957\">Like Lowe</a>, in the months prior to his appointment as head of a central bank, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/u5A4Gw20dcw\">Bernanke was denying</a> the existence of a debt-financed housing bubble.

Deflation risks mean they could be here to stay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As with Bernanke and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Lowe holds a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Likewise, Lowe may eventually engage in extraordinary intervention to bail out a banking system that is dangerously overleveraged and exposed to an inflated housing market. But the RBA must think that\u2019s a good thing \u2013 because it let it happen in the first place. </p> <p>Relative to scale, Australia\u2019s level of household debt dwarfs that of the US at the peak of its housing bubble. Today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/how-australian-households-became-the-most-indebted-in-the-world\">the Australian household sector is the most leveraged in the world</a>, with debts equal to 125% of GDP as of the first three months of 2016. In contrast, US household debt peaked at 98% in the first quarter of 2008. The US government was obliged to bail out its overleveraged banking system and mortgage lenders that were too heavily geared towards profiting from mortgage debt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a529ad0af6295e1b0e56028fd04e2cbd8161fabc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a529ad0af6295e1b0e56028fd04e2cbd8161fabc/0_0_473_268/473.jpg\" alt=\"Australian and US unconsolidated household gross debt to GDP ratio 1952-2015\" width=\"473\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian and US unconsolidated household gross debt to GDP ratio 1952-2015</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LF Economics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the four largest banks in America \u2013 JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo \u2013 had a combined loan book equivalent to 21% of American GDP. In Australia, the mortgage book of the Commonwealth Bank alone is equal to 23% of Australian GDP. We are essentially talking about a housing bubble and leverage profile that has reached a completely different realm of \u201cprime\u201d banking and lending.</p> <p>So what will a future Australian economy look like now under Lowe\u2019s tenure? Though nobody has a crystal ball, RBA policy has been structured in a way to promote inefficient financialisation of the economy and debt-financed speculation to specifically inflate land prices. Unfortunately, it is as simple as that.</p> <p>Stevens\u2019 legacy (whether he likes it or not) clearly sucked diversity out of the Australian economy by allowing our banking system to engage in a scheme to funnel a disproportionate sum of new debt specifically towards the housing market so many more people can suddenly afford to pay more for a home (which raises house prices). </p> <p>Though this strategy is already failing in parts of the country, Lowe\u2019s Australia will not, and cannot, afford to care about reforming the economy to be more efficient or innovative. As under the leadership of Stevens, all that matters now is whether house prices rise or fall and household debt continues to expand faster than GDP and household income. If prices rise, already leveraged households feel comfortable spending more. If house prices fall, homeowners who are stuck with a mortgage five to 10 times their annual income place pressure on economic growth and the overleveraged banking system.</p> <p>If there is a house price correction on the scale some of us fear, expect Lowe to introduce more monetary easing followed possibly by a bailout of Australia\u2019s overleveraged banks with the $300bn bailout facility \u2013 called the <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2011/mr-11-25.html\">committed liquidity facility</a>. A bailout of this size for our \u201ctoo big to save\u201d banks may not be enough to cover all shortfalls without possible nationalisation of some of our financial institutions. Our major banks are simply too big, too leveraged and too undercapitalised to survive a crash in house prices without driving the hard-working middle class a little closer to the poverty line.</p> <p>If inequality in Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">wide and rising today</a>, programs such as quantitative easing and bailouts, i.e. the RBA purchasing junk mortgages from banks at a premium, will further boost inequality. It will be an attempt to re-inflate house prices whilst rewarding the same bank executives who messed up in the first place and leaving everyone else to fend for themselves. This will be the RBA policy response under a Lowe leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/06/the-economy-may-be-growing-but-it-sure-doesnt-feel-that-way-to-most-of-us\">The economy may be growing but it sure doesn't feel that way to most of us | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">Quantitative easing </a>can theoretically go on indefinitely. Globally we are in uncharted waters and do not yet know the true limits of QE. However, there are limits to the specific problems QE can solve, particularly structural problems. If it did solve structural problems, Japan\u2019s central bank would have stopped printing money more than a decade ago. Japan\u2019s unemployment rate today is just 3%. Yet its declining population continues to flank economic expansion. Hence in this instance, a wiser approach for Japan would be to reform its immigration policy or restructure the economy to combat a falling population rather than just printing money and hoping it spurs real growth.</p> <p>Back in Australia, the economy is not looking healthy or progressive amid 17 consecutive quarters (a national record) of falling real net national disposable income per capita, plunging capital expenditure, record low wage growth, immense household debt, negative nominal rental price growth, a trade-exposed sector gutted by the high dollar and a lacklustre innovation scene starved of capital. Unfortunately for Lowe, printing money will not solve these structural issues.</p> <p>RBA policy has helped to generate the largest debt-financed asset bubble in Australian history. This is defended by the RBA, including government and industry, as a natural result of deregulation and \u201cinnovation\u201d by the banking and financial sector. This (Wonder Bra) paper wealth creation model has already been tried and tested on numerous occasions globally.

In today\u2019s announcement, the business secretary, Greg Clark, highlighted that the go-ahead for Hinkley was subject to two conditions. One is that the UK government keeps a golden share in Hinkley and similar projects; the other is that ownership of key national assets will be subject to a national security test.<br><br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/535y2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2720468\"            data-video-name=\"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters/AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57da6ff2e4b0e813b694d401\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/15/160915hinkley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/15/160915hinkley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-gets-green-light-video\">Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant gets green light</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>These conditions should be seen as more than mere window dressing. True, similar conditions are the norm in many other major economies. True also, the British government possesses some powers of this kind already. Most people are likely to see them as utterly sensible. What is different, however, is the new political saliency given to such thinking, which accords to government an ineradicable place to act in the national interest. This suggests something bigger and deeper is changing in our politics.</p> <p>The insistence that government needs the power to exercise judicious control over the ownership of an industry in the national interest may seem sensible and moderate to most people. Yet it also seems revolutionary and radical. It is a break from a recent past in which global market forces have routinely been treated as the only secure basis for ownership decisions.</p> <p>Much the same goes for a requirement that a national security consideration be given to large infrastructure projects. This too sounds like common sense. Yet it needed saying. The UK\u2019s appetite for inward investment is now so large that even national security is being increasingly relegated to the margins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efae2e2d9bd34225b53fe2ad81c4b8dfd2a2706f/305_0_2576_3008/856.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary, Greg Clark, \u2018drew a line\u2019 under George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business - and \u2018began to push back\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The re-examination of Hinkley is actually less important in terms of the substance of the deal than for these wider signals. It is one sign among many that the economic liberalism of the political right, which has been in such ascendancy since the 1980s, no longer eclipses all other considerations, including the human cost. Clark didn\u2019t bury George Osborne\u2019s wish to be open for business \u2013 what a vacuous phrase it is \u2013 even in sensitive sectors this week. But he drew a line under it and, in a limited way, began to push back.</p> <p>Not before time, many will say. Not yet enough, lots will add. Both observations are right. But we should nevertheless see this moment in our history for what it is. At the end of the 20th century, the triumph of capitalism and democracy seemed at one stage so complete that an era of global economic liberalism appeared to beckon. Today the folly of that delusion has been made obvious by the financial crisis and its political consequences.</p> <p>But it is not just the economic liberalism of the 80s that has hit rough water. So too has the socio-cultural liberalism of the 60s, with its belief in universal rights and the meaninglessness of difference. That form of liberalism has not been able to withstand the challenge of militant Islamism, with its denial of any universality except its own dogmas. The impact on liberal politics and liberal nation states continues to be immense, visible in Britain in everything from Brexit to the rise in state investigatory powers.</p> <p>Liberalism is a Hydra-headed and extremely resilient creature. There are also few words in the political dictionary that mean so many different things in different contexts. Most of us consider ourselves liberals in some respects but not in others. Adherents of 60s social liberalism are not necessarily adherents of 80s economic liberalism, or vice versa. Nor is either liberalism quite as absolutist as is sometimes claimed. Most people are somewhere on a spectrum of views, whether on social issues or economics.</p> <p>We should not pronounce the death of liberalism prematurely. Just because it is full of contradictions and cannot solve the problems of the age, it does not follow that liberalism is ignoble or that it is doomed to collapse \u2013 still less that there is some self-evidently superior alternative. Most people, at least in Britain, still seem prepared to support the liberal democratic order and many of the important liberal social and economic ideas on which it rests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316b197a19b120512f41e0a0fad6c7be03784fa1/750_0_3077_3120/986.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019\" width=\"986\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May in Downing Street after becoming prime minister: \u2018Her speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly useful to see ours not as a liberal age but as a post-liberal one. There has been a rumbling discussion about post-liberalism for some years, triggered not least by concerns about the weakening impact of migration on national social democracies. But it is striking that this week saw the publication of a book by <a href=\"http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/the-politics-of-virtue\">John Milbank and Adrian Pabst</a>, which takes post-liberalism as an established reality and as the starting point for the examination of a new kind of politics based on a vision of social and personal virtue and what the authors dub conservative socialism.</p> <p>In Britain, the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote is the most striking example of this shift. May is not an economic liberal like Margaret Thatcher or a social liberal like David Cameron. In fact, liberalism of any kind seems almost a marginal consideration in her thinking and her policy making. These are still early days, but May\u2019s speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking.</p> <p>All of this poses a particular problem to the one party in British politics that proudly defines itself as liberal. The Liberal Democrats have more immediate hand-to-mouth concerns as they gather for their conference in Brighton than whether liberalism is in terminal eclipse. Nevertheless, in government between 2010 and 2015, the Lib Dems were the victims both of the crisis of economic liberalism, in the shape of austerity, and the crisis of social liberalism, in the rise of anti-migrant feeling articulated by Ukip. Liberals need to get real as well as feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>As Milbank and Pabst stress, liberalism is certainly not inherently bad, but it does have defects and inherent problems. Brexit is in part a revolt against a set of characteristics of modern liberalism. We have a new political agenda that no political party can afford to ignore. Whether we consider ourselves liberal or not, we increasingly inhabit post-liberal times.</p>",

He projected 25m new jobs would be created broadly within the timeframe of a two-term Trump presidency, as a result of an average annual growth rate that would rise from current projections of about 2% to 3.5% through his tax-cutting and trade policies.</p> <p>The audaciousness of that boast is underlined by comparison with previous presidents. It would bring American job creation levels back to the golden days enjoyed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s when the dotcom boom and an expanding global economy saw 21m jobs created under his watch.</p> <p>By contrast, Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House have seen almost 10m jobs created within a sluggish recovery from the 2008 collapse.</p> <p>Even more audaciously, Trump said he could achieve such a boon to employment while keeping the national budget deficit neutral. \u201cIf we achieve 4% growth it will reduce the deficit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Buoyed by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">new polls</a> showing him in effect tied nationally with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the real estate billionaire said he could pull off such a turnaround in the US economy through a combination of traditional conservative tax cutting and by tearing up trade deals and bringing jobs back to America from Mexico and China. His words were given added poignancy, though he did not make overt reference to the fact, by the setting of his speech in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue, a legendary hotel bought by a Chinese insurance company in 2014.</p> <p>On taxes, Trump proposed to simplify the tax code into three brackets down from seven, and to take poor earners out of tax altogether with individuals with an income under $25,000 (\u00a319,000) and married couples under $50,000 paying no tax. </p> <p>However, with his tax cuts applying to all earners, no matter how wealthy, they would have a regressive effect. The Tax Policy Center has calculated the richest 0.1% would on average see tax cuts under his plan of $1.3m in 2017 compared with just $5,100 for everybody else.</p> <p>Trump tried to counter that criticism that he was putting forward policies that would benefit the 1% by modelling how average families would fare under his vision. A married couple earning $5m a year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses would only get a 3% reduction in their tax bill, he said, compared with a 35% reduction for a similar couple earning $50,000 and with $8,000 in child care.</p> <p>\u201cPeople earning $5m will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all,\u201d he said. </p> <p>But in other parts of his address, he underlined reforms that would be to the advantage of wealthy Americans, including his proposed abolition of the estate tax that is only paid on inheritances valued at over $5m. He also repeated his promise to slash the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, earning a robust cheer from the many corporate leaders eating lunch on the ballroom floor in front of him.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been widely criticized by analysts.

The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hinkley-point-c\" title=\"\">only change from a move that infuriated the Chinese and flummoxed the French investors appears to be a British veto</a> on any sale of the Gallic interest during construction, and in future a new national security test for all foreign investment in critical infrastructure. All the pause really illustrates is that when it comes to nuclear, Britain is no longer a player in a world in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/russias-state-owned-nuclear-group-keen-to-break-into-uk-market\" title=\"\">Russia</a> and China vie to dominate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans\">China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hinkley C is an unproven design that comes at a punitive cost. Given the bill that will finally be picked up by the British taxpayer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/nuclear-power-is-risky-and-expensive-heres-a-better-idea\" title=\"\">it could well be no riskier</a> to make a commitment on a similar scale to building <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-power-a-national-infrastructure-commission-report\" title=\"\">a smart energy network</a> that delivers power efficiently. This approach could be complemented by investing more heavily in reducing demand through measures such as better insulation, while expanding renewables, whose costs are falling. Already offshore wind is the only source more costly than nuclear.</p> <p>But nuclear clearly has some advantages. It is low carbon and Britain would struggle to meet its target of carbon-free energy by 2050 without it. It will keep the lights on in a way that most renewable energy cannot yet be relied upon to do, although the gap is narrowing as storage technology improves.</p> <p>Unlike onshore windfarms, fracking or even extensive solar installations, all of which arouse powerful local opposition, most of the neighbours at Hinkley C want the investment. It will safeguard existing jobs and it will deliver new ones \u2013 as many as 25,000, it is estimated. British business is eagerly anticipating a supply-line bonanza. Most of all, after the shattering blow of the Brexit vote and its potential impact on foreign investment, it is hard to see how Mrs&#xa0;May could really risk withdrawing approval for Hinkley C.</p> <p>In trying to exercise power, the prime minister has instead illustrated the constraints on her scope for action in an area where she has to maintain a fragile balance between national security, global investment and the demands of climate change politics. She could be forgiven for wishing she was starting somewhere else.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edie.net/news/10/Hinkley-Point-nuclear-energy-plant-development-timeline-and-schedule-2016/\" title=\"\">For nearly a decade</a>, Hinkley C has been presented as the magic bullet that will keep the lights on for generations to come, and a prelude to a huge expansion of nuclear power to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy and the need to take old, dirty and inefficient capacity out of service. But&#xa0;after some costly experiences, Britain has lost its nuclear know-how: by the time it was completed in 1995, the last nuclear power station to be built, Sizewell B in Suffolk, was 40% over budget and successive governments have retreated from such ambitious infrastructure investment. When, in 2006, Labour tentatively proposed putting nuclear back in the energy mix, it already appeared certain that new nuclear would be built with foreign expertise and capital.</p> <p>British consumers will not bear the \u00a318.5bn&#xa0;construction costs of Hinkley C. But nuclear is far too costly and too slow to produce a return to attract private sector investment without huge incentives. That&#xa0;is why EDF secured a guaranteed price for its electricity that is nearly double the current wholesale cost, for half of its planned lifetime; it is why the government has also underwritten construction costs by \u00a32bn, and it explains the decision which so worried Mrs&#xa0;May, to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/china-to-take-one-third-stake-in-24bn-hinkley-nuclear-power-station\" title=\"\">Beijing to pick up a third of the cost</a> as a quid pro quo for future permission to build at least one nuclear power station to its own design, at Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>The decision is made, but implementation will matter too. The benefits that the government is claiming for the project must be realised. The consumer must not end up with the bill for construction, jobs must come to Britain and above all, the technology has to work. But there is more to it than that. This is a tale that illustrates one of the basic lessons in the No 10 manual of governance: in a competitive field, energy policy is one of the hardest to get right. Keeping the lights on without adding to global warming at a price that consumers can afford is complex. And nuclear, with its lethal waste and high decommissioning costs, is no long-term solution; the worst judgment of all on Mrs May\u2019s first big strategic choice is to find that it drives out investment in other, smarter, solutions which are the real technologies of the future.</p>",
  "<p>The government is to press ahead with increases of up to 500% in court fees for immigration and asylum cases, despite a consultation in which all but five of 147 responses opposed the move.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed the decision on Thursday, saying it was grateful for the responses to the consultation, but the policy remained that, where fees were charged to access public services, they should be set at such a level to recover the full cost.</p> <p>The decision means that fees for an application to the first-tier tribunal dealing with immigration and asylum cases will increase from \u00a380 to \u00a3490 for \u201ca decision on the papers,\u201d and from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800 for an oral hearing. </p> <p>Fees are to be introduced for the first time for appeals to the upper tribunal: \u00a3350 for applications and \u00a3510 for the appeal hearing.</p> <p>The ministry\u2019s response to the consultation estimates that the charges will raise \u00a334m a year on top of the \u00a37m brought in annually by existing fees. This compares with estimated annual running costs of \u00a386m for both tribunals.</p> <p>Ministers have made one concession as a result of the consultation. Immigration and asylum applicants who have already been assessed as destitute by the Home Office will not have to pay the tribunal fees. Existing exemptions, such as for those on asylum support or people who already qualify for legal aid, will continue to apply.</p> <p>The Law Centres Network said the rises were disgraceful and meant that asylum seekers faced \u201cwhopping\u201d fees. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services Union said: \u201cIt is utterly reprehensible that this government is pressing ahead with a 500% increase in tribunal fees, despite overwhelming opposition from law firms, judges, professional bodies, charities and unions.\u201d</p> <p>But the MoJ said the fee increases would secure the funding of immigration and asylum tribunals, while \u201cprotecting access to justice and the most vulnerable appellants through extension of the fee exemption scheme\u201d.</p> <p>The fee increases for first-tier tribunals were to be implemented as soon as possible, followed by those for the upper tribunal.</p> <p>A separate MoJ consultation paper, titled transforming our justice system, published on Thursday, contains a commitment to continue the former justice secretary Michael Gove\u2019s programme of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/21/new-york-problem-solving-courts-england-wales\">introducing US-style problem-solving courts</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe are exploring the opportunities for problem-solving methods further with the judiciary and collecting the evidence base,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are continuing to trial this approach in locations across the UK.\u201d</p> <p>However, the paper was coupled with an announcement that two more magistrates courts in London, Hammersmith and Camberwell Green, were to close. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Labour MP and former justice minister Andy Slaughter said the closure of the Hammersmith court would \u201cincrease the travel and waiting times for users who will now have to travel to magistrates courts on the other side of London, something that is particularly troubling for those on modest means and those with reduced mobility\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, the MoJ\u2019s initiative to allow victims and witnesses to provide cross-examinations that were pre-recorded outside court was welcomed by Citizens Advice.</p> <p>\u201cFor victims and witnesses of crime, giving evidence in court can be a daunting experience,\u201d said the Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy. \u201cSome witnesses are understandably anxious about the prospect of attending court in person and going through cross-examination. Reliving what may have been a traumatic event in front of the defendant as well as the judiciary can be particularly stressful, especially for victims of crime.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>This coming Monday, 19 September, is the feast day of Saint Theodore of Tarsus (602-690), one of my political heroes. Born in modern-day Turkey, he fled the approaching Muslim army and ended up as archbishop of Canterbury, where, among other things, he invented the parish system. If localism has a patron saint, he is a Turkish immigrant. For the parish system became not just the basic unit of ecclesiastical government, but also, for centuries, our basic unit of social togetherness. The whole idea of a priest and a parish was the very infrastructure of local community. With the shop and the pub, it came to define what we meant by the local. This was where roots were set, where generations were born and died, where the British values of social togetherness were nurtured. It was perhaps the single most important moral contribution of the church to British society. It\u2019s where the \u201cwe\u201d has precedence over the \u201cI\u201d.</p> <p>But localism is now much derided. On a plane back from Israel last week, passing the time with in-flight entertainment, I am subjected to the most excruciating <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/149172139\">advertisement for Pullman hotels</a>. The music pulsates. A young man is going for a run in Shanghai, off to some high-powered meeting, then returning to his hotel. The narrator sounds sexy and enticing. \u201cNo frontiers, no borders, no limits. You are the beautiful nomads. And our world is your playground.\u201d I shuddered. What morally vacuous sentiments.</p> <p>I thought of all the people I might be literally flying over, risking everything, desperate to escape the misery of Syrian barrel bombs. No frontiers? No borders? Beautiful nomads? The contrast was offensive, sick. For millions, born with the wrong sort of passport, the world is a vale of tears, a daily struggle for survival and the survival of their children. These people squeeze themselves through razor wire and face the daily rejection of strangers. How they must loathe the easy entitlement of the beautiful nomad, ugly with self-worth, for whom \u201cour world is your playground\u201d. And, yes, I feel convicted by that description too.</p> <p>The philosophy of the beautiful nomad is often called liberalism. It\u2019s the philosophy of the unfettered self, free from restraint, free from the tiresome constraints of place and the local. Indeed, from the perspective of this liberal cosmopolitanism, the local community is a place to escape from, to grow out of, a place of narrow-minded sameness, a place to go back to at Christmas, but nothing more. Asked where he came from, the philosopher Diogenes replied that he was \u201ca citizen of the world\u201d.</p> <p>The beautiful nomad would think it an outrage that they\u2019d have to pay for a visa to travel to Europe, for instance.</p> <p>Michael Oakeshott, another philosopher, shows us how beautiful nomads are made. He argues that it is precisely the job of liberal education to sever people from their attachments to the local: \u201cEach of us is born in a corner of the earth,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut school and university are where a learner is emancipated from the limitations of his local circumstances. They are sheltered places where excellence may be heard because the din of local partialities is no more than a distant rumble.\u201d</p> <p>The values of the beautiful nomad are the opposite of those of Theodore and his community-orientated parishes. Here in the parish, what we mean by \u201csocial mobility\u201d is helping the elderly get to the shops. And not about clever youngsters moving onwards and upwards, cutting themselves off from their roots and their background, rarely to return.</p> <p>I know why the people of Syria leave their homes and seek a new place to live. Most of them would prefer to have stayed put. But they need safety. And we should welcome them. They are not hopping around. They want to settle. No, it is the beautiful nomad that is the dangerous creature. Having little respect for roots or for locality, s/he is the digital \u00fcbermensch, the epitome of capitalist entitlement that believes only in the things that s/he has made, bought or chosen. And like a locust, the rapacious consumption of the beautiful nomad turns the world into a desert. \u201cIt\u2019s not about where you are,\u201d advises the Pullman advert. Place is unimportant. Just consume and move on.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\">@giles_fraser</a></em><br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 September 2016.

But what about the rest of us? | Carmel Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ivanka in particular has all her father\u2019s \u201cpros\u201d and almost none of his incredibly off-putting cons. She has balanced motherhood with owning her own company. She has been successful in practically every area of business, including <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/07/ivanka-trump-book-working-women/\">her work</a> as an author, all while keeping a certain amount of traditional femininity that Republicans still praise. She came into the political spotlight as an outsider but has proven she has plenty of acumen on the campaign trail, at the same level or even beyond that of her father. She has access to the Trump family\u2019s self-funding resources. She would even have Donald Trump himself at her disposal as a fiercely loyal supporter unafraid to speak his mind on camera.</p> <p>In addition to bringing a sharp sense of business management and outside perspective, Ivanka doesn\u2019t carry the same downsides as Donald. She has managed to stay above her father\u2019s controversial statements about birth certificates, immigration and war heroes. She doesn\u2019t have a combative relationship with the press or drive away young and Hispanic voters. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Ivanka has remained poised, well-spoken and relatable.</p> <p>Bonus: Ivanka Trump cancels out Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cwoman\u201d card.</p> <p>There are many incredible Republican women, both elected and in leadership, but the GOP has yet to secure a serious female presidential contender. This perpetuates the stereotype that the party consists of mostly old white men, especially since the presidential race gets more news coverage than any other campaign. While the stereotype doesn\u2019t hold true down-ballot, the past few Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t helped the GOP image problem regardless of the broad choices at the start of the primary.</p> <p>The Trumps intimately understand the importance of image. Ivanka\u2019s image includes her own lovely features and her picture-perfect all-American family. If she ran on a Republican ticket, she\u2019d be hard to ignore.</p> <p>In addition to her non-political qualities, we have already seen the kind of policies Ivanka would want to focus on in a hypothetical run for office. Her convention speech touched on some controversial ideas among conservatives, such as the role of the government in paid maternity leave and childcare (she was instrumental in crafting her father\u2019s policy in that area). </p> <p>How the federal government should approach these issues is still up for debate among both parties, but Ivanka\u2019s raising the issue shows how in touch she is with the real-world problems facing Americans. Ivanka showed both an awareness of these challenges and a certain sensitivity that her father lacks. Her openness about her own family, including adorable pictures of her new baby, probably doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p> <p>She also focused on the importance of equal opportunity for all. Both Trumps have hired and promoted women for leadership positions, but Ivanka doesn\u2019t have any on-the-record sexist comments to accompany hers. In fact, when she <a href=\"http://time.com/4417579/republican-convention-ivanka-trump-transcript/\">talked</a> about her father hiring the best person for the for the job, it became quite clear that Donald\u2019s faith in his daughter was not misplaced. She offered a far more convincing profile of her father as a smart and caring businessman than anything Trump has said on his own.</p> <p>Many Trump supporters argue that their candidate is a real person, unlike the \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians in Washington. But the Trump brand \u2013 plastered across casinos, hotels and televisions shows \u2013 has made Donald larger than real life. </p> <p>Ivanka, on the other hand, posts Instagram photos without makeup, is frank about her motherhood and retains a down-to-earth persona effortlessly exuded during her meetings with voters. A strong woman who has managed to balance her family and success seems like a no-brainer.</p> <p>Even though Ivanka turns 35 next month, making her eligible for the office of commander-in-chief, she sadly won\u2019t be on the ballot in place of her dad. But since family dynasties have been in political fashion for the past 15 years in the US, she might consider what she could bring to the GOP in future races.</p>",
  "<p>Seven years ago, Dr Charles Runels\u2019 lover surprised him at his office, demanding that he inject blood into her clitoris as a Valentine\u2019s Day present. She hiked up her dress, hopped on to the exam table and motioned for Runels to put on his headlamp. She explained that she\u2019d been watching him inject his own penis with blood for about a year, and that while his bigger and stronger erections had been fun, she\u2019d grown tired of the one-sided sexual enhancement. It was her turn. So Runels bowed between her legs, numbed her clitoris with an ice cube and shot her up. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how graphic you can be with this thing,\u201d he said over the phone, pausing mid-story to ask me about the Guardian\u2019s policy on discussing orgasms. \u201cBut the next afternoon, she came to see me, and her orgasms came more quickly \u2013 very strong, ejaculatory orgasms. The passion, the thunder, the sounds that she was making \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He sighed at the memory.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I thought: I should try this on my patients.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, the O-Shot was born. </p> <p>The non-surgical treatment that aims to facilitate and improve orgasms in women, which Runels trademarked in 2011, can only be performed by him or one of the more than 500 certified practitioners he\u2019s trained over the years. It has two steps: first, he extracts PRP, or platelet-rich plasma, from a woman\u2019s blood (usually taken from her arm). He then re-inserts it into the clitoris and the ceiling of her vagina with a syringe. The infusion of white blood cells, according to Runels, increases lubrication and sensitivity, allowing the patient to reach climax easily. </p> <p>Today, more than 20,000 women have had the procedure done, and Runels estimates an 85% success rate. In the mainstream medical community, however, the O-Shot is controversial; its findings are viewed as inadequately tested (it\u2019s not FDA approved) and some question whether its effects boil down to nothing more than placebo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Runels, the ability to have good orgasms is essential to a woman\u2019s overall wellbeing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Runels insists the procedure changes lives. He also claims it can cure incontinence and pain during sex caused by anything ranging from scarring after childbirth, to post-radiation dryness and even female genital mutilation (FGM). For Runels, the ability to have good orgasms \u201cempowers\u201d assault victims and is essential to a woman\u2019s \u201coverall wellbeing\u201d. </p> <p>In others words, this is a man obsessed with making women come.</p> <p>As I listened to him describe the procedure and his philosophy, I wondered: who was this man who\u2019d dedicated so much of his life to helping women orgasm? What was behind Runels\u2019 fixation? Was he a feminist revolutionary? Or a total creep? </p> <p>I booked a flight to Alabama to find out. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c1ef963915875cda3eb2ba6c651b66357f0f0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1ef963915875cda3eb2ba6c651b66357f0f0c8/0_320_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Charles Runels does an O-Shot procedure on a patient inside his clinic in Fairhope, Alabama, with help from staff member Danielle Gautier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Charles Runels does an O-Shot procedure on a patient inside his clinic in Fairhope, Alabama, with help from staff member Danielle Gautier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Fairhope, Alabama (population 5,326) is an unlikely place to find a man trying to revolutionize women\u2019s sexual health. Runels admits that living \u201cin the buckle of the Bible belt\u201d \u2013 where vibrators are literally illegal, thanks to the state\u2019s Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act \u2013 poses certain drawbacks.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as you\u2019re not too open about it, you can find the free-thinking people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still, peddling clit injections seemed like a hard sell. </p> <p>Runels\u2019 office isn\u2019t anything like the sterile exam rooms most women associate with gynecological exams. It\u2019s intimate, personal and cozy \u2013 because in addition to treating thousands of patients there over the years, he also lives there. The small entryway opens on to a living room dominated by gym equipment. In the bathroom, I found a functioning shower and shelves filled with employees\u2019 toiletries. The only examination table was separated from the kitchen by a curtain. </p> <p>Pamela, Julie and Vivienne \u2013 the three women on Runels\u2019 four-person staff \u2013 greeted me with open arms. In order to better understand what they promoted, Pamela and Vivienne told me they\u2019d both had O-Shots administered by Runels. (Mark, the sole male employee, opted for the male version, a \u201cP-Shot\u201d.)</p> <p>When I asked whether it was weird for any of them that their employer had seen their genitals, they laughed: \u201cOf course not!\u201d Pamela had never felt better; she said she enjoyed multiple orgasms now.

She told me that doctors regularly flew in from all over the world to be trained in the procedure, and that initially they reacted to offers of free O-Shots just as I had \u2013 with a mix of embarrassment and surprise. But by the end, she said, everyone wanted one.<br></p> <p>She and Runels laughed, recalling how the last class had run until three in the morning, just to accommodate demand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Baptist revival, except you\u2019re injecting each other\u2019s genitals,\u201d he said. </p> <p>I assured them I wasn\u2019t interested. Runels looked at me and said: \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if you change your mind.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Throughout this piece, I\u2019ve changed O-Shot recipients\u2019 names \u2013 including those of Runels\u2019 employees \u2013 in order to protect their identities.

But soon her father \u201cnoticed something different\u201d about her and started calling her a \u201cwhore and a lesbian\u201d. Physical abuse followed when Lacey\u2019s next rapist, her husband, found himself unable to climax unless Lacey was in excruciating pain. He raped her throughout their 10-year relationship, and left her with herpes, incontinence and vaginal scarring. </p> <p>At 29 years old, she wet the bed, had never had an orgasm and thought her vagina was deformed. Doctors responded to her concerns by suggesting lube and psychotherapy. </p> <p>At 30, Lacey never expected to experience sexual pleasure again. She tried using a back massager for stimulus, but it left a painful callous on her clitoris. Later she met Runels at the bank where she worked. After learning what he did, she confided in him, and Runels said he knew of something that might help \u2013 or, at the very least, something that would not hurt her. </p> <p>Lacey got the O-Shot on her lunch break, and immediately \u201cfelt alive down there\u201d. Over the next few weeks the callous slowly disappeared, revealing healthy, circulated tissue. Her incontinence went away. </p> <p>But more than anything, Lacey felt healed by her newfound ability to orgasm; before the shot, climaxing, if it happened at all, had taken about half an hour of \u201cjackhammering friction\u201d. After the shot, she switched to a gentle (and illegal \u2013 remember, this is Alabama) finger vibrator, and came within seconds.

He did not have pimples; he had oozing, volcanic skin that piled up on itself. Individual features disappeared.

(This paper has since been published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease.) </p> <p>Gunter, who specialized in lichen sclerosus and had previously warred with Runels on Twitter, said she\u2019d seen the paper but couldn\u2019t take it seriously, since it only involved nine participants \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a case series, not a study\u201d \u2013 not to mention that the overall absence of a placebo group ruined its findings.

Didn\u2019t dismissing a woman\u2019s sexuality as a psychological issue implicitly throw into question her ability to describe what was happening to her body?</p> <p>Gunter countered that the dermatological issues associated with lichen sclerosus were categorically separate from sexual function. She had patients \u201cin their 50s, 60s\u201d with lichen sclerosus who didn\u2019t even care about sex \u201cbecause their husbands were impotent\u201d.</p> <p>I flinched at this. Wasn\u2019t it sort of a double standard to say that if man can\u2019t get erection, he\u2019s \u201cimpotent\u201d \u2013 in other words: he has sexual dysfunction whether he wants it or not, but a woman only has it if it bothers her? </p> <p>Why did diagnoses of sexual dysfunction appear to be split along gender lines, considered either physical or psychosomatic depending on the presence or absence of an erection?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why do diagnoses of dysfunction appear split along gender lines, dependent on the presence or absence of an erection?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gunter sighed. Apparently I was conflating two separate fields. She urged me to run some of the scenarios I\u2019d mentioned (injecting lovers, injecting employees) by a bioethics expert. </p> <p>So I contacted Tim Caulfield, a professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s school of law and school of public health.</p> <p>Caulfield told me that PRP first became \u201csexy\u201d in 2013, when NBA players such as Kobe Bryant started getting the injections to heal athletic injuries. That same year, blood injections rocketed into the world of trendy cosmetics when doctors in Miami gave Kim Kardashian a \u201cvampire facelift\u201d (another of Runels\u2019 trademarked PRP procedures, it turns out, where blood is dripped all over the T-zone while attacking the area with needles). </p> <p>Afterward, Kardashian posted a selfie of her blood-soaked face (when the photo went viral, her doctor received an official \u201ccease and desist\u201d call from Runels, who explained he owned the trademark). But despite its popularity in mainstream media, Caulfield said that the actual science behind PRP was \u201ciffy\u201d at best. </p> <p>Like Gunter, he brought up the placebo effect \u2013 and, in particular, \u201cplacebo theater\u201d. He explained that white coats, medical lingo and especially the presence of needles combine to heighten a patient\u2019s anticipation that a treatment will work. </p> <p>The O-Shot ranged in price from $1,200-$1,500, and controlled studies have shown that more costly treatments increased the placebo effect \u2013 an effect that is so strong, it has been shown to actually create physical improvement in Parkinson\u2019s symptoms. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Studies have shown that more costly treatments increased the placebo effect \u2013 and can even improve Parkinson's symptoms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was my kneejerk reaction to stand up for Runels predicated on subconscious insecurity?

Runels paid his lawyer $30,000-$50,000 a month just to track down and send cease-and-desist letters to anyone who advertised the O-Shot without having trained with Runels or someone in his medical group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Runels paid his lawyer $30,000-$50,000 a month to send cease-and-desist letters to anyone who advertised the O-Shot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two of Runels\u2019 assistants, Pamela and Julie, entered to tell me Julie would be getting the O-Shot \u2013 <em>right then \u2013 </em>so I could witness how painless it was. Julie explained that this wasn\u2019t just for my benefit \u2013 that she was 50 years old, had suffered incontinence since having kids and was hoping the O-Shot would help. So I put away my sushi and followed her through the curtain. Moments later, in an awkward attempt to make conversation while I sat between her legs, I said: \u201cYour vagina looks like my vagina.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Julie said, sounding relieved as she glanced down at her lap. She lay back, clutching Pamela\u2019s hand, explaining that she\u2019d always secretly thought that she might be \u201cdeformed down there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone comes here thinking that,\u201d Pamela reassured her. </p> <p>Runels hummed his way into the room and after drawing blood from Julie\u2019s arm, he loaded it into the centrifuge and left us alone so that Pamela could lather on the numbing cream. She used her fingers to spread Julie\u2019s labia, gently coaxed the clitoris from its hood and applied the ointment. After giving it time to kick in, Runels returned to inject the lidocaine into the top crest of Julie\u2019s labia minora \u2013 at the point just before it branched into the base of the clitoris. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23960dacf766915207e6816e2980eb5aa407bc82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23960dacf766915207e6816e2980eb5aa407bc82/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Runels performing an O-Shot procedure on a patient.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Runels performing an O-Shot procedure on a patient.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I waited for Julie to cry out in pain. But instead she just kept talking to Pamela about church. Runels explained to me that this area of the labia wasn\u2019t sensitive (it was built to rip during childbirth) and that bloodflow would naturally take the lidocaine from the labia minora into the clitoris, making a direct injection unnecessary. We made small talk for a few minutes until she she was fully numb. Then Runels plucked the vial of her blood from the centrifuge, preparing for the final injection \u2013 a direct hit to the clit. The PRP floated on top, yellow and opaque, like dehydrated urine. </p> <p>While Runels flicked the needle, I ignored the taste of metal in my mouth, squeezed my thighs together and pretended everything was normal. But apparently my secondhand discomfort was unfounded; not only was the whole thing over in seconds, but afterward Julie said: \u201cIs it happening yet?\u201d \u2013 because the O-Shot felt like nothing.</p> <p>\u201cHow long will this last?\u201d she asked Runels.</p> <p>\u201cConservatively speaking, around nine months,\u201d he answered. He added that, in Lacey\u2019s case, results had persisted for nearly six years. </p> <p>Julie beamed at me, and I smiled back, saying I was happy for her \u2013 but the truth was, I couldn\u2019t get Dr Gunter\u2019s and Dr Caulfield\u2019s voices out of my head. Two smart and accomplished medical experts had insisted to me that satisfied O-Shot customers were dupes. </p> <p>As a layperson, I couldn\u2019t help but respect their authority. But as a human being, it was hard for me to discredit so many women\u2019s stories. When they said the O-Shot worked, I believed them.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>On my last day in Alabama, imaginary feuds between feminists and doctors and ethicists and patients ricocheted around my brain. I\u2019d talked to so many people, read too many papers, and still had no clue what to think about the O-Shot. </p> <p>So I asked Runels to inject my clitoris. </p> <p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d a girlfriend texted me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have sexual dysfunction!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The procedure was brief and painless and within hours I was boarding my flight home, eager to put the O-Shot to the test</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I responded with some defiant emojis. It wasn\u2019t orgasms I was struggling with \u2013 it was the conclusion to my article. So I stepped out of my jeans and held Pamela\u2019s hand while Runels tugged on the headlamp. \u201cIs it happening?\u201d I said \u2013 but it was over. The procedure was brief and painless, and within hours I was boarding my flight home, eager to put the O-Shot to the test.</p> <p>Unfortunately, results proved vague. </p> <p>Every time I had sex I would ask myself: does this feel better than it did before my clitoris was injected with blood?</p> <p>Even more mood-killing were the other questions pulsing through my mind: does having an orgasm as a result of this procedure make me a good or bad feminist? Have I taken a daring move by putting my clitoris first? Or have I sold out a century of progress by \u201cobeying\u201d Runels, a member of the patriarchy, who deluded me into thinking I needed him to fix me?\u201d </p> <p>These questions made sex worse. So I decided to depoliticize my body \u2013 to take psychology and medicine and feminism out of the equation, and forget I\u2019d ever met him.</p> <p>That did the trick. And it felt great. </p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/10/have-you-been-watching-american-horror-story\">The first season</a> of <a href=\"http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/american-horror-story/episodes\">American Horror Story</a> no one knew what we were getting ourselves into and it was glorious. There were all sorts of twisty plots coming and going, the past seemed to be as relevant as the present, and cast members were regularly killed off, something that would never be done on a show intended to last many seasons. But once we learned it was an anthology that would reset every year, some of the magic wore off. </p> <p>After a few lackluster seasons, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/american-horror-story-season-6-theme-ryan-murphy\">creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk decided to get back to basics</a>. Instead of releasing the theme of the sixth season (like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/29/american-horror-story-coven-best-season\">Asylum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/15/american-horror-story-box-set-review\">Coven</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/02/american-horror-story-season-four-freak-show-review\">Freak Show</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/07/american-horror-story-fifth-season-hotel-review-lady-gaga\">Hotel</a>) they decided to leave it blank because there is nothing as scary as not knowing what is going to happen. No copies were released to the press before the premiere and even the cast list was kept as hush-hush as Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS1HVpUOu7k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JS1HVpUOu7k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>While it\u2019s an exciting premise, it didn\u2019t exactly pay off in the premiere episode, which indicated that Murphy and co have settled on a show-within-a-show concept. Wednesday\u2019s installment was presented as an episode of a show called My Roanoke Nightmare, after the 16th-century colony off the coast of what is now North Carolina <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roanoke-colony-deserted\">where all the members of the village disappeared without a trace</a>. However, while there were some villagers with pitchforks and torches, this wasn\u2019t a story about colonialists. In the manner of the true crime shows that litter <a href=\"http://www.investigationdiscovery.com/\">Investigation Discovery</a>, we\u2019re hearing a couple tell their story but watching dramatic re-enactments of the events they describe. </p> <p>Shelby (Lily Rabe) and Matt (Andr\u00e9 Holland) are an interracial couple who leave LA for Matt\u2019s native North Carolina. There they buy a gorgeous old farmhouse that makes the <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/bates-motel-canceled-a-and-e-five-seasons-1201820986/\">Bates Motel </a>look like a quaint seaside cottage. They don\u2019t question why it\u2019s being sold at auction for about $20,000 or why the only other interested buyers are a trio of hillbillies. (Though of course we all know the answer.) That\u2019s when the hauntings start. </p> <p>In the past, Shelby (Sarah Paulson) sees that the sky is raining teeth and is attacked by a mysterious figures carrying torches and pitchforks while she bathes in the hot tub. Matt (Cuba Gooding Jr) is worried about her and when he leaves on business he enlists his sister Lee (Adina Porter and Angela Bassett in the past) to come and spend time with her. The two of them are once again beset by mysterious forces that they can\u2019t explain including little stick men hanging in the house, seemingly imported from The Blair Witch Project </p> <p>This framing device is clever but it also has its drawbacks. Just like the true crime shows it is based on, there is more emphasis on suspense than showing us the cause of the terror. Unfortunately, American Horror Story has also managed to import the genre\u2019s drawbacks too \u2013 a slack pace, overly larded with extraneous details. The one bonus is that Gooding\u2019s limited acting ability makes him look like he\u2019s doing a spot-on impersonation of one of those dramatic re-enactment actors giving an outlandishly bad performance. </p> <p>One of the great things about AHS was the way it took horror movie conventions \u2013 whether witches, vampires or aliens \u2013 and subversively played around with them. Making AHS into a carbon copy of a lesser genre of program doesn\u2019t allow it to challenge that formula in the same way. It\u2019s just another crappy true crime story, but with a few Oscar nominees and a much larger budget. </p> <p>The episode ends mid-scene, leading viewers to believe that the next episode will be another installment of My Roanoke Nightmare. That doesn\u2019t seem promising given that we watch American Horror Story to be surprised and thrilled by the weird directions in which Murphy leads us. (Remember the weekly anachronistic pop songs from Freak Show that he seemed to forget about after episode four?) But since we know nothing about where the show is going it\u2019s hard to say what to expect. After so many years of lackluster showings and slapdash storytelling, not knowing what to expect is terrifying \u2013 but in a bad way. </p>",

The Slovak government, which has the presidency, is trying to be part of the mainstream,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Robert Fico, stands alongside Tusk to discuss the results of the summit on Friday evening, that view will be put to the test.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t half as important as you think you are.\u201d That was the implicit message for Britain in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/junckers-speech-was-all-about-concrete-ideas-to-heal-a-divided-eu\" title=\"\">state of the European Union address</a> by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. It was a welcome signal for European citizens and politicians exasperated by British indecision and outright incompetence post-referendum. But it was a message unlikely to even register with all those pundits and politicians in Britain still convinced that the EU needs the UK more than vice versa.</p> <p>Modelled on the rather more showily delivered American version, the state of the European Union speech marks the beginning of the political season in Brussels. With the Brexit vote less than three months ago, it naturally contained a number of allusions to British politics. Juncker stated that Europeans face \u201cthe unhappy prospect of a member leaving our ranks\u201d. This he \u201crespected\u201d and \u201cregretted\u201d, as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\" title=\"\">highlighted the rise in hate crimes</a> against Europeans in Britain since the Brexit vote. Since the penny does not seem to have dropped yet, Juncker reiterated that there is no way the UK can end up with a better deal post-Brexit than it enjoyed as a member.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xen\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717384\"            data-video-name=\"Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d91795e4b067ad30087916\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914Juncker1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11872695&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/14/jean-claude-juncker-uk-a-la-carte-access-single-market-video\">Juncker: Europe cannot accept violence against Polish workers</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But these were a handful of remarks scattered around a 6,000-word speech that took a good 50 minutes to deliver. Juncker wanted to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis\" title=\"\">concerns that actually exercise Europeans</a>: refugees, terrorism, economic stagnation, a dysfunctional eurozone architecture and Russian expansionism. Add to that the real possibility of chaos in Turkey, of EU-phobe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/07/francois-hollande-would-be-swept-aside-in-presidential-election-poll-shows\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen winning the French presidential election</a> and of a Trump presidency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-nato-isolationist\" title=\"\">blowing up Nato</a> and it should be clear that Brexit is somewhere on page two or three of the EU priority list. In fact, the prospect of Brexit seems to have helped the EU at least in the short term, with a number of countries seeing an unexpected surge in support for the EU. In the words of prominent German member of the European parliament Manfred Weber: \u201cMany people are now in favour of the EU [after the Brexit vote]. In Germany we have not had these results since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile in the Netherlands, the country often held up by Brexiteers as the next to leave, all major parties say they want to reform rather than leave the EU. It is only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/dutch-far-right-leader-geert-wilders-goeson-trial-for-inciting-hatred\" title=\"\">Geert Wilders</a>\u2019 PVV party that actually wants an exit. He currently polls at just under 20%.</p> <p>Medical science uses the word \u201ccrisis\u201d for the point where a patient either irrevocably collapses or turns the corner towards recovery. On the basis of Juncker\u2019s speech, this is the stage where the commission now feels the EU and the eurozone find itself. Following the speech, Vivien Pertusot from the French Institute for International Relations called them the polycrises: urgent and potentially devastating crises occurring simultaneously and often amplifying or feeding on one another while driving member states apart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/restricted-travel-british-people-nigerian-visa-passports\">Welcome to the world of restricted travel, British people | Chibundu Onuzo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNever before have I seen so little common ground between our member states,\u201d said Juncker, himself an EU veteran like few others. The EU is in greater danger than ever before, he continued, with greater levels of selfishness, nationalism and parochialism.</p> <p>Yet Juncker also slipped in good news of the sort that somehow rarely reaches the mainstream British press. There had been one million jobs created in Spain over the past three years, and seven million more elsewhere. Public deficits are, on average, now below 2% across the eurozone, down from a terrifying 6.3% in 2009. Juncker might have added the eurozone\u2019s healthy current account surplus, meaning it continues to export more than it imports. This is a stark contrast to the US and Britain, two nations that are becoming ever more indebted because they buy more from foreign countries than they sell.</p> <p>Easily the most refreshing element in the speech, at least for those who have had to endure the Brexit \u201cdebate\u201d, was Juncker\u2019s emphasis on realism. Where Brexiteers continue to indulge in narcissistic fantasies about getting the best of all worlds from the EU while making Britain a world power again, Juncker struck a very different tone. Insisting that \u201csolidarity is the glue that holds the union together\u201d he pointed out that Europeans today make up 8% of the world population. In 2050 that will be down to 5%. \u201cBy then you would not see a single EU country among the top world economies,\u201d Juncker went on. \u201cBut the EU together? We would still be topping the charts.\u201d</p> <p>To which he might have added: \u201cAnd that is true with or without Britain.\u201d</p>",

Some migrants also come here overland and leave by boat, but less at the moment as the navy carries out many operations,\u201d said one elderly fisherman. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/fisherman-lost-at-sea-436-days-book-extract\">Lost at sea: the man who vanished for 14 months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was very close to here that a Honduran fisherman lost control of his boat in 2012, drifting for 14 months, before miraculously turning up 6,500 miles away in the Marshall Islands. Scores of fishermen have died in these waters. </p> <p>The boats carrying migrants are heading for beaches such as Bah\u00eda La Ventosa in Oaxaca, a small fishing village with a handful of seafront restaurants where migrants and drugs have been passing through for years, according to local resident Ra\u00fal Salinas.</p> <p>\u201cAround 10, 15 years ago, 200 to 300 Central Americans would disembark every few days, but that virtually stopped because of navy operations. Numbers have started to go up again in the last couple of years, and right now at least 80 to 100 land every week,\u201d said Salinas, who has attempted to rescue drowning migrants on several occasions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70c39c1205427b5f54db854d69c1b8e2bb150658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70c39c1205427b5f54db854d69c1b8e2bb150658/0_173_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smugglers travel with more than 20 migrants by boat in Barra de San Jos\u00e9, Chiapas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smugglers travel with more than 20 migrants by boat in Barra de San Jos\u00e9, Chiapas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Encarni Pindado/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They arrive at night to avoid detection, and are met by local fishermen who take them home where they can rest, eat and bathe. Most leave the next day in taxis or buses arranged by their coyotes; others take to sea again, heading to the state of Guerrero. </p> <p>According to Salinas, some local families have been persuaded to work with migrant smugglers and drug traffickers because of dwindling fish stocks caused by oil spills from the nearby refinery. </p> <p>The involvement of organised crime groups means that migrants who travel by boat in an attempt to avoid danger, are instead at risk of falling prey to human traffickers. In this zone, Los Zetas, the Gulf and New Generation Jalisco cartels are currently battling for control over land and sea territory to transport drugs, arms and people. Reports of extortion by local police are common. </p> <p>Amid ever-increasing violence in Central America, thousands of people continue to flee every month in search of safety and a better life. Activists and fishermen fear trafficking and drownings will rise as more migrants are persuaded to travel by sea. </p> <p>Salinas said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen dead bodies, I\u2019ve tried to rescue people. The open sea is dangerous, small boats can easily overturn, and most can\u2019t swim.

  "<p>They come with their fathers, they come with their mothers. They come with their grandmothers and grandfathers and uncles and aunts, some of them dabbing tears from their eyes. They stand outside the Vin Scully Press Box at the LA Dodgers\u2019 stadium on Vin Scully Avenue waiting not for Vin Scully, known as baseball\u2019s greatest announcer, but for the Spanish language Vin Scully; the voice of <em>their </em>lives. And when he emerges from the elevator, they embrace him and ask for photos and then they beg that he never, ever leaves.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people they come up to me and say: \u2018My father used to hear you, my grandfather, my grandmother ... and so we started growing up together,\u2019\u201d the Dodgers Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarr\u00edn says softly. \u201cIt really pleases me to hear that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jan/09/the-joy-of-six-great-moments-in-sport-commentary\">The Joy of Six: great moments in sport commentary | Nick Miller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lost <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-vin-scully-20160913-snap-story.html\">behind the year-long farewell</a> to Scully is remarkable story. It\u2019s a story many baseball fans don\u2019t know because when they think of the Dodgers they think only of Scully, <a href=\"http://timelines.latimes.com/vin-scully-through-years/\">the team\u2019s narrator for nearly 70 seasons</a> and a man who calls games in such vivid detail he was voted into the Hall of Fame more than 30 years ago. Even as they mourn Scully\u2019s October retirement, they have barely heard of the regal 80-year-old legend in Scully\u2019s shadow. Nor do they realize that for 58 years, millions of southern California Latinos have had a Vin Scully of their own. And that without him the Dodgers might not be the $2bn franchise they\u2019ve become.</p> <p>\u201cI think we opened the door to some organizations to realize how important the Latino market is,\u201d Jarr\u00edn says.</p> <p>And that market matters.</p> <p>In the winter of 1958 Walter O\u2019Malley <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Brooklyn_Dodgers#Move_to_California\">moved his Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles</a>. Being a businessman he looked around the vast, booming city and he saw opportunity in immigrants from Central and South America with no understanding of American sports. He would make them baseball fans by not only broadcasting each game in English but in Spanish too. No team had ever done something like this before, putting every game on Spanish radio. But O\u2019Malley dreamed that someday these new fans would flock to the stadium he was building on a hill above downtown LA \u2013 a hill once-populated by Mexican immigrants who had been pulled from their homes in part for the ballpark\u2019s construction.</p> <p>The man who came to be O\u2019Malley\u2019s Spanish broadcaster barely knew baseball then. He was 23 years old and had arrived three years before on a boat from Ecuador. But soon Jarr\u00edn was telling the same Dodger story as Scully, only to an audience that didn\u2019t know Scully. And they did listen, And they did come to his ballpark on the hill, driving from places like Bakersfield and Fresno, several hours away, lured by the story of a team that Jarr\u00edn told nightly. Now nearly half of the Dodger Stadium crowd is Latino, and a little less then half of that group speak Spanish as their first language.</p> <p>\u201cIn the Mexican community in Southern California, I don\u2019t know if Jaime is God-like but he\u2019s at least a notch below,\u201d says Charley Steiner, who broadcasts Dodgers games in English. Then he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky,\u201d Steiner continues. \u201cI have two of the greatest broadcasters of all time to go to work with every day.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUD7ltcUL2M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fUD7ltcUL2M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Jarr\u00edn stands outside the Nationals Park press box on a scorching Washington afternoon watching the Dodgers take batting practice. He still travels with the Dodgers, covering every game on every trip. His only exception is a small vacation he takes each summer. He figures that he\u2019s earned the right after more than five decades. Otherwise he keeps flying on the planes, moving from hotel to hotel, climbing press box staircases because he enjoys the grind of baseball and the camaraderie of being around a team. He wants to do this for two more seasons, until he reaches his 60th<sup> </sup>in the game before deciding if he will cut back. His wife, Blanca, who he married long ago back home in Ecuador continues to let him go. He promises her he will stop the moment she asks. So far she hasn\u2019t. Maybe she understands how vital his voice is to a population that looks forward to hearing it the way LA\u2019s English-speaking fans take comfort in Scully\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cI am so blessed doing what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI have the best seat in the house and [am] respected by my colleagues. I respect everybody in the organization, I demand respect and they do that, I am very well paid. The main thing is: I love what I do. Most people hate what they do.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, Jaime\u2019s son Jorge became his broadcast partner. Each morning they have lunch together and share a ride to the stadium where they sit side-by-side, switching every three innings. Jorge talks a lot about statistics and Jaime likes that. It allows him to tell stories. To him, his nightly conversation with Southern California is a public service. He knows his listeners. They are the working people; the ones who leave home at 6am and don\u2019t come back until after 5pm. They are tired by day\u2019s end, they need a diversion and his Dodger broadcasts are their refuge.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for me to give them something they can enjoy,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething that can really relax them.\u201d</p> <p>He constantly worries about doing that. He is a worker too. For years he did radio news stories for Spanish language station KWKW in Pasadena, in addition to baseball, only giving it up a decade ago. He has covered riots and protests and presidents. He was the only Spanish-speaking reporter to be at John F Kennedy\u2019s funeral, flying to Washington that day without a credential and calling on a Latino congressman who got him a pass and a car within an hour. He became the first Spanish-language journalist in Southern California to win <a href=\"http://www.rtna.org/GoldenMikeAwards/\">a Golden Mike Award</a> for his coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/important-day-us-history-chicano-moratorium\">1970 Chicano Moratorium</a>. He later won another. For a few years, he was also the sports director at Telemundo 52 in LA, giving the job up when he found he loved radio more than TV. He remembers a five-year period where he worked from 4am to 1am six days a week and he wonders now how he managed to keep going.</p> <p>But then Jarr\u00edn was aways a newsman. His first radio job came when he was 15 reading news and writing scripts for station HCJB \u2013 \u201cThe Voice of the Andes\u201d \u2013 in his hometown of Quito, Ecuador. Two years later, he was the official announcer for the Ecuadoran senate. He could have had that job forever but he longed for something bigger. Bianca, who he married at 18, urged him to search saying she would follow wherever he went. That opportunity came when after interviewing the American consul in Quito, he told the man: \u201cI want to emigrate to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Three days later Jarr\u00edn had a visa. He bought his passage on a boat bound for Florida, and sailed through the Panama Canal. Twice the ship was rocked by huge storms that kept him trapped below deck for three days. He got sick. But when the boat finally reached America the first thing he saw was a great bridge traversing Tampa Bay and he thought: <em>\u201cAny country that can build something like this can do anythin</em><em>g\u201d</em></p> <p>He was torn about what to do in his new homeland; choosing between flight school in New Jersey, or a radio career in Los Angeles. He picked LA and arrived on 24 June 1955, the same day as Sandy Koufax\u2019s big league debut. For six months he worked in a factory making metal fences while trying to convince KWKW to hire him. Eventually they did. Bianca joined him and by 1958, he was the station\u2019s news and sports director, broadcasting Thursday night boxing at the Olympic Auditorium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa15edf8409e26fa629ce4e04464378f915761f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa15edf8409e26fa629ce4e04464378f915761f3/0_212_5046_3028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dodger Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaime Jarr\u00edn calls games at Dodger Stadium with his son, Jorge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Dunn/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day the manager called everyone into his office and told them O\u2019Malley wanted the station to call the Dodgers games in Spanish. Jarr\u00edn, the manager said, would be one of the announcers even though he knew almost nothing bout baseball. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the station manager told him, he would have a year to learn. And so Jarr\u00edn spent that first summer of the LA Dodgers listening to their games on the radio. When the 1959 season began, he sat with his first partner Rene Cardenas in a makeshift pressbox in the LA Coliseum\u2019s stands. In front of them were Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. He was 23 years old and a long way from writing scripts and reading news in Quito.</p> <p>\u201cSo as you see, I never applied for the [Dodgers] job,\u201d Jarr\u00edn says with a chuckle. \u201cI never looked for the job. It was extended on a silver platter.\u201d</p> <p>He thought he would do it for six or seven years. Instead he never stopped, toiling all those years in Scully\u2019s world, invisible to Scully\u2019s listeners. And now he is sad that Scully will soon be gone.</p> <p>\u201cVin has been my mentor, my idol, my friend,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have words to say how I feel towards Vin Scully.\u201d</p> <p>When Jarr\u00edn was young and new to baseball, Scully gave him two vital lessons: <em>Prepare for every game as if it is your first and </em><em>never get too close to the players</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Everything he has done as a baseball broadcaster has been built around those words. For the first eight years the Dodgers were in Los Angeles he and Cardenas didn\u2019t travel to road games. Instead they did re-creations from the KWKW studios. A special line was set up to the ballpark in New York or Chicago or wherever the Dodgers were playing. An hour before the game, Scully would get on the line and gave Jarr\u00edn details about the weather and the crowd and what the Dodgers players and coaches had said that day. Then when the game started, the Spanish broadcasters listened through headphones to the broadcast of Scully and his partner, Jerry Doggett, trying to repeat in Spanish what they were hearing in English.</p> <p>And something wonderful happened to Jarr\u00edn during all those nights listening to Scully in his headphones. He started to sound like Scully. When Scully told stories, he told stories. When Scully described the way the stadium felt or how the pitcher stalked the mound, he did too. For a young man new to America and even newer to baseball there was no better teacher than the announcer who would be the best. He learned things from a distance he would never have known if he had travelled to the games.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to realize he was translating Vin\u2019s words and if you are translating Vin Scully for eight years you are going to <em>become</em> Vin Scully,\u201d his son, Jorge, says.</p> <p>Standing now, on the balcony at Nationals Park, Jaime Jarr\u00edn looks away, gazing out toward the field and the players finishing batting practice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to copy Vin,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I adopted his style. He was such a big part of me. He gave me so much confidence at my work. He gave me so many lessons that I adopted his style. I am like him. I am not a screamer. I pray to God to give me the quality of watching what is going on with my eyes, not with my heart and I try to be very impartial.\u201d</p> <p>Which he has been. With the exception of one player.</p> <p>His name was Fernando Valenzuela and he arrived from the tiny Mexican town of Etchohuquila in September 1980, a portly left-handed pitcher, all of 19 years old who rolled his eyes heavenward every time he threw the ball. Almost nobody had ever heard of him. By the next spring, Valenzuela <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dn-20-greatest-dodgers-fernando-valenzuela-20150526-story.html\">was the biggest thing in baseball</a> winning his first eight games, five by shutout. What followed was like nothing Jarr\u00edn had ever seen before or since. Spanish-speaking fans filled Dodger Stadium on the nights Valenzuela pitched. The organist played bullfighting music and everyone shouted \u201cOle!\u201d One night a woman ran onto the field wearing a Fernando shirt and kissed the pitcher.</p> <p>For the first time baseball had a transformative Latino star. Nobody, not even Roberto Clemente, had seized the nation the way Valenzuela did in the first weeks of the 1981 season. Every place the Dodgers went they had to set up special press conferences for Valenzuela, who spoke no English. The team needed a translator so they asked Jarr\u00edn.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a dream,\u201d Jarr\u00edn says of those months. \u201cWhat Fernando did for baseball is amazing. I think that he is the one single player who created more baseball fans than any other player. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is Willie Mays or Roberto Clemente or Stan Musial or whatever because thousands and thousands of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans were very, very indifferent to baseball. They didn\u2019t care about baseball. They were big on soccer and boxing \u2013 that\u2019s it. But thanks to Fernando he created so much enthusiasm and created so much interest, especially among ladies, mothers and grandmothers and grandfathers. Everybody became Fernando followers and later on Dodger followers and baseball followers.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly everything changed. So many new Spanish speakers came to Jarr\u00edn\u2019s broadcasts wanting to know about this Mexican star. His ratings grew. As time went on the crowds at the ballpark changed too. Not only did Latino fans show up on days Fernando pitched, they came every game, buying tickets in family-sized blocks. Then their children grew up and brought their children until the Dodgers were no longer a Fernando fad but a culture passed down through generations. The number of Latinos in the stands soared from the 8% when the Dodgers first came to LA and kept growing until today where they make up 46-52% of the crowd on any given day.</p> <p>More people heard Jarr\u00edn\u2019s broadcasts. More people knew his name. And in 1998 he was <a href=\"http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/viva/roster/jaimejarrin.asp\">elected to the broadcaster\u2019s wing</a> of the Baseball Hall of Fame, just as Scully had been many years before.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgN7mYqvXsU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mgN7mYqvXsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He went to Cooperstown for the induction ceremony, and was led into a room only for Hall of Famers. Nobody else was allowed inside. Not family. Not staff. Just the tiny handful of men who had been great enough to earn the game\u2019s highest honor. There he was, Jaime Jarr\u00edn who came from Ecuador on a boat in 1955, never having seen a baseball game in his life, standing beside Stan Musial and Willie Mays.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate that because it\u2019s very unique,\u201d Jarr\u00edn says. \u201cThe Dodgers with two Hall of Famers working simultaneously \u2013 the only organization that has two Hall of Famers. And to be near [Scully] and near the titans of our sport...\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head. Who could have imagined?</p> <p>\u201cIt was destiny first of all that got him here,\u201d Jorge Jarr\u00edn says. \u201cFirst of all, it was destiny that got him to Los Angeles and it was destiny that he got to a radio station that said: \u2018you\u2019re going to do the games, this will be good for you, you are the guy to do it.\u2019 That was in 1958 and he\u2019s still doing it in 2016. That\u2019s a book.

Many of their responses echo what Dave Ward, general secretary of CWU said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/post-office-future-strike-cuts\">an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday</a>. Their main concerns are pension reforms, a culture of unattainable sales targets and job losses across the business. Below are their stories, which we\u2019ve kept anonymous.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>I will be facing a 47% reduction in my pension<strong>\u2019\u2013 postal officer, 50</strong><br></h2> <p>From the Post Office\u2019s own projection as to how their pension changes will affect me personally, I will be facing a 47% reduction. Having worked for the service for 14 years, this is why I will be striking. Who in their right mind would sit idly by and let this happen without fighting for a better deal? <br></p> <p>As employees we are trying to focus on providing the best service we can despite the changes and disruption being constantly thrown at us. The government and Post Office management should accept that we are a vital service for communities across the length and breadth of the British Isles and properly fund it to maintain this service rather than trying their best to run it into the ground. Their actions are either deliberate or incompetent and I\u2019m not sure which of those scares me the most.</p> <h2>\u2018I and many others have had our loyalty thrown back at us\u2019 \u2013 customer advisor, 55</h2> <p>I like many others have been pushed to breaking point. The company I was once proud to work for no longer cares about me or our loyal customers. The once 18-strong workforce in our busy office is reduced to nine. Last week we had to open with just two staff due to holidays, long term sickness and bad management. It is so wrong and a complete breach of our security. <br></p> <p>My pension is about to be slashed. I and many others have had our loyalty thrown back at us and job security taken from us by a higher management team that want us destroyed. The fact that no one cares and trying to do the job I love with less help than ever before <br></p> <p>Many of us have worked and dedicated our lives to the Post Office \u2013 I\u2019ve been here 20 years. Losing our branch offices and the knowledge of your dedicated workers is not good customer service at all. The smaller branches will not only have staff that are not trained, but will not be able to provide all the services to the customer or indeed the companies we represent.</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re a public service, not a supermarket\u2019 \u2013 Post Office manager<br></h2> <p>I\u2019m tired of senior management running this business so badly. All they do is cut. They never look at ways to invest in people and products. They don\u2019t look at ways to increase business with services the public actually want. The general public are tired of being flogged home phones and life insurance. The government needs to step up and take accountability for a public service rather than allowing branches to be closed. It also needs to take accountability for the decision to separate Royal Mail and the Post Office \u2013 huge mistake. <br></p> <p>Sales targets are the biggest issue for me. We\u2019re a public service, not a supermarket. People want good customer service, not a sales pitch every time they walk into a Post Office. If things keep on going this way the post office will cease to exist within 10 years, and the government will only have themselves to blame. <br></p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s not a business and never will be\u2019 \u2013 postal officer, 50<br></h2> <p>After 31 years with the Post Office I\u2019m striking because I\u2019m sick of being continually lied to, because offices are constantly being closed or franchised and because we as employees are continually forced to try to force products on customers who are sick of being targeted week in week out. The business has no plans for growth, just cuts, cuts and more cuts. Frontline staff are bullied to achieve unrealistic sales targets and continually blamed for not getting the sales, and there is no job security at all.<br></p> <p>Now the Post Office Ltd are planning to close our pension scheme, which is multi-award winning. This will leave thousands of colleagues with around 30% less in retirement. I\u2019d say to them hands off. It\u2019s ours. <br></p> <p>Many colleagues have given 30-plus years service and have seen countless business reinvention programmes that have all failed miserably. The current board has also failed in its attempt to grow a business that is not a business and never will be. It needs to listen to the customers. </p> <h2>\u2018I have been threatened and abused at work on many occasions\u2019 \u2013 former Post Office mortgage specialist, 60<br></h2> <p>I will be supporting my ex-colleagues on the picket line because what management are doing to the Post Office is appalling. Staff are bullied into selling financial products whether they are suitable for the customer or not. Morale is the lowest it\u2019s ever been \u2013 I used to love my job but in the end it made me ill and I couldn\u2019t continue any longer.</p> <p>Staff have to record in a diary how many \u2018conversations\u2019 they have had and how many leads they have provided to the financial specialist and mortgage specialists \u2013 the customer base in my branch was mainly pensioners and asylum seekers, neither of whom qualify for a mortgage (or most of the other products to be honest) but this wasn\u2019t taken into account. </p> <p>I have been threatened and abused at work on many occasions (If I had a pound for every time a customer said to me \u2018why don\u2019t you get behind the counter instead of trying to sell us life insurance\u2019 I\u2019d be rich ...) I\u2019d say to the government: think about the workers. Come and walk a mile in their shoes and see how you get on. I doubt any one of them would be able to stand the constant pressure of a working week behind the counter, trying to serve customers, putting up with abuse, trying to fit back office duties in while not making mistakes with money.

A third of the Marshall Islands\u2019 60,000-strong population now resides in the US and some of those left behind fret that many more will follow, with the archipelago\u2019s unique culture blemished by each departure.

The Marshallese may use faded US dollar bills, daub murals of LeBron James and Steph Curry on walls and retain the names Rita (after Rita Hayworth) and Laura (after Lauren Bacall) for the two ends of the curved Majuro island, but the relationship with America is a complicated one. </p> <p>A US military base remains at Kwajalein, where unarmed missiles periodically land, fired from California. Many Marshallese serve in the US army, while the rest of the population each gets around $500 a year via a trust fund set up to compensate the harrowing nuclear tests.

But the Marshallese community, now numbering around 10,000, remains close-knit. </p> <p>Legend has it they congregated at this unlikely, nondescript place because of a pioneer named John Moody, who moved to the area first through education and then work in the 1970s. </p> <p>Moody toiled for nearly 20 years in the <a href=\"http://www.tyson.com/\">Tysons</a> poultry plant, gutting and packing chickens.

Walmart\u2019s headquarters, located up the road in Bentonville, is another major feature of the local economy.</p> <p>The Marshallese are an object of curiosity here, but are largely accepted by a population that has has become more diverse in recent years.

Morris was plunged into a new reality, a world of McDonald\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s day and Hanukkah, without being able to speak English. But she is now what many people would expect of a stereotypical American teen.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first started here, I always wanted to tell myself \u2018I\u2019m American\u2019, because I thought it was really cool coming here and then seeing new faces,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I grew up, I knew more about my culture, and then I really liked it. I was telling myself: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m blessed to have this culture.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Morris now attempts to straddle both worlds, of Snapchat and of Marshallese customs on clothing and behavior, as well as celebrations such as <em>kemem</em>, a big bash thrown at the first birthday of a child. She says she was \u201cvery angry\u201d when she heard about what climate change was doing to the Marshall Islands and wants to go back to help \u2013 but not to live.</p> <p>Arlynda Jonas, 23, is also inclined to stay in the US. Like Morris she has an American accent, which she says some Marshallese people tease her about. </p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m more towards the American side than my Marshallese side but I know that I should be on my Marshallese side more strongly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. I don\u2019t want to forget my culture, my heritage or anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the Constitution Day parade in Springdale, the tone is a little more defiant. The celebrations have been given a climate change theme, giving the occasion more of a protest than a party feel. Banners proclaim \u201c70 years of exile\u201d for the Bikinian people and \u201c1.5 to stay alive\u201d, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/14/worlds-scientists-to-join-forces-on-major-15c-climate-change-report\">global temperature rise that can\u2019t be breached</a> if the Marshall Islands is to survive. Candies are tossed to onlooking children as the parade passes by.</p> <p>Kenneth Kedi, speaker of the Marshallese parliament, is in Springdale to address the crowd. Kedi decries the salt-soaked soils of home, ruined for crops, and the disastrous drought. Climate change \u201cisn\u2019t shenanigans, it\u2019s reality\u201d, Kedi says.</p> <p>Kedi spent six years in the US and is now putting his son through school here. But he says he has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the diaspora, as he inspects a lei filled with candies that has been placed around his neck.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>They\u2019re losing their identity as Marshallese,\u201d he says of the Springdale community. \u201cThis is what we fear and our chiefs fear will happen, and it\u2019s happening.\u201d He moved back to the Marshall Islands because he loves his country, he says, but \u201cnow, that train is reversing\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d251a2f9ddcae9502082953cac1f831c3e5a4734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d251a2f9ddcae9502082953cac1f831c3e5a4734/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marshallese men and women celebrate Constitution Day in Springdale, Arkansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marshallese men and women celebrate Constitution Day in Springdale, Arkansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mae Ryan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kedi, a soft-spoken man, worries that more people will flee as climate change starts to bite deeper into the fabric of Marshallese life. That they will probably move to the US is \u201cbittersweet\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we have been given a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe make a minuscule contribution to the climate greenhouse effect but we are at the very frontline of the problems of climate change.\u201d He adds that plutonium stored at Enewetak, one of the Marshallese islands, is starting to leak into the ocean \u2013 yet another American legacy.</p> <p>\u201cSo, yeah, we\u2019re getting a bad deal,\u201d he says. \u201cWe certainly are getting a bad deal.\u201d</p> <p>Before the beauty pageant begins there is a lengthy church service. Marshallese people are often deeply religious \u2013 most of the population is Protestant. Large sections of the address is in Marshallese but at one point the pastor blurts out in English while referencing climate change: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p> <p>Pageant contenders read out poems on climate change. One has the anguished line: \u201cWe are losing our island, where will we stand?\u201d Another offers: \u201cKeep your faith in God.\u201d There follows dancing, singing and intricate, beautiful Marshallese gowns. Eventually, as we near 1am and even Marshallese patience is wearing thin, Arlynda Jonas is crowned the winner.</p> <p>It\u2019s a Marshallese triumph rooted in America. Jonas would be sad if the Marshall Islands were eaten away by the waves but can see an obvious solution for the country\u2019s people. \u201cIt would be great if they did all move [to the US] because there are just so many opportunities for them here, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cI think it would be great for them to move here.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Majuro, there are people who have to weigh whether to stay or go every day.

  "<p>Donald Trump publicly raised questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health for the first time since the former secretary of state was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-leaves-911-ceremony-after-feeling-overheated\">forced on Sunday to leave a ceremony for the victims of 9/11</a>.</p> <p>Speaking in an air-conditioned minor league basketball arena in Canton, Ohio, Trump made his most direct reference to Clinton\u2019s recent diagnosis of pneumonia and her campaign saying she left the event in New York because she felt \u201coverheated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou think this is easy?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cIn this beautiful room that\u2019s 122 degrees.

The Democratic nominee had to be helped into a van while leaving. Afterward, Clinton cancelled all public events for three days.</p> <p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton-doctor-letter-pneumonia\">since released</a> more detailed medical information from her doctor describing her as \u201chealthy and fit to serve as president\u201d. In contrast, Trump has yet to share further medical information to the public besides a brief letter written in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/donald-trump-health-doctor-letter-americas-healthiest-president\">that said</a> he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. However, in an interview with controversial TV doctor Dr Oz, set to air on Thursday, the 70-year-old Trump <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/donald-trump-dr-oz-weight/index.html\">reportedly said</a> that he would like to lose 15 pounds, doesn\u2019t exercise and is fond of fast food.</p> <p>Trump also addressed the water crisis in Flint, a former car manufacturing hub that has seen tens of thousands of jobs disappear in recent decades. \u201cIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn\u2019t drink the water in Mexico,\u201d the Republican nominee said. \u201cNow the cars are made in Mexico and you can\u2019t drink the water in Flint.\u201d Ford said on Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/ford-steep-decline-financial-performance-2017\">it was moving all its small-car production to Mexico</a>.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Trump had visited the city and ended up in a confrontation with a local pastor. Trump was visiting a church that serves as a water distribution center for residents when he started critiquing Clinton. The pastor, Faith Green Timmons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour\">interrupted and made clear</a>: \u201cMr Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what we\u2019ve done in Flint, not give a political speech.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-speech-pastor-interruption-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/533yt\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2719026\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump chastised by pastor during Flint speech \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d9cebde4b05caf65ecd45f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/14/160914Trumppastor_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-speech-pastor-interruption-video\">Donald Trump chastised by pastor during Flint speech</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Later in Ohio, Trump, buoyed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/trump-ohio-poll-leads-hillary-clinton\">recent polls</a> that showed him taking the lead in that crucial swing state, was in high spirits in front of a cheering crowd.

The Republican nominee added of the proposal: \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just a single year, and we have no idea where they come from, it\u2019s a great Trojan horse.\u201d Looking ahead to history\u2019s judgment, Trump noted, \u201cI don\u2019t want be known in 200 years for having created a Trojan horse by a different name.\u201d</p> <p>The uncharacteristic return to his unscripted rally style comes the day before the Republican nominee is scheduled to make a major economic policy speech at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. There, the Republican nominee will introduce a tax reform proposal. </p> <p>Trump has previously introduced two other tax reform plans. First, in 2015, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/28/donald-trump-unveils-tax-plan\">emphasized that half of Americans</a> in lieu of paying taxes would simply mail a card to the IRS saying \u201cI win\u201d, and more recently in August where he proposed to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">reduce the number of tax brackets</a> to three while drastically cutting rates.

  "<p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Hope Solo are \u2013 how shall we say this politely? \u2013 divisive characters in world football. Both attracted ire this summer when they attacked their opponents for a lack of adventure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">Solo called Sweden \u201ca bunch of cowards\u201d</a> after they ground their way to a penalty shoot-out victory against the defending champions, USA, at the women\u2019s Olympic football tournament. And at Euro 2016, Ronaldo launched the biggest attack on Iceland <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars\">since the Cod Wars</a> when he disparaged the tactics of everyone\u2019s favorite plucky underdogs. \u201cWhen [Iceland] don\u2019t try to play and just defend, defend, defend, this in my opinion shows a small mentality and they are not going to do anything in the competition,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/14/portugal-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\">fumed Ronaldo after Portugal drew with Iceland</a>. Ronaldo was proved right too, as long as you don\u2019t include beating England in the last 16 as \u201canything\u201d. Which many people wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>But cheap gags at Roy Hodgson aside, did Ronaldo and Solo - which sounds a bit like an 80s cover band \u2013 have a point? Are today\u2019s football games too easily destroyed by parking the bus and counter-attacking? The answer is simple: yes. The solution, though, is more difficult.</p> <p>And make no mistake: For all the global dollars, euros and pounds that wind up in the hands of Manchester United and Barcelona, a solution is necessary. The internet and the 500-channel universe have given football a larger audience, particularly in the United States where the Premier League now regularly <a href=\"http://www.socceramerica.com/article/68858/tv-report-epl-outdraws-nhl-in-2015-16.html\">draws in bigger viewership that the NHL</a>. But that audience can also be taken away.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Gimmicky attempts to jazz up the game</a>, done mostly for an American audience with Fifa\u2019s alternating blessing and scorn, didn\u2019t pay off. The old NASL had a points system that rivaled English county cricket in its complexity and enforced the offside law only in the last 35 yards of the field. The USISL of the early 1990s used a 60-minute countdown clock that stopped when the ball went out of play, along with \u201ckick-ins,\u201d cruel and unusual punishment for fouling too often, and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fifa-plan-bigger-goals-1322249.html\">the occasional flirtation with larger goals</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">Three points for a goal? League 1 America: the soccer revolution that never was</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A proposed new league in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/02/league-1-america-soccer-revolution-never-was\">that would have limited players to particular zones</a> and given bonus points for long-range goals was dismissed in favor of the less experimental Major League Soccer. When commissioner Don Garber took over MLS in 1999 and immediately killed <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/throwback-thursday-hockey-style-shootouts-in-mls.html\">the post-game shootout</a>, a 35-yard one-on-one vestige of the NASL, the United States ended its service as a laboratory for attack-boosting rules.</p> <p>But the changes made globally to discourage negativity haven\u2019t solved the problem, either. No one wants to go back to the days of awarding only two points for a win or allowing defenders to play the ball into their own goalkeepers\u2019 safe hands. Yet those tweaks are not enough, especially in an era in which we\u2019ve all realized that to play like Barcelona, you need to be a team like Barcelona.</p> <p>The fundamental problem is space. Twenty-two players on a large rectangle seems to be a good number until the space is condensed by a team playing a high defensive line. Or when a crowd of players are in the box, reducing football to a simple test of one\u2019s ability to leap while shoving just enough to avoid a whistle.</p> <p>With all due respect to the recent set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">changes to the laws of the game</a>, highlighted by the newfound legality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/08/kickoffs-backwards-rule-changes\">taking a kick-off backwards</a>, it\u2019s time for something more radical.</p> <p>Such as \u2026</p> <p><strong>Smaller numbers on set pieces</strong>. One reason teams can park the bus is that traffic in front of goal is so congested on corner kick and free kicks in an opponent\u2019s half. If teams were limited \u2013 say, five to six players per team in the box until the ball is cleared \u2013 attacking players would have more space, and defensive players would have more of a challenge. Teams could nominate whoever they want to go into the box so fans would still get the thrill of seeing their keeper sprint up the pitch for a rubbish header in the final seconds of a cup tie.</p> <p><strong>Farewell, offside.</strong> Interpretation of Law 11 <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9930438/the-offside-rule-change-explained-with-the-help-of-a-referee\">has evolved over the years</a>. Now, we\u2019re told \u201ceven is on.\u201d But it\u2019s still far too easy for a defensive line to compress the field. The law\u2019s supporters say defenders are free to join the attack without having to worry about an opposing forward lurking 70 yards down the field, but when the defense press forward, we can end up with 20 or so mobile players in a congested area. And then the outcome of a game may hinge on the split-second decision of an assistant referee who surely could do better things than stare at the second-to-last defender for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Which leads to this \u2026</p> <p><strong>More eyes off the ball</strong>. The NFL <a href=\"http://operations.nfl.com/the-officials/these-officials-are-really-good/officials-responsibilities-positions/\">has several officials</a> who watch for fouls away from the ball. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(basketball)\">Basketball has three officials</a> for 10 players. Ice hockey <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)\">has four officials for 12 players</a>. Football has one person <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/04/world.cup.referees.fitness/\">running more than 12 miles per game</a> just to be near the ball. Two more officials race along the lines of the field, but again, their primary task is to stare at the second-to-last defender. Then a fourth official holds aloft a sign and attempts to calm down Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (more than four officials <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22440422\">have been used in some tournaments</a> but the practice is not yet widespread).</p> <p>Surely some responsibilities can be rearranged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/15/mls-video-replay-referees-football\">Tests with a \u201cvideo assistant referee\u201d are promising</a>, though perhaps a video official can chat with the referee through a headset (as in cricket, rugby, field hockey and a handful of other sports) instead of waiting for the referee to jog over to see someone\u2019s video screen.</p> <p>But if we need to resort to stronger measures, maybe we need to start punishing teams who sit back, make themselves a nice sandwich and wait for penalties. Some suggestions:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/05/breaking-the-law-why-fifa-should-relax-its-eligibility-rules\">Breaking the Law: why Fifa should relax its eligibility rules | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Passivity penalty</strong>. Each team will be required to register a legitimate shot on goal at least once every 30 minutes. Failure to do so is punished by the removal of one player. The referee wouldn\u2019t issue a red card \u2013 so players aren\u2019t suspended for a collective failing \u2013 but the manager of the offending (or over-defending) team would be obliged to take off one player. We\u2019ll need to define a shot too \u2013 possibly a ball that is either on target or within six yards either side of the goal \u2013 to prevent players from just taking a speculative whiff from 50 yards out every few minutes.</p> <p>Those are game-by-game solutions. A few other ideas are dependent on the type of competition.</p> <p><strong>League play:</strong> Deduct points. Each time a team attempts fewer than eight shots in a game, it\u2019s a warning. The third warning is a one-point deduction. The fifth warning is a two-point deduction. And so on. Until your team is relegated on minus-98 points.</p> <p><strong>Tournament play:</strong> Revamp extra time. If a game remains tied after extra time, the team that attempts the most shots in the added period is declared the winner. A team may still park the bus for 90 minutes, but sometime in the next 30, they needs to get that bus in gear. If teams are level on shots, it goes to penalties just to make England unhappy. Yes, you may see teams doing whatever they can to take or prevent shots. That simply adds another dimension to the game and makes the tiebreaker something other than the test of nerves and luck of the traditional kicks from the penalty spot.</p> <p>And if all else fails, boo. Complain. Gripe. Writers, should stop hailing the \u201cbrave defense\u201d of an overmatched team that makes little effort to play an entertaining game. Fans, create tifo ridiculing negative opponents.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019ll remind coaches and players that their massive salaries are dependent on people who have other options to spend their money on. And if they keep on treating the beautiful game as a dour exercise in cranking out results, we\u2019ll all be watching and playing lacrosse or ultimate frisbee in another couple of decades.</p>",

And it would be just the start.\u201d</p> <p>The minister referred to ongoing discussions with countries on resettlement options, but he suggested there would be no imminent breakthroughs. \u201cNegotiations will be protracted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The speech also foreshadowed future reforms to the permanent skilled and family streams of the migration program.</p> <p>Dutton will travel to New York with the prime minister next week to attend a United Nations-led summit on refugees, and in an interview with the al-Jazeera network foreshadowing the trip, the immigration minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">appeared to hold open the prospect that asylum seekers could be settled in New Zealand.</a></p> <p>Dutton indicated he would have no objections if people were sent to New Zealand, arguing that any resettlement was an issue between Nauru and New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had people smugglers that have tried to send boats across the top of Australia to New Zealand before,\u201d Dutton said.<br></p> <p>\u201cLet me make this very important point that people \u2013 if they\u2019ve sought to come by boat \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter where they\u2019re resettled, New Zealand or somewhere else, they will not be coming to Australia at any point.\u201d</p> <p>The observation was a significant departure from previous government statements on this question. Since 2013, New Zealand has put a standing offer to Australia that it would take 150 people a year, but the Turnbull government has consistently shut the offer down, arguing it would give a green light to people smugglers.</p> <p>After Dutton\u2019s comments to al-Jazeera were published in Australia, the New Zealand immigration minister issued a two-line statement saying New Zealand was not contemplating any separate discussion with Nauru over the resettlement offer.</p> <p>In questions after his speech on Thursday night, Dutton said there was absolutely no change in the government\u2019s position on resettlement in New Zealand.</p> <p>He said the question put to him on al-Jazeera referenced a deal that could be struck between Nauru and New Zealand, not an Australia-led negotiation. \u201cThere has been no change. Our position remains unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton told the Australian Strategic Policy Institute the government had to hold the line on deterrence measures because people smugglers \u201cwill not go quietly into the night; they are ruthless and sophisticated criminals\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey diligently follow the asylum seeker debate in this country, looking intently for any opportunity to restart what was a half-billion-dollar industry. Whatever decisions we make, we must always cast an eye to potential pull factors and the consequences that may follow.\u201d</p> <p>Dutton acknowledged there had been what he termed \u201cissues in our strained detention and processing networks\u201d \u2013 but he repeated his regular criticism of refugee advocates.</p> <p>\u201cOur detractors do no service to anyone by trading in false hope and speaking in disingenuous terms. Their entreaties to a different approach offer nothing but a holiday from history and ignore the fundamental reality that secure borders require policies that are tough and fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they are not tough they will not be fair to those desperate people waiting in camps. And they will not be morally fair to those who will again be lured to the murky depths by the siren call of people smugglers.\u201d</p> <p>He also told his audience terrorist groups such as Daesh were \u201cexploiting the mass movements of the international migrant crisis to move materials and personnel to support terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are using chaos and volume as cover. Just two days ago three Syrian nationals who travelled through Turkey and Greece using fake passports were arrested in a series of pre-dawn terror raids in northern Germany,\u201d Dutton said.</p> <p>\u201cThe men were allegedly assisted by the same smuggler organisation behind the Paris attacks.\u201d</p> <p>During the period of questions Dutton was asked why John Howard could soften the \u201cPacific Solution\u201d and bring people held offshore back to Australia in the mid 2000s \u2013 but the Turnbull government was resisting current entreaties to bring people out of what is proving to be indefinite detention.</p> <p>The immigration minister suggested criminal syndicates lacked the capacity during the Howard years to communicate quickly with one another about political statements being made in Australia. \u201cWe have to learn the lessons of history but we have to have a contemporary view,\u201d Dutton said.</p> <p>The minister said the government was working \u201cvery very intensely with a number of partners\u201d on third country resettlement \u2013 but complex resolutions to complex problems can\u2019t be announced overnight.</p>",

It drops the $500,000 lifetime cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer did a lot of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print first. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the parliament and that needs Labor\u2019s support. But the win did increase Coalition confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne followed up, saying the Labor\u2019s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. Remember that one under Tony Abbott?<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very interesting fishing exercise.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. </strong><br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s it from me.

Labor\u2019s superannuation package, which was released by <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> a fair while before the Coalition\u2019s package, should also be congratulated. Bowen essentially gave Morrison cover to work up superannuation reforms which could make a difference to the budget and get rid of a significant tax shelter. As Morrison said, people were stacking money into balances up to $100m paying no tax. Larf! </p> <p>Now you could say, Morrison should have run it past his own backbench before the budget to make for a neater policy package. It certainly would have saved a bit of angst and removed a stick for <strong>Eric Abetz</strong>. But hey, the broader point remains. If the generous concessions for largely high-income earners are wound back for the good of the budget and the savings figures are correct, <strong>Morrison and Turnbull done good</strong>. (All nuclear explosions kept to the comments thread, please.)</p> <p>Bowen will be out at midday. Morrison says he has spoken to him. We await with interest but could there be two policy reform handshakes in one week?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:47:49.653Z\">at 2.47am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9f3d8e4b067ad30087d44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:07:55.138Z\">2.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lastly \u2013 I promise \u2013 <strong>George Christensen</strong> gives the prime minister five stars for performance.

Can you understand, though, why most people would think that $100,000 a year out of after-tax income, is an extraordinarily high amount to enable someone to contribute to super out of their own pocket.

That is the product of a previous set of arrangements. </p> <p>That will have a legacy to it, understandably.

While some may call me a latte-sipping elite, I am no stranger to communities in the back blocks. I live in a small town and live among some people who for various reasons share some of the views of <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. Some vote for her.</p> <p>I heard those views just prior to Hanson winning a seat in 1996. I had just moved out of the city and at that time, she was an anathema to me because I considered her and her supporters ignorant. Since coming to know the people in regional Australia, I don\u2019t think of her supporters in that way. They have issues which they want to see ventilated and putting a lid on them will not make them go away. Conversations help.</p> <p>But there is a difference between then and now, though the messages are similar. I covered that 1996 speech when she said Indigenous Australians were getting special benefits and we were being swamped by Asians. Now we are being swamped by Muslims, who are taking benefits, and the Asians, having done too well, are buying all our land. As <strong>Penny Wong</strong> said this morning, if she was around in the 50s it would have been the Greeks and Italians. I predict the Sudanese will come into focus in the future.<br></p> <p>The difference as I see it is this. In 1996, Hanson was unformed, politically naive, channelling views she heard in her family and in her community. The political process and Svengalis got a hold of her, chucked her in jail for a bit and she has emerged out the other side a different person. Strategic. Polished. That speech last night was a result. Deliberately hitting the same notes but choosing different victims. Smirking as the Greens staged their ill-advised walkout. As <strong>Tony Burke</strong> said she is not dumb, this was a deliberate, damaging, illogical but incendiary intervention. As much as I railed in 1996, I prefer that version. Pauline Hanson 2.0, in this security environment, has much more capacity for damage. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T23:42:34.389Z\">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9cf64e4b067ad30087c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T22:36:37.144Z\">11.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are looking around for powerful first speeches, check this one out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNKv2QttTY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/muNKv2QttTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julian Leeser, new MP for Berowra, gives his first speech.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Leeser won the safe Liberal seat after <strong>Philip Ruddock</strong> retired. </p> <p>It\u2019s the personal experiences I think which shape the best first speeches.

  "<p>The morning after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">EU referendum</a> was not, for progressives, like the morning after any other defeat. It wasn\u2019t just depressing, but disorienting. For Remainers used to thinking of themselves as the sensible mainstream the result was a rude shock. They hadn\u2019t just lost, they were lost in a country they no longer recognised. People clearly weren\u2019t thinking what they were thinking, after all.</p> <p>And so, many will be drawn to the upbeat title of this book, with its can-do suggestion that actually there\u2019s still a huge market for progressive parties if only they can get their act together.</p> <p>The idea for a cross-party collection of essays stems from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\" title=\"\">election night 2015</a>, when the Green MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolinelucas\" title=\"\">Caroline Lucas </a>and her Liberal Democrat opponent Chris Bowers were chatting at their Brighton count about the futility of fighting each other when they actually agreed on so much.</p> <p>A few months later they joined forces with the rising Labour star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a> to produce this book, arguing not for a&#xa0;merger of their three parties, or even a formal electoral pact, but more cautiously for making common cause wherever possible. Why split the anti-Tory vote between them when, they suggest, the differences between many Labour, Lib Dem and Green candidates \u201care far smaller than the differences between figures who are at home in the Conservative party?\u201d</p> <p>That would be easier to swallow, perhaps, if Labour weren\u2019t currently tearing itself in two over some of these supposedly small differences. Ironically, Nandy quit the front bench rather than work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> in the very month this book was written.</p> <p>But the prospect of a Labour split does, in a sense, add fresh urgency to the argument. Some Corbynites would clearly rather work with Greens, nationalists and fringe socialist parties than with the dreaded Blairites; some on the Labour right wonder if they now have more in common with centrists in other parties. Could there be an earthquake coming \u2013 a grand redrawing of the political map?</p> <p>There are some highly readable essays here. Skim readers should skip straight to <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/duncan-brack\" title=\"\">Duncan Brack</a>\u2019s practical account of lessons learned from Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown\u2019s efforts to forge a Lib-Lab pact in the 90s. The SNP MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mhairi-black\" title=\"\">Mhairi Black</a> and <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/chris_law\" title=\"\">Chris Law</a> shed interesting light on sticky relations with Labour at Westminster.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yasminalibhaibrown\" title=\"\">Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</a>\u2019s argument that the left has for the best of reasons failed to call out unacceptable beliefs and practices in ethnic minority communities is the best-written polemic in&#xa0;the book, whether you agree with it or not. True progressives, she argues, should operate without fear and favour \u2013 which means demanding that white liberals integrate better, too: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> talked about racial integration, but how many Asians get invited to his house?\u201d</p> <p>And while there\u2019s no set progressive manifesto, some common themes do emerge: electoral reform to help smaller progressive parties, a basic universal income that might compensate for technology destroying low-skilled jobs, a shorter working week and a shift towards prioritising happiness over economic growth. An essay from the <a href=\"http://www.newweather.org/\" title=\"\">New Weather Institute</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.newweather.org/about-us/david-boyle/\" title=\"\">David Boyle</a>, arguing that the left should be proposing new ways of creating prosperity rather than just demonstrating that it \u201cknows how to share it around\u201d, meanwhile provides a necessary counterpoint to some more utopian contributions.</p> <p>But the most important chapter here is probably the one many readers won\u2019t like, in which the pollster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-curtice\" title=\"\">John Curtice</a> runs briskly through the electoral maths. As he writes, almost half the nation voted for broadly progressive parties in 2015 (49% backed Labour, the LibDems, Greens, SNP or Plaid Cymru, while 51% chose the Tories or Ukip). But it\u2019s not as simple as concluding that first-past-the-post has cheated half the nation out of the liberal-left government it secretly wanted. Drill deeper and there\u2019s worryingly little support for many of the assumptions made elsewhere in the book \u2013 for example, spending more on benefits even if it means higher taxes. Almost two-thirds of voters think ordinary people don\u2019t enjoy a fair share of national wealth, yet only 40% favour redistribution from richer to poorer. Most think people should use their cars less for the sake of the planet \u2013 but when asked if they personally are willing to drive less, a majority aren\u2019t. People like \u201cwhat we might call the \u2018sentiment\u2019 of progressivism\u201d, Curtice writes, but balk at what it means in practice. As for electoral reform to make every vote count, voters rejected that idea in a referendum just five years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This barely addresses the gap between what voters are thinking and what progressives would like them to be thinking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And the yawning hole in this book is that it barely addresses this awkward gap between what voters are thinking and what progressives would like them to be thinking. Brexit may have come too late for the authors to reflect on, but progressive ideas took a pasting in May 2015 too, and the book doesn\u2019t seem very interested in asking why.</p> <p>The awkward reality hinted at in Curtice\u2019s essay is that in Britain, progressives often struggle to get into government unless they hitch themselves to larger movements and identities. Labour has prospered by uniting progressive liberals, often middle class and urban, with a more socially conservative working-class movement. Tory modernisers thrived only by convincing traditional Conservatives to play along. The SNP blends progressive policies with identity politics. There are endless ways to make up the numbers, but growing big enough to govern usually involves compromises between those impatient for progress and those lagging behind; yet this book largely ignores the challenge posed by the latter.</p> <p>Labour could add votes \u2013 although analysis suggests not enough to win a&#xa0;general election \u2013 by wooing Green voters, but the positions they\u2019d strike to do so risk alienating others. Does anyone really imagine Labour voters who want to keep Trident, cut immigration, and who aren\u2019t much interested in civil liberties have nowhere else to go? It\u2019s not as simple as mentally shifting Green voters in marginal seats from one box to another, and assuming nothing else changes \u2013 and even if it were, scope&#xa0;for tactical voting is always limited by voters\u2019 often deep attachments to their original tribes.</p> <p>The authors are right to point out the madness of people who fundamentally agree on so much yet are scrapping over what looks like nothing. But if progressives aren\u2019t careful, dreams of reuniting the left can become a place to hide from reality; a means of wishing away awkward truths about what voters think, and ducking the need to compromise with your own party. The trouble with collections of essays is that while each can be individually stimulating, they are often too contradictory to cohere into one clear story.

  "<p>Somewhere in this sprawling behemoth, this teeming leviathan, this pythonic mammoth of a novel there is a very good \u2013 even visionary \u2013 book struggling to get out. Notoriously, it runs to more than 600,000 words and is longer than the Bible. None of this will deter Alan Moore\u2019s legions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/alan-moore-uses-nine-year-olds-fan-letter-on-new-books-cover\">fans</a>, though I suspect that many of them may indulge in what Sir Walter Scott once referred to as the \u201claudable practice of skipping\u201d.</p> <p>The plot is simple enough. We open with Alma Warren, an artist and eccentric, whose brother Michael once nearly choked on a cough sweet and miraculously came back to life. Many years later a bonk on the noggin has allowed him to access the memories of what happened when he was between life and death. He is worried that he is going mad, which seems to be something of a family tradition, going back at least as far as his great-great-grandfather Ernest Vernall. Alma uses Michael\u2019s memories or hallucinations or epiphanies as the inspiration for a series of paintings, and on the night of the private viewing, various lives converge en route to the gallery in Northampton district the Boroughs. There is a heroin-addicted prostitute looking for a client, a middle-aged poetaster still living with his mother, a predatory monster, a bewildered boy, a compromised council official, someone who works with refugees, a car crash. Some chapters fill in the Vernall family history; others deal with the countercultural history of Northampton: Lucia Joyce, daughter of James, confined in an asylum; John Clare and Sir Malcolm Arnold; Samuel Beckett and Thomas a Becket and a surprising amount of hymnology. There are also ghosts, often intersecting across centuries; a monk who brought a relic to Northampton as the \u201cheart of England\u201d, a \u201crough sleeper\u201d ghost who laments the problematic logistics of ghost sex and is charged with a mission of deadly import. Finally, there are the chapters set in Moore\u2019s most visionary mode. These are mostly associated with what happened to Michael Warren in his betwixt time: in which \u201cBuilders\u201d play \u201ctrilliards\u201d with human souls in a metaphysical pool hall; two Vernall spirits embark on an epic pilgrimage to the end of time; and there\u2019s a night flight with demon king Asmodeus. The final chapter gives us Alma\u2019s exhibition, where the titles of the painting correspond with the titles of the individual chapters in another one of the crisscrossings found throughout the novel.</p> <p>There is much here that is magnificent, but the problem lies in the language. Beckett\u2019s most famous play was purportedly described as one in which nothing happened, twice; <em>Jerusalem</em> is a novel in which everything is said at least twice. The opening sentence of this review will have given you a flavour of that \u2013 needless tautology, with nouns chained to adjectives like prisoners in a gulag. I am quite a fan of the sesquipedalian and have never held that the \u201cless is more\u201d mantra is true at all times, but one has to know when more should be more, and Moore doesn\u2019t. Take this as an example: \u201cThe inner glow remained inside the gooseberry-toned configuration from the point at which it surged in via the chasm of the doorway, followed it as it briefly veered to Michael\u2019s right and resumed its path towards him, a manoeuvre undertaken to avoid the obstacle of the drowned mesa that he reasoned must be their living-room table.\u201d Or: \u201cA diffused gold plume rose smokily through the engulfing negative-space gelatine, a cloudy and unravelling woollen strand of lemonade that trailed up to the gumdrop pane of the vat\u2019s surface quite near Michael\u2019s plaid-clad feet as he stood on the framing wood surround.\u201d The graphic novel form, in which Moore found fame, demands of the practitioner a measure of restraint.</p> <p>Pity, because when it is good, it is very good. When Michael first emerges into \u201cUpstairs\u201d, there is some fine wordplay which gives a pleasing sense of his disorientation. \u201cWiz this play seven?\u201d, \u201cIt must be a missed ache\u201d \u2013 it is a technique that Tom Stoppard used to brilliant effect in <em>Travesties</em>. This section also introduces the most beguiling part of the mythology, the \u201cDead Dead Gang\u201d, a kind of supernatural equivalent of the Baker Street Irregulars in Conan Doyle or the Gorbals Diehards in Buchan, but closest in spirit to the Chums of Chance in Pynchon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/26/fiction.thomaspynchon\"><em>Against the Day</em></a>, especially given their affection for genre fiction. The chapter devoted to Lucia Joyce is, by contrast, a pallid imitation of the prose of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/28/finnegans-wake-james-joyce-modern-interpretations\"><em>Finnegans Wake</em></a> \u2013 Moore hints at this influence in calling the opening chapter \u201cWork in Progress\u201d, the title Joyce used before revealing the true name of the book. But <em>Finnegans Wake</em> is more than a string of puns and portmanteau words. Moore\u2019s version is monoglot, and therefore one-dimensional.</p> <p>The noble political anger one would expect is still here. \u201cDespite the very real continuing abuses born of antisemitism, born of racism and sexism and homophobia, there are MPs and leaders who are female, Jewish, black or gay. There are none that are poor.\u201d The problems are still here, too, though: the chapter narrated by prostitute Marla, obsessed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/jack-the-ripper\">Jack the Ripper</a> and Princess Di, seems to confuse expletives with authenticity, including 32 f-words \u2013 to take one page, chosen at random \u2013 and five c-words. This is caricature, not characterisation.</p> <p><em>Jerusalem</em> contains a great many inventive and instructive cosmologies. Let me offer my humbler own. Most cultures describe an aboriginal chaos, and into this plenitude intervenes a figure \u2013 call it God, Demiurge, Artificer, Urizen \u2013 who gives it form, distinction, coherence, elegance and even meaning.

  "<p>Poor capybara. I feel sorry for this one on many counts. First, for being a capybara \u2013 a ridiculous, outsized rodent, a Brobdingnagian (actually Brazilian) guinea pig. For being captured and caged, an indignity for any wild animal, even a big guinea pig. Then released, back into the wild \u2026 he thinks \u2013 it looks like his natural wetland habitat, grassy with a nice muddy pool to slip quietly into. It sort of is the wild, but it\u2019s a fenced-off piece of it, and within the fence are capybara nemesis No 1 \u2013 a pair of hungry jaguars. Mmm, capybara for tea tonight.</p> <p>They \u2013 the feline stars of <strong>Natural World: Jaguars - Brazil\u2019s Super Cats </strong>(BBC2) \u2013 are a pair of young sisters. Their mother rescued her cubs from rising waters, then climbed a tree, exhausted. But unfortunately it was a tree in someone\u2019s garden in the suburbs of Corumb\u00e1, a town on the border with Bolivia. A rescue attempt went badly wrong, mum was darted, fell from the tree to her death, two little big cats were orphaned. Aw, I\u2019ll have one, get me a baby jaguar right now Daddy, so cute, here puss. What, they get big and bitey? Well, then they can be turned into rugs \u2026 no, no longer acceptable?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe6d7f9463ad5bfbe88d03522ba3dad2e4d32b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe6d7f9463ad5bfbe88d03522ba3dad2e4d32b7/0_144_4282_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A jaguar cub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A jaguar cub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oncafari Project/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, these two aren\u2019t entirely on their own. They are fostered until they\u2019re big and strong. Now a woman \u2013 Lilian the Jaguar Lady \u2013 is attempting to do what has never been done before: rewild them (I know, ugly etymologically, but it could be a very good thing ecologically). They have got their large enclosure, in the area where they will be released, but first they must learn to hunt and kill for themselves. Enter the capybara.</p> <p>Jesus, that\u2019s even worse. Not just prey; he\u2019s practice prey. This may \u2013 and does \u2013 take a while. But, after a lot of splashing, scratching, clawing and biting, they get there in the end. One fewer capybara in the world, two fuller jaguars. But hey, that\u2019s nature, red in tooth and claw and all that. Plus there are plenty of capybaras, and not enough jaguars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0e124d0c448331cd58346ba5f9a78d7d55a44ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0e124d0c448331cd58346ba5f9a78d7d55a44ad/0_91_4292_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A jaguar in a tree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A jaguar in a tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oncafari Project/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, now that these two can hunt and fend for themselves, it\u2019s time for them to be fitted with GPS collars \u2013 very undignified and unfetching, surely no chance of hooking up and procreating \u2013 and released into the wild. Except that it\u2019s not totally wild around these parts (the Pantanal \u2013 lovely, do go if you\u2019re in the Brazil area); most of it is cattle farmland, and to a jaguar a cow is like a big capybara, ie tea. Mmm, steak Saturday. But the farmers don\u2019t like having their livelihoods stolen from under their noses, so they shoot the jaguars, and then you\u2019re back to square one: not enough jaguars.</p> <p>So the people have to be shown that jaguars can mean livelihood too, via tourism. Well, if you\u2019ve come all that way, from America or Europe or even S\u00e3o Paulo, you want to see more than cows and big guinea pigs, you want apex predators, with spots. So the cowboys are being retrained as big-cat boys, and their wives are working in the new eco-lodges (this is Latin America, where gender roles are very traditional; Lilian is the exception).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dc9abd74ab53fc7a96e83dc27257f48bf2b6f0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc9abd74ab53fc7a96e83dc27257f48bf2b6f0e/0_193_2894_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esperenza and cub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esperenza and cub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oncafari Project/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The jaguars are getting habituated to being around people, and the tourists are seeing jaguars because they\u2019ve got GPS collars on them, so Lilian and the team and the retrained cowboys know exactly where they are and can take the tourists straight to them. How is that going to look in the photos though, I wonder, the big satellite collar around their wild jaguar from Brazil? Well, it can probably be photoshopped out.</p> <p>What about the two orphan sisters, how are they doing? Worryingly, on the tracker one has been in the same place for a while, this doesn\u2019t look good at all \u2026 Death, yes, but not hers; she\u2019s made a kill. This time a peccary, a wild pig \u2026 well, even jaguars like a varied diet. Hmm, pork supper tonight, pass the apple sauce. And I was quite wrong about the ugly collar being an impediment to romance (jaguars are less shallow than I am, clearly): the other sister has hooked up with a local dominant male; maybe it won\u2019t be long before we hear the pitter-patter of little paws.</p> <p>The project is a success, then: jaguars rewilded, good news for South America\u2019s beautiful big cats. Lilian is happy, the cowboys and their families are happy, the tourists too; there are no losers. Well, apart from the odd peccary, and the capybaras.</p>",
  "<h2>Your dad was one of the founders of Mr Whippy. How influential was your dad\u2019s ice-cream business in your decision to enter the food industry? </h2> <p>It definitely played a major part. Growing up there\u2019d be discussions around the table at night about the business. It did seem normal to me. But the fact that my dad really loves what he does was very infectious and inspirational, and that also played a part in me starting a business.</p> <h2>Hotel Chocolat is seen as a luxury brand but it has a range of accessible to high-range price points. How did you decide on the pricing structure?</h2> <p>We started with the idea. Our mission was to make chocolate exciting again. When we started, chocolate in England was at an all-time low; it was extremely boring and there was just no innovation or excitement about it. We knew that the ingredients had to be the best and the price kind of came out of that. We didn\u2019t want it to be too expensive so that we could only sell it in Knightsbridge but then we didn\u2019t want to compromise on the ingredients either. We offer accessibly priced chocolate but also expensive chocolate costing over \u00a3100.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/hotel-chocolat-founders-make-20m-each-from-stock-market-debut\">Hotel Chocolat founders make \u00a320m each from stock market debut</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How did you decide on your distribution strategy?</h2> <p>Well, we certainly didn\u2019t want to sell through supermarkets. That was one of the factors we felt strongly about; we felt supermarket chocolate had become boring and rubbish quality. So firstly we established an online business, which was selling direct to customers. It was hard to get off the ground \u2013 it took six years to get going \u2013 as we realised that the idea of selling chocolate and waiting a day before it arrived was counterintuitive to what most people want to do. Many want to buy it and serve it up right now. But we built up our customer database like that and so when it came around to opening our first store we had a strong support base. </p> <h2>What key challenges have you faced along the way?</h2> <p>We launched our first website in the late 1990s and we were too early for the market [so establishing an online business was a struggle]. But then part of the brand has always been about doing things differently. Our recipes are different, distribution is different, we train people in-house at a school of chocolate [in Covent Garden, London] to be specialists. Our aim was to change everything. And from that we came to the logical conclusion that we had to buy our own cocoa plantation and become farmers [Hotel Chocolat acquired the 130-acre Rabot estate in St Lucia in 2004]. </p> <p>We had to get close to the cocoa. But we didn\u2019t realise that through that, our approach would change completely. We looked at everything [in our production process] from a cocoa grower perspective rather than that of a chocolate maker. For example, we realised we could make cocoa drinks, rather than just hot chocolate drinks, with just a bit of powder through in. So we went back to grinding the cocoa beans and adding skimmed milk, took a little stand at Borough Market [in south London] and sold it from there. If you\u2019re a traditional chocolate company, that would never have occurred to you to do. </p> <h2>Is there anything you would have done differently?</h2> <p>My business partner Peter [Harris] will say I\u2019m a natural, glass half full kind of person. If something doesn\u2019t work immediately, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not working, it means it hasn\u2019t quite finished yet. For example, there\u2019s plenty of ideas we looked at 10 years ago and now are recycling and bringing back to market. Sometimes we were just too early. I have no regrets.</p> <h2>What\u2019s been your proudest moment?</h2> <p>When our cocoa estate was up and running we hosted Prince Charles on a tour around it. Seeing the effect of his visit \u2013 on the faces of the cocoa growers on the island, their families, our team and my dad (who escorted him around) as well \u2013 was such a great moment. It was great seeing how proud it made everyone feel. </p> <h2>You floated the brand [with a \u00a3167m valuation] earlier this year. Why did you decide to go public?</h2> <p>It felt like the right time to float a minority of the business. We knew it would help us tap development capital [to take the money and develop the company further through investing in manufacturing, for example], and it would enable me and Peter to convert some shares into cash. It meant we\u2019d be able to forward plan for the company, and enable the employees to participate [in the company] through the shares. We continue to be the guardian of the brand \u2013 we still have majority of the shares. It meant we could continue to develop and grow; we\u2019ve invested some of the money into our manufacturing base in Cambridgeshire.</p> <h2>You\u2019ve worked with your co-founder Peter Harris for more than 20 years. How have you maintained such a successful partnership?</h2> <p>There are two reasons. One is that we have a developed an unusual sense of humour and that has saved us when we\u2019ve had the blackest discussions about things. We\u2019ve been able to use humour to oil the wheels. And secondly, it\u2019s mutual respect for each other\u2019s abilities. We are quite different, but we work well together. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/17/dishoom-cofounder-love-affair-indian-food\">Dishoom's co-founder on our love affair with Indian food</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What advice do you have for burgeoning entrepreneurs?</h2> <p>I didn\u2019t finish my degree at Sheffield.

Everybody on the course was an entrepreneur, and the conversations you would have and the quality of the learning was transformational. People rave about it. If you can afford \u00a310k, it\u2019s worth it. When I came back after doing it I was more confident in my abilities. I now had instinct plus fact.

The Hitchcock-punning title of the Radio 4 comedy <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017szpf/episodes/guide\">North by Northamptonshire</a> is designed to win a smile from the place name in the way that Bognor did for generations of comedians.

It was vivid, packed with incident and humour, strikingly modern and egalitarian. I read it, then asked my father about the author, a woman who, 1935 memoir aside, I knew next to nothing about. The conversation that followed set me on a quest to discover more about Dorothy, or Dorothea as she was within the family, and her amazing mountaineering life and legacy.</p> <p>Dorothea was born in Camberwell, south London, in 1894 to a family on the up. Her father, a chemist, teacher, and entrepreneur, had amassed a small fortune manufacturing baby food. Dorothea was sent away to the exclusive Queenwood school in Eastbourne to be groomed for a life of top-end housewifery, but promptly rebelled \u2013 a trait and spirit which endured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5da4abb125fe02fe60a166a029f6c9e9e1b1756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5da4abb125fe02fe60a166a029f6c9e9e1b1756/0_383_1764_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy Pilley, right, with her husband Ivor Richards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy Pilley, right, with her husband Ivor Richards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pilley Family archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a young woman she kicked forcefully against the life and choices others thought best and seemly. Eventually, she achieved a level of autonomy through journalism (for, among others, the Daily Express, and periodicals including Lady\u2019s Pictorial, the Englishwoman, and the Pall Mall Magazine) and by working as a secretary for the proto-feminist British Women\u2019s Patriotic League. It was also during this period that she began to escape London to climb in the mountains of north Wales and Skye.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Snowdonia was central to Dorothea\u2019s independent 20s.

It was there, in 1915, that she learned to climb on the nursery slopes of Tryfan and the Idwal Slabs; there, in 1917, that she first met her future husband and climbing partner, the literary critic and scholar IA (Ivor) Richards; and there, in 1921, that she helped found the <a href=\"http://pinnacleclub.co.uk/\">Pinnacle Club</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s first climbing club established by women for women. So it seemed apt that I began there too.</p> <p>From the moment I decided to research and write about Dorothea, it felt crucial to engage with her mountaineering legacy in a physical way, to climb the routes and peaks she pioneered with Ivor. I travelled first to the Idwal Slabs \u2013 a formation the locals call Rhiwiau Caws (Slopes of Cheese). It is a great fist of rock, dark fingers pushing down into the wet earth. I hiked up the A5 from Bethesda in hard rain, then on into the bowl of Cwm Idwal to stand beneath the rhyolite cliffs and watch others climb the slick rocks, soaking up the scene and the sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb03edb17fdc8801a4eaae108df114f236ce0a2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb03edb17fdc8801a4eaae108df114f236ce0a2b/0_114_4026_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The north ridge of Tryfan, Snowdonia national park, Gwynedd, Wales, United Kingdom, Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The north ridge of Tryfan, Snowdonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Else/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of months later I returned with members of the Pinnacle Club, a chastening and farcical trip: a circular several-mile walk around Ogwen in a deluge.

Drying out by the fire, we looked through their archive of letters and photographs of the club founders. Theclub members were kind and stoical and I was grateful for their hospitality.

However, it wasn\u2019t until I took part in a <a href=\"http://www.jcmt.org.uk/courses/\">Conville Winter mountaineering course</a> in the Cairngorms that I felt I\u2019d truly experienced real mountaineering. Run in conjunction with <a href=\"http://www.pyb.co.uk/\">Plas y Brenin</a>, the National Mountain Sports Centre, the Conville courses were established by Jonathan Conville\u2019s family in the wake of his death on the north face of the Matterhorn in 1979. He was 27. A trust was established to provide subsidy and training to young mountaineers so they might enjoy the mountains in greater safety.</p> <p>Dorothea and Ivor have been described to me as climbing aristocracy, whose feats and reputations spanned generations. To properly follow them it was vital that I learned to climb and belay safely on snow and ice and get to grips with spiky kit, such as axes and crampons. So, stood with a team of fellow Alpine rookies below the cliffs of Coire an t-Sneachda, I was taught to navigate, dig snow holes and take avalanche precautions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e3e4f9532b48cdc176b98af4901a5fc671f45f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e3e4f9532b48cdc176b98af4901a5fc671f45f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cairngorms, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cairngorms, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou need enough in your locker to survive and return to safety if things get out of hand,\u201d explained our instructor, Sammy.

The first time, I travelled over with my father and we set about the mountain with great zest and enthusiasm but we suffered: poor fitness, altitude sickness, failure to reach the summit, arguments, angry hut guardians and then a benighting. That is a beautiful word but a horrible reality: the light broke down, visibility was low so we stopped for the night, sat on a freezing ledge above Zermatt with an intermittent grandstand view of the Matterhorn. That rather took the shine off the expedition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52f89ff83928dee311e3a3e0438429015752ef49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52f89ff83928dee311e3a3e0438429015752ef49/0_229_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two female hikers looking at the reflection of the east face, Hoernligrat, of the Matterhorn, Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two female hikers looking at the reflection of the east face, Hoernligrat, of the Matterhorn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ingolf Pompe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My second attempt, made several months later with Swiss guide Jean-No\u00ebl Bovier, while far better organised and successful on paper, was equally eventful \u2013 and occasionally fractious. He got me to the summit, for which I\u2019ll always be grateful, but at the cost of a thorough dragooning. The climb was a vertiginous boot camp of sarcasm, tough love and swearing. On the descent I fell through a snow cornice and nearly began to descend at a speed incompatible with life. It all happened in a flash but Jean-No\u00ebl\u2019s skill and hawser strength saved me. We may have argued, but I love that man, won\u2019t hear a word against him. I can\u2019t thank him enough.</p> <p>Would Dorothea and Ivor have approved? I hope so. They were fantastic climbers, but at the same time, wonderfully droll, funny people with a strong sense of the ridiculous. Dorothea was every inch the swashbuckling heroine, a fierce trailblazer, yet always caring. I hope they would have been pleased that I went out to meet them in their element. I grew to love and value them enormously along the way.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the reverberation of one\u2019s life among them,\u201d wrote Dorothea of the mountains, \u201cIn each case the sense of an uncapturable significance will arise, and its secret \u2013 for the mountaineer as for any pilgrim passion \u2013 is almost an open one. Therein, reflected, is the experience of being ardently alive.\u2019</p> <p>\u2022<em> Climbing Days by Dan Richards is out now, published by </em><a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571311927-climbing-days.html\"><em>Faber and Faber</em></a><em>.

Six tips to inspire women climbers</h2> <p>B<strong>y Hilary Lawrenson, president of the </strong><a href=\"http://pinnacleclub.co.uk/\"><strong>Pinnacle Club</strong></a><strong>, a club for women climbers</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"82ad40e6b04ea8c921a1160de25440d6e07efa65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82ad40e6b04ea8c921a1160de25440d6e07efa65/0_0_5290_3175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mingulay, Outer Hebrides, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mingulay, Outer Hebrides, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Forman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1. Getting started</strong><br>If you want to start climbing outdoors, most local clubs will have introductory days for beginners. You could go on a \u201cwall-to-rock\u201d course or go for the full works with a weekend or week-long course at somewhere such as <a href=\"http://www.pyb.co.uk/\">Plas y Brenin</a>, the National Mountain Centre in Snowdonia. The gritstone edges in the Peak District offer hundreds of easily accessible, short climbs for starting on, or you can scramble and do easy multi-pitch climbs in the mountains of Snowdonia.</p> <p><strong>2. Join a meet</strong><br>The Pinnacle Club organises around 30-40 meets a year, many at our club hut in Snowdonia, but also in different parts of the UK and abroad. Most are for experienced traditional climbers, but we also have introductory meets for women who don\u2019t have much climbing experience. They are a great way to meet other female climbers and be inspired. As well as the climbing they\u2019re sociable and great fun whatever the weather.</p> <p><strong>3. My favourite UK climb</strong><br>I\u2019ve climbed in fantastic locations from Mingulay in the Outer Hebrides to Land\u2019s End in Cornwall, from Fairhead in Northern Ireland to the gritstone edges in the Peak District. One of my favourite climbs, only 12 minutes\u2019 drive from my house, is Croton Oil on Rivelin Edge, on the outskirts of Sheffield. It features an awkward wide crack, followed by balance-y moves standing on improbably sloping footholds, to finish dramatically on top of a pinnacle, where you can sit and admire the view.</p> <p><strong>4. The films to watch</strong><br>There are great short films on <a href=\"http://tv.thebmc.co.uk/\">BMC TV</a> where you can pick up tips about technique, gear, clubs and all aspects of climbing. I recommend: Pinnacle Club/BMC Women\u2019s International Climbing Meet 2016; Arc\u2019teryx Lakeland Revival: Middlefell Buttress; <a href=\"http://tv.thebmc.co.uk/videos/mina-meets-godzilla/\">Mina Meets Godzilla; </a>and the multi-award-winning <a href=\"http://www.lightshedpictures.com/operation-moffat/\">Operation Moffat</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.

And finally \u2026</strong><br>The great thing about climbing is you get to go to beautiful places in the pursuit of your sport. It can really challenge you physically and mentally and, unlike team and competitive sports, people carry on doing it well into their 70s. In fact, there\u2019s an active climbing scene for pensioners on the Costa Blanca in winter when it\u2019s too cold to climb in the UK. You can see a short film of Pinnacle Club \u201csenior\u201d members Dorothy Russell, 76, and Judith Brown, 58, climbing in the Lake District on Middlefell Buttress (see the films listed above).</p>",

The civil rights struggle of our times is not defined by marches on Washington, by anti-apartheid boycotts or by a looming wall to tear down. Today\u2019s struggle is defined by the betrayal of the opportunities of half an entire generation \u2013 and their growing anger and discontent at their fate.</p> <p>While western countries spend at least $100,000 (\u00a375,000) over a child\u2019s education life cycle from three to 16, the typical low-income country spends a hundred times less \u2013 just $1,000. In Somalia and the Central African Republic, this figure is a meagre $320 per student.</p> <p>And when all the world\u2019s aid spent on education is brought together, \u2013 from individual country donors like DFID, USAID and the EU and from the World Bank and international institutions \u2013 its cumulative worth is just $18 per pupil in low-income countries and even less \u2013 just $14 per pupil \u2013 in sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the poorest countries committed to modernising their schools are still receiving woefully low levels of aid. Togo, a much improved performer, receives just $7 per pupil. Even the harshest critic of aid must acknowledge the impossibility of building a meaningful transformation in education on a fiscal foundation barely able to cover the cost of one textbook per child.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62555fded9a9d8c9fbe2fd4e510a8e3e6d03c532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62555fded9a9d8c9fbe2fd4e510a8e3e6d03c532/0_220_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schoolchildren in Niger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schoolchildren in Niger. \u2018The dividing line could not be more clear.

And our inaction will encourage extremists who stand ready to exploit children\u2019s discontent and use our failure as a pulpit from which they can allege coexistence is impossible.</p> <p>No country that invests and is prepared to modernise and reform should be allowed to fail to deliver universal rights to education for a lack of funds. So on 18 September, the <a href=\"http://educationenvoy.org/commission/\">International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity</a> \u2013 which has brought together presidents, prime ministers, chief executives and education leaders with the support of the Norwegian PM \u2013 will set out the first global education budget, detailing the benefits and the costs of delivering the largest expansion of educational opportunity in modern history and outlining the reforms in international architecture needed to achieve this vision.</p> <p>Around the turn of the century education was 13% of all international development aid. Today it is just 10%, while global health has seen its share rise from 15% to 18%. And so we need to mobilise the same visionary zeal that inspired a concerted global effort to eradicate polio, tuberculosis and malaria to make ours the first generation where every child goes to school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/14/uk-ngos-raise-concerns-about-priti-patels-new-approach-to-foreign-aid\">UK NGOs raise concerns about Priti Patel's new approach to foreign aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Delivering on this is of urgent concern to those children in greatest need \u2013 the global cohort of 30 million displaced children (among them an ever-growing segment, 2m, made refugees by the Syrian civil war). For the out-of-school children among their ranks, the great barrier to an education is not so much a lack of teachers or schools but, as to its credit the UK government has recognised, a lack of funding.</p> <p>So as two refugee summits convene at the UN general assembly, we propose that by the end of 2017, every Syrian child refugee should have a place in school as a first step to ensuring schooling for every displaced child. To fund this, a begging bowl circulated years into the crisis must now be replaced by guaranteed provision available at the outset.</p> <p>The dividends will be profound. Education is the greatest anti-poverty investment we can make and with infant mortality among educated mothers half the rate of the uneducated, one of the most impactful health interventions. Our estimate is that, if our recommendations are accepted, GDP per capita in low-income countries will be 70% higher in 2050, and poverty 20% lower.</p> <p>Seventy years ago, international cooperation and statesmanship brought forth the Marshall plan to rebuild broken-down countries, the World Bank and the IMF to finance their reconstruction and the United Nations to secure the rights of their citizens. This was a time of enlightened self-interest, a time when the world saw a positive-sum pathway to improving the human condition. In 2016, when what is at stake is not just the security of millions but also the sacred belief in equality of opportunity, we are challenged to do even more. In the past we developed only some of the talents of all the world\u2019s children. It is now urgent that we develop all of the talents of all of them.</p>",

Clinton placed half of Trump supporters in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d on 9 September and stumbled upon leaving the World Trade Center on 11 September. Trump led Clinton 44-39 in a four-way race in the poll, with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson scoring an impressive 10 points.</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, which has picked the winner in every presidential election since 1964.

  "<p>From giving women the vote to repealing the White Australia Policy, the Australian parliament has an amazing history of taking the transformative decisions that make this country so great today. </p> <p>On issues like economic reform and gun control, Australia was well ahead of its time and we\u2019re still seen as a global leader. </p> <p>That great history makes it all the more bizarre that we\u2019re on the brink of handballing the next big social change \u2013 marriage equality \u2013 to an expensive and unnecessary plebiscite, rather than dealing with it in parliament like every other decision that doesn\u2019t need a change to the constitution. </p> <p>When we elect our MPs, we trust and expect them to make those calls. So why can\u2019t parliament be empowered to make this decision?</p> <p>There are two problems with a plebiscite. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/marriage-equality-plebiscite-i-take-this-barrage-of-bigotry-dressed-up-as-debate-personally\">Marriage equality plebiscite: I take this barrage of bigotry dressed up as 'debate' personally | Kerryn Phelps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is the damage it could do in the short term. </p> <p>We\u2019ve already had claims that gay marriage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/18/cory-bernardi-same-sex-bestiality\">could lead to bestiality</a>, and accusations that <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/subscribe/news/1/index.html?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a&amp;mode=premium&amp;dest=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/samesex-marriage-totalitarian-tolerance/news-story/ccb59decf097e134adc823b132ee5541&amp;memtype=registered\">businesses that support it are being \u201ctotalitarian\u201d</a>. I\u2019ve had people come up to me or write to me saying that they fear worse is to come \u2013 their fear is a plebiscite will be open season for most damaging, hurtful language about LGBT people. Given that the rate of depression for gay Australians is much higher than the national average, that\u2019s a serious concern.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about giving people time and space for a national debate. Australians have been talking about marriage equality seriously since the early 2000s and we already have the forums for people to express their views on both sides, including the media and the parliament itself. The issue is with using taxpayer funds in a way that could give a platform to the worst kind of homophobic rhetoric \u2013 without even binding parliament to the result. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/52z2h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2714138\"            data-video-name=\"Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d7a185e4b08465d4500198\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/13/160913gaymarriage_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572802&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/sep/13/children-from-rainbow-families-discuss-marriage-equality-plebiscite-video\">Children from Rainbow Families discuss marriage equality plebiscite</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There have only been three plebiscites in Australian history and the last one was the vote on whether to change a national anthem \u201cAdvance Australia Fair\u201d. Nobody has a convincing argument for why we need one now.</p> <p>The second problem is the message calling a plebiscite sends about Australia\u2019s ability to make important national decisions.</p> <p>Parliament is where we have to agree on reforms in tax, education, environment, industrial relations and immigration policy, as well as debating foreign affairs and the economy. It\u2019s also where we\u2019ve got to come to grips with the social changes that are taking place in Australia just like they are in every other country.</p> <p>Same-sex marriage isn\u2019t a niche issue. It\u2019s about basic rights and equality \u2013 the \u201cfair go\u201d that\u2019s such a fundamental Australian value.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-marriage-equality-plebiscite-and-the-constitution-it-may-not-be-plain-sailing\">The plebiscite and the constitution: it may not be plain sailing | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Undercutting parliament by taking away its ability to decide on marriage equality would set a terrible precedent for the next big change we\u2019re faced with, whether it\u2019s an economic choice or a social one.</p> <p>On the other hand, empowering parliament to vote would solve both the problems of a plebiscite.</p> <p>It would put a reform that the majority of Australians want to see in the hands of the people we elected to represent us less than three months ago, avoiding a lot of uncertainty and trauma for the LGBT community. </p> <p>And it would send a strong, positive message about Australia\u2019s ability to show leadership on the big decisions we\u2019re going need to make in this parliament and future ones. </p>"
