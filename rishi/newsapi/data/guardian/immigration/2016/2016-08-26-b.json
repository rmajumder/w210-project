  "<p>Under darkness, an impossibly small crate is left in the middle of the stage. Then: lights and fanfare, as dozens of performers clamber out of it with a huge energy that will carry the rest of the show. </p> <p>I know how they do the trick and I don\u2019t care, because the whole tent smells like popcorn and sweat, and my ears are ringing with cheers and an incredible live band. On Saturday night, the Circus Oz performers will climb higher than I will ever have the courage to, hold one another in ways I\u2019m not strong enough to try, and move faster and more precisely than my comparably weird, dumb limbs could permit.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t feel bad. The inescapable message is that we are all extraordinary. It\u2019s a wholesome, invigorating agenda.</p> <p>In the popular consciousness, circus is confined to the Sub-Art\u2122, apolitical, \u201cfamily entertainment\u201d section of live performance. It\u2019s discarded among programming that aims to pass a day, rather than to expand or challenge.<br></p> <p>But for Australia\u2019s national circus, this is a misclassification. Circus Oz established itself in 1978 as a satirical, animal free, politically progressive and feminist Australian company, which every year since has dedicatedly toured regional Australia, entertained our capital cities, and showcased Australian talent in 26 countries across five continents. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1526fe502cf9b4337ff6903dcdb1e8099bd883c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1526fe502cf9b4337ff6903dcdb1e8099bd883c0/0_274_3543_2085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circus Oz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A welcome, invigorating agenda\u2019: A toss in TWENTYSIXTEEN, Circus Oz\u2019s 2016 production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Blackburn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an under-appreciated gem in our national cultural identity \u2013 but they\u2019ll try to dupe you into thinking the Collingwood rehearsal space is simply a fun factory.</p> <p>The ceilings are so high they forcibly reduce you to the size and mentality of a child.

I\u2019m led around like a lost orphan who\u2019s fallen into some magical other world in a Disney film.<br></p> <p>The props department is a floor-to-ceiling archive of giant clams and false-bottomed vending machines, and there\u2019s a huge sandwich press with hundreds of nails where the heating element would be: a person goes where the sandwich should go, and then a performer tap dances on it while someone is inside with the nails poking into their skin.

She leads the band on the key-tar, before wheeling out a \u201cpercussion tree\u201d that grows four different kinds of triangles and bell lines and cymbals and bongos. It\u2019s so cool, and I tell her this about 10 times, like an idiot.</p> <p>They still have the top of the original Big Top, hand sewn by those with the know-how in a kitchen in Collingwood in 1978. They made the whole tent that way.</p> <p>But the institution has grown since then. Perhaps it\u2019s also matured. </p> <p>The first sign of the shifting internal culture at Circus Oz is the bleachers from that original Big Top, which have been cut down and turned into office seating \u2013 the rehearsal space has a boardroom now.<br></p> <p>Tim Coldwell helped sew that first Big Top in the 1970s. He isn\u2019t a sad clown so much as a busy clown, and these days he\u2019s also a production manager. He hangs up on a call to a theatre in Sao Paolo, and sighs tiredly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re more established [now], or if there are more people whose job is categorising whether or not something is a kid\u2019s show,\u201d he explains, his voice rough, perhaps from having done so many tricks.</p> <p>Circus Oz arrived in 1978 when the Soapbox Circus roadshow and Adelaide\u2019s New Circus came together to make something special. Born in the crucible of Melbourne\u2019s Pram Factory theatre, they shared the scene\u2019s ambition of making political Australia work \u2013 and the reality of having no money. </p> <p>\u201cIt was effectively the entire Melbourne fringe in one building,\u201d Coldwell says. The whole organisation performed the show, cadged Pram Factory resources, fiddled with the books, and built the very tent they would perform in.</p> <p>\u201cI was 20. It was different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was the 70s,\u201d Laurel Frank adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75bb5947228eb9b69b713f02dbb923c6f9ec6633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75bb5947228eb9b69b713f02dbb923c6f9ec6633/0_0_787_1062/741.jpg\" alt=\"Laurel Frank, who cofounded Circus Oz in the 1970s and is now costume designer\" width=\"741\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Political opinions aren\u2019t going to be well recieved around the world\u2019: Laurel Frank, who cofounded Circus Oz in the 1970s and is now costume designer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Circus Oz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank, another founding member, has stayed on as an incredibly patient costume designer. Like a circus mum, she frets over fabrics that sufficiently grip the Chinese Pole without stopping the kids from having fun.</p> <p>It certainly wasn\u2019t always just a kids\u2019 show. Or a kids\u2019 show at all. The first production featured \u201ckangaroos fucking\u201d, and that act toured for years. \u201cGenerally we got away with it,\u201d says Coldwell. \u201cIt was great.\u201d </p> <p>But the greatest juggling act of all has been pushing the boundaries while also making bank. \u201cThe core of the whole thing is the relationship between the performers and the audience, and that doesn\u2019t run the way business runs,\u201d Coldwell says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t run the way workplaces run.\u201d</p> <p>Frank continues: \u201cAll our history and new obligations \u2026 it gets harder to change and take big risks. A business has to survive. A lot of political opinions aren\u2019t going to be well-received around the world. Producers are buying our show and they have their parameters.\u201d</p> <p>Look close enough in the ring and you\u2019ll see an organisation trying to keep sustainability, activism and cool tricks in the air at the same time.</p> <p>You\u2019ll also see Robbie Curtis execute an incredible, accelerating routine with a growing number of juggling balls, and the strongest and most competent arms and abs I have ever seen. Unlike their previous show But Wait, There\u2019s More \u2013 a surprising, deeply progressive manifesto on anti-consumerism, and the beauty of the individual as part of a whole \u2013 the new show, TWENTYSIXTEEN, doesn\u2019t start with a political thesis.</p> <p>\u201cI see this show as a whole series of little things,\u201d Coldwell says, \u201cIt can take you everywhere.

He had been working at the Aboriginal Legal Service in Dubbo, but got bored with it. He knew that, with work, he could make it into Bangarra. But for an Indigenous Australian good with his limbs, Bangarra seemed a well-worn path.</p> <p>\u201cHere, I get to do whatever I want to. I don\u2019t know why Indigenous people haven\u2019t tried circus before. It\u2019s in our blood. It\u2019s storytelling and our physicality, and it\u2019s what we were meant to do.\u201d</p> <p>To rob him of a punchline, Brown is a triple threat: gay, Aboriginal and adopted. It\u2019s not uncommon for him to be approached after the show by families with kids who are gay, or Aboriginal, or adopted, and to be told \u201cnow, she has a role model\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it,\u201d says Brown, who scripts a lot of his lines. \u201cI don\u2019t write for everyone; I write for them.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone I speak to seems to want to inspire that same sense of empowerment. In TWENTYSIXTEEN, the director Anni Davey has given free reign to a diverse cast, to create a show that feels artisanal and bespoke.</p> <p>\u201c[Equality] was one of the launchpads for the company in the 70s and it\u2019s still a consciousness that attracts a lot of performers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a political statement to say that [all] people are extraordinary.</p> <p>\u201cYou can look through the eyes of somebody who\u2019s just like you and feel that there\u2019s a place for you, and it\u2019s a valuable place and it\u2019s an important place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"80e40d4c3582190afcf38e52021b82615f692924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e40d4c3582190afcf38e52021b82615f692924/0_0_3543_2357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Wilson and Olivia Porter in But Wait There\u2019s More, Circus Oz\u2019s 2015 production\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Wilson and Olivia Porter in But Wait There\u2019s More, Circus Oz\u2019s 2015 production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Blackburn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oz is about empathy and representation without explicit moral instruction.

These are no mean feats, regardless of how much boho, show-on-a-shoestring ratbaggery might have been lost since the 70s.</p> <p>There\u2019s also <a href=\"http://www.circusoz.com/support-circus-oz/support-us/support-blakflip.html\">the Blakflip program</a>, comprising scholarships, internships and classes, to identify and develop promising Indigenous performers.

That\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Given the hostility of the Australian arts landscape, Circus Oz maintains the proud, progressive spirit in which it was conceived with encouraging success \u2013 and it\u2019s a welcome departure from the traditional framework of Australia\u2019s academic, angry political theatre. With a social conscience matched only by its inspiring energy, collective power is in the soul of this place; the rehearsal room is warm, and equal, and supportive, and it\u2019s laid bare again in the Big Top. The metaphors inspired by 10 strong arms raising another body are too obvious to finish. </p> <p>But for all their activist sensibilities, Oz is absolutely no less a circus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna shave Flip\u2019s head out in the carpark,\u201d Brown says, running past with one of the tumblers in tow.

There are no prostitutes this time, and no sordid allegations of espionage or intrigue.</p> <p>Instead, there\u2019s a Labor staffer who is under investigation for allegedly receiving documents tantamount to an \u201cofficial secret\u201d from an anonymous source. The documents, according to Labor, are nothing to do with national security but do show failings and cost blowouts in the construction of Australia\u2019s highly politicised national broadband network.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/aug/25/stephen-conroy-talks-to-katharine-murphy-about-the-humiliating-nbn-documents-australian-politics-live-podcast\">Stephen Conroy talks to Katharine Murphy about the 'humiliating' NBN documents \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor argues the Coalition is particularly sensitive about the leaks because they show that despite Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s promise the Coalition could deliver a cheaper NBN in less time than Labor\u2019s plan, it is now over budget and behind schedule. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/police-to-raid-parliament-house-department-over-nbn-leak-says-stephen-conroy\">The execution of a second series of search warrants this week</a> by the AFP at Parliament House in the course of this investigation made for plenty of dramatic stock video footage as police officers scurried through parliament. And it\u2019s provoked a political tit for tat between Labor senator Stephen Conroy and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, over the AFP\u2019s decision to take up the case and their independence. To add to the complicated legal issues at play, Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/cory-bernardi-signals-he-may-back-labor-over-controversial-nbn-raids\">has also made a claim of parliamentary privilege</a> over some of the documents that have been seized by the AFP.</p> <p>But if you peer beyond the back and forth there are some urgent and pressing issues the raids throw up that go to the heart of Australia\u2019s political system. And they raise vital concerns for all journalists in Australia.</p> <p>We know that the federal police have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/journalists-reporting-on-asylum-seekers-referred-to-australian-police\">quite active in pursuing journalists\u2019 sources</a> with a view to prosecuting them. This often occurs in politically sensitive areas such as immigration. Whistleblowers from the detention system have had their phone records accessed. My own email and phone records <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/federal-police-admit-seeking-access-to-reporters-metadata-without-warrant\">were obtained by the AFP</a> as part of an investigation into my sources from the detention system. All of this has been done under the still quite serious offence under s70 of the Crimes Act which specifically prohibits disclosures made by commonwealth officials. This offence targets the source, not the journalist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/24/police-to-raid-parliament-house-department-over-nbn-leak-says-stephen-conroy\">Federal police raid Parliament House over alleged NBN leak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what\u2019s unusual about the NBN raids is that the even more serious \u201cofficial secrets\u201d offence <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s79.html\">under s79 of the Crimes Act</a> is now being invoked to seek to investigate \u2013 and potentially prosecute \u2013 the Labor staffer Andrew Byrne himself for allegedly receiving the documents as well as the unnamed source for disclosing them, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidlipson/status/768263181718302720\">according to the warrants issued.</a></p> <p>No charges have been brought against Byrne but the investigation is obviously active.</p> <p>There are two early conclusions that could be drawn from the AFP\u2019s decision to investigate Byrne for allegedly receiving an official secret. The first is that the offence is being used as a way to get their search warrants over the line, in order to work out the source of the NBN leaks. If this were true then it could be seen as a serious abuse of process.</p> <p>The second is that the AFP really are serious about throwing the book at Byrne. And if that\u2019s the case then it would be probably the first time in Australia\u2019s history that the official secrets offence has been used to target someone for anything short of serious espionage.</p> <p>The AFP\u2019s argument will no doubt be that the NBN is a core part of national infrastructure \u2013 and that the documents disclosed are a matter of national security capable of reaching the threshold of an official secret.</p> <p>That\u2019s not how official secrets have traditionally been considered though. And the use of the offence is even more bizarre given the controversy over whether NBN employees could even be considered \u201ccommonwealth officers\u201d \u2013 a point quite rightly flagged by Conroy. As Conroy has repeatedly highlighted, the NBN Co has an <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/nbnca2011336/s95.html\">express statutory clause</a> outlining that it is not a public authority. How then can the officers the AFP are investigating as the sources of the alleged leak be considered commonwealth officers?</p> <p>This entire process has obviously alarmed Labor, but it should be alarming journalists as well. The worrying prospect for journalists in Australia is that the same offence could be used to justify not only executing search warrants of a news organisation, but even the prosecution of a journalist who has received a bundle of leaked documents that embarrass the commonwealth government. </p> <p>If the AFP can seriously mount the case that disclosing documents about the NBN is matter of national security serious enough to invoke the official secrets offence, then the case could equally be made in many other areas. Immigration springs to mind as one area where the AFP has already been active in seeking to investigate and prosecute sources. But why not housing? Why not finance and banking? That most nebulous idea of national security could be twisted to suit the politics of the day.</p> <p>There would be nothing to stop the federal police investigating a journalist as the alleged perpetrator of the official secrets offence by simply doing their job: being in receipt of documents that show wrongdoing by commonwealth officials.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s battle against the federal police raids should be seen as a threat to every journalist and news organisation in the country. If the federal police investigation is ultimately successful, it sets a most dangerous precedent over the reach of the official secrets offence. And it may embolden them to one day pursue a journalist in the same way.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>Not every big issue that Europe has faced over the past 12 months has been linked to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration\" title=\"\">migration and refugee crisis</a>. But most of them have. The arrival of over 1 million people in late summer 2015 shook European politics and institutions, as well as challenging Europe\u2019s awareness of itself and its place in the world more than any event since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It would be foolish to imagine that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/eu-and-turkey-restart-talks-over-migrant-pact\" title=\"\">this crisis is now over</a> and that the numbers will not rise again.</p> <p>One key moment came in late August 2015, when <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html\" title=\"\">Germany announced</a> it would accept all Syrian refugees fleeing war without sending them back to the countries where they had first entered the EU. Angela Merkel\u2019s words a few days later, <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/angela-merkels-sommerpressekonferenz-13778484.html\" title=\"\">\u201cWir schaffen das\u201d</a> (we will manage), felt pivotal, although whether the German chancellor really did open the floodgates of a vast refugee movement is still debated. Refugees had, after all, been on the move for months already in their hundreds of thousands. Harrowing pictures of overcrowded voyages to reach Europe were familiar. Long before Germany opened its doors, southern EU countries were facing a critical situation, their administrations and social services overwhelmed.</p> <p>Many, including the Guardian, applauded Mrs Merkel\u2019s humanitarian lead. Yet it cannot be disputed that in many ways Europe then failed the moral test. The worst refugee crisis in modern Europe has had a transformative effect that few had predicted or prepared for. The EU, Europe\u2019s nation states, and Europeans in general have all been weighed in the balance. On the political level the migration crisis has empowered nationalist and populist parties, which have since grown in influence from Austria to Scandinavia in ways that may last. Brexit might not have happened without the worries fed by Europe\u2019s refugee problem and their exploitation in Ukip\u2019s posters. Chaos and misery at borders, from Calais in the north to Kos and Lampedusa in the south, exposed the EU\u2019s divisions and inefficiency, energising centrifugal political pressures whose impact on the union may not end with Brexit.</p> <p>A key pillar of the EU project, the passport-free Schengen area created in 1995, remains in disarray. Schengen was suspended last February, and there is still no clarity as to how it might be restored. Across the continent, internal <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/national-borders-are-the-worst-invention-ever-says-ec-chief-jean-claude-juncker-a7204006.html\" title=\"\">border controls</a> that had once been abolished \u2013 and in some places, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/hungarys-pm-plans-more-massive-fence-to-keep-out-migrants\" title=\"\">barbed-wire fences</a> with police using tear gas against refugees \u2013 have become the new normal. These reflect not just a spike of illiberalism caused by reactions to the refugees but the EU\u2019s longterm failure to control its external borders effectively. Unless the external borders are controlled and managed, perhaps by the now strengthened EU border force, freedom of movement inside the bloc merely compounds the problems.</p> <p>A year ago Europeans finally grasped that their own world is not shielded from the chaos of the Middle East and of parts of Africa and Asia. In the aftermath, geopolitics have been upended. European relations with Turkey have been transformed in the effort to stem the arrival of refugees across the Aegean sea. Mrs Merkel has been much criticised, this time for her realpolitik rather than her humanity, but the deal has brought the numbers down (while displacing some of the pressure to the Libya-Italy crossing). There have been EU efforts to get sub-Saharan countries to take back migrants not entitled to asylum, in exchange for development aid, but such aid has been patchy at best. Though&#xa0;most victims of war and poverty have stayed in their regions, the exodus will not stop until those regions are helped to become safer and more prosperous.</p> <p>In spite of endless summitry and talks over refugee quotas, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/uk-unlikely-to-reach-target-of-resettling-20000-syrian-refugees-by-2020\" title=\"\">Britain played a strikingly minimal role</a>, Europe has shown itself mostly at a loss. In dealing with Turkey as it did, it has harmed some of its human rights principles. The onslaught of terrorism in France and elsewhere has fed paranoia about migrants. Identity politics is on the rise almost everywhere. Anti-Muslim movements, such as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a6bf467e-6852-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c.html#axzz4ISBDxnAQ\" title=\"\">the AfD in Germany</a>, have benefited. France remains convulsed by&#xa0;issues like the burkini, in spite of today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/26/frances-highest-court-suspends-burkini-ban-in-test-case\" title=\"\">welcome court decision</a> suspending a local ban. On the other hand, there have also been&#xa0;the many gestures of solidarity and humanity. Citizens\u2019 networks&#xa0;have distributed food, clothes and offered housing. Volunteers have thrown themselves into support efforts on the beaches and in the camps. \u201cRefugees welcome\u201d slogans have been hoisted on homes, football stadiums, places of worship and even government buildings.</p> <p>In the year since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\" title=\"\">Alan Kurdi\u2019s body</a> was found on a beach, Europeans have been found wanting. They have learned that what goes on in the rest of the world affects them more than they thought \u2013 a glumly late illumination after Europe has had so much impact on the world. Europeans have been confronted with the truth that theirs is one of the richest parts of the planet and that many desperate people, some fleeing for their lives, want to reach it. How Europe responds in the longer term remains in the balance. But the past year has been a humbling start.</p>",

In fact, an association with American Renaissance could be damaging to a conservative\u2019s career.\u201d</p> <p>This enmity is mutual. Taylor said: \u201cMainstream conservatives have completely conceded the question of race, at the cost of their own political fortunes.\u201d </p> <p>Taylor has been a presence on the racially motivated fringes of the right for more than a quarter of a century, following the founding of his New Century Foundation in 1990, and American Renaissance in 1991. In articles \u2013 many written by Taylor \u2013 at events and in podcasts, the website stresses white people are discriminated against, black people are inclined to crime and mainstream conservatives who deny these assertions this are culpable and headed for disaster. </p> <p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Taylor\u2019s career has involved lending a <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jared-taylor\">\u201cpseudo-academic polish\u201d</a> to racial thought. He presents as urbane: he is a trilingual Yale graduate, and his work has mainly involved producing \u201cresearch\u201d that backs up his positions on race. </p> <p>His influence can be seen in the alt-right Twitter accounts that brandish IQ tables and selective crime statistics to bolster their arguments on race. </p> <p> He has not only adopted the alt-right tag, first coined by white nationalist Richard Spencer, but also their online methods. In addition to the website, he is active on Twitter, and acts as a moderator on alt-right subreddits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Chip Berlet, a veteran researcher of the far right, finds the mainstreaming of Taylor\u2019s views concerning, even if Trump loses the election. </p> <p>\u201cThe problem is not that they will take state power, because they almost never do. The problem is that in the course of this social movement, in action and propaganda, they target scapegoated groups of people who become victims of violence,\u201d said Berlet.</p> <p>While the Republican presidential nominee has apparently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/donald-trump-immigration-reform-sean-hannity-fox-news\">softened his stance on immigration</a> as of this week, Taylor said, \u201cMr Trump speaks in elliptical phrases that sometimes make it hard to pin him down. At this point all talk about \u2018softening\u2019 seems to be speculation. I will wait until he gives that postponed speech on immigration policy.\u201d </p> <p>Berlet, too, is unconvinced and called it an insincere pivot to recover lost ground. But even if it were, it could not remedy Trump\u2019s actions in helping bring figures like Taylor to prominence.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t undo the damage he\u2019s done. The antagonisms he\u2019s bred will be longstanding, and will be apparent well beyond the election,\u201d said Berlet. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>Fiona Millar (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/argument-for-grammar-schools-selective-education-theresa-may\" title=\"\">Education</a>, 23 August) lists arguments made for grammar schools, including the \u201cthoroughly unscientific idea that there are \u2018clever\u2019 children and the rest\u201d. Those who believe 11-year-olds are inherently of two types, academic sheep and practical goats, should consider some real-life examples. Is the child who excels at maths but finds it hard to string two sentences together a sheep or a goat? What about the one who likes reading and writing but loves drawing and making things? Or the talented refugee who performs poorly in the 11-plus because she\u2019s not yet fluent in English? Is the child who falls just below the dividing line in test results because he\u2019s missed weeks of schooling through homelessness really a goat? Is the one who scrapes through because of private tuition really a sheep?</p> <p>The whole idea is a nonsense, as is the idea that two types of school are needed to provide sheep-education and goat-education.<br><strong>Janet Dobson</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was delighted to read the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/exams-grammar-schools-and-the-trouble-with-sorting-the-sheep-from-the-goats\" title=\"\">letter from Michael Liversidge</a> (24 August) in which he outlined his academic successes despite his poor performance at O-level. I was a pupil at the same school, which at the time held direct grant status and at which my father, Don, was one of Michael\u2019s history tutors. Shortly before our O-levels I recall overhearing Don referring to a number of my contemporaries as \u201cnice lads but not very bright\u201d. One of them, Chris Penny, went on to work at GCHQ where, so he said, he was just a cleaner, although the attendance at his funeral last year suggests a more significant role. Another, Matthew Harding, left to become a tea-boy in a finance house: he ended up owning that business and also Chelsea football club. Good results in academic exams are a clear indicator of being good at academic exams, nothing more.<br><strong>Dick Willis</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 The selective school system not only resulted in the majority of pupils being rejected at 11: it also segregated children within families. In 1958, I passed the 11-plus and went to a grammar school; my twin brother failed and went to a secondary modern. I was not good enough however to continue in the sixth form, so went to a further education college instead. There I met someone who told me he had failed the 11-plus. His parents were so concerned about the stigma of the local secondary modern that he was sent to one in the next town whose uniform the neighbours would not recognise.<br><strong>Bert Clough</strong><br><em>Newbury, Berkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>This time of year always takes me back to Sicily, where we went on our honeymoon. With its melting pot of influences from the Middle East, Spain, Mexico and beyond, I was bewitched by the food from the first bite, and we feasted on tomatoes, aubergines, capers and fish, all of it laced with delicious vinegars and olive oils: rich, sun-drenched food with spikes of flavour from other worlds.</p> <p>This week\u2019s bean salad has the sweetness of Moorish dates and the freshness of crisp apples and yoghurt dressing, while the bream over the page carries Sicily\u2019s classic agrodolce stamp: that wonderful balance of sweetness and sharpness complements fish so well. With the fish comes a burnt aubergine puree I first had in Mexico (which has exchanged food influences with Sicily for centuries via the Spanish conquistadores); unlike a classic baba ganoush, you do not remove the skins before pureeing the aubergines, which gives them a more pronounced smoky flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Borlotti, date and apple salad</strong></h2> <p>Soaking beans is the work of minutes and gives them a silky, luxurious texture (if you\u2019re making this on the hoof, by all means use tinned beans, though). This salad is best eaten when the beans are still slightly warm. Serves four as a main course or eight as a side.</p> <p><strong>350g dried borlotti beans </strong><br><strong>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda </strong><br><strong>2 cloves garlic, smashed once </strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp sunflower seeds</strong><br><strong>2 granny smith apples, washed </strong><br><strong>100g rocket leaves </strong><br><strong>4 small pitted dates, finely sliced </strong><br>For the dressing<br><strong>5 heaped tbsp Greek yoghurt</strong><br><strong>\u00bd large garlic clove, peeled and crushed with a little salt</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp cloudy apple juice </strong><br><strong>1-2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, plus a little extra for the apples </strong><br><strong>1 handful fresh mint leaves, finely shredded </strong><br><strong>1 sage leaf, finely shredded </strong><br><strong>1 sprig fresh tarragon, picked </strong><br><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for the beans</strong></p> <p>Put the beans and bicarbonate of soda in a large pot, cover with plenty of cold water and leave to soak overnight. The next day, drain the beans and tip into a large casserole. Cover with fresh cold water, add the garlic and bay (I like to add a teaspoon of peppercorns, too) and bring to a boil. Turn to a simmer and cook for an hour, skimming off any scum and topping up with boiling water as needed. When the beans are completely tender, drain, transfer into a large serving bowl and season generously.</p> <p>Mix the dressing ingredients in a jug, season well and dress the beans while they\u2019re still warm; they\u2019ll need another generous seasoning, too. You can do this a few hours ahead, but if you do, cover the bowl to stop the beans drying out and keep them at room temperature or in the fridge, and reheat gently in a pan just before you eat. </p> <p>Lightly toast the seeds in a dry frying pan. Slice the apple very thinly (use a mandoline, if you have one) and toss in a little lemon juice. Toss the apple, rocket, seeds and dates through the warm beans, taste for seasoning and serve.</p> <h2>Wild black bream with burnt aubergine and Sicilian-style onions<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bbeb903854232d5d360cce9cda1454ec81fc0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bbeb903854232d5d360cce9cda1454ec81fc0a/0_157_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 wild black bream with burnt aubergine and Sicilian-style onions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 wild black bream with burnt aubergine and Sicilian-style onions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Over a gas hob or a barbecue, char the aubergines, using tongs to turn them, until blistered and blackened all over and the flesh inside is completely soft (about 15 minutes); alternatively, heat the grill to high and blacken the aubergines in a roasting tin on the top shelf, turning occasionally. Cut off and discard the stalk, then blitz the whole fruit, skin and all, in a food processor with the tahini, garlic and juice of half a lemon. Season well and set aside. You can make this in advance.</p> <p>Fry the onions in a wide saucepan over a medium heat with the butter, two tablespoons of olive oil and a quarter-teaspoon each of sugar and salt, until softened \u2013 10-15 minutes. Drain the currants and add to the pan with the remaining lemon juice.</p> <p>Toast the pine nuts until golden, then add to the currants. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Give the onion pan a quick wipe and add the rapeseed oil. Fry the fish fillets skin-side down on a high heat for three to four minutes, until the skin is crisp, then turn and fry for a couple of minutes more, until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily.</p> <p>Spoon the warm aubergine puree on to four plates and top first with a fish fillet and then some onions. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil, scatter with mint and serve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/12/courgette-recipes-frittata-couscous-salad-herbs-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 courgette recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week\u2026</strong></h2> <p>The bean salad makes lots, but you\u2019ll be grateful of any leftovers: they\u2019re lovely on their own, or as a side for sausages or roast or spatchcocked chicken; they also make a mean packed lunch. If you have friends coming over later in the week, make extra beans and puree them with lots of olive oil and rosemary for use as a bruschetta topping; crisp slices of fried serrano ham on top are optional. Make double the aubergine puree and serve it as a dip, or stuff the excess inside a boned leg of lamb before roasting for a slap-up Sunday lunch.</p>",

Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c054b9e4b09fcabd06c91d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:42:57.165Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/26/all-eyes-on-yellen-as-jackson-hole-kicks-off-business-live?page=with:block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908#block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908\">rollercoaster market reaction</a> to the speech by Janet Yellen.<br></p> <p>He comments:</p> <p>\u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish.

This saw the dollar pop higher initially and precious metals fall. Nevertheless, she anticipates that gradual rate hikes are appropriate...</p> <p>\u201cBut as is so often the case, the initial market reaction can be misleading. As traders scanned below the headlines for the meat in the speech, perceptions over Dr Yellen\u2019s thinking changed. Gold and silver have surged as the dollar slumped.

New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech915.pdf\">shortly after the EU referendum said</a>: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05244e4b09fcabd06c911\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:30:20.880Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view:</p> <p>\u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04d6ce4b0486629890578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:17:03.350Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already?</p> <p>Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen.

  "<p>British politicians helped fuel a steep rise in racist hate crimes during and after the EU referendum campaign, a UN body has said.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CERD/Pages/CERDIndex.aspx\">committee on the elimination of racial discrimination</a> said many prominent politicians should share the blame for the outbreak of xenophobia and intimidation against ethnic minorities.</p> <p>It said it was deeply concerned that the referendum campaign was marked by divisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cMany politicians and prominent political figures not only failed to condemn it but also created and entrenched prejudices, thereby emboldening individuals to carry out acts of intimidation and hate towards ethnic or ethno-religious minority communities and people who are visibly different.\u201d</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/11/police-blame-worst-rise-in-recorded-hate-on-eu-referendum\">3,000 allegations of hate crimes </a>were made to UK police \u2013 mainly in the form of harassment and threats \u2013 in the week before and the week after the 23 June vote, a year-on-year increase of 42%. </p> <p>The UN committee said it was concerned that the increase in hate crime notifications did not reflect the true extent of the problem, and that proportionately few reported cases resulted in successful prosecution. \u201cAs a result, a large number of racist hate crimes go unpunished.\u201d</p> <p>The committee did not name any politicians. However, the referendum campaign threw up allegations of racism against the prominent leave campaigner and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\">notorious anti-migrant \u201cBreaking Point\u201d poster</a> was reported to the police for inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>The UK government said in response to the committee that it had a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to hate crime. \u201cWe have in place one of the strongest legislative frameworks in the world to protect communities from hostility, violence and bigotry. We keep it under review to ensure it remains effective and appropriate \u2013 and recently published a comprehensive new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hate-crime-action-plan-2016\">hate crime action plan</a> to drive forward the fight.\u201d</p> <p>The committee added that the negative portrayal of minorities, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers by the UK media, particularly in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, was also a concern.</p> <p>It called on the British government to investigate all reported acts of racist hate crime and ensure that perpetrators received appropriate legal sanctions. Ministers should also adopt comprehensive measures to combat racist hate speech and \u201cxenophobic political discourse\u201d on the internet.</p> <p>The government\u2019s anti-terrorism <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent strategy</a> had created \u201can atmosphere of suspicion towards members of Muslim communities\u201d, the committee said. Ministers should introduce safeguards to ensure the strategy did not discriminate on grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin.</p> <p>It warned that government proposals to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new British bill of rights could lead to \u201cdecreased levels of human rights protection\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>The chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, David Isaac, said: \u201cThere is no place for racism and hatred in a modern Britain and we share the UN\u2019s serious concerns about the recent spike in race-hate incidents. </p> <p>\u201cIn the weeks before and after the Brexit vote we saw reports of race-hate incidents rise significantly. We support the UN\u2019s recommendations for effective investigation and prosecution of all acts of racist hate crime and wide-ranging action better to deter and punish perpetrators.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Omar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, said the committee findings shamed Britain: \u201cThis report will embarrass the UK on the world stage and restrict the UK\u2019s ability to criticise other nations on human rights unless the government takes urgent action.\u201d</p> <p>The committee\u2019s conclusions, published on Friday, followed a series of hearings that took evidence from the UK government and charities and human rights agencies. It assesses all nations on a rolling four-year basis. The last UK report, in 2011, was critical of government inaction on tackling race inequality. </p> <p>The committee was established by a UN treaty, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Britain is a signatory. The convention is not incorporated into UK domestic law, meaning the government is not bound by the committee\u2019s recommendations.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 26 August 2016.

Despite eight devastating earthquakes in 40 years, experts estimate 70% of Italy\u2019s buildings do not meet seismic standards.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s culture minister said 293 historical buildings had been damaged or destroyed by the Amatrice quake, and public prosecutors announced an investigation into whether anyone could be held responsible.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/italy-quake-zip/giv-31075hB1ftyZZYq5n/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/italy-quake-zip/giv-31075hB1ftyZZYq5n/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Renzi announced plans to help the country prepare better and address poor building standards, saying Italy should \u201chave a plan that is not just limited to the management of emergency situations\u201d. <br></p> <p>But the prime minister said suggestions that the country could easily construct quake-proof buildings were \u201cabsurd\u201d. It was difficult to imagine, he said, that this level of destruction \u201ccould have been avoided simply by using different building technology. We\u2019re talking about medieval-era towns.\u201d</p> <p>Italy\u2019s older buildings are not obliged to conform to anti-seismic building codes, and experts estimate it could cost more than \u20ac90bn to reinforce all the country\u2019s historic buildings. Targeted improvement work, though, could be effective.<br></p> <p>Compounding the problem is the fact that many more modern buildings do not comply with regulations when they are built, and often prove deadlier than older constructions when an earthquake strikes.</p> <p>News reports in Amatrice said investigators were looking in particular into the town\u2019s Romolo Capranica school, which was restored in 2012 using funds provided after the L\u2019Aquila quake. It all but collapsed on Wednesday, while the town\u2019s 13th-century clock tower remained standing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are able to prevent all these deaths,\u201d Armando Zambrano, of the national council of engineers, told the Associated Press. \u201cThe problem is actually doing it.

  "<p>Attempts to provide poor, pregnant women in Texas with mosquito repellent to avoid possible Zika infections are off to a slow start.<br></p> <p>Two weeks after the state announced that mosquito repellent would be given out to women and girls on Medicaid, only 1,200 cans have been distributed, equivalent to less than 1% of the roughly 134,000 pregnant women eligible for the product.

Cities on the gulf coast provide an ideal environment for <em tabindex=\"-1\">Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes, the virus\u2019s vector, and the state has already seen 108 travel-related cases of Zika, including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d41731d8f23f4803b04ddaaba25b54b8/texas-residents-zika-case-linked-miami-travel\">one related to an outbreak in Miami</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe provision of mosquito repellent through these programs is definitely a step in the right direction, and this is something the coalition advocated for,\u201d said Alice Bufkin, policy director for the Texas Women\u2019s Healthcare Coalition. \u201cAbsolutely, this is not enough, of course, but it is important that [the state] did it, and now it\u2019s important to figure out.\u201d </p> <p>In Texas, girls and women aged 10 to 45 on Medicaid and other public health programs can obtain mosquito repellent through a pharmacy. The state issued what\u2019s called a \u201cstanding order\u201d in an attempt to make it unnecessary for women to obtain a prescription to get the repellent. </p> <p>But pharmacies have to opt in to this program, meaning many still legally require prescriptions, including some major chains. </p> <p>\u201cAnything I\u2019m dispensing requires a prescription, it\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said Vincent Omo, a CVS pharmacist in Brownsville, Texas, a town that borders Mexico along the gulf coast. </p> <p>When Stephanie Trbula, a pharmacist at Cobb\u2019s, a small pharmacy in a small town near Corpus Christi, heard about the program, she immediately contacted Medicaid to receive information about the standing order and was able to put it into effect that same day. She put up advertisements outside her family\u2019s store and on Facebook, and called the local school nurse to let more people know about the program.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/florida-keys-zika-virus-genetically-modified-mosquitoes\">Zika virus: Floridians fear 'Pandora's box' of genetically altered mosquitos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trbula has had a number of people on Medicaid ask about the mosquito repellent for young children or the elderly, but so far no one has been eligible.

We have had so much rain in the past couple weeks that there\u2019s standing water that has been there for weeks now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mosquitoes seem to be enormous. And I know all around us they\u2019re starting to see cases of Zika virus going into the hospital in San Antonio, Houston, so I know that it\u2019s just a matter of time before it\u2019s in our area as well.\u201d</p> <p>She is concerned for her pregnant sister-in-law in Austin, telling her to wear Deet, the <a href=\"http://www.txvendordrug.com/formulary/downloads/zika-products-pharmacy-assistance-chart.pdf\">preferred ingredient</a> in mosquito repellent, and to keep protected since \u201cright now they don\u2019t have anything other than prevention\u201d.</p> <p>But Texas women can only obtain two cans a month through 31 October, one at a time, meaning refills require two trips to the pharmacy \u2013 and potentially two prescriptions.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still pharmacies out there who are not aware of the program, or who is covered or what is covered,\u201d said Dr Sharon Davis, the chief medical officer of Los Barrios Unidos, a group of family clinics in West Dallas and Grand Prairie, Texas. Davis said she had done \u201cspot calls\u201d the same morning checking in on individual pharmacies about it. </p> <p>\u201cMost of our patients, I\u2019d say 90%, are Hispanic and were really at high risk because a lot of patient population either travels or they may have a spouse that travels to Mexico, South America, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s sexually transmitted, we really have to have everyone know about it.\u201d </p> <p>Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said the measure was at least a start. That the benefit is ending soon is because arbovirus season in Texas and most of the southern part of the United States \u201ckind of ends by then, so this is the crunch time right now\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, if we could afford it, I would like to see free Deet provided for all women,\u201d Hotez said.</p> <p>He is particularly concerned for women who are low income but do not qualify for Medicaid, and may have difficulty getting to a doctor if their pharmacy requires a prescription. In the past, <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2529146\">Hotez has argued</a> that children may be equally susceptible to the disease. He suggested that monitoring cases of Zika to see where transmission occurred and control of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> are also critical measures.</p> <p>In Texas, 3.6 million men, women and children qualify for public health insurance under the state\u2019s very strict income requirements. As of October 2013, the most recent data available, about <a href=\"http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/research/MedicaidEnrollment/ME/201310.html\">134,000 of those people</a> were pregnant women. </p> <p>Because of the austere requirements, the majority of people covered under Texas\u2019s Medicaid program are probably already pregnant or are children. This could be problematic, as scientists believe the most dangerous time for a fetus to be exposed to Zika is in the first trimester. </p> <p>The only <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/young-adults-and-families\">able-bodied adults eligible for Medicaid</a> (who are not pregnant) are those who care for at least one child. For the parents of a family of four to qualify, the household needs to take home less than $227 a month.</p> <p>However, children in low-income families are far more likely to qualify, as are pregnant women. A child in a two-parent household would qualify if the parents made less than <a href=\"https://chipmedicaid.org/en/Can-I-Get-It\">$1,842 a month</a>. A single pregnant woman could qualify for Medicaid if she made <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/women/pregnant\">$1,991 or less a month</a>, and would be covered until two months after the birth of her child. </p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services actually approved the use of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/01/feds-say-medicaid-has-pay-zika-prevention-diagnosis-and-treatment/85240846/\">Medicaid for mosquito repellent in June</a>, but states along the gulf coast didn\u2019t start the programs until August, after Florida had local transmissions. </p> <p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/florida-zika-cases-mosquitoes-miami\">first four domestically acquired cases of Zika</a> were identified in the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article97345352.html\">Wynwood neighborhood of Miami on 29 July</a>. The Mississippi division of Medicaid announced it would cover mosquito repellent on 1 August; by that time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/florida-zika-cases-transmission-neighborhood-miami-dade-county\">total number of infections had risen to 14</a>. </p> <p>Texas announced it would provide mosquito repellent through Medicaid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/florida-zika-virus-outbreak-miami-mosquitos\">two days later</a>. <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/08/080916-zika-update.html\">On 9 August</a>, when the number of locally acquired Zika cases in Florida hit 21, <a href=\"http://www.healthystartfv.org/repellent-available-through-medicaid-health-plans/\"> the state announced</a> it would provide mosquito repellent to Medicaid recipients, but people would need to call one of 15 providers to determine if they were eligible. </p> <p>One of the only gulf coast states\u2019 Medicaid programs to begin distributing mosquito repellent in June was Louisiana, though recipients there needed a prescription and could only obtain one can a month. </p> <p>In Texas, other gaps exist as well. Men on Medicaid will not be eligible for mosquito repellent, despite the fact that Zika can be transmitted sexually.</p> <p>The roughly 4.6 million Texans \u2013 or roughly 17% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 who don\u2019t have health insurance won\u2019t be able to obtain mosquito repellent as a benefit. Undocumented immigrants, who number roughly <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-illegal-immigration-but-didnt-know-who-to-ask/\">1.6 million</a> in Texas and who are eligible for neither <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/coverage/\">Medicaid programs nor Obamacare</a>, will also not receive mosquito repellent as a medical benefit.</p>",

Khankan sang the <em>adhan</em> and made an opening speech, and Fetteh delivered the <em>khutbah</em>, or sermon, on the theme of \u201cwomen and Islam in a modern world\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/chinas-proud-300-year-history-of-female-led-mosques-is-an-inspiration-to-the-west\">China\u2019s proud 300-year history of female-led mosques is an inspiration to the west | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Only a passing mention was made of burkinis.

Rows of women, perhaps half of them of other faiths or no faith but invited to take part in the mosque\u2019s opening ceremony, bowed, knelt and touched their foreheads to the ground \u2013 a remarkably rare sight.<br></p> <p>In many mosques, women are encouraged to pray at home or in private. Where women\u2019s sections exist, they are usually small, uninviting and accessed through back entrances. Mosques are traditionally seen as places where men gather for collective prayer and discussion.<br></p> <p>The Mariam mosque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/12/women-led-mosque-opens-in-denmark \">opened informally in February</a>, and it took six months of further preparation before the first Friday prayers could be held. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a process of learning. We\u2019re on a journey and we\u2019ve only taken the first step,\u201d said Khankan.<br></p> <p>Even so, the past few months have seen five weddings at the mosque, and three more are in the pipeline \u2013 including some inter-religious marriages, frowned upon by traditional mosques. There have also been a couple of divorces, one of which was conducted after prayers on Friday.<br></p> <p>The mosque has drawn up its own six-page marriage charter with four key principles: polygamy is not an option; women have the right to divorce; a marriage will be annulled if psychological or physical violence is committed; and, in the event of divorce, women will have equal rights over any children.<br></p> <p>One of the mosque\u2019s main objectives, said Khankan, was \u201cto challenge patriarchal structures within religious institutions. Islam has been male-dominated, women are still not equal in Catholicism and Judaism, and were only ordained in the Protestant faith [in Denmark] in 1948.\u201d</p> <p>The mosque also wanted to challenge \u201cpatriarchal interpretations\u201d of the Qur\u2019an, confront growing Islamophobia and promote Islamic progressive values. \u201cIt is possible to change patriarchal structures but it\u2019s a long journey and we have met opposition. But we decided not to focus on the opposition and instead speak about all the people who support us. We\u2019ve had very positive reactions to the mosque \u2013 from Pakistan, Iran, Europe, Turkey, Arab countries,\u201d Khankan said.</p> <p>She insisted there was \u201cno valid religious criticism of us \u2013 we are on safe theological ground\u201d. But Khankan has encountered some resistance from relatives and friends to her plans to open the mosque and become an imam.<br></p> <p>\u201cNot from my parents \u2013 they have been so supportive. My father is a feminist icon. I wouldn\u2019t now be talking about female imams without my father, who always told me I could do anything,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Her Muslim father is a refugee from Syria who came to Denmark after being imprisoned and tortured for his opposition to the regime. Her Christian mother moved to Copenhagen from Finland to work as a nurse. \u201cI was raised between different religions and different cultures, and that has a lot to do with this initiative,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>After spending a year studying for a master\u2019s in Damascus, Khankan returned to Copenhagen in 2000, \u201clonging to be in a religious community, but I couldn\u2019t really find a home\u201d. The following year, a month before 9/11, she founded the <a href=\"http://www.kritiskemuslimer.dk/?page_id=245\">Forum for Critical Muslims</a>. But the events and aftermath of 9/11 meant the organisation spent the next 15 years defending Islam instead of pursuing its reform agenda and advocating for female imams.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to hold to a narrative that Muslim women are oppressed when women are taking the lead,\u201d said Khankan.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Video of the LA women's mosque\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/world/video/2015/feb/01/all-female-mosque-los-angeles-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Female imams have existed in China since the 19th century, and in South Africa since 1995.

Supt Robyn Williams certainly doesn\u2019t want to see stony faces and crossed arms, but says dancing is discretionary. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t tell our officers not to dance \u2013 the music can be seductive, it is difficult not to want to move, we\u2019re only human,\u201d says Williams, who is the deputy head of training for the Metropolitan police. \u201cWe do remind our officers that they are there for a specific role and to always have their mind on that.\u201d</p> <p>But where there are cheerleaders, there are also critics. \u201cSome people love to see police officers immersed in the carnival, dancing and having fun, but anything that goes viral on social media will be met with a chorus of dissenting voices \u2013 \u2018you shouldn\u2019t be doing that\u2019,\u201d says Williams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e40547279aee0e292349c72c7b129cb3c413959f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e40547279aee0e292349c72c7b129cb3c413959f/0_16_512_307/500.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn Williams MPS Superintendent\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Williams (front) will be one of more than 13,000 police officers on duty at the carnival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hendon Police Training School</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, there will always be those that participate in the revels \u2013 and those who don\u2019t. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended if an officer declines to have a dance, they might prefer not to \u2013 or simply have no rhythm,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she is in the mood to celebrate what will be the carnival\u2019s 50th anniversary this year, the largest celebration of African-Caribbean culture in Europe. \u201cMinority migrant communities have done so much in London and there is a shared sense of pride,\u201d she says. </p> <h2>The ultimate test of leadership</h2> <p>Williams began her police career with Nottinghamshire police and moved to London in 2003 to work for Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary (the body that independently assesses police forces), before joining the Met as an inspector five years later. Within a matter of years she was managing the criminal justice department for the London borough of Westminster and it was here she first came into contact with operations for the Notting Hill carnival. \u201cI had to go on a public order training course where they threw petrol bombs and all sorts at me,\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>Public order training is the ultimate test of your leadership skills, according to Williams, it exposes your decision-making in a way no other space can. </p> <p>With present security threats at severe, and a record number of arrests seen at the carnival last year, those leadership skills will be put to the test this weekend. More than 13,000 police officers will be working at the carnival on Sunday and Monday, making it the largest yearly Met operation. </p> <p>There is a three-tiered command structure in place for the event \u2013 gold commander David Musker, who sets the strategy, silver commander Jane Connors, who delivers the tactical plan, and then a number of \u201cbronzes\u201d spread across the carnival, who put the plan into action on the ground. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e68a6c9315b9d0c84642df99cd1adae5f5e92fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e68a6c9315b9d0c84642df99cd1adae5f5e92fe/0_0_5100_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officer dancing with a carnival performer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some people love to see police officers immersed in the carnival, dancing and having fun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year, carnival organisers have doubled their own number of stewards, but if tensions arise, the police\u2019s strategic engagement officers will be dispatched with community ambassadors \u2013 well-respected locals \u2013 to help calm things down and prevent them from escalating into criminal activity.</p> <p>And if that does happen, they\u2019ll be there to speak to the crowds and explain what is happening. \u201cWe want to be open and transparent about policing and getting the right policing style is so important,\u201d says Williams, though she admits the police force at large doesn\u2019t always get this part right.</p> <p>\u201cOften people who make complaints talk about incivility and it isn\u2019t about what is said but how it is said; it\u2019s not unusual for minority communities to have that complaint.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Find the good people in your organisation to watch and learn from</p> <footer> <cite>Supt Robyn Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Not your average police officers</h2> <p>Williams is one of the bronzes and is the Met\u2019s spokesperson for the carnival. She will be out on Sunday, and for the first time she will flanked by five strategic engagement officers she has recruited specifically for carnival. This isn\u2019t your average police ensemble. Four of the team are women and they are all black and ethnic minority officers. Two are experienced detectives and the other three are young sergeants with less than three years in the role. </p> <p>\u201cThese are young, energised, brilliant officers who all understand the different music scenes from grime through to soca, and the audiences that might be attracted to the different sound systems.\u201d </p> <p>As a black female officer, she is all too aware that London\u2019s police force does not reflect the community it serves as well as it should. But things are moving in the right direction. \u201cPeople think of us as shiny and new but actually there are now black officers completing their 30 years of service and retiring,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe press wants to hang the Met out to dry in terms of representation, but the commissioner has set ambitious recruitment targets for BME and women; and we\u2019re seeing things change,\u201d she says, adding that the ambitions are 50% female and 40% BME. \u201cFor women we are at 26%, and BME we are at 13%.

A passionate mentor, the superintendent is keen to give her strategic engagement officers exposure to senior leadership meetings and teach them what the command structure looks like, early on. \u201cI want to support the development of our staff and bring them into spaces where they wouldn\u2019t normally have access \u2013 it might take years for them to get there otherwise,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Does she have any advice for other women aspiring to leadership roles? \u201cSee yourself in the wider context by going around and finding out what everybody else does and how you fit in, and find the good people in your organisation to watch and learn from,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd look after yourself \u2013 I do a lot of green juices.\u201d The odd Nutriblast recipe has been known to find its way on to her Twitter feed. </p> <p>Looking ahead to the bank holiday weekend, she says the best moments are when very little is happening other than the carnival itself. While she doesn\u2019t eat meat, the superintendent will be sure to have some rice and peas, washed down with something tropical (non-alcoholic, she hastens to add), and possibly fish \u201cbecause you can\u2019t go to carnival and not have something with jerk seasoning.\u201d Will she be having a dance herself? \u201cI will leave it to the police cadets, but I will have a smile on my face.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

Barely hours out from the event, Trump\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said she would \u201chighly doubt\u201d reports that such a joint appearance would happen, adding dismissively that the two men \u201cdon\u2019t know each other\u201d.</p> <p>But it all ended in a populist form of triumph, when the day after their appearance in Jackson, Hillary Clinton devoted a passage in her speech denouncing the rise of the alt-right to Farage. \u201cJust yesterday,\u201d she warned, \u201cone of Britain\u2019s most prominent rightwing leaders, a man named Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum, to have Britain leave the European Union,&#xa0;campaigned with Donald Trump in Mississippi.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/25/wouldnt-vote-for-hillary-if-you-paid-me-nigel-farage-at-trump-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x843\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2682831\"            data-video-name=\"'Wouldn't vote for Hillary if you paid me': Nigel Farage at Trump rally \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57be78b1e4b0fe30498a4892\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/25/160825faragetrumprally_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400117&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11400117&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/25/wouldnt-vote-for-hillary-if-you-paid-me-nigel-farage-at-trump-rally-video\">\u2018Wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary if you paid me\u2019: Nigel Farage at Trump rally</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If this cast Farage as some distance to the right of Trump, it wasn\u2019t the only carnival mirror moment of the week. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some weight to get someone like that to come out here,\u201d judged one member of Trump\u2019s audience of the candidate\u2019s success in pulling off the Farage booking. \u201cIt shows Trump is a heavyweight.\u201d Blimey. I hadn\u2019t realised quite how damaged America\u2019s self-esteem was.</p> <p>That a significant section of people feel left behind by mainstream politics is clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/britain-right-wing-brexit-america-trump\" title=\"\">rise of populist movements</a> on both sides of the Atlantic. That Trump can make their lives better seems considerably less likely even than Farage being able to do the same. The only way these two men can show their supporters how much they care about them is to display how much they despise almost everyone else. Yet the suspension of disbelief holds, and shows no sign of breaking in the short- or even medium-term future.</p> <p>A highly indifferent former City trader cosies up to the bizarre confection of megalomania that is Trump, yet the sense of rebellion against elites among their supporters is real. It may seem odd, considering he resembles a picture too hideous even for the attic, but Trump frequently reminds me of a line in The Picture of Dorian Gray: \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray\" title=\"\">You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These two men show their supporters how much they care about them by displaying how much they despise everyone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is no need for a word cloud after a Farage event these days, because his shtick can be reduced down to about four phrases that would sound patronising in any less looking-glass a world. \u201cLittle people\u201d. \u201cOrdinary people\u201d. \u201cDecent people\u201d. \u201cReal people\u201d. Farage thinks America\u2019s infinitely superior polling is as out of whack as the UK\u2019s, so you can see why Trump likes him so much right now. But on the off chance that the Donald isn\u2019t triumphantly landing his private jet on Pennsylvania Avenue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/election-2016-100-days-facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">on 9 November</a>, I\u2019d like to see Trump launch a range of colognes to go with his established lines, <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/merchandise/trump-fragrance/\" title=\"\">Success by Trump, and Empire by Trump</a>. Why not market Little People by Trump, Real People by Trump, Ordinary People by Trump, and Decent People by Trump?</p> <p>After all, Trump is incapable of having an experience without wondering primarily how it might be monetised. Persistent rumours suggest he is <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network\" title=\"\">eyeing the establishment of a rightwing news network, post-election</a>, which would allow him to maximise the opportunity of the audience he has acquired.</p> <p>Perhaps Farage envisages a role for himself on this putative network. It would be something to fill the time and keep him in a version of the limelight before his inevitable return to lead Ukip \u2013 or whatever successor to the party Banks is planning \u2013 in time for the 2020 election. As Farage was saying with hilarious specificity by the end of his own resignation speech: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see where we are in two and a half years\u2019 time</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Any Farage show on the Trump network wouldn\u2019t be within four hours of prime time, obviously. I see him in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/late-night-radio-djs-confession-priest-iain-lee-hattie-pearson-pete-price-dotun-adebayo\" title=\"\">Alan Partridge graveyard slot</a> \u2013 3am till 6am \u2013 taking calls from deranged insomniac survivalists and consoling himself with the thought that there are far higher callings than spending time with one\u2019s family.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps he prefers the smaller pond. Farage\u2019s failure to go as far as endorsing Trump suggests he has more than one eye on how it might play back where it really matters to him, while his reaction to Hillary\u2019s speech could scarcely have been more UK-centric, leading with: \u201cShe sounds rather like Bob Geldof and can\u2019t accept Brexit.\u201d If that line was designed to land anywhere in the States, then Farage probably wants to buy in some new writers.</p> <p>Still, look at him now \u2013 all dressed up and doing the town. As I was sorry to have to observe before the referendum vote itself, all those who voted out for reasons of sovereignty or whatnot would eventually discover that what they really ended up voting for is something embodied in Farage. A lot of those same people are always complaining we don\u2019t make and export anything in this country any more. I beg to differ: we make desperately grateful straight men for Donald Trump.</p>",
  "<p>Among Republican strategists \u2013 the kind of political hacks who have actually worked on successful presidential campaigns \u2013 there has long been some serious head-scratching about the Democratic response to Donald Trump.</p> <p>Why portray him as the scariest man alive? Why treat him as if his random brain farts will become reality?</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats are taking Trump way too seriously,\u201d one veteran GOP consultant told me at the Republican convention in Cleveland. \u201cIf you say he\u2019ll destroy the world, that means you think he\u2019s going to do what he says he\u2019ll do.

After all, it\u2019s much easier to horrify moderate voters \u2013 and motivate the party base \u2013 with Trump\u2019s plans to deport 11 million US residents, close the borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China and cozy up to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In this target-rich environment, who has the time or energy to go after his credibility?</p> <p>Why, Donald Trump does, of course.</p> <p>This week the GOP nominee managed to flip-flop on his signature issue: the one that got him through all those noisy primary debates. The one that allowed him to destroy most of his rivals and connect at a visceral level with the party\u2019s nativist core.</p> <p>Of Trump\u2019s top three opponents \u2013 Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush \u2013 two are Latino and one is married to a Latina. Trump tarred all three, despite their protestations, with the same brush of being soft on immigration.</p> <p>And then, out of sheer desperation or stupidity, Trump decided this week to copy them. At a town hall-style show on Fox News, hosted by his unofficial adviser Sean Hannity, the GOP candidate <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/24/trump-asks-his-supporters-to-weigh-in-on-deportation-policy/\">rolled out</a> his kinder, gentler immigration policy to a mixed response from the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have somebody that\u2019s been in the country for 20 years, has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK. Do we take him and the family, her or him or whatever, and send them out? Are they gone?\u201d Trump mused out loud.</p> <p>\u201cOr when somebody really has shown \u2013 you know, it\u2019s called like the merit system \u2013 other than they did break the law in the first place, OK \u2026 So do we tell these people to get out, number one, or do we work with them and let them stay in some cases?\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass, with a rambling response on Fox News, that Trump demolished the foundation of his own campaign. Which naturally left his audience a little confused.</p> <p>Trump may have previously given the impression that he thought all these undocumented immigrants were little more than a gang of murderers and rapists. But now, after some reflection, he concedes there may be some decent families mixed in with the gangs of thugs. Under Trump\u2019s new plan, there would be no citizenship for these people, but there would be legal status after the payment of some back taxes.</p> <p>This plan is otherwise known as the Obama proposal for comprehensive immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me,\u201d he explained on Fox News. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve said, Mr Trump, I love you, but to take a person that\u2019s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out. It\u2019s so tough, Mr Trump. I mean, I have it all the time! It\u2019s a very, very hard thing,\u201d</p> <p>Then he turned to his crowd and asked, \u201cWho wants those people thrown out?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters.

But when pressed about Trump\u2019s paramilitaries on CNN, his new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said meekly: \u201cHe has not said that for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Back in 2004, John Kerry\u2019s campaign was destroyed for pointing out obtusely that he had voted both for and against funding the Iraq war. This flip-floppery led to TV ads of him windsurfing back and forth to the tune of the Blue Danube. As a result, it was hard to think of a less manly American leader in the midst of the war on terror.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering what Team Bush thinks of Donald Trump\u2019s far more dramatic flip-flop, you don\u2019t have to look that far. Jeb Bush, the low-energy brother who was so easily dispatched by Donald Trump in the GOP primaries, told WABC radio that the nominee\u2019s reversals were \u201cabhorrent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a typical politician,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAll the things Donald Trump railed against, he seems to be morphing into. I don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things.\u201d</p> <p>If only he had been capable of such quips in the primaries, he might now be working on his transition to government.</p> <p>Of course, in later speeches and interviews, Trump suggested he might deport more people. Or fewer. Depending on the TV interview or crowd he\u2019s talking to at the time.</p> <p>Until now, honesty has been one of the very few areas where Trump has been running ahead of Hillary Clinton. While both candidates score poorly on such traits, Trump still maintained an edge, according to a recent NBC News/Survey Monkey <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-maintains-big-lead-voters-doubt-trump-s-temperament-n631351\">poll</a>. Even while losing badly overall to Clinton, Trump enjoyed a five-point advantage over Clinton on being honest and trustworthy. This is unlikely to last for much longer.</p> <p>The bottom fell out of the Trump campaign last month after a disastrous convention season. He picked a miserable fight with a Muslim American gold star family, and gave a series of TV interviews that would have got him fired from his own show. Straight talk, no matter how offensive, was his last remaining quality.</p> <p>People say that Trump learns nothing from his past errors, but that clearly isn\u2019t true.

Nor would tumbleweed now be blowing through high streets.</p> <p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/15/osborne-project-fear-budget-eu-refereundum-leave-scare\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d budget </a>\u2013 an attempt to dramatise the impact of weakening longterm economic growth on any chancellor\u2019s options \u2013 was over the top. But in the context of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\" title=\"\">leave\u2019s specious NHS claims</a> it&#xa0;was no more than a misguided attempt to fight abusive statistical fire on the same terms.</p> <p>Stock market buoyancy is a function of sterling\u2019s weakness and of the Bank of England\u2019s \u201csledgehammer\u201d monetary response \u2013 itself born of the bank\u2019s own deep apprehensions of a \u201cmaterial slowdown\u201d. Thus, too, the current resilience of retail sales. But what matters is future intent. Here surveys of business and consumer confidence tell a more ominous story. The commercial property market and construction, where decision-makers are compelled to make longer-term assessments, are already experiencing sharply weakening conditions.</p> <p>Prospects over the next five years are sobering \u2013 even alarming. The British and European economies are inextricably interconnected, as you would expect after more than 40 years of EU membership. Much of what remains of our manufacturing industry is dependent on free movement of goods and people, of which the newly successful motor and aerospace industries are typical exemplars. Industries as disparate as higher education, agriculture and financial services have prospered directly from EU programmes and the single market. Unscrambling all these hard-won and valuable relationships is bound to have a deleterious effect.</p> <p>Further, the world\u2019s companies come here to enjoy the UK \u201caircraft carrier\u201d effect \u2013 exporting into the EU single market from an exceptionally business-friendly environment. Nearly 500 multinational companies have their European or global HQ in Britain \u2013 five times more than Germany \u2013 a major boost to our business services and commercial property industries alike.</p> <p>Now the \u201caircraft carrier\u201d is torpedoed \u2013 but until we know the details of Brexit nobody can tell whether it is badly crippled or sunk \u2013 along with the economic activity that derived from it. Is the end result likely to be Brexit-lite, with continued access to the single market and some compromise on free movement of people? The Tory right and their media allies will insist that is a sell-out, and will the Labour party want to be painted as a friend of immigration? In which case Britain will be compelled to negotiate trade deals with 27 EU countries, and another 52 deals with the countries with whom the EU has deals in turn. What will the resulting tariff \u2013 and indeed non-tariff \u2013 regime be? When will they be concluded, given they take on average seven years? Liam Fox trumpeting possible deals with Australia and Azerbaijan in a decade\u2019s time is no substitute for knowing the answer, or better still having free and uninhibited access to the vast market in our own continent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What will be the regime for agriculture, for science, for startups, for aerospace, for financial services?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the \u201cdust cloud\u201d of uncertainty of which the chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/monetary-policy-only-short-term-balm-for-uk-economy\" title=\"\">recently warned</a>. It can be partly ameliorated, certainly, but it can\u2019t be removed by an active fiscal policy and industrial policy. There will plainly be some increase in exports with a lower pound: but the response was desperately weak after sterling\u2019s fall in 2008-9. More importantly, who is going to make a major investment in the UK in these circumstances, even with a weaker pound? Two economists <a href=\"http://voxeu.org/article/britain-s-eu-membership-new-insight-economic-history\" title=\"\">(Nauro Campos and Fabrizio Coricelli</a> \u2013 yes, experts) calculate that foreign direct investment will fall by a quarter. And if or when the uncertainty lifts, will it be because we have a hard or soft Brexit? It was for these reasons that every reputable forecaster predicted Brexit would lead to output falling below what it would otherwise have been in the years ahead. Not lurid pictures of an Armageddon; rather a cool assessment of economic realities, casually dismissed as \u201cProject Fear\u201d.</p> <p>It could even be worse. Economies can get trapped in vicious downward spirals. Falling investment begets falling investment. A weakening commercial property market spells weakened bank balance sheets, and potential credit constraints. What kind of recovery will happen after the inevitable slowdown or recession next year? What will be the regime for agriculture, for science, for start-ups, for aerospace, for financial services? Who has confidence in Messrs Johnson, Fox and Davis putting the interests of the economy and jobs before their ideological predilections?</p> <p>We have been plunged into a mess. The EU never obstructed the vital structural changes to the British investment and innovation ecosystem that had to be made, in or out. Now we have to deliver those reforms beset by the disastrous uncertainty of leaving the world\u2019s greatest trading bloc. For what? Not to co-operate with our European neighbours in what, in my view, is a noble cause? To unleash the most disturbing outburst of anti-foreigner sentiment I have witnessed in my adult life?</p> <p>Of course opinions vary. As you may have seen last week, Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s current economic editor, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\" title=\"\">upbeat about Brexit</a>. I, a former one, am&#xa0;profoundly concerned. Readers in the years ahead will judge which of us was right.</p>",

  "<p>Walking beside me through a market town centre is a lean, healthy, 46-year-old man. \u201cSo, you wanted me to show you how I used to look?\u201d He draws in his stomach, rounds his shoulders, paws imaginary sweat from his cheeks, and suddenly I\u2019m looking at a junkie \u2013 jumpy, wheedling, begging for a fix. \u201cAnd this is how you walk when you\u2019re going to score heroin.\u201d Subtly hunched over a sunken midriff, he strides ahead, as fast as he can without breaking into a run. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the stomach,\u201d he grins when I\u2019ve caught up. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stomach cramps.\u201d</p> <p>For 14 years, Neil Woods would leave behind his wife and two young children, put on stained \u201ccharity-shop scally tracksuit bottoms\u201d, and turn up in a town somewhere in England as a drug addict. \u201cI was a sponge for colloquialisms and mannerisms. Street slang is very regionalised, even just specific to a town, so you have to adapt quite quickly. The biggest danger at the start of any job is that you\u2019ve landed from Mars \u2013 and who are you?\u201d Using a new cover story each time, the undercover drugs squad officer would gradually befriend destitute addicts, ingratiate himself with their dealers, buy drugs from them \u2013 and then have the whole lot sent to jail.</p> <p>It\u2019s a struggle to reconcile the faux junkie Woods used to be with the articulate ex-policeman taking me for tea and cakes. \u201cOh, but I loved the art of deception,\u201d he offers. \u201cAnd I loved the development of the skill. It\u2019s a great thrill to be able to successfully deceive people. Particularly when it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The dangers grew every year, as dealers cottoned on to undercover police tactics, and grew increasingly suspicious of a new face asking for drugs. One dealer tried to run Woods over, another held a knife to his groin, another pulled a 9mm Glock handgun on him. But the commendation awards kept piling up. Woods even helped formulate national guidelines for undercover operations, and trained officers all over the country in his skills. By his calculation, he consigned drug offenders to more than 1,000 years behind bars.</p> <p>He did feel guilty about jailing the hapless addicts who led him to the dealers. \u201cBut I told myself I was fighting the good fight, and that the ends justified the means.\u201d This moral justification seemed more compelling with each new assignment, due to the ever-escalating violence deployed by dealers to deter communities from talking to the police. In Northampton, Woods discovered a chilling new punishment for informants \u2013 gang rape of a girlfriend or sister \u2013 and every heroin addict in Brighton warned him that if the local dealers thought he had talked, the next hit of heroin he bought would kill him. Woods had wondered why heroin fatalities in Brighton were five times the national average. This wasn\u2019t an overdose epidemic, he realised, but dealers literally getting away with murder, making their victims\u2019 deaths look like just another accidental overdose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations\">The UN\u2019s war on drugs is a failure. Is it time for a different approach?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was then that the epiphany dawned. \u201cEvery year the police get better at catching drug gangs, and the gangsters\u2019 most effective way of fighting back is upping the use of fear and intimidation against potential informants. The most efficient way to stop people grassing them up is to be terrifying. In other words, organised crime groups were getting nastier and nastier as a direct result of what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p>The only dealers the drug squad could reliably catch, he saw, were \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d \u2013 the small-fry dealers, and harmless addicts trying to pay for their habit by selling a bit, who an informant could report with no fear of retribution. \u201cIt\u2019s why organised crime is increasingly becoming monopolised, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/man-who-exposed-lie-war-on-drugs-roberto-saviano-ed-vulliamy\">the most successful organised crime groups are the ones that can be the most terrifying</a>.\u201d Like cold-war nations seeking security in Nato or the Warsaw Pact, small-town dealers are being absorbed into large city gangs. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic arms race. Although at least with the cold war you could knock a wall down, and de-escalate it. There\u2019s no wall to knock down with the war on drugs, is there? Brighton is the thin edge of the same wedge destroying Mexico. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/16/mexico-drug-cartels-famous-female-leader-sandra-avila\">Mexico\u2019s just the thicker end of it</a>, but it can only go in one direction.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f467eec51c73e8deaa03c7b67ec6ca32e659e1d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f467eec51c73e8deaa03c7b67ec6ca32e659e1d6/0_194_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a police raid in London in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every year the police get better at catching drug gangs, and the gangs fight back by upping their use of fear and intimidation\u2019 \u2026 a police raid in London in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also saw what the drug war was doing to the police. When Woods came across corrupt colleagues in the drug squad, the senior ranks would shrug that this was inevitable, given the money involved. A criminal trade that is worth \u00a37bn could buy as many police as it liked.</p> <p>\u201cBut the public don\u2019t tend to see this, and it\u2019s not really very much talked about, is it? One of the big problems is the duty of chief constables to maintain public confidence \u2013 which is understandable, because if the public lose confidence in the police, anarchy can follow. But it means there is no openness about the extent of corruption from the drug supply. So the public don\u2019t know. Compare that with prohibition in America up until 1933. The headlines in the press were constantly about the corruption that was being caused by prohibition.\u201d</p> <p>The realisation that the career he had risked his life for was not merely futile, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/08/spice-synthetic-marijuana-drug-screenings-tests\">the chief cause of the misery he had witnessed</a>, plunged Woods into a psychological crisis. He felt as if he was losing his mind until doctors diagnosed PTSD; it was so severe that even today Woods is twitchy and restless. A tic jerks his neck into spasms when he explains that the memories tormenting him were of the harm he had done to vulnerable addicts. This form of PTSD, he learned, is called Moral Damage. \u201cIt\u2019s about having done bad things. And I have done really bad things.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to talking to colleagues, but they were having none of it. If drugs were legalised, they assured him, the dealers and gangsters wouldn\u2019t disappear, but simply diversify into other crimes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the greatest misunderstanding about crime. It\u2019s not criminals that cause crime, it\u2019s opportunity.\u201d No other crime presents the same opportunity for \u201cany 15-year-old\u201d to make anything like as much money as easily and with so little risk of being caught. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all about the demand as well. The government\u2019s own statistics say three million people in this country use cannabis. There is no such vast demand for any other type of criminality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/prohibition-doesnt-work-uk-needs-enlightened-drugs-policy\">Prohibition doesn\u2019t work.

Alongside that, 50% of acquisitive crime is committed by less than 0.2% of the population. And that\u2019s problematic heroin users. If we undercut the criminal gangs, and prescribed heroin to addicts, most of that crime would disappear overnight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/01/switzerland-drugs-heroin\">The evidence is there in Switzerland</a>.

By now it\u2019s hard to remember that Woods was ever a policeman. He tucks into \u201cthis bog-standard reply\u201d as if it were a banquet. \u201cThere\u2019s two answers to counter that view. For one, burglars are a tiny number of people. As any police inspector or sergeant will tell you, you can decrease the amount of burglaries in a town of 25,000 people by half by catching two burglars. And by catching burglars, you reduce the demand for that crime, so to speak. But by policing drugs, you don\u2019t reduce the demand. You have no impact on the demand whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a global study, conducted by the coalition government, of the impact that punitive drug policies have had on drug use. Its unambiguous conclusion, he says, was that \u201chowever harsh your measures \u2013 the death penalty, 20 years in prison \u2013 they have no impact on drug use\u201d. Instead of wasting our time trying to reduce drug use, argues Woods, \u201cdrug policy should be about reducing not drug use, but drug harm\u201d.</p> <p>The second point, he continues, \u201cis that a burglary causes all sorts of devastation, so is wrong in itself. But the only reason why drugs are prohibited is because we made a decision.\u201d The impulse to temporarily alter one\u2019s mind is both natural and universal, and unless we think inebriation intrinsically immoral \u2013 in which case alcohol has to go, and probably coffee, too \u2013 to allow one method while banning another \u201cmakes no sense at all\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/24/war-on-drugs-40-years\">Nixon's 'war on drugs' began 40 years ago, and the battle is still raging</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following residential treatment for PTSD, Woods never returned to work.

I need to tell people. And people listen to me, because I\u2019m not a hippy. I was a police officer.\u201d</p> <p>Former friends in the force were immediately ordered to sever all contact with Woods, and although Leap receives Facebook friend requests and messages of support from serving officers \u201call the time\u201d, he accepts that, to his seniors, he is a traitor. To make matters worse, he has now written a memoir about his undercover career. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1110612/good-cop-bad-war/\">Good Cop, Bad War</a> is a gripping expos\u00e9 of the disastrous reality of the drug war, which he hopes will help shift public opinion. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to write a memoir.

But it\u2019s the best vehicle to get people to come with me on my journey, and realise what it was that made me come to the conclusions I did.\u201d</p> <p>Woods offers an analogy with the dramatic transformation in attitudes to homosexuality. \u201cThere was no particular revolution.

They highlight serious concerns about the ongoing risks to children and adults held on the island. They show how the Australian government has failed to respond to warning signs and reveal sexual assault allegations \u2013 many involving children \u2013 that have never previously been disclosed.</p> <p>The most damning evidence emerges from the words of the staff working in the detention centre themselves \u2013 the people who compile the reports. These caseworkers, guards, teachers and medical officers have been charged with caring for hundreds of asylum seekers on the island.</p> <p> \u201cThe Australian government detains refugees indefinitely [on these islands] as part of its offshore detention policy designed to deter refugees from arriving in Australia by boat,\u201d said El-Enany. \u201cMore than 500 refugees are detained on Nauru, including many children.</p> <p>\u201cRefugees on Nauru are regularly subjected to abuse, violence, sexual assault and rape.

By the same token, though, changes within that political arena have proceeded at a pace more disorienting than any thriller might hope to achieve and have been more tragic, farcical and banal than <em>The Knives</em> might want to be.</p> <p>The novel opens with a historical prologue set in Bosnia, in which its protagonist, David Blaylock, leads his unit through a sticky incident involving mujahideen.

Blaylock is thus established as&#xa0;a man of&#xa0;action with a serious past.</p> <p>In succeeding chapters, Blaylock shoots between meetings with the cabinet, the civil servants in his department, his estranged family, his supporters, his constituency team and various campaigners. Characters fly in and out&#xa0;of scenes, necessitating a cast list. Even with dramatis personae, though, it\u2019s hard to keep up with the revolving door. The pace required of the political thriller mode means that few are given more than a two-line sketch: \u201cEric Manning, director-general of immigration, was a neat and tidy fellow with&#xa0;gentle manners and a tendency to&#xa0;dress up bad news.\u201d One character is&#xa0;identified by a&#xa0;\u201cCaledonian brow\u201d.</p> <p>The political thriller itself, indeed, comes across as an oddly shaped creation. Take the ditching of the protagonist\u2019s Christian name: \u201cBlaylock darted in to plant a foot on the youth\u2019s forearm, feeling some old instincts to be dependably present and correct.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the phrase \u201cthe Jack Reacher of Westminster\u201d might have been used in editorial meetings. Accordingly, nuance isn\u2019t the&#xa0;game here; we\u2019re more likely to get Fleming-esque scene setting: \u201cAn hour later, suited up for the day\u2019s labours, Blaylock leaned back in his ergonomic chair, swivelled to give himself a sober panorama of grey London through the&#xa0;window of his study; and readied to take incoming fire from <em>Today</em>.\u201d&#xa0;</p> <p>As the novel develops, Blaylock\u2019s self-destructive and barely suppressed rage becomes the engine of the narrative, giving rise to violent disagreements and acts of have-a-go heroism, mirrored externally in the perpetual suggestion that, to borrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a>\u2019s terminology, it\u2019s all kicking off, everywhere. Despite the difficulties he faces, Blaylock is presented as a decent guy trying to do the right thing, and he is respected by the prime minister, who resembles&#xa0;Cameron re-imagined with fantastic competence. He also shares an unspoken mutual respect with his bodyguard; otherwise, it\u2019s enmity and&#xa0;distrust on all sides. His marriage to&#xa0;a&#xa0;progressive human rights lawyer has&#xa0;broken down. His son, an anti-capitalist protester, respects him least of all \u2013 little does he know how close he is to danger by dint of being a&#xa0;Blaylock.&#xa0;</p> <p>In terms of intrigue <em>The Knives</em> doesn\u2019t entirely weave the web: the threads are spun but not always knitted. The whole, therefore, refuses to reduce and resolve at the level of plot, leaving some very tasty suspicions open. Had it tied up every single plotline it would have felt extremely contrived; as it is, what is clearly intended as a surprise ending is only a surprise because there are several possible storylines that could have provided it. There are pedantic quirks, including a brief discussion over&#xa0;the correct use of \u201cwhence\u201d, which&#xa0;make unhappy turns&#xa0;of phrase stand out all the more: \u201cThe&#xa0;list of signatories was long and staunch.\u201d Graham Greene this isn\u2019t. It provides a&#xa0;character study in repressed and embattled masculinity, but it\u2019s stuck in&#xa0;T<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/top-gear\" title=\"\">op Gear</a> and moving too fast to be able to offer much insight on that&#xa0;front.</p> <p><em>The Knives</em> comes with a plug from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell</a> and it\u2019s easy to see why: the tough, honourable guy making tough but honourable decisions in a world of compromise is a type far more favourable to politicos than the ruthless bastard who has to deal with endless fuck-ups. Perhaps the literary thriller offers the only viable means to&#xa0;depict the heart of contemporary politics: after the \u201comnishambles\u201d hurdled the&#xa0;fictional barrier, a realist approach would surely need to contain equal parts&#xa0;farce, deadening bureaucracy and&#xa0;Beckettian hopelessness. <em>The Knives</em> does not pretend to be that, and&#xa0;it rattles along, but even in pacing it is outperformed by the spectacle of&#xa0;the real.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Blacklock\u2019s <em>I\u2019m Jack</em> is published by Granta.

  "<p>The Guardian Small Business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jun/15/enter-the-guardian-small-business-competition-win-a-mentor\">competition</a> to win a mentor, supported by Barclaycard, offered three businesses \u2013 in the retail, professional services and hospitality industries \u2013 the chance to discuss their ambitions and meet with one of three successful entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The three mentors are Sarah Willingham, serial entrepreneur and investor and star of Dragons\u2019 Den, Lopo Champalimaud, founder and CEO of online hair and beauty appointment bookings service Treatwell (formerly Wahanda) and Andre Blais, founder of Bodean\u2019s, one of the first barbecue restaurants to open in London. </p> <p>To enter, small business owners were asked to describe, in 150 words or less, their ambition for their enterprise and how a mentor could help them achieve it. More than 400 firms entered and their ambitions were wide-ranging \u2013 from becoming London\u2019s favourite beer shop to building a reputation as the Pret a Manger of Indian food.<br></p> <p>Among the entries were common challenges and ambitions. A number of creative entrepreneurs felt they lacked the accounting or marketing skills to grow their ventures; several hospitality companies wanted to increase their number of branches; and many budding exporters were seeking advice before exploring opportunities abroad.<br></p> <p>To whittle down the entries we held a judging breakfast. The judging panel included Claire Burke, editor of the Guardian Small Business Network; Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze; Helen Pattinson, co-founder and director of Montezumas chocolates; Jess Mahoney, business and partnerships manager at the British Library\u2019s Business and IP centre; Siddarth Vijayakumar, co-founder of Grub Club; Sharon Manikon, director of customer solutions at Barclaycard; and Anthony Eskinazi, founder and chief executive of JustPark.</p> <p>The entries were judged within the three separate industry categories: retail, professional services and hospitality. The criteria were: the ambition demonstrated by the business; future plans and potential for growth; and how the business\u2019s challenges could be overcome and plans achieved with the help of a mentor.<br></p> <p>With these criteria in mind, the judges discussed their favourite entries before individually ranking the businesses. The winners were: Claudi &amp; Fin, which sells low-sugar frozen lollies for children, made from 100% yogurt; The Sparkle Fairy, a mobile dental hygienist working in London and the surrounding areas; and Notes, a coffee shop and wine bar with six branches in London. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ba16c42363073f7a54c3342caf4a158eeb0a8dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba16c42363073f7a54c3342caf4a158eeb0a8dc/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coffe cup and cake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coffee and cake, served at Notes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: notes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian Small Business Network has matched each of the winners with a mentor, based on industry and experience: Claudi &amp; Fin with Willingham, The Sparkle Fairy with Champalimaud and Notes with Blais. </p> <p>Fletcher said of the entrants: \u201cAll of the businesses we saw were fantastic and have already achieved an enormous amount, a reflection of the talent of the founders.\u201d </p> <p>The judges were impressed by Claudi &amp; Fin\u2019s success, including securing stock listings in Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Ocado and Budgens, and its ambition: to achieve full national distribution and become a household name. </p> <p>Pattinson said of Claudi &amp; Fin: \u201cThey have achieved a huge amount in two years. To get the products into production and then sell them into high profile retailers, such as Waitrose and Sainsbury\u2019s, shows huge ambition and the ability to grow.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Eskinazi was impressed by the timeliness of the product: \u201cTo have a healthy alternative to traditional ice snacks at a time when [\u2026] the spotlight is continuing to shine on childhood obesity, the timing feels perfect.\u201d </p> <p>The Sparkle Fairy\u2019s entry described an ambition to grow its mobile service throughout the UK. Mahoney said: \u201cI was impressed by the breadth of application for this professional services business model [\u2026] I felt a mentor could be invaluable in helping the company prepare for, and address, the potential challenges in growing a local service to a national chain.\u201d</p> <p>Vijayakumar added: \u201cThe market for employee benefits or services is growing rapidly and I think The Sparkle Fair is a great product in a great space.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e381cdde7705edbd2997bddd850eaca08d155a3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e381cdde7705edbd2997bddd850eaca08d155a3b/0_17_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"van\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sparkle Fairy visits businesses in its van.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sparkle Fairy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, Notes, a speciality coffee shop by day and wine bar by night, caught the judges\u2019 attention with its simple business model and worthy ambition: to grow the business by two to three units per year. </p> <p>Manikon said: \u201cThe founders have already proven that their brand and formula is successful [but they] recognise that in order to grow there are multiple challenges that all businesses face and they wisely want support to deal with these head on.\u201d </p> <p>The winners will be talking to their mentors in the coming weeks \u2013 first during an initial phone call discussing their plans, then at a mentoring lunch.

  "<p>The 2016 presidential race on Thursday circled closer to the poisonous pulse of racial resentment, as Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for a video featuring white supremacists and Clinton prepared to deliver a speech detailing how, she said, the Trump campaign \u201cis taking a hate movement mainstream\u201d.</p> <p>Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has moved aggressively to capture non-white voters. The Republican nominee met African American and Latino activists at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday morning, after moderating his stance on immigration and including in his stump speech a sales pitch for African American voters: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/what-do-you-have-to-lose-donald-trump-appeals-for-black-vote\">What do you have to lose?</a>\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have great relationships and the numbers are going up with the African American community rapidly,\u201d Trump said at the meeting, which included retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson and members of the Republican leadership initiative to develop conservative minority leaders. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had great relationships with the African American community, and now I\u2019ve made it such a focal point.\u201d</p> <p>Prior to the meeting, two protesters hung a flag over a second-floor railing in the building\u2019s lobby just outside a branch of Starbucks, reading \u201cTrump = Always Racist\u201d, according to a pool reporter with the Trump campaign. A protester was quickly escorted out, although he shouted to the small gaggle of reporters that Trump was \u201ctrying to pander to black and Latino leaders\u201d and \u201cnothing will change\u201d.</p> <p>The magnitude of the challenge for Trump as he tries to attract non-white support was underscored by a Quinnipiac University <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2375\">poll</a> released on Thursday in which Clinton led among non-white likely voters by a 62-point margin, 77%-15%. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-gets-0-support-black-voters-ohio-pennsylvania-nbc-n609026\">A July poll</a> of battleground states found Trump with 0% support among African Americans.</p> <p>This is not the first week of the campaign in which racial tensions have been laid bare.

If he doesn\u2019t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Trump accused Clinton of trying to bully his supporters.</p> <p>It was a video released on Thursday by the Clinton campaign that drew the sharpest rebuke from Trump, however. The video features white supremacists describing their support for Trump, and depicts newly minted Trump campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon as an avatar of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/alt-right-movement-white-identity-breitbart-donald-trump\">alt-right</a>, defined in voiceover as \u201cthe sort of dressed-up-in-suits version of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf Trump wins, they could be running the country,\u201d the ad warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/768823064033308673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There&#39;s a reason the most hateful fringe of the right wing is supporting Donald Trump.<a href=\"https://t.co/AqB3DM2m0N\">https://t.co/AqB3DM2m0N</a></p>&mdash; Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/768823064033308673\">August 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Trump campaign called for the ad to be retracted through a statement from Mark Burns, a <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2016/07/the-rnc-is-over-but-can-we-talk-about-pastor-mark-burns/\">controversial</a> pastor from South Carolina and, next to Carson, one of Trump\u2019s most prominent African American supporters. </p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign went to a disgusting new low today as they released a video tying the Trump campaign with horrific racial images,\u201d Burns said. </p> <p>\u201cThis type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale.

  "<p>On the wall of <a href=\"http://www.brightontabletennisclub.co.uk/\">Brighton table tennis club</a> is a large map of the world, covered in drawing pins to represent where each member comes from. The largest cluster falls, unsurprisingly, on southern England, with black and white pins piling on top of Brighton. The second most common place, with eight pins, is Afghanistan.<br></p> <p>In May the sports club became the first in the country, of any type, to be given the title \u201cclub of sanctuary\u201d \u2013 part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/15/how-refugee-charities-will-spend-appeal-donations\">city of sanctuary movement</a> that recognises cities and schools that welcome refugees and asylum seekers. </p> <p>Brighton is home to roughly 60 unaccompanied minors, almost all boys, who came to Britain seeking asylum. They are housed mostly with foster families, until they turn 18 and their asylum claims are processed. Of these 60, around half have come to the club.</p> <p>The work began with Anh, a child from Vietnam who was the victim of human trafficking. He started attending the club in January 2015 at the suggestion of his social worker. Now 19, Anh is a qualified table tennis coach, and was recently granted leave to remain in the country for five years. His involvement in the club was cited by the Home Office as evidence of strong connections to his community.</p> <p>After the success with Anh, his social worker began recommending the club to all the asylum seeker children in her care, and news spread. Now 15 to 20 boys, from Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea, Kurdistan and Algeria, come every week, many three or four times, for table tennis lessons and friendship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"025a1da2b8fb9431278f2e74feb5f6daf0f56b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/025a1da2b8fb9431278f2e74feb5f6daf0f56b44/0_266_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton table tennis club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The table tennis club is one of the country\u2019s biggest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI am really happy there,\u201d says 17-year-old Faisal, from Helmand province in Afghanistan. \u201cEveryone is really nice. Before it was really difficult to find friends in England.\u201d</p> <p>The programme has been so successful in teaching the boys English and fostering friendships between the young asylum seekers and local children that Sport England, in conjunction with Table Tennis England, has just given the club founder, Tim Holtam, a \u00a3100,000 grant to continue their work.</p> <p>Many of the boys have been through a lot. Noor, 15, from Nangarhar province in Afghanistan, says his family told him to escape to Britain because they feared his life was in danger. </p> <p>Abdul, also 15 and from Nangarhar, came through Calais by himself at the age of 13. He left Afghanistan after returning to lessons after lunch one day to find his school had been bombed. </p> <p>Holtam says that as they build relationships with the boys, fragments of these stories emerge, but that mostly the club just allows them to have fun and play. \u201cI think when they come here, when they\u2019re playing table tennis, they\u2019re not thinking about how they\u2019ve fled. The benefits of table tennis to mental health is huge,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to think that their involvement in this club will help them \u2013 not necessarily help them with the Home Office \u2013 but help them feel like there are people in this country who care about them,\u201d says Holtam. \u201cSometimes they come in here and then they go to the shop and they see all these newspapers with all of these horrible headlines. It\u2019s about doing something locally that\u2019s positive and showing these guys that there are people in this country who care about them.\u201d</p> <p> Table tennis is not a natural sport for a lot of them. Faisal and Abdul, for example, prefer cricket. When the boys arrived at the club, many of them had never seen a table tennis game before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24e3257b072a1e1af2d5d60aa2372077d44daaa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24e3257b072a1e1af2d5d60aa2372077d44daaa4/0_276_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wen Wei Xu, one of the club\u2019s founders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wen Wei Xu, one of the club\u2019s founders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cI had seen it twice I think, not live, on TV,\u201d says Noor. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the rules, I didn\u2019t know how should I take the bat in my hands.\u201d</p> <p> But, says Holtam, table tennis is accessible and a leveller \u2013 people can learn it quickly and play it at different ages and states of fitness. </p> <p>Evidence of the club\u2019s inclusiveness are all around.

  "<p>It seemed to have the same effect as those dreaded occasions when rock bands break a run of crowd-pleasers and tell a festival audience they\u2019re about to play a new song.

By way of a punchline, the candidate list ends with Phillip Broughton, Ukip\u2019s 2015 candidate in Hartlepool, and a former semi-professional wrestler \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/philip-broughton-wrestling-ukip-euro-7055385\">who traded</a>, for some reason, as \u201cthe one and only Phillip Alexander\u201d.</p> <p>It is all a rum do, and in some of the commentary about the party\u2019s travails one can detect a view of its prospects that has perennially bubbled up since it decisively began moving on to the political map around 12 years ago.</p> <p>In this reading, Ukip was only ever a personality cult built to serve Farage \u2013 in which case, to quote one of an endless sea of tweets, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlieT62/status/760823084928688128\">\u201cUkip are finished \u2013 [because] Farage was Ukip\u201d</a>. And in any case, its entire reason for existing has been fulfilled. By overseeing Brexit and pushing the Tories away from Notting Hill and back to a petit-bourgeois populism, Theresa May could re-establish their complete dominance of the political right \u2013 while even if Labour fails to get its act together, the former Labour voters who supported Farage will either go back to abstaining, or vote Ukip in much smaller numbers.</p> <p>At which point, a few corrective thoughts. First, whatever the state of Ukip\u2019s internal affairs, the state of politics in both Europe and the US suggests that as economies and societies continue to fragment, and the mainstream seems to have no clear answers, the new rightwing populism is going be with us for some time to come.</p> <p>Second, given that the referendum happened only two months ago, it is worth at least briefly reflecting on the part Ukip played in the outcome. With a solitary MP and a flimsy activist base, it still played a huge role in embedding the connection between most of Britain\u2019s ills and the EU, and thereby carrying its cause from the margins of politics to its very centre. Here is an example of postmodern politics from which people on the left would do well to learn. Moreover, the people responsible are hardly likely to simply disappear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ukip\u2019s whole schtick has always been to insist that some things matter more than economics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there is the associated question of Brexit, and what it might actually entail (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d says the prime minister, but that hardly clarifies anything). Just as it is hard to know at this early stage what exactly will be the terms of any British departure, it\u2019s unclear where the vote for leave now sits in the minds of the people responsible. We are talking about England here, so the questions are valid: will it turn out to have been some Diana-esque spasm, after which everybody once again switches off? Or a matter of keenly felt conviction and expectations that people will demand are met?</p> <p>On this score, though it\u2019s painful to make the point, do not underestimate the centrality of immigration to the Brexit vote, and how irate a lot of people may get if the status quo persists \u2013 a point underlined by this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/net-migration-to-uk-fell-to-327000-in-past-year-figures-show\">net migration figures </a>(in the year to March 2016, 633,000 people arrived in the UK, while 306,000 moved overseas).</p> <p>More generally, there is still a sense of far too many of the political class thinking the vote can soon be nullified \u2013 witness the hapless Owen Smith claiming that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/24/owen-smith-labour-should-continue-to-fight-brexit\">we didn\u2019t actually know what we were voting on</a>\u201d and holding out the prospect of another referendum. If the Brexit vote was motivated by people\u2019s sense that Westminster either ignored them or failed to take them seriously, what does he think will happen if their one briefly successful protest is treated the same way?</p> <p>Political journalism too often overlooks the social nitty-gritty, and the way it pushes people in this or that direction far more than dramas at the top. Self-evidently, in the old Labour heartlands that still represent Ukip\u2019s biggest political opportunity \u2013 and to which Jeremy Corbyn and his followers still show few signs of convincingly speaking \u2013 the rise of Farage\u2019s party was fed by deep problems, which are unlikely to change. These barely need outlining: the fact that there is an ongoing housing crisis; that employment is ever-more insecure; that the cultural distance between a confident middle class at ease with globalisation and millions of others suffering its malign effects is growing ever larger. In addition, if one of the big sparks for Ukip\u2019s rise over the past 10 years was the impact of the economic crash of 2008, the turbulence that could yet result from Britain leaving the EU may have exactly the same results.</p> <p>Obviously, that would be an outrageous irony: the party that so enthusiastically pushed Britain out of the EU making hay with the adverse consequences. But to that, there are two answers: that politics has little time for paradox; and that in any case, Ukip\u2019s whole schtick has always been to insist that economics isn\u2019t everything, not least for people with precious little to lose. Farage restated the basic point this week: \u201cThere are some things in life that matter more than just money: your community, your street, your town, your neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>In the midst of all these possibilities lurks Arron Banks, the insurance tycoon who spent \u00a35.6m of his own money on the Brexit campaign, and who was recently heard speculating about either reforming Ukip \u201croot and branch\u201d, or funding a new populist party that may succeed it: a force that may have a chance of \u201ctaking over from Labour as the opposition, because Labour are imploding and Labour voters for the first time ever have defied their party, voting for leave\u201d. He is with Farage in the States.</p> <p>Which brings us to the recently retired leader himself. After working flat-out for upwards of a decade, to the point that he began to complain about his health, Farage might have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resignation-ukip-leader-brexit\">expected to disappear for a while</a>. And yet here he is again, evidently loving every minute, and saying he is minded to \u201csee where we are in two and a half years\u2019 time\u201d. To paraphrase that other suntanned populist, Arnold Schwarzenegger, he\u2019ll be back.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cI have lumps in my breasts, in my throat, and in my uterus.\u201d Halimeh spoke softly, but as she quickly uttered these words, I noticed an immense sadness in her dark brown eyes. We were sitting on the rocks near the ocean, wary of wild dogs barking nearby, and melting in the scorching heat of this remote Pacific island. I could feel her fear, so common for any woman in her 30s who checks her breasts in the morning and knows something isn\u2019t right.</p> <p>Halimeh fled Iran three years ago, after she said several of her friends got executed there, because they converted to Christianity, something that she wanted to do as well. She aimed for Australia \u2013 a country where she was hoping to find peace and freedom from religious persecution.</p> <p>Instead, after a gruelling journey through Malaysia and Indonesia, a dangerous ocean crossing on a smuggler\u2019s boat, and six months in immigration detention on Australia\u2019s Christmas Island, she got sent to Nauru \u2013 a tiny, remote island state where Australia has been for years banishing asylum seekers trying to reach its shores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many people around the world, I was repulsed last week by the sheer scale and inhumanity of the abuses and neglect documented in the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">Nauru files</a> expos\u00e9.</p> <p>But for me the leaks struck a particular chord since I had only last month witnessed these patterns of horrendous abuse with my own eyes. It brought back the thoughts about Halimeh and the other 57 people I interviewed during the week I spent on the island. Women, men and children with personal stories to make even the most emotionless readers shudder; people who fled wars, who lost family members and friends, who were tortured by repressive regimes, and who are now stuck on Nauru, in anguish and despair about their future.</p> <p>More than 1,200 women, men and children from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Afghanistan, spent months or years in appalling conditions in a detention camp funded by Australia. They lived in crowded, mouldy tents, where guards conducted regular, prison-like searches, and limited their showers to two minutes, before forcing them out.</p> <p>With no prospect of leaving this impoverished island \u2013 which is smaller than many airports I have travelled through \u2013 these hundreds of people are effectively facing a future of indefinite, arbitrary detention. As a result, they are breaking down physically and emotionally. Although I\u2019ve worked in most of the conflict zones around the world over the past 15 years, I have never seen such high rates of mental trauma, self-harm, and suicide attempts, among children as well as adults.</p> <p>Health problems are simply not being addressed. I spoke with people who suffered several heart attacks, major complications from diabetes, kidney diseases, untreated broken bones, and infections. In most cases, they only got blood tests and Panadol.</p> <p>Halimeh told me that in 2014 she was sent to Melbourne, and spent four months there, between an immigration detention camp and a hospital. \u201cMy doctor said I need surgery for my breasts,\u201d she said, her gaze fixated on the ocean in front of us. \u201cHe said I cannot go back [to Nauru], but the immigration decided to bring me back anyway.\u201d Her condition continued to deteriorate \u2013 in 2015 they sent her to Papua New Guinea for an endoscopy and a colonoscopy, which confirmed some of her medical problems ... and sent her back to Nauru again.</p> <p>Now the lumps are growing and she has a worrisome discharge from her breasts but Australia is denying her treatment or even a proper check-up.</p> <p>As unthinkable and inhumane as it sounds, this neglect appears to be part of life on Nauru. Australian politicians have been adamant that they will never allow the refugees sent to Nauru to settle in Australia. \u201cI feel they keep us as hostages,\u201d Halimeh said. \u201cThey make us suffer as an example to others who might think of fleeing to Australia.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s worse, as remote as Nauru is, it\u2019s actually much closer than one might think \u2013 right-wing European politicians have been touting the \u201cAustralian model\u201d of offshore asylum processing as a solution to the European refugee \u201ccrisis\u201d. Under the same pretext of \u201csaving lives,\u201d European countries are already closing borders, striking deals with states, such as Turkey, that cannot offer refugees adequate protection, and outsourcing their responsibilities.</p> <p>The latest detailed exposure of what this \u201cAustralian model\u201d is like in reality, which has received extensive coverage in Europe, is significant. For hundreds of refugees in Australia\u2019s offshore prisons, it brings renewed hope that Australia will finally fulfil its international obligations and allow them to settle in a place where they can get the assistance they need and the protection they deserve.</p> <p>For Halimeh, it means she might still get vital surgery and treatment before it\u2019s too late. And for any European state contemplating similar measures, it is a clear warning of just how wrong things go when fear and populist agendas are allowed to trample core humanitarian values and the international right to seek asylum.</p> <p><em>Anna Neistat is a senior director of research at Amnesty International. </em></p>"
