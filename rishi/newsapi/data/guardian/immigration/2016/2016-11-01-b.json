That should be a cracker and the outcome will decide the group. Arsenal can be confident, though. This was a big victory given that they made a dreadful start, conceding twice in the opening 15 minutes. Yet they demonstrated their character, levelling the game before the interval thanks to goals from Granit Xhaka and Olivier Giroud, and they\u2019ll be feeling pretty damn good about themselves before Sunday\u2019s game against Tottenham.

Ludogorets 2-3 Arsenal (Mesut Ozil, 87 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mesut Ozil has surely won it for Arsenal and sent them into the last 16 with a magnificent goal! Out of nowhere, he\u2019s released through the middle by Elneny, making an instant impact, Ludogorets getting it all wrong with a dismal attempt at an offside trap. Borjan hurtles out of his area and the ball is bouncing awkwardly. So Ozil simply scoops it over him with his left foot, a little like Messi against Arsenal in 2011, and advances towards the area. Two defenders are covering, though. So Ozil keeps his composure, drops the shoulder, shakes the hips, leaves both of them on their backsides, takes his sweet time about it and strokes it into the empty net! What a player!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b89866b4a5157e5b2af4c3b900e0bd04d6cce92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b89866b4a5157e5b2af4c3b900e0bd04d6cce92/0_0_1846_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mesut Ozil lobs goalkeeper Milan Borjan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mesut Ozil lobs goalkeeper Milan Borjan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bf1c0f87899d0150cf13faad3ccc602da0e7892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bf1c0f87899d0150cf13faad3ccc602da0e7892/0_0_1853_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ozil then puts two Ludogorets\u2019 defenders on the floor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ozil then puts two Ludogorets\u2019 defenders on the floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"768d8b5a3efd0061b096ce4cd5d791bef964dee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/768d8b5a3efd0061b096ce4cd5d791bef964dee5/0_0_2920_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"And Ozil slots home a brilliant late goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"493\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And Ozil slots home a brilliant late goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T22:03:31.476Z\">at 10.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581908b5e4b029b92ca447b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:27:31.745Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Granit Xhaka, on a yellow card, is replaced by Mohamed Elneny.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58190895e4b07ceadb3a1625\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:26:48.754Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>86 min: </b>Mohamed Elneny will be on in a minute.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58190812e4b07ceadb3a1622\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T21:25:07.418Z\">9.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>84 min: </strong>Minev\u2019s tame cross is easily claimed by Ospina.

Fine, it\u2019s not news. But that doesn\u2019t mean a chill didn\u2019t go down the spine of every sensible Arsenal supporter this morning. This, after all, has traditionally been the month when a few things start to go wrong in their season and a fine, encouraging start gives way to angst and anger and the occasional level-headed debate on ArsenalFanTV about whether Arsene Wenger is a TREACHEROUS DISGRACE WHO NEEDS TO GET OUT OF MY CLUB NOW or AN UNDISPUTED LEGEND WHO CAN DO NO WRONG. If Arsenal happen to lose to Ludogorets tonight, do keep an eye on YouTube later, it\u2019s bound to be entertaining.</p> <p>The stats aren\u2019t too encouraging. November has long been the worst month in Arsenal\u2019s season under Wenger, their points per game in the Premier League dropping to an average of 1.59. How to explain it? Some put it down to injuries, others say it\u2019s because they\u2019re too often gripped by the need to avert catastrophe in their Champions League group. Maybe it\u2019s a protest against daylight saving. Whatever the reason, though, they could do without another mini collapse this time, because they\u2019ve been building some impressive momentum since losing to Liverpool on the opening day of the season. Unbeaten in all competitions since that 4-3 defeat, they\u2019re level with Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, lead their Champions League group on goal difference and have been playing some scintillating football.</p> <p>Don\u2019t stop now. That\u2019ll be Wenger\u2019s message to his players. A big month begins with them taking on Ludogorets in Sofia and they need to keep accelerating. Victory over a side who were walloped 6-0 at the Emirates a fortnight ago will keep them above Paris Saint-Germain in the battle to win Group A, thus improving their chances of an easier draw in the last 16, and ensure that there\u2019s no loss of confidence before Sunday\u2019s North London derby. With games against Manchester United and PSG to come later this month, Arsenal can\u2019t afford to let bad habits creep back into their system. There haven\u2019t been too many signs of their focus dropping in recent weeks \u2013 but they would be foolish to approach this game with a complacent attitude. They might have thrashed Ludogorets in London, but the Bulgarians did create chances and can be tricky at home. This is Arsenal. Be careful when making predictions.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm GMT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/olivier-giroud-arsenal-wenger-ludogorets-champions-league\">Olivier Giroud ready to seize Arsenal moment as Wenger looks long-term</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T17:20:23.950Z\">at 5.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>All my faith in humanity was destroyed by <strong>Chasing Asylum: Inside Australia\u2019s Detention Camps</strong> (BBC4 Storyville, 9pm), a deeply shocking documentary directed by Academy award-winning filmmaker Eva Orner (Orner produced Alex Gibney\u2019s Taxi to the Dark Side). It filled me with rage and broke my heart. Focusing on the human cost of Australia\u2019s hardline policy of offshore detention, it takes us inside camps on Nauru and Manus where men, women, children and babies are detained indefinitely and no cameras or journalists are allowed. All footage was filmed secretly. And what unconscionable horrors it exposes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like the support worker who recalls seeing a sign about training staff to use a Hoffman knife, asking why, and being told it is to cut people down when they\u2019re found hanging. Or the repurposed second-world-war tin shed used to detain people in sweltering, squalid conditions. The detainees setting themselves on fire, stitching lips and eyelids shut. The allegations of physical and sexual abuse of children. The babies \u201cfailing to thrive\u201d. The graffiti scrawled above a line of payphones saying \u2018\u201ckill us\u201d\u2019. The fact that all this is being done as a deterrent, \u201cto make this place as horrible as possible\u201d as one ashamed ex-director of Nauru detention centre puts it, in order to put refugees off from seeking asylum in Australia. To \u201cstop the boats\u201d, as the slogan goes. </p> <p>Chasing Asylum is one of the most important, distressing and necessarily relentless documentaries I have seen this year. The others are the unforgettable trio of BBC films, Exodus, made using hidden cameras given to refugees crossing Europe. That secret filming was required in both cases shows how badly those in power do not want these stories told. I can see why: together these documentaries form the most damning indictment imaginable of the way we treat people in desperate need. Everyone, but especially those in power endorsing the policies that make such living hells possible, should watch them.</p>",

  "<p>Ukip leadership favourite Paul Nuttall has praised Nigel Farage\u2019s controversial anti-migrant poster, saying it made an \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d point that there is a \u201cdeluge of people coming from the Middle East\u201d.<br></p> <p>Nuttall, the former deputy leader, backed the poster during a hustings event for Ukip leadership candidates on radio station LBC, which descended into bickering and acrimony over issues ranging from homophobia to the death penalty.</p> <p>\u201cThe point behind that poster was absolutely correct. We do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the Middle East. And the EU\u2019s idea of a common asylum policy isn\u2019t the route to go down,\u201d he said when asked for his views on the campaign image.</p> <p>He also said there had only been a slight increase in hate crime following Brexit, while arguing that it was not out of the ordinary because it \u201chappens after any national event\u201d.</p> <p>A different position was taken by Suzanne Evans, the former deputy chairman of the party, who said the poster was unnecessary though not racist.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it. I thought it was insensitive and ill judged,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The poster, which Farage unveiled during the EU referendum campaign, showed a queue of mostly non-white migrants and refugees with the slogan \u201cBreaking point: the EU has failed us all\u201d. It was condemned at the time by an array of politicians from leading Brexiter Michael Gove to former chancellor George Osborne.<br></p> <p>The leadership contest was triggered by Farage\u2019s departure after the referendum and then the refusal of Diane James to serve after she was elected the new Ukip leader in the first race to succeed him.</p> <p>The candidates were mostly in agreement about the need to unite the party after a year of bitter infighting but there were palpable tensions during the hustings, largely directed at John Rees-Evans, the least known of the four candidates, who hit the headlines in 2014 for claiming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/22/gay-donkey-rapists-other-odddities-how-ukip-keeps-going-off-message\">a gay donkey tried to rape his horse</a>.</p> <p>He clashed with LBC presenter Iain Dale after he criticised Evans for calling for a Ukip assembly candidate to be axed for branding LGBT activists the \u201cGaystapo\u201d.<br></p> <p> \u201cIt is entirely acceptable for a Ukip candidate to have any views that he likes,\u201d said Rees-Evans, who called for members to set party policies through direct democracy.</p> <p>He also suggested he could back the death penalty for paedophiles convicted of sexual crimes with prepubescent children.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be some pretty strict criteria in terms of the burden of evidence but yes ... In the case of specifically paedophiles and child killers,\u201d he said, adding that it would not for example apply to someone convicted of a sexual crime with a teenager who looked 18 but was actually 15 and a half.</p> <p>Nuttall said he would vote in a referendum on the death penalty for it to apply to child murderers such as Ian Huntley, while Evans and Peter Whittle said they did not support the death penalty.</p> <p>Nuttall, who is the strong favourite to win, had one of the toughest messages about the party\u2019s future, saying it was \u201cpeering over a political cliff\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI will be the candidate who keeps Ukip on the pitch,\u201d Nuttall said, calling for the party to replace Labour as the UK\u2019s main patriotic party of working people.</p> <p>At a later hustings for Ukip members in Westminster, both he and Evans made rallying calls for the immediate revocation of the European Communities Act, saying it was necessary to hold Theresa May to account on delivering a real Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWe want our borders back and we want our fish back as well,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>Peter Whittle said he thought the country was \u201cunder a sort of attack\u201d and it was imperative to uphold British values by challenging sharia law and eradicating female genital mutilation.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole advance of radical Islam ... Who is the party that has time and time again stood up and said what people really believe about this?\u201d he added.</p> <p>Nuttall struck a similar tone, calling for sharia law to be outlawed from UK towns and cities and a ban on Saudi Arabian funding for mosques.</p> <p>On immigration, Evans said she supported the return of the primary purpose rule abolished by Labour requiring Brits with foreign spouses to prove that citizenship was not the main point of their marriage. She also called for immigrants to be able to support themselves and their families for five years and have a job before they enter the country.</p> <p>She said there was a need for Britishness to be emphasised in schools, claiming that Shakespeare is taught as a \u201cglobal playwright\u201d who comes from nowhere in particular.</p>",

  "<p>Rioting broke out among teenagers on the site of the largely cleared Calais camp, hours before they were due to be taken from the site in buses to undisclosed locations around France.</p> <p>About 20 police riot vans arrived early on Tuesday evening and teargas was used to quell fighting and protests among the remaining estimated 1,500 asylum seekers, most of whom are teenagers.</p> <p>The violence came at the end of a day of mounting tension after minors were told that they were to be removed to \u201cjuvenile centres\u201d across France on Wednesday morning. Those with family in the UK, or who have specific vulnerabilities that may make them eligible to claim asylum in the UK, were told that their applications would be processed from the new locations.</p> <p>The Calais prefecture issued a notice in nine languages informing the people still living in disused shipping containers on the site of the now-demolished camp that they needed to register for wristbands, securing them a place on the buses which will begin leaving at 8am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"077c8d2336c57009a373d4248246021a643964e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077c8d2336c57009a373d4248246021a643964e7/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A riot policeman patrols close to where 1,500 minors are being housed in converted shipping containers in Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A riot policeman patrols close to where 1,500 minors are being housed in converted shipping containers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British officials would be on the buses, accompanying the asylum-seeking children, the notice added. \u201cNo further applications for transfer to the United Kingdom will be dealt with in Calais,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAll cases will be handled and all departures for the UK will take place from the juvenile centres.\u201d</p> <p>The absence of any detail about the destination of the buses caused great anxiety among the child refugees. By the fenced-off container area of the site, there were hundreds of people milling around, most of whom were very confused about what was planned.</p> <p>Aladdin Adam, 16, from Sudan, had been given a wristband marked 33 and had been told to be ready at 8am. \u201cI am so worried. I don\u2019t know where I will be going. Everyone is feeling worried; some people are feeling angry,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That anger erupted into protests as dusk fell and large groups of teenage migrants made their way from the shipping containers into the deserted camp, carrying sticks and shouting. Some vehicles\u2019 windows were smashed and some asylum seekers were reported to have been injured.</p> <p>Among the remaining camp population there were a smaller number of 11 or 12-year-olds but the majority seemed to be slightly older teenagers, perhaps aged between 15 and 17. There were a few visibly older people claiming to be minors, who appeared to be leading the protests.</p> <p>There was anger from volunteers, who have worked with the younger Calais residents for the past year, that the children had been left behind after the adult population was taken last week to accommodation around France.</p> <p>Michael McHugh, who worked with unaccompanied child refugees, said he was dismayed to find more riot police on site than social workers, teachers or therapists. \u201cThese are some of the most vulnerable children in Europe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tina Brocklebank, from Help Refugees, said: \u201cIf it had been up to us we would have got the most vulnerable children out first. They are completely at risk and vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>This final large-scale transfer may be the last major stage of the Calais camp clearances. Throughout the day trucks were taking away debris from the camp, crushing tents and wooden shacks, and the grinding noise of bulldozers was audible throughout the camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49649dd12c316899b38fb1406dca850aea838682\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49649dd12c316899b38fb1406dca850aea838682/0_202_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of earthmoving equipment at work on the site of the Calais camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of earthmoving equipment at work on the site of the Calais camp on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wasil Anwari, 14, who said he fled Afghanistan earlier this year after both his parents were killed, showed a purple wristband marked Bus 30. He said he had been given no information about where in France they were going to be taken. He was hoping to be given papers allowing him to come to the UK eventually, so that he could join his uncle, who works in a shop in London.</p> <p>Some people thought that the buses were going to take them straight to London; others thought they would be driven to Lille. \u201cWe aren\u2019t given a choice. We will go somewhere in France, but we don\u2019t know where,\u201d Wasil said.</p> <p>Noorullah Hussaini, 17, from Afghanistan, also had a purple wristband and was preparing to leave on a bus on Wednesday. He said he hoped that his application to join his sister in Manchester would eventually be successful, after a 30-minute interview with Home Office officials in the camp last week.</p> <p>\u201cThey told me it would take between two weeks and two months,\u201d he said. He said he hoped to study to become a dentist in the UK. Because he was confident that his request would be granted, he said he was not trying to come illegally to the UK on the back of lorries. But several other young people said they were continuing the night-time attempts to head to England by smuggling themselves into vehicles, convinced that this was the best option for them to rejoin family in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go legally. There are too many dangers on the lorries,\u201d Noorullah said.</p> <p>Children were carrying belongings in plastic bin bags, many of them wearing flip-flops and shorts in the November weather.</p> <p>The cleanup continued around them, as workers gathered abandoned duvets hanging in the trees, half-burnt tents and singed blankets submerged in the sand.</p> <p>Digena Gesesew, 17, from Ethiopia, was with friends, washing some clothes in a bucket and hanging them on the fencing to dry. \u201cThe bus will leave at 8 tomorrow morning. I don\u2019t know where we will go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>The French authorities declared the cleanup complete on Monday, but at the edges of the camp small clusters of tent remained, with people living in them. The president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said on Tuesday that an increased police presence around the camp would ensure that people were not able to return. But there were new arrivals, some from an informal migrant camp in Paris, who had come to see if they could find space on a coach to London.</p> <p>Ben Teuten, the co-founder of Refugee Youth Service, a charity that has looked after minors in the camp for the past year, said he was disappointed by the lack of clear information for young people. \u201cAll the decisions have been quite poorly communicated. The children are very confused and scared. The children are left not knowing what their status is. We have a real concern that many have been given false hope when we know a lot of them won\u2019t be going to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was worried that a lot of the children would disappear from the French children\u2019s centres once it became clear that there was little prospect of them being transferred legally to the UK.</p>",

Giving evidence to a committee this morning, he said there probably won\u2019t be a war with Russia next year.</p> <p>The Press Association has the story.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fears that Russia and Nato are on a collision course for war next year have been dismissed by defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon. </p> <p>Fallon insisted that a hot conflict with Moscow was not likely in 2017, as he gave evidence to the Commons defence committee. </p> <p>Pressed about warnings by former Nato deputy allied commander in Europe, General Sir Richard Shirreff, that the plot of his novel 2017 War With Russia was plausible, Fallon said that was an extreme view. </p> <p>\u201cWell, there are a lot of people writing books and trying to sell them, and his is a very good one. However, I don\u2019t agree that war with Russia is likely next year. I think that is too extreme. </p> <p>\u201cWe have seen much greater Russian aggression this year, and in previous years, in terms of long-range aviation, in terms of submarine activity, and the carrier task group that sailed through our waters, the role of Russia in Syria, and elsewhere. But I don\u2019t think that presages an open conflict next year. </p> <p>\u201cAnd I hope that General Shirreff would - and I think he does this - recognise that Nato is now responding. So, Nato is waking up to the challenge,\u201d Fallon said. </p> <p>The defence secretary insisted the decision to send 800 British troops to Estonia next year was intended to create an \u201cearlier tripwire\u201d and act as a deterrent against possible aggression. </p> <p>\u201cThe whole point of forward deployment to Estonia is to arrange, if you like, an earlier tripwire so the force there doesn\u2019t have to wait for tension to escalate. The force will be there from next spring in any event, in all three of the Baltic states. It\u2019s partly reassurance, but it\u2019s also deterrence - to make it very clear to any potential aggressor that Nato is ready to respond.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Astute readers will, of course, realise that the very fact that a \u2018no war next year\u2019 declaration has become newsworthy is itself a matter of some concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b4273636bc65af1108d84b33c6959042a585d1e/0_4_1773_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Michael Fallon arriving for cabinet at Number 10 this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5818ab91e4b01c528432f015\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:50:18.136Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is <strong>Ed Miliband</strong>, the former Labour leader, on Karen Bradley\u2019s statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/793464579250647040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DC, NC and I signed pledge to support Section 40 on costs.

Both involve unwinding significant elements of Leveson, the inquiry set up with cross-party support in the Commons after the phone-hacking scandal, and in truth neither is particularly surprising, although there is one line in the small print that is intriguing.</p> <p><strong>1 - Bradley has confirmed that the government may shelve part two of the Leveson inquiry, the bit that was intended to examine in detail allegations of phone hacking and collusion with the police at News International and other newspaper organisations. </strong>Although part one of the inquiry covered phone hacking, it did not consider allegations in details because at that stage prosecutions were pending. When David Cameron launched the inquiry, he specifically said that a second stage would investigate what happened in detail once the police investigations were over.<br></p> <p>All the key prosecutions have now concluded. Bradley has now launched a consultation on whether to press ahead with part two of the inquiry although the chances of part two actually proceeding are probably no higher than nil. When David Cameron was prime minister it was widely reported that part two would be permanently shelved. Theresa May may seem less interested in schmoozing the media than Cameron, but she is not daft and it is very hard to see why she would want to launch an inquiry that would trigger all-out war with powerful, Conservative-supporting newspaper groups, especially News UK, the successor to News International.</p> <p><strong>2 - Bradley has announced that she will consult on whether or not to implement section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013.</strong> This is also unsurprising. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f#block-58188023e4b01c528432ef0f\">12.59am.)</a> But what\u2019s interesting is that Bradley is consulting on four options: keeping section 40 under review, bringing it in, repealing it, or partially introducing it. It was never likely that Bradley would introduce it, and her comments in the chamber (see, for example, what she said about Peter Preston\u2019s column at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/01/guardianicm-poll-gives-tories-16-point-lead-over-labour-politics-live?page=with:block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2#block-58189d5ae4b01c528432efc2\">1.50pm)</a> suggest implementation is not a runner. But she has also included the option of partially introducing part 40 - introducing the \u201ccarrot\u201d (exemption from costs for papers that lose a court case, if they are signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator) but shelving the \u201cstick\u201d (forcing papers to pay their opponents\u2019 costs even if they win, if they are not signed up to a Leveson-compliant regulator). This would benefit the small number of organised that belong to IMPRESS. Papers signed up to IPSO would probably complain if Bradley were to choose this option (and there is no particular reason to think she will) but doing this would allow her to claim she is salvaging one more vestige of Leveson.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T08:27:24.739Z\">at 8.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5818a1f4e4b01c528432efdc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T14:09:15.796Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bradley\u2019s statement is now over.

It is expected that she will use the statement to unpick one of the consequences of the Leveson report into phone hacking.</p> <p>The Leveson report was published in November 2012 and it recommended a tighter form of press regulation. The newspaper industry accepted the need for some reform, but it strongly opposed anything smacking of state regulation and, after much haggling, a compromise system was adopted. A royal charter was granted in 2013 and that led to the establishment of a Press Recognition Panel (PRP) which has the job of approving Leveson-compliant press regulators. Most national newspaper groups decided not to cooperate with this system and support the Independent Press Standards Organisation, an independent regulator. But a few publications signed up to IMPRESS, an alternative regulator, and last week IMPRESS became the first regulator to get PRP approval.</p> <p>This is significant because, one a PRP-approved regulator is in place, section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is supposed to come into force. This section, passed with cross-party support, is designed to provide \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d incentives to newspapers to sign up to a PRP-approved regulator. The carrot is that papers that belong to such a regulator won\u2019t have to pay the costs of claimants if they get sued for libel, even if the paper loses. The stick applies to papers that don\u2019t belong to such a regulator; under section 40, they will have to pay the costs of people who sue them, even if the paper wins.</p> <p>But section 40 only comes into force if the government activates it. As you can imagine, the prospect of this happening has alarmed the newspaper industry. Bradley has already said that she will take her time before deciding what to do, and in a few minutes we will learn more.</p> <p>Section 40 is not the only stick in the Crime and Courts Act 20113. Section 34, which is already in force, allows the courts to impose exemplary damages (ie, extra, punitive damages, on top of normal libel damages) against newspapers that have not joined a PRP-approved regulator. But exemplary damages are relatively unusual, and so far this section has not caused any problems for newspapers outside the Leveson framework.</p> <p>There is more on this topic<a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7576/CBP-7576.pdf\"> in this House of Commons library briefing paper (pdf).</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0520dd0d693620dfb607977c470352249fd20e19/0_149_5242_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Bradley, the culture secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58189107e4b01c528432ef7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T12:58:27.284Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Dennis Skinner </strong>asks why, if more than 30 years is too long to make an inquiry worthwhile, why it is not long enough to justify the release of some cabinet papers about the strike.

And Labour continues to flounder.

  "<p>Recent warnings about Russia\u2019s behaviour have become as numerous as they have been, at times, alarmist. Which isn\u2019t to say they are unfounded. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/31/andrew-parker-increasingly-aggressive-russia-a-growing-threat-to-uk-says-mi5-head\" title=\"\">director general of MI5 in a Guardian interview has now added his voice</a> to a widening group of western officials who describe Russia as a threat, and against which new thinking must be developed. In the past months, Russia has been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-07/u-s-confirms-russia-behind-hacking-attacks-to-disrupt-elections\" title=\"\">accused of trying to disrupt the US election through hacking</a>, it has deployed nuclear-capable missiles in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/russia-confirms-deployment-of-nuclear-capable-missiles-to-kaliningrad\" title=\"\">Kaliningrad</a> and flown bomber planes across Europe. Moscow has pursued policies in Syria that have less to do with fighting Isis than with carpet bombing civilians.</p> <p>If Vladimir Putin\u2019s narrative is to make Russia great again, there is by now little doubt he will resort to a wide spectrum of actions, both hard and soft power, to attain that goal. That western officials have been repeatedly caught off-guard says perhaps as much about the illusions or shortfalls of past \u201creset\u201d policies as it does about the slickness with which the Kremlin has learned, over the years, to read western societies and the way their leaders react \u2013 or fail to. More than a decade ago Mr Putin revealed his thinking in an annual address to parliament comparing the US to a Russian folk tale character, remarking: <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-11/news/0605110171_1_russian-president-vladimir-putin-military-spending-parties\" title=\"\">\u201cComrade wolf knows who to eat.\u201d</a> Few, at the time, could have predicted what would unfold: the first redrawing of borders in Europe through use of force since the second world war (annexation of Crimea), and a pattern of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/cold-war-20-how-russia-and-the-west-reheated-a-historic-struggle\" title=\"\">geopolitical confrontation that some have dubbed cold war 2.0</a>.</p> <p>The Kremlin believes the time has come to seek a form of revenge on the west for having \u201chumiliated\u201d Russia after the dissolution of the USSR. That Russia\u2019s economic collapse in the 1990s and the enlargement of Nato and the EU resulted from decades of communist mismanagement and the legitimate aspirations of nations factors little into this vision. Today the west and Russia find themselves talking past each other on almost all issues. Putin\u2019s propaganda machine has made inroads into the west by exploiting its openness, all the while repressing those who, inside Russia, dare dissent.</p> <p>What is to be done to avoid escalation? Talk of nuclear confrontation has become commonplace in Russia, something that points to the need for renewed deterrence. Making sure eastern European allies are protected is not provocation. Nato\u2019s new deployments in the Baltic region and Poland are a reaction to, and not the cause of, Russia\u2019s military adventurism in its neighbourhood. The best way to discourage more Russian revisionism is to make clear that red lines will be defended. Europe can ill afford to let the worst of the 20th century catch up with it in the 21st century. On wider international issues, pressure must be applied wherever it is smart and effective to do so. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/spain-reviews-plan-to-let-russian-warships-refuel-en-route-to-syria\" title=\"\">Spain\u2019s recent refusal to refuel</a> Russia\u2019s aircraft carrier on its way to Syria was an example of how to catch Moscow\u2019s attention. Sanctions over Moscow\u2019s activity in Ukraine should be kept in place until ceasefire requirements are met. Europeans would do well to forge a common response to Russian policies in Syria, which should be seen as part of a wider pattern: chaos on Europe\u2019s doorstep, including refugee movements, serves Mr Putin\u2019s interests because they feed the illiberal forces of which he approves.</p> <p>This is not to say Russia must be quarantined, nor its leader entirely shunned. Partly what matters is language. Speaking of Russia as a \u201cpartner\u201d no longer equates to realities, if only because Moscow consistently relinquishes genuine cooperation and openly casts itself as an alternative, hostile model no longer very interested in international rules. Diplomacy without leverage can be empty choreography, as talks over Syria have shown. Nor should Russia\u2019s power be exaggerated. Its economy is ailing. It has few allies, with China an awkward friend. Mr Putin may choose to designate external enemies and encourage a fortress mentality for domestic consumption, but that does little to bring the investments his country badly needs if it is ever to modernise. The Russian president has shrewdly exploited whatever gaps western powers have offered him, whether through neglect, divisiveness or miscalculation. Mr Putin once said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/06/chechnya.russia2\" title=\"\">\u201cthe weak get beaten\u201d</a>. He believes the west is weak, hypocritical and decadent. The short-term answer should be a resolute show of transatlantic unity \u2013 a question that hangs over the US election. Dialogue with Russia should come with smart leverage \u2013 neither aggressive nor complacent. It\u2019s likely the Russian question will not go away for a long time yet \u2013 Mr Putin plans to get re-elected in 2018.</p>",

The squished-together, hoicked-up presentation of bosoms has all but vanished from fashionable circles. Scaffolding breasts under the chin and framing them with a low-cut top, which has for decades been a shorthand for allure \u2013 the four-four-two of getting dressed up for a night out, if you like \u2013 is over. The go-to after dark neckline from catwalk to high street this year is a straight horizontal line that exposes the shoulders. The must-have Gucci blouses on Net-a-Porter have elaborate pussy bows that demand to be fastened around the neck. Any self-respecting It girl of the moment knows that the photo the paparazzi want is the one in gym leggings and a crop top, exposing this year\u2019s must-have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/14/ab-crack-taylor-swift-serena-williams\">ab-crack</a>. Eva Herzigov\u00e1, whose 1994 Wonderbra advert (\u201cHello Boys\u201d) did more than any other image to put cleavage at the bullseye of sex appeal, has this year chosen for her most high-profile appearances a pie-crust collared white blouse under a trouser suit for the Vogue centenary party, and a buttoned-up denim coord at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a>.

I mean, I\u2019m all for looking on the bright side, but when a recent survey by Dove found that just <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dove-research-finds-beauty-pressures-up-and-women-and-girls-calling-for-change-583743391.html\">20% of women in the UK</a> are confident about how their body looks, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite ready to punch the air and say: \u201cHurrah, thank goodness all those issues about women\u2019s plummeting body image are solved.\u201d Women are as critical of their physical selves as ever, and as likely to spend their time and money on bodily self-improvement. But when it comes to buying bras, that money is no longer spent on structures that create the once all-important effect of two extra large scoops of ice-cream upholstered by scalloped lace. A third of Net-A-Porter bra sales are now soft bras, without underwire. Elle Macpherson has returned to the lingerie market with a range that foregrounds comfortable, triangle-shaped bras, citing research that shows young women prefer this type of lingerie. Even Victoria\u2019s Secret, spiritual home of the pneumatic cleavage, is marketing a new range of \u201cbralettes\u201d without underwire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23167374d820868abcc41652c42bcff7db4bb9d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23167374d820868abcc41652c42bcff7db4bb9d4/0_0_3062_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eva Herzigov\u00e1\u2019s 1994 Wonderbra advert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eva Herzigov\u00e1\u2019s 1994 Wonderbra advert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Contract Number (Programme)/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not, to be clear, about an anything-goes era. There is still very definitely an ideal, when it comes to bosoms. But what Naomi Wolf once dubbed the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/1487595\">official breast</a>\u201d looks different now than it did in the first heyday of cosmetic surgery. The new look is what fashion insiders, with their wilful clinging to the fashion singular, have long dubbed \u201ca 70s boob\u201d, for its aesthetic connection to the soft-focus, earthy femininity of that decade. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jane-birkin\">Jane Birkin</a> in a cotton T-shirt, or Michelle Pfeiffer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarface\">Scarface</a> (1983, but still). It is also Elizabeth Debicki in this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager\">The Night Manager</a>, all swan-like neck and clavicle and sweeping cream satin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Victoria\u2019s Secret, spiritual home of the pneumatic cleavage, is marketing a new range of 'bralettes' without underwire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As anyone who has known the particularly grating discomfort of wire digging into soft flesh will testify, the demise of the push-up bra is a step in the right direction, even if it is not a happy ending. The cleavage\u2019s function as an essential part of looking glamorous but a barrier to being taken seriously in a professional context was a tiny, irritating example of the kind of double standards with which women endlessly have to deal. And the body parts that are being showcased instead \u2013 shoulders, upper arms and abs, for the most part \u2013 might not be attainable by all, but at least they speak of strength and action, rather than the quivering spectacle of a trophy cleavage. The way one presents to the world is always a power play: a statement about what you can offer, and what you expect in return. Breasts piled together like a pair of cream buns do not make a subtle statement, to that effect \u2013 a fact that Wonderbra nailed, back in 1994, in the way that only the straightforward wording of ads can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0efff537fab2c370a9fccebbfacd0a8f4beee4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0efff537fab2c370a9fccebbfacd0a8f4beee4f5/0_0_1880_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new 70s boob look: Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"993\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new 70s boob look: Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look a little closer, however, and there is a subtle but significant difference between the 70s boob of the actual 1970s, and the new 70s boob. The new version is not so much natural, as faux-natural. It may not be hoicked, but it is certainly perky. The look is as much about breasts that don\u2019t need a bra, as it is about not wearing a bra. In celebrity-ville, there are a lot of cosmetically enhanced breasts, and cosmetically enhanced breasts do not need bras. In this way, the goalposts of the perfect body have been moved, once again. Cosmetic surgery has a insidious impact on the beauty and fashion industries. Just as the effect of rhinoplasty and fillers is aped by Superdrug counters bulging with cheap contouring creams, so the rise of silicone buoyancy has created a new market for lace bralettes. The end of cleavage does not mean the path to a more realistic, more diverse, more empowering world of female body image has got any easier. But at least we get to make the journey in more comfortable underwear.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2016 to correct the spelling of \u201csilicone buoyancy\u201d.</p>",

Still, to stand before the painting today is to marvel at the particularity of its light: at the gloamy incandescence that falls on the petals and dress-folds and soft-dipped faces; at the lanterns that glow a shrill and ferocious orange.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"828a0b5005df7810c8770953b23fe04ef6fc3373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/828a0b5005df7810c8770953b23fe04ef6fc3373/0_0_2400_2706/887.jpg\" alt=\"Gloamy incandescence ...

It\u2019s there, too, in the stories we tell ourselves of sun deities, star signs, eclipses; in the solemnity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/dec/23/hanukkah-celebrations-around-world-in-pictures\">candles lit for Hannukah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2015/nov/11/diwali-festival-of-lights-in-pictures-kolkata\">Diwali</a>, Christmas; in our celebration of May mornings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/21/is-this-the-most-british-summers-day-ever\">solstices</a>, in the great heights we scale just to see the sun rise or set.</p> <p>There is a sweetness in the way we shape our lives around light \u2013 in the places we choose to live and work and travel, in the simple rituals of dimmer switch, chandelier, table lamp, in the way we seek out the precise ratio of sky to earth that pleases us.</p> <p>I have lived in the half-gloom of basement flats, in the deep, damp darkness of the countryside and the restless glow of the city. I have found myself drawn to Florida, California, New Mexico, to Cornwall and Provence and Kent, just to see how the light sits. I have learned that the light I love best has a softness and a giddiness, a sense of warmth and mischief.</p> <p>Today then I live in a tall building beside the sea. Some years before Sargent painted his Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, JMW Turner \u2013 that \u201cpainter of light\u201d declared the skies here \u201cthe loveliest in all Europe,\u201d and from my window I watch them move above the harbour, the day\u2019s soft shift of light from the the milk-wash of morning to the mild hysteria of sunset.

Because no matter the matches struck, the switches flipped, the elaborate way we may dress it up in expensive shades and fancy glass bulbs, hang paper lanterns in flower gardens or fling it out into night skies in bursts of gunpowder and flame, our relationship with light will always be in some way unmet and unconsummated. As Rebecca Solnit once wrote of the colour blue, \u201cSome things cannot be owned.\u201d Rather, light lies a bedfellow of music, electricity, love, as one of the great impalpable joys of life, a cause for celebration and wonder, a source of endless desire.</p>",
  "<p>Liam Fox\u2019s hopes of securing a trade deal with the European Union before Brexit have been dealt a blow by a leading member of the European parliament, who insists no deal can be struck until the UK has left the bloc.</p> <p>Danuta H\u00fcbner, a former Polish minister who became the country\u2019s first European commissioner, said it would not be possible for the UK to conclude a trade deal while still an EU member.</p> <p>Now an MEP, she chairs the European parliament\u2019s constitutional affairs committee, which will be responsible for vetting any post-Brexit free-trade agreement with the UK.<br></p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, she stressed negotiations on Britain\u2019s EU exit under article 50, due to begin next year, would be on a different track to talks on the future relationship.<br></p> <p>\u201cFormally you cannot conclude or even negotiate the agreement that belongs to a third-country situation while you are still a member.

A trade deal would be \u201cchallenging\u201d to agree, she added, because it requires unanimity from all EU member states. The article 50 exit talks, which cover unwinding 43 years of the UK\u2019s EU membership, require only majority agreement among other member states.</p> <p>But the Polish politician was clear that the British withdrawal agreement would have to specify whether the UK was heading for hard or soft Brexit. This is in line with article 50, <a href=\"http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html\">which states</a> that the exit agreement shall take into account \u201cthe framework for [the the departing state\u2019s] future relationship with the union\u201d. </p> <p>The MEP said: \u201cOur major challenge is how to ensure that between the withdrawal agreement and the future agreement there is no legal vacuum.\u201d</p> <p>As the British government weighs up its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/nissan-eu-tariff-free-brexit-sunderland\">options on the single market and customs union</a>, the EU machinery is whirring into gear to prepare for the launch of Brexit talks in spring 2017.<br></p> <p>Officially, the European parliament has no place at the negotiating table, but its consent is needed to seal the article 50 deal and any new status agreement with Brexit Britain. </p> <p>Preparations go well beyond the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/guy-verhofstadt-diehard-european-to-lead-brexit-talks-for-european-parliament\">Guy Verhofstadt</a>, former Belgian prime minister and leader of the Liberal bloc, as the parliament\u2019s spokesman on the Brexit process.

But she is not convinced a hard Brexit is inevitable and predicted that economic arguments would win out over demands for curbs on immigration. </p> <p>She predicted a shift from \u201cpurely political considerations\u201d towards a stance that takes greater account of the economic repercussions of Brexit.

  "<p>The Calais camp lies in limbo, with most of its inhabitants long gone. Those who remain face hardship beyond anything the camp has previously known. Before, there was shelter \u2013 now hundreds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/operation-to-clear-calais-refugee-camp-finishes-ahead-of-schedule\" title=\"\">sleep on the fringes of its dirt tracks</a>. Before, there was at least some sense of ease \u2013 now shocked and abandoned refugees live in a state of constant tension. Fire is a constant threat, and the bulldozers are coming.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/operation-to-clear-calais-refugee-camp-finishes-ahead-of-schedule\" title=\"\">Volunteers grapple</a> not only with the urgency of the situation, but also with the knowledge that it should \u2013 and easily could \u2013 have been prevented.</p> <p>When the French authorities began the registration and resettlement of refugees, those of us involved felt an initial sense of relief. But after three days of relatively smooth action the warehouse where the registration took place closed its doors. It did not open them again. This was despite previous assurances that all refugees would be accommodated. Those left behind had no chance of safely reaching asylum centres. Most minors, registered separately, were confined to a fenced-in yard and housed in shipping containers. The rest were left homeless alongside the adult population of the camp.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/28/where-next-the-last-days-of-the-calais-refugee-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k29\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2848995\"            data-video-name=\"Where next?

The last days of the Calais refugee camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Why did the system not provide for all? How could any state leave children without shelter \u2013 and in some of the most dangerous circumstances in western Europe?</p> <p>Despite being provided with up-to-date and detailed census information from my organisation, Help Refugees, and the local charity, <a href=\"http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/\" title=\"\">l\u2019Auberge des Migrants</a>, the authorities chose not to take heed of these estimates. The 50-person, four-day census operation identified exact numbers of men, women, and children within the camp, and put the total population at 10,188. Though promised over 12,000 spaces in accommodation centres throughout France, almost 2,000 refugees have been abandoned once again by an uncaring government, and are left behind in the ruins of the Calais camp.</p> <p>Over two weeks ago Help Refugees warned authorities at a local tribunal in Lille that housing minors in the \u201ccontainer camp\u201d would be tantamount to exposing them to fire, violence, and extreme trauma. My colleague\u2019s words went unheeded, and now seem almost prophetic. There are now approximately 1,500 children subjected to these conditions.</p> <p>Children housed in the containers report choking on the smoke that blows in from their burning former homes. They say there is no drinking water, that the toilets are never cleaned and the showers are not working. Food is served only from 3pm to 5pm, and there is only one meal a day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no drinking water. The toilets are never cleaned. The showers are not working. There is only one meal a day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HelpRefugeesUK/videos/329853420708671/\" title=\"\">The authorities have utterly failed</a> to safeguard these young people, and show little to no regard for their wellbeing, health, or mental states. The children in this camp are starved of care and attention, and are in constant danger. Their treatment is not just neglectful \u2013 it\u2019s abuse.</p> <p>The lack of organisation has permeated every aspect of these children\u2019s lives. The crippling hunger pangs reported by many are alleviated only when groups of volunteers are allowed to distribute food. Without an identification wristband, children are not permitted to use the few still-working shower facilities \u2013 a fact made worse by the decision of the authorities to register some children without providing wristbands.</p> <p>Arbitrary security measures mean that services such as the <a href=\"http://refugeeinfobus.com/\" title=\"\">Refugee Info Bus</a> \u2013 founded by long-term volunteers to provide refugees with WiFi and legal services \u2013 are barred from approaching the container camp, cutting the children off from means of communication and legal assistance. With this, and the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/human-rights-lawyers-blocked-calais-jungle-demolition-refugees-state-emergency-french-authorities-a7386031.html\" title=\"\">recent banning of human rights lawyers</a> acting as observers from entry into the camp, it is feared that the mistreatment of the camp\u2019s children will go unchecked.</p> <p>Volunteers are banned from putting up tents to house the homeless adult and child refugees outside the container camps, in yet another example of the restrictions that serve only to further endanger refugees\u2019 lives. With a large portion of the camp in flames, many are sleeping on the dunes surrounding the camp, exposed to the rain, the cold, and the people smugglers.</p> <p>Despite desperate conditions and daily heartbreak, the volunteers of Help Refugees and other organisations continue to provide food, water, and some comfort to the refugees who are left. Many volunteers are from the UK, and express their devastation that their country is not answering France\u2019s calls and the refugee children it is failing \u2013 at present, it seems unlikely that the UK will take in more than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\" title=\"\">274 children</a> it already has. Many other volunteers are French, and must bear witness, distraught, to their nation\u2019s mistreatment of refugees already so weakened by months of subsistence in the camp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/operation-to-clear-calais-refugee-camp-finishes-ahead-of-schedule\">Calais: fears grow for dozens of children amid chaotic camp shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 1 November charities operating within the camp received notice from the French authorities promising that all children in the container camp would be transferred by bus to accommodation centres across France this week. A representative from the UK Home Office on each bus will ensure that any children legally eligible for asylum within the UK are able to apply for transfer to the UK. It is unknown how long this legal process will take.</p> <p>This is a testament to the work of the volunteers and legal workers in the camp, and presents an opportunity for these children to leave behind the trauma and misery of life in a refugee camp. However, there are no guarantees, and charities must continue to work to ensure that refugees throughout France are given a far better standard of care than was provided for the children of the Calais container camp.</p> <p>\u2022 To donate, support, or to find out more, please visit <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\" title=\"\">www.helprefugees.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.calaiskitchens.net/\" title=\"\">www.calaiskitchens.net/</a> or <a href=\"http://refugeecommunitykitchen.com/\" title=\"\">refugeecommunitykitchen.com/</a>.</p>",

Californian company makes snack bars from beer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Howard Carter, a bite prevention expert who developed <a href=\"http://www.lessmosquito.com/us/zap-ease.html\">a product</a> to relieve jellyfish stings, believes the trend will continue: \u201cMore and more jellyfish will end up on the popular beaches like in South Florida, especially with the strong winds and currents in the US. There are already extremely poisonous species like the box jellyfish in the Caribbean Sea \u2013 which is not too far.\u201d</p> <p>Now, one Israeli startup thinks it\u2019s found a solution to tackling these swelling populations \u2013 biodegradable diapers and female hygiene products made out of jellyfish.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.capitalnano.com/portfolio/cineal\">Cine\u2019al</a> was conceived by Shachar Richter, a material scientist at the University of Tel Aviv, who began studying jellyfish a few years ago. As a material scientist, Richter looked closely at the flesh of jellyfish, and found that it could absorb liquid in large quantities. He and his colleagues then developed a super-absorbent material they named \u201chydromash\u201d, which Richter says can absorb a high volume of blood and water. </p> <p>In order to produce hydromash, the company first breaks down the jellyfish flesh and then adds antibacterial nanoparticles to the mix, which remove the sting. The process converts the jellyfish into a strong, flexible but fully biodegradable material. Although jellyfish stings are painful and sometimes fatal, jellyfish are composed of 90% water. Richter and his colleagues realized jellyfish flesh could actually be used in medical bandages and sponges.</p> <p>Cine\u2019al is now developing infant and adult diapers, as well as feminine hygiene products made out of hydromash. The company expects the products to hit the market in the next 18 months. The global diaper market size <a href=\"https://www.psmarketresearch.com/press-release/diaper-market\">was estimated</a> at $52bn in 2015, and set to reach $76.5bn by 2022. There are <a href=\"http://disposablediaper.net/faq/how-many-diapers-are-required-every-day-to-satisfy-the-world-consumption/\">40.37m</a> diapers used daily in the US, most of which end up in landfills. About 43 million women in the US use tampons; on average, a woman uses <a href=\"http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/healthandscience/cumulative-exposure-and-feminine-care-products/\">11,000 tampons in her lifetime</a>. A typical disposable diaper or tampon can take hundreds of years to break down. According to Richter, a product made of hydromash takes less than 30 days to biodegrade.</p> <p>Cine\u2019al isn\u2019t unique when it comes to drawing inspiration from nature to create new materials. Biomason, a North Carolina startup, makes eco-friendly bricks grown with sand and bacteria. Coeio has invented a \u201cburial suit\u201d made out of mushrooms, which is intended to neutralize toxins found in a decomposing body and transfer nutrients to plant life after burial. Agroplast, a Danish startup, uses pig urine to produce bioplastics which could be turned into disposable plates and utensils.</p> <p>\u201cIf these products go mainstream, they can revolutionize the market and make an environmentally noticeable difference,\u201d says Nir Davison, Richter\u2019s colleague at Cine\u2019al <a href=\"http://www.capitalnano.com/portfolio/cineal\">also involved in the development of the material</a>.</p> <p>\u201cJellyfish are elegant, beautiful and intriguing creatures. If they\u2019re studied properly, there are many more ways [they] can contribute to our lives,\u201d Richter says.</p>",
  "<p>He was called Jack. He wrote about his \u201czest for experience\u201d, about the exhilaration of riding box cars, about being \u201can American hobo\u201d and a \u201cstranger in a strange land\u201d. He travelled around with \u201ckin-brothers\u201d and painted fantastic word pictures of drinking under the night sky, lying with a newspaper under his head: \u201cAbove me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves ... \u201d</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t write a book called On the Road. In 1907, 50 years before Jack Kerouac\u2019s novel became a bestseller, Jack London wrote his own masterpiece, called, wait for it, The Road. Without that vivid and extraordinary memoir, the second half of the 20th century would have looked a whole lot different. London was the daddy-o of the Beats. He even looked the part, with his dark good looks and penchant for leather jackets. More importantly, he both walked the walk and talked the talk. </p> <p>His life story is astonishing. As detailed in The Road, he tramped the length and breadth of the US in 1894, aged just 18. Before that, he\u2019d spent long brutal hours working in cannery factories and sailing on seal ships bound for Japan. Romantically, he got most of his education sitting at a makeshift desk in a saloon. The owner took such a shine to him, he paid for him to go to university. In true Beat style, London dropped out. Later, he sailed down the Mississippi on a raft, then joined the Klondike gold rush, got scurvy and discovered leftwing politics.<br></p> <p>Oh, and he wrote more than 20 novels, a good handful of nonfiction books, and dozens of short stories before expiring, aged just 40, in the late stages of alcoholism, hopped up on morphine and with a body wrecked by hard years of use and abuse.<br></p> <p>So it\u2019s easy to see why Kerouac always named London as a foundational influence \u2013 and why he might have been the only author to get a namecheck in On the Road. But Jack London is more than just a proto-Beat. He was also a profound influence on Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Norman Mailer. Lenin liked him, too. In her book Memories of Lenin, the revolutionary leader\u2019s wife Nadezhda Krupskaya said that when the revolutionary leader was dying she read him a tale by London:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Love of Life \u2013 it is still lying on the table in his room. It was a very fine story. In a wilderness of ice, where no human being had set foot, a sick man, dying of hunger, is making for the harbour of a big river. His strength is giving out, he cannot walk but keeps slipping, and beside him there slides a wolf \u2013 also dying of hunger. There is a fight between them: the man wins. Half-dead, half-demented, he reaches his goal. That tale greatly pleased Ilyich (Lenin). Next day he asked me to read him more Jack London.</p> </blockquote> <p>It must have helped, of course, that for a long time, London was a fellow traveller. He was a sharp critic of the inequalities and injustices of the \u201cgilded age\u201d in which he lived. That\u2019s part of the reason George Orwell (whom London inspired to write Down and Out in Paris and London) also found him so interesting. And why London still feels all too relevant, this month, 100 years after his death, as we endure a second gilded age of rampant inequality, overweening press barons, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnpO_RTSNmQ\">gold-plated political monsters</a>. It\u2019s sad to say that his depictions of dire poverty in People of the Abyss, and of the surveillance state in The Iron Heel, still have plenty to teach us. </p> <p>But before I paint Jack London as some kind of leftwing saint, I should also point out that he was more complicated (and more interesting) than that. He eventually left the Socialist party of which he was a member. He enjoyed both earning and spending huge amounts of money, dressing in fine clothes and enjoying the high life. In an essay quoting the passage above from Krupskaya, Orwell says that Krupskaya went on to read her husband a second story from London that turned out to be \u201csaturated with bourgeois morals\u201d, and \u201cIlyich smiled and dismissed it with a wave of his hand\u201d.<br></p> <p>Less amusingly, London also held plenty of the less appealing social Darwinist and racial theories of his age and indulged a \u201ccult of the Nordic\u201d. Orwell says: \u201cLondon could foresee fascism because he had a fascist streak in himself: or at any rate a marked strain of brutality and an almost unconquerable preference for the strong man as against the weak man.\u201d<br></p> <p>While he took on London\u2019s character, Orwell also had a few choice words about his mentor\u2019s prose: \u201cLondon is a very uneven writer. In his short and restless life he poured forth an immense quantity of work, setting himself to produce 1,000 words every day and generally achieving it.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t put us off, however. Although Orwell complained that much of this work was \u201cscamped and unconvincing\u201d, he also conceded that London \u201cproduced at least six volumes which deserve to stay in print, and that is not a bad achievement from a life of 40 years\u201d.<br></p> <p>Annoyingly, Orwell doesn\u2019t name which six. And confusingly he singles out at least seven for praise: The Road, The Jacket, Before Adam, The Valley of the Moon, The Iron Heel, People of the Abyss, and a collection of short stories, Love of Life and Other Stories.<br></p> <p>That list might give us a good place for us to start as we make a selection for this month\u2019s reading group. Although, of course, that would be to ignore London\u2019s most famous (and brilliant) novels White Fang and The Call of the Wild. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London#Bibliography\">fine list to choose from</a>. As often, we\u2019ll put it to the vote. </p> <p>To nominate your favourite, just name it in the comments below. If you could give a reason, that would be fantastic \u2013 but it\u2019s not compulsory. I\u2019ll come back in a few days to tot up the totals. Just to add to the fun, since he wrote so much, and since so many of his books are so short, I\u2019m tempted to try and look at two works this month, so feel free to name more than one.<br></p>",

My eldest grandchild, aged 11, is extremely anxious about political events, particularly potential terrorist attacks. She has become worried about travelling on the tube in London when she visits me. She is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the Paris attacks. She is not at all frightened by any supposed Muslim threat \u2013 indeed, she is rather pro\u2013Muslim having many Muslim peers, which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern children\u2019s education, but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun. She loves coming to London but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous. These concerns affect her sleep. She has confided she has periods of lying awake, worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not, and in my view cannot, dispel her concerns. My experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort. </p> <p>My granddaughter doesn\u2019t have a computer or iPod, or direct access to the web on her phone, but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about what\u2019s happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events. Inevitably, she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say. In my view, the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home, and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum. </p> <p>Teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them. More consideration needs to be given to the way social media, which can now feed into a bullying process, affects children. Bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but I don\u2019t think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive. There needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and I believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age. Children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value, in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts.</p> <h2>Amet Akolawin, 28, from London: \u2018My daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warming\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a55a33907dd4a64b1945f8ac1cf7904cd678910/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Amet Akolawin\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My daughter, who turns eight next week, watches the news when I do, so in the morning and evening.

She is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on Syria, for example, and I think the images are disturbing, her I will ask her if she would like to watch something else.</p> <p>To be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school, such as global warming and natural disasters. We go to visit her gran in Sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there. She has become very fixated about this and I haven\u2019t been able to reassure her about. Her uncle lives in Rome so it\u2019s understandable that she would worry but it\u2019s definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when she\u2019s there.</p> <h2>Jessica Eaton, 26, from Staffordshire: \u2018My sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of them\u2019</h2> <p>My sons, who are five and eight, had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in Syria was real. They had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in Syria. We were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset, saying: \u201cReal people are dying in Syria, with real guns and bombs.\u201d They had got confused between \u201creal\u201d and \u201cpretend war\u201d because of how war is depicted in video games and the fact that they have toy guns. My five-year-old son started to cry, saying: \u201cWe need to stop the shops and the government from selling things that try to make war and bombs and guns fun because it\u2019s real mum. It\u2019s happening in Syria.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the news has made them upset: my boys worry a lot about war and nuclear weapons. They also worry that they might end up refugees too and no one will love them or want them. </p> <p>They have lots and lots of questions about war, politics and weapons. I don\u2019t shield them from current affairs and I don\u2019t lie to them, but instead spend time explaining stuff and suggesting empowering solutions, such as getting them to make posters or write a letter to the government. We have also registered to take in refugee children for fostering. </p> <p>While the media is busy playing everyone off against one another, children are absorbing dangerous messages from all sides. Our children spend more time using technology than any other generation and are very engaged in the media. I would prefer them to experience moral uncertainty and question everything they read rather than just swallowing information.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 41, from London: \u2018My eldest worries about animals dying and the destruction of the earth\u2019</h2> <p>My eldest, who is nine, has been very worried about climate change since he did a class project on habitats last year. He often talks about environmental issues, such as animals dying, trees disappearing and the general destruction of the earth. </p> <p>Both my children actually stopped eating meat last year and decided to become vegetarian. There\u2019s a lot of focus on this issue and they cry when they think about animals being killed. They even made a How to Save Our Planet game together.</p> <p>We don\u2019t allow our children to watch the news: the images are too graphic and the language is not suitable for under 10s. They occasionally hear the news on the radio, but we monitor their internet use, only letting them online for a limited time. They don\u2019t have access to any social media despite their protests. But this is at home, outside in the world we can\u2019t censor or guide them in what they hear or read. Social media is impossible to censor \u2013 thus we have a blanket ban. </p> <h2>Geoff Jein, 36, from London: \u2018Brexit was the worst news my son had ever heard\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b08d363388c8f9c37fa4e478e0ec0984173da00c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08d363388c8f9c37fa4e478e0ec0984173da00c/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Geoffrey Jein\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My son is quite sensitive, but half-hearing news headlines and stories does make him anxious. He usually asks questions about stories four or five weeks after he has seen them, which makes me think he\u2019s been worrying for all that time. A particular concern for him at the moment is Donald Trump getting elected. At the time of the primaries he picked up on him being a joke candidate and being a disaster for the world if elected. Some of his friends in schools do Donald Trump impressions that their parents taught them, so Trump is a bit of a funny character in school. But then he hears phrases like, \u201cThis man could have his finger on the nuclear button,\u201d and gets worried. He takes things very literally so imagines there actually being a button. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Brexit result really upset him.

He is not on social media as he is too young and I don\u2019t think any of his friends are either.</p> <p>The Brexit result really upset him. It got to the point where we were late to school that morning trying to calm him down. He thought that it was the worst news he had ever heard. He was so scared of leaving Europe. I take the blame for that really, as I didn\u2019t see it coming. I gave him a very polemic view of why we should stay and no insight really into why some people wanted to leave. I am hoping to give him more information on news events now so he is less anxious. A few weeks ago, for example, I signed up to <a href=\"http://theweekjunior.co.uk/about-junior/?ppcad=true&amp;gclid=CK3jw8HLh9ACFaEL0wodbVUFZA\">The Week Junior</a>, which is a magazine that explains big news events to children.</p> <h2>Anonymous, 45, from Kent: \u2018We need to help children analyse media stories and sources of information\u2019</h2> <p>Since the age of seven my daughter has worried about global events but it\u2019s not had a negative impact. She listens to the radio, reads The Week Junior and watches Newsround daily. If she wants to find out more, we research it together online. We discuss stories and sources of news regularly.<br><br>After the Paris attacks, a number of children were pulled out of a trip to London. I discussed this with my daughter and explained that the government does all it can to keep citizens safe, and why you can\u2019t let terrorists win. We thought about what we could do, so she wrote to David Cameron and got a response a few weeks later. It\u2019s important to give children a way to try to positively effect change. We also need to help them to understand risk and analyse media stories, and sources of information.</p>",

To settle debts, or merely sustain themselves, some families have resorted to marrying off daughters at a young age, said Beyani.<br></p> <p>Even in urban areas that offer the most economic opportunities, life has become so precarious that residents have had to flee \u2013 sometimes more than once. Last year, when Afghan and international forces fought to push out the Taliban from the northern city of Kunduz, Aminullah, 58, hunkered down with his family. As airstrikes took place across the city for days on end, his 10-year-old daughter Bashira, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, went into a state of shock. She did not recover after the family fled east to Takhar province, or when they returned to Kunduz two weeks later.</p> <p>When fighting erupted again last month, the family fled once more, this time to the capital. In camps in Kabul, assistance was scarce. The family of 11 slept under three blankets in a tent. Since last year, Bashira had not been able to walk, or utter more than a few words, said Aminullah. \u201cWhen we hear planes in the sky, she asks me to put my hand on her heart,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bibi Nesar, 50, also had to flee Kunduz for the second time. But this time, it was even harder. In last year\u2019s attack, she lost her right arm when a rocket hit her home. Her husband lost an eye. This year, they did not linger long enough to be injured. After a US airstrike last year destroyed a hospital run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, there was no quality healthcare facility in Kunduz province to help them if they got wounded again. \u201cWhen we fled, there were dead bodies everywhere but we tried not to look at them,\u201d Bibi Nesar said.</p> <p>Afghan migrants being deported from abroad will only add to the problems. Although deported migrants are not necessarily destined to become internally displaced people (IDPs), the line between the two groups is fluid, said Beyani.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s IDPs are tomorrow\u2019s refugees.

Efficient aid delivery is slowed down by internal government squabbles, and occasionally the government refuses to assist people in areas controlled by the Taliban, in contravention of humanitarian principles, he said. </p> <p>Both the UN rapporteur and the UNHCR-World Bank report emphasise that Afghans, squeezed by economic hardship and violence, have genuine reasons for migrating. \u201cLeaving is more of a necessity, rather than a choice,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Necessity, however, is not what prompted Europe to prepare the deportation of tens of thousands of Afghans, said Beyani. That decision is political. \u201cEurope has never had 1 million come as they did last year and yet, if you put that in perspective, there are regions, including Asia, Africa and Latin America, where 1 million people may be absorbed by a single country,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Haruki Murakami has warned that \u201cno matter how high a wall we build to keep intruders out, no matter how strictly we exclude outsiders, no matter how much we rewrite history to suit us, we just end up damaging and hurting ourselves\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking as he received the <a href=\"http://cphpost.dk/news/odense-honours-haruki-murakami-with-hans-christian-andersen-award.html\">Hans Christian Andersen literature award</a>, the Japanese novelist said that \u201cjust as all people have shadows, every society and nation, too, has shadows\u201d, and \u201cif there are bright, shining aspects, there will definitely be a counterbalancing dark side. If there\u2019s a positive, there will surely be a negative on the reverse side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt times we tend to avert our eyes from the shadow, those negative parts. Or else try to forcibly eliminate those aspects. Because people want to avoid, as much as possible, looking at their own dark sides, their negative qualities. But in order for a statue to appear solid and three-dimensional, you need to have shadows. Do away with shadows and all you end up with is a flat illusion. Light that doesn\u2019t generate shadows is not true light,\u201d said the novelist.</p> <p> He continued: \u201cYou have to patiently learn to live together with your shadow. And carefully observe the darkness that resides within you. Sometimes in a dark tunnel you have to confront your own dark side.\u201d</p> <p>Murakami was announced as winner of the Hans Christian Andersen prize a year ago, but received the prize this weekend. The 500,000DKK award, for writing which \u201ccan be linked to Andersen\u2019s name and authorship through genre similarities or storyteller-artistic qualities\u201d has previously been won by authors including JK Rowling and Salman Rushdie. Murakami was cited for his \u201c capacity to boldly mix classic narrative art, pop culture, Japanese tradition, dreamlike realism and philosophical discussion\u201d, which judges said \u201cmakes him a fitting heir to the Andersen legacy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201dMurakami\u2019s ability to combine the everyday and reality with magic and fairytale derives from a linguistic mastery that once again makes one think of Hans Christian Andersen. There are images and descriptions of natural scenery, cityscapes and landscapes in Murakami that possess a distinctive poetry,\u201d said committee member and professor Anne-Marie Mai from the University of Southern Denmark in a speech at the ceremony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/06/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-years-pilgimage-haruki-murakami-review\">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novelist, author of books including <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/winter-reads-norwegian-wood-haruki-murakami\">Norwegian Wood</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/fiction.harukimurakami\">Kafka on the Shore</a>, called his speech in Denmark The Meaning of Shadows, in honour of Andersen\u2019s story <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://hca.gilead.org.il/shadow.html\">The Shadow</a>.

Instead of using my head, in other words, it\u2019s through moving my hand in the process of writing that I think.

  "<p>Europe is closing. \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d reiterates PM Theresa May, buying time until the negotiations for this apparent \u201chard Brexit\u201d are hammered out. In this political purgatory, businesses are left floundering, unsure about what it will actually mean for them. For British bands touring on the continent, the uncertainty about one of their only certain means of income could not have come at a worse time. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just bands, agents and tour managers voicing worries about the miasma of ambiguity. Sir John Sorrell, the founder of the Creative Industries Federation, has recently argued that touring acts could be driven off the road due to visa and carnet costs in a post-Brexit Europe. (Carnet is a system governing transportation of equipment across borders without having to complete customs declarations on every item, but they could run up to \u00a32,000 a year.) These will all slash the margins of an artist\u2019s primary source of income. Sorrell said the creative sector is \u201ca key driver of wealth and global success\u201d for the UK. \u201cTo imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy.\u201d </p> <p>Touring agents and managers that I have spoken to off the record in recent months all revealed enormous uncertainty about what will happen to British acts playing shows and festivals across Europe in the aftershock of Brexit. They are trying to put a brave face on things but most are fearing the worst \u2013 namely the closure of opportunities and escalating running costs that could make touring utterly unsustainable. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the biggest thing for me as a production manager would be the addition of a carnet for every show outside the UK,\u201d Joel Stanley, production manager at Production Value, <a href=\"http://www.iq-mag.net/2016/03/brexit-2016-live-music-business/\">told live industry trade magazine IQ</a> in March. \u201cCurrently we only ever have to show proof of ownership with the bond and have it stamped in and out if we go outside of the EU \u2013 mainly Switzerland \u2013 but [post-Brexit we\u2019d need a carnet] even for a one-off show in France.\u201d</p> <p>Agents and touring artists are already dealing with the aftermath of the decline of the CD business. In the boom years, labels would underwrite shows with tour support and regard this as a marketing investment to break new acts that would then go on, ideally, to sell lots of records, thereby covering that development cost. That is now evaporating to the point where 20-date European tours are being truncated to 10 or eight-date jaunts around Europe, with days off a rare thing because days off mean no money is coming in. </p> <p>The net effect could be that acts will just focus on a handful of big European cities \u2013 but if they all do that, the shrunken market will quickly become over-saturated and everyone will lose. Add in the possibility of requiring a work visa for every European country and costs could spiral before acts have even played their first show of a European tour. This is already making it hard in other major markets; the same system in Europe could be catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cGetting visas is an absolute minefield and it costs a lot of money, and it\u2019s the reason that a lot of people don\u2019t get to tour America,\u201d Colin Roberts of Big Life Management <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1186-the-uk-leaving-the-eu-would-change-the-european-music-industry/\">told Pitchfork in June</a>. \u201cEven going to a country like Japan where visas are quite easy to get, I know how difficult it is having to factor in the cost and the time to acquire a visa.\u201d</p> <p>The government loves to pay lip service to the export power of British music, braying and gloating from boxes at the Brit awards about how proud they are of our globally successful artists. Britain, since Beatlemania, has been the second biggest exporter of music globally after the US. There is a huge amount of money at stake here for both artists and the UK economy. A <a href=\"http://www.ukmusic.org/research/music-tourism-wish-you-were-here-2016/\">study by UK Music</a> this summer found there were 10.4m \u201cmusic tourists\u201d coming to the UK in 2015 and their direct and indirect spend was \u00a33.7bn. These are people drawn to the UK because of the live market, its successful music exports and its diverse grassroots scenes.</p> <p>On top of this, <a href=\"https://www.bpi.co.uk/home/british-artists-score-highest-recorded-share-of-global-music-sales.aspx\">the BPI reports</a> that British acts accounted for one in seven albums sold globally in 2014, with their record sales generating approximately $2.75bn that year. So there are really two issues here: the outbound earnings of the acts on the road, and the inbound earnings that come from the UK being seen as a global force in music. </p> <p>There is an argument that just because the UK has successfully exported the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, Coldplay, Adele and so on, it will just keep doing so forever. It won\u2019t. It needs support and infrastructure at all levels (not just for superstars). </p> <p>It\u2019s an industry truism that the old model of touring as a loss leader to sell albums has been inverted \u2013 records are now loss leaders to promote tours. But if you garrotte the touring opportunities, then everyone down the pecking order suffers, and those at the very bottom suffer first and hardest. Couple this with the systematic closure of key grassroots venues around the UK \u2013 something the Music Venue Trust was set up as a registered charity in 2014 to lobby against \u2013 and things are starting to look very bleak indeed for the future of British live music.</p> <p><br></p>",

Inmates and staff now referred to her as \u201cdoctor\u201d despite her lack of qualifications, and medication was prescribed by an Arizona-based doctor over the telephone.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/federal-officials-ignored-years-of-internal-warnings-about-deaths-at-private-prisons/\">An investigation by the Nation magazine</a> found that the Cibola County facility accumulated more repeat deficiencies or significant flaws in health provision than any other private federal prison, with 30 out of 34 contract citations since 2007 related to poor standards of medical care. The investigation also identified three deaths, not including Jaramillo\u2019s, linked to questionable care at the facility by the end of 2015.</p> <p>These failures, argued experts, made Ice\u2019s decision to keep the facility open all the more extraordinary, particularly when the Department of Homeland Security is conducting its own review of its use of privatised institutions, following the DoJ announcement in August.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning that Ice is turning around and signing a new contract there,\u201d said Carl Takei, a staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s national prison project. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the medical care for Ice detainees being just as terrible as it was for BOP prisoners. There\u2019s no reason to believe it will improve. It\u2019s the same company and the same facility.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, CCA chief executives formally announced the five-year contract with Ice, arguing: \u201cCCA already has an experienced, well-trained workforce at the Cibola County corrections center which, for many years, has provided an exceptional level of service to the BOP, and we are proud to have the opportunity to extend the same level of exceptional service to another federal customer under this new contract.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>The village of Milan, with a population of just 1,300, was caught off guard when the DoJ announced the closure earlier in the summer. CCA is the largest employer here, and also in the neighboring town of Grants, where the company operates a <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/144121/former-inmate-testifies-about-sexual-assault.html\">controversial</a> women\u2019s prison under a contract with the state government.</p> <p>There were 245 jobs scheduled to be lost by the time the Cibola County prison was due to close, at the end of October. The village stood to lose a projected $358,000 in revenue from property taxes and gross receipts, while the county government would have lost $700,000 annually in taxes.</p> <p>Families had already begun packing up and leaving town in September, as local government officials frantically pushed for solutions and endorsed CCA efforts to keep the prison open as it sought contracts with Ice, the US marshal service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt will turn this community into a ghost town,\u201d said Marcella Sandoval, the Milan village manager in September. \u201cThe prison is a lifeline for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90dfff5e256e91cdaab0f076cf443443da11e3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90dfff5e256e91cdaab0f076cf443443da11e3c0/0_64_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcella Sandoval and Eileen Yarborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Sandoval and Eileen Yarborough, executive director of Cibola Communities Economic Development Foudation.

It was around this time that CCA bought facilities in the area, offering a chance of employment to those who remained in town.</p> <p>The prison drew almost instant controversy. In 2001, inmates rioted over the quality of food, drawing local police and outside law enforcement who used teargas to quell the unrest. But residents soon grew used to the prison\u2019s presence. Many who spoke to the Guardian in September felt slighted by the federal government\u2019s decision to close the prison. In this heavily Democratic county, some said the decision had been enough to make them vote Republican at the election in November. Sandoval said the county was given no advanced warning and no assistance was offered to the local economy. </p> <p>Milan\u2019s police chief, Jerry Stephens, who commands the village\u2019s seven-strong police department, said just two escapes had occurred from the prison during his tenure as chief.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the community here worries about it at all,\u201d he said. A records request indicated his department had attended 49 assault calls at the prison between 2014 and 2015. </p> <p>Despite this, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general found</a> that inmates in its contract prisons were nine times more likely to be placed on lockdown than in other comparable facilities, and assault rates were 28% higher than in federal prisons.</p> <p>In an interview in October, Sandoval told the Guardian that the reopened facility could now eventually hold 1,400 detainees \u2013 expanding its already stretched capacity by 200 beds. \u201cThe decision basically saved us. They\u2019re rehiring and will have even more jobs this time,\u201d she said, relieved. </p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Jose Jaramillo wrote a short statement after he was arrested for illegal re-entry in August 2006: \u201cI know what I did is against the law and so I accept full responsibility for my conduct. I came back to work and be with my family.\u201d</p> <p>Jaramillo had been pulled over as he drove from the chilli fields outside of Roswell, where he had worked backbreaking shifts for most of his life, starting at 5am and finishing at sunset. A sheriff\u2019s deputy had noticed he had a broken headlight, and later reported him to border patrol agents in New Mexico after he failed to present identification papers. Instead of running away when agents called to inform him he was likely to be arrested, he waited for them to arrive at the door that evening.</p> <p>\u201cI think that just shows you what sort of a law-abiding guy he was,\u201d Lisa Curtis said.</p> <p>That year over <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/356/\">29,000 people were convicted for illegal entry and re-entry</a>. By 2013, that number had soared to just under 88,000 \u2013 meaning more than half of all federal criminal prosecutions that year were for unlawful border crossings. By the time the DoJ announced it was abandoning all contracts with these 13 private immigrant jails, their populations had swelled to 22,000 inmates, costing the federal government $600m a year.</p> <p>After he stabilized in 2009, Jaramillo was moved to the nursing home in Las Cruces. The federal government had initially moved to deport him, but the family successfully appealed after arguing he would die within days if he was moved back to Mexico. But the brain damage was irreparable. He had no movement from the neck down. When he spoke it was often nonsensical. On rare occasions when he could muster a coherent sentence, he told his daughter Judy, born in the US with full citizenship, that he wanted her to finish high school and become a nurse.</p> <p>\u201cIt was his dream,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Judy is now training to become an elementary school teacher, but visited her father twice a week at the nursing home until his death in July. The family, who settled with CCA in 2014 for an undisclosed amount with no admission of liability, placed the money in a trust to pay for Jaramillo\u2019s care, but knew the end was coming as his health rapidly deteriorated from another infection.</p> <p>\u201cI just felt like the world was hitting me,\u201d Judy said of the day her father died. \u201cIt was sadness and anger. Anger at the prison.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In August 1945, the US army dropped a secret over Japan: fully functional nuclear bombs, which instantly killed tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. More than 6,000 miles away, meanwhile, in northern New Mexico, one newspaper carried a headline with uniquely local flair.</p> <p>\u201cNow They Can be Told Aloud These Stoories [sic] of the Hill\u201d blared<a href=\"http://albuqhistsoc.org/source-documents/now-can-told-aloud-stoories-hill/\"> a rushed edition of the Santa Fe New Mexican</a>. The article revealed that Los Alamos \u2013 a mysterious settlement, built atop a picturesque mesa \u2013 had been instrumental in the creation of these new weapons of mass destruction.<br></p> <p>Today, Los Alamos is a secret no longer: it\u2019s a small community with about 18,000 people living in the main town and a suburb called White Rock. But the nuclear lab remains, and the city is still an island in many ways: an extraordinary pocket of wealth and privilege, surrounded by some of the poorest counties in New Mexico, one of the poorest states in America.</p> <p>The city is also partly toxic. The nuclear research lab still disposes of radioactive waste, and an underground plume of <a href=\"http://www.sfreporter.com/santafe/article-11031-leaks-from-the-lab.html\">hexavalent chromium</a> \u2013 a contaminant linked to increased risks of cancer and made famous by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/20/chromium-6-erin-brockovich-chemical-threatens-two-thirds-of-americans-erin-brockovich\">Erin Brockovich</a> \u2013 has been drifting from the lab. A September 2016 report from the lab\u2019s environmental management office said it could take more than 20 years and nearly $4bn (\u00a33.3bn) to clean up decades-old nuclear waste in the area.</p> <p>And yet Los Alamos has more millionaires per capita than almost anywhere else in the country.</p> <h2>Instant city</h2> <p>The city has always been unique. During the second world war, Los Alamos was the site of a classified research laboratory, built as part of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Along with Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford, Washington, it was also home to a \u201csecret city\u201d built to house thousands of scientists, engineers and their families.</p> <p>\u201cIt was isolated, and it was also beautiful, which was something [J Robert] Oppenheimer used when he recruited people,\u201d says Jon Hunner, professor of history at New Mexico State University, referring to the theoretical physicist who led the Los Alamos lab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"508271c0621dec7c18f96a31e54238b1b0da4ec1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/508271c0621dec7c18f96a31e54238b1b0da4ec1/0_161_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Alamos / Espanola, New Mexico for cities\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Alamos\u2019s once secret nuclear history has become a tourist attraction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Saucedo-McQuade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The goal, he explains, had been to build top secret, temporary research facilities in order to keep US nuclear scientists and their work \u201caway from prying eyes and ears\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who lived in Los Alamos were forbidden to talk about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hunner\u2019s 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Los-Alamos-Growth-Community/dp/0806138912\">Inventing Los Alamos</a>, describes the birth of what he calls an \u201cinstant city\u201d. In some ways, the story sounds similar to that of the hundreds of company towns built across the US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to provide labour for single industries: mining, coal and logging towns. </p> <p>Except here the industry was nuclear weapons. And, officially, the town did not exist. </p> <p>Those who lived in Los Alamos were forbidden to talk about it. The town was not mentioned on drivers licenses, birth certificates, or postal mail. The whole area was surrounded by fences, gates and guards.</p> <p>Constructed almost overnight, much of the land was simply appropriated from traditional Hispanic homesteaders and Native American communities, as well as an elite <a href=\"http://www.losalamoshistory.org/ranch_school.htm\">private boys school</a> that counted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/14/gore-vidal-gripped-a-nation\">Gore Vidal</a> as one of its famous alumni. </p> <p>To guard its secret, Los Alamos was built to be almost completely self-contained. There were schools, a hospital, and theatres that doubled as dance halls on Saturdays and churches on Sundays. Housing was allocated according to one\u2019s rank at the lab. By the end of the war, it had a population of 6,000.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was run by the Army Corps of Engineers. There were no private businesses in Los Alamos until the 1950s. Nobody could own property. Nobody could own their home,\u201d says Hunner. With its focus on the science behind the bomb, he describes it \u201clike a university town that was controlled by the military\u201d.</p> <p>It was also shoddily constructed, he says, because it was only supposed to exist during the second world war. But then the cold war with the Soviet Union gave the US nuclear weapons programme, and Los Alamos, a new raison d\u2019etre.

Already Los Alamos receives tens of thousands of visitors each year to see the place where the atomic bomb was developed, says McClenahan. Some of the biggest numbers are from Russia, Germany and Japan.</p> <p>McClenahan says Los Alamos has \u201calways been conflicted\u201d about the impact of the research done here. From the beginning, she says, \u201cthere were scientists who were so proud of not only the scientific work they did, but of saying \u2018We ended world war two\u2019. And then there were others who said, \u2018We just killed hundreds of thousands of people\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, she adds, there was also \u201ca sense of \u2018Stay out of our town, we\u2019re doing top-secret work and you can\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d But attitudes have changed. Now, she says, people are thinking: \u201cHow do we bring tourists to our tiny little town?\u201d</p> <h2>Espa\u00f1ola: \u2018It\u2019s complicated\u2019</h2> <p>Espa\u00f1ola is a 25 minute drive north-east of Los Alamos. It, too, is a small town, with a population of about 10,000. But, in many respects, it feels a world away from the nuclear island on the hill.</p> <p>The road into Espa\u00f1ola passes by brightly painted murals and drive-thru fast food restaurants. Other buildings bear hand-painted signs on storefronts, selling animal feed, boots and party supplies for <em>quincea\u00f1eras</em>. Boldly coloured low-rider cars, which have become key cultural symbols of this part of New Mexico, rumble down the town\u2019s wide roads.</p> <p>Sheehey, the Los Alamos councillor, says that thousands of people commute to Los Alamos each day from neighbouring communities like this one. \u201cEconomic benefit is felt throughout the region,\u201d he says. \u201cChildren from outside the county are allowed to attend Los Alamos schools, which still get a federal subsidy and are some of the best public schools in New Mexico.\u201d</p> <p>The lab has also been \u201cgenerous in supporting education and other community programs in Espa\u00f1ola and other neighbouring communities,\u201d Sheehey adds. He gives the example of a free bus service through northern New Mexico, funded partly by a Los Alamos county program called Progress through Partnering.</p> <p>Like many people in Espa\u00f1ola, Patricia Trujillo, 39, says she has always been connected to the lab in some way. \u201cWhen we talk about the company town it\u2019s much wider than Los Alamos,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole valley.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2ea2498b95f4e9cbf2f266ffae89aa3dc8cb415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ea2498b95f4e9cbf2f266ffae89aa3dc8cb415/0_227_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Alamos / Espanola, New Mexico for cities\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two towns divided by extreme wealth and inequality.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooks Saucedo-McQuade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a child in the late 1980s, Trujillo says she remembers her teachers sending her and her classmates to wait by the side of the road and cheer as new scientific equipment was brought to Los Alamos by truck. \u201cThey had us sit outside all day long,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of getting us to question it, they had us cheering.\u201d</p> <p>Her own grandmother worked in Los Alamos in the 1940s, as a house matron in charge of a dormitory for other women who worked in the then-secret city\u2019s households and offices.

In the case of my organisation (<a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/emergencies/south-sudan\">Care International</a>), we were back in the country within five days. But three months on, many institutions continue to maintain a minimal presence on the ground and the mood among aid workers has dipped following the reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\">rape and murder of humanitarians</a> and continuing attacks in parts of the country that seem to be purposefully targeting aid workers.</p> <p>South Sudan has now become one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be an aid worker, with a total of <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/south-sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-16-20-october-2016\">67 humanitarians killed</a> since the outbreak of conflict in 2013.</p> <p>So what is the threshold for withdrawal?

With one in five people forced to flee their homes and more than half the population needing urgent humanitarian assistance, the need is too great.</p> <p>While NGOs can\u2019t control all the factors responsible for security, we need to look at how programmes can function when staff cannot access them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/17/attack-on-aid-workers-in-south-sudan-there-was-incredible-naivety\">Attack on aid workers in South Sudan: 'There was incredible naivety'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One way is to empower local communities to take ownership of projects \u2013 this can be key to keeping programmes alive in some of the most dangerous places.

Around $1bn is spent on peacekeeping forces in South Sudan who have repeatedly been found to have failed in their basic mandate of protecting civilians and aid workers.</p> <p>As we see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/antonio-guterres-next-un-secretary-general\">new UN secretary general</a> about to take office \u2013 one with a humanitarian background \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55372#.WBNX_vorKFg\">a new head</a> of the UN mission in South Sudan, now is the time to make changes.

  "<p>Welcome to the month of November when half the world\u2019s planes seem to be stuffed with rugby players. Most have no choice if they wish to pursue their chosen trade. Ireland and New Zealand are in Chicago this week while Australia and South Africa are in London. Fiji are training in Toulouse, with England opting for a short warm-weather break in Portugal. There are almost as many gumshields passing through departure lounges as giant Toblerones.</p> <p>There is good reason for this hyperactivity. The game is increasingly global and spreading the gospel can be lucrative. The All Blacks are not in the States purely for the fresh Illinois air and Argentina did not stage their Rugby Championship Test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/argentina-australia-rugby-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">against Australia at Twickenham</a> last month because of the local tango-dancing scene. Beyond the financial inducements, though, there are additional benefits: a change of scene can eradicate staleness and complacency and create unexpected new friendships.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/eddie-jones-george-ford-toulon-england\">Eddie Jones warns George Ford that Toulon move would end England career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season\u2019s Top 14 final in Barcelona was a case in point. It was shifted to Catalonia only because French stadiums were being used for the European football championship but the staggering attendance and vivid atmosphere made every continental administrator sit up and take notice. Spain also performed creditably at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/the-olympic-games-and-rugby-sevens-a-match-made-in-heaven\" title=\"\">Olympic sevens tournament in Rio</a>: could there be a whole new Iberian audience out there waiting to be enticed, if only occasionally, from their round-ball obsession?</p> <p>Which brings us back, not for the first time, to the Rugby Football Union\u2019s narrower horizons. Bumping into English squad players on red-eye flights to a Portugal training camp on Monday morning was a culture shock simply because it happens so rarely. Aside from one short hop across the Irish Sea to Dublin next March, this is the only time the majority of England\u2019s senior squad will have to board a flight on international business between now and next June. With just about everything the RFU organises occurring in the home counties, a valid driving licence and an Oyster card are pretty much the only requirements.</p> <p>Once again all four internationals in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/29/autumn-internationals-home-nations-england-wales-ireland-scotland\" title=\"\">this autumn\u2019s Old Mutual Wealth series</a> will take place at Twickenham on successive Saturdays. Only a few hundred unsold tickets remain so, financially, the schedule stacks up nicely. Four 80,000-plus attendances, in addition to all the associated corporate hospitality benefits and huge bar profits, will clearly swell the coffers more than taking the odd home Test fixture out on the road.</p> <p>But hang on. This is a union which has just posted revenues of \u00a3407.1m, with record profits for rugby investment of \u00a3102.3m. Admittedly a large chunk of that was a consequence of staging the 2015 World Cup but the RFU is far wealthier than any other union. Where it has been less obviously successful is in raising the profile of rugby union in the north of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/06/rugby-union-twickenham-manchester-world-cup-2015\" title=\"\">a recurring issue that does little to promote the 15-a-side code as a truly national sport</a>.</p> <p>It can be easy, and somewhat misleading, to dismiss English rugby league as a game played in just a few northern counties. But what about the latest England senior rugby union team? Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/courtney-lawes-injury-england-south-africa\" title=\"\">Josh Beaumont was called in</a> as an injury replacement, only one member of the 33-strong training squad currently plays for a northern club. Sale\u2019s Mike Haley is that rarest of comets, a northern resident who has caught Twickenham\u2019s attention. None of the other 32 live north of Leicestershire. Before last autumn\u2019s dead rubber against Uruguay, England had hosted one full international in Manchester since 1897.</p> <p>With Ian Ritchie as chief executive and another northerner, Andy Cosslett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/21/rfu-appoint-andrew-cosslett-chairman\" title=\"\">recently sworn in as the RFU\u2019s new chairman</a>, it is not as if there is a lack of appreciation inside Twickenham that the world does not stop at Watford Gap services. When the Guardian made discreet inquiries last week it was told there remains a continuing desire for representative teams to play at northern venues but, crucially, not the senior XV.</p> <p>It is not good enough. Where would English football be without strong northern clubs? How insular would English cricket look if it did not stage a single Test or one-day international north of the River Trent? How does English rugby union plan to enthuse youngsters and their families from Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cumbria if it gives league a largely unopposed head start? Is it entirely a coincidence that northern lads \u2013 Chris Ashton, Sam Burgess, David Strettle \u2013 seem increasingly more comfortable with the idea of playing abroad than sticking around in English union. Or that the two main northern cogs in England\u2019s backline \u2013 Owen Farrell and George Ford \u2013 gravitated towards union largely because their fathers took coaching jobs down south? Tommy Taylor and Danny Care bring the total number of northern-born players currently in Portugal to a measly half dozen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/31/sam-warburton-world-cup-wales-british-irish-lions-new-zealand\">Sam Warburton: \u2018You watch Sky with everyone else to see if you\u2019re in Lions squad\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe it is idealistic to think that playing a Test match against Fiji \u2013 or Australia come to that \u2013 in Leeds or Manchester would directly assist England in winning the 2023 and 2027 World Cups. Maybe the RFU\u2019s profits would be affected. Maybe it would be less convenient for Eddie Jones to train his players beside the seaside in Blackpool or Bridlington than in Brighton or Brown\u2019s sporting academy in Portugal. But New Zealand train and play at venues all around their country and it does not hinder their national team \u2013 the opposite, in fact. Sticking to convention and doing what you always do is no way to run or grow a sport, let alone deliver a truly national side. England do not even have to board a plane to locate fresh new frontiers.</p> <h2>Get shirty</h2> <p>The 2017 British and Irish Lions jersey is being unveiled this week, still a must-have garment for all professional players in the four home unions. Not every strip seen this season falls into that category: will many players reminisce nostalgically about the days they wore the dull grey away strip of Bath or the hi-vis green stewards\u2019 outfits currently sported by Leicester on their travels? Or those shorts with a sponsor\u2019s name plastered across the players\u2019 backsides? It was a marketing wheeze but New Zealand\u2019s deliberately blacker-than-black kit \u2013 with accompanying socks and dark boots to match \u2013 was at least more visually striking and aesthetically appealing. Compare and contrast with the latest blue change kit set to be worn by England against Fiji a fortnight on Saturday. Both are manufactured by Canterbury but only one will stand the test of time.</p> <h2>And another thing \u2026</h2> <p>Congratulations are due to Zebre for achieving their first victory in six attempts in this season\u2019s Pro12 last Friday night in Edinburgh. It is not always easy to discern shafts of optimism in Italian provincial rugby and this year\u2019s European Champions\u2019 Cup results to date have been grim. Good luck, then, to Conor O\u2019Shea, Italy\u2019s new national coach, and his assistant Mike Catt as they prepare to face New Zealand, South Africa and Tonga in their first home Tests in charge of the <em>Azzurri</em>. If the Italian patient can be resuscitated on their watch, it will be a colossal achievement worthy of worldwide acclaim.</p>",

He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d</p> <p>It later emerged that Trump had been granted four education draft deferments and one medical.

When he went after a woman over an image problem, that would unite 90% of women and men and was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d</p> <p>Machado won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996.

To the dismay of his party, Trump took the bait and talked about Machado for days, telling Fox News: \u201cShe gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sees the entire universe in terms of how it affects him,\u201d Galen said. \u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t have the temperament to be president of the United States. He figured out what the country had been mad about; he was the wrong messenger for the right message.\u201d</p> <p>Trump accused Mexican immigrants of being \u201crapists\u201d, drug traffickers and criminals at his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">campaign launch in June 2015</a>.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s two oil \u201csupermajors\u201d, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have outlined plans for a more frugal future to withstand stubbornly low oil prices as they beat profit expectations in the third quarter.</p> <p>While both firms outperformed forecasts, Shell won greater plaudits from investors thanks to rapid progress on cutting costs and a hefty production boost from its \u00a343bn takeover of gas specialist BG.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s underlying net profit for the three months to the end of September rose 18% to $2.8bn, beating analyst forecasts of $1.7bn.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest company said its performance had improved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/shell-reports-71-plunge-in-profits\">after a disappointing second quarter</a> as it cut costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/35bn-shell-takeover-approved-bg-shareholders\">following its takeover of BG Group in January</a>.</p> <p>Chief financial officer Simon Henry said the BG deal had \u201cturbocharged\u201d the company, helping increase production by 25% to 3.6m barrels per day (bpd) from 2.9m this time last year.</p> <p>But the cost of the takeover, coupled with low oil prices, has seen the company\u2019s debt balloon from $26.6bn last year to nearly $79bn, adding to pressure to reduce spending and sell assets.</p> <p>Shell expects its capital investment to fall $25bn next year \u2013 at the lowest end of its $25bn to $30bn guidance range. </p> <p>Henry pointed out that Shell is already being thrifty, with this year\u2019s $29bn in capital investment some $18bn less than Shell and BG were spending as separate companies in 2014.</p> <p>Oil companies around the world have cut spending severely to cope with a plunge in the oil price that has weighed on the industry for more than two years and that both companies said is unlikely to reverse this year.<br></p> <p>Henry warned that continued retrenchment could include further job losses in the North Sea, where Shell has already cut 1,000 staff since 2014.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot rule out further changes in the number of jobs,\u201d he said, adding that Shell was ready to sell North Sea assets but hadn\u2019t received attractive offers.</p> <p>The firm is in the process of selling 16 assets as part of a $30bn sale programme as it looks to bolster its balance sheet following the BG deal.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, stressed the need for caution despite the better-than-expected results, saying: \u201cLower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>Shell\u2019s cost cuts and progress in integrating BG won approval from the markets, sending its shares up nearly 4% to \u00a321.15.</p> <p>But while BP beat expectations, investors were less impressed than they were with Shell and its stock fell 4.5% to \u00a34.62.<br></p> <p>Investors in both companies stand to receive a \u00a32.5bn boost to their dividends from sterling\u2019s weakness this year, according to Capita Dividend Monitor, which expects their combined payouts to be \u00a318.6bn.</p> <p>At BP, net profit almost halved to $933m in the third quarter from $1.8bn a year earlier, although the result was better than the average analyst forecast of $780m, according to Reuters. </p> <p>The company blamed lower oil prices as well as higher costs for writing off exploration projects and cancelling rigs. <a

last month</a> after commissioning a high-spec oil rig in Singapore.</p> <p>Like Shell, BP is battening down the hatches for continued low oil prices, with capital spending due to be $16bn this year, $1bn less than predicted in April.<br></p> <p>The company has largely worked through the costs of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill but added $189m to its overall bill, which has now reached $61.8bn since the incident in April 2010.<br></p> <p>Both companies\u2019 shares have been under pressure as the oil price hovers at about $50 a barrel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/oct/28/bp-and-shell-slide-on-continuing-concerns-about-opec-oil-deal\">and rising doubts about Opec\u2019s ability to organise a promised production cut.</a></p> <p>But Shell\u2019s finance chief Simon Henry said the efforts to slash costs will put it in \u201cvery strong cash generating territory\u201d if prices rise again.</p> <p>He said every $10 rise in the price of Brent crude was worth $5bn to Shell and would be worth $6bn within years, signalling huge rewards if oil prices eventually reach $100 again. \u201cThat\u2019s another $30bn in the bank each year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Energy industry commentators have pointed to the falling cost of renewables versus fossil fuels and Shell\u2019s head of new energies and integrate gas, Maarten Wetselaar, said solar and wind were already undercutting gas in some areas.</p> <p>He said solar panels were \u201cequivalent or cheaper than fully costed gas\u201d in areas near the equator when stripping out the cost of period with limited sunshine.</p> <p>He said the same was true of wind power in the North Sea, although he stressed that gas still has an advantage when windless days are factored in.</p>",

  "<p>Over the past few months the public and political debate on Brexit has moved on to a discussion of the \u201chard\u201d v \u201csoft\u201d varieties.</p> <p>So far the debate has generated more heat than light, the very terms \u201chard Brexit\u201d and \u201csoft Brexit\u201d becoming almost as meaningless as the word \u201cBrexit\u201d itself. The path ahead is not binary: instead there is a spectrum of possible outcomes, from a mostly symbolic break with Europe (the soft end), to a much more meaningful separation (the harder edge). One of the key variables in play is whether or not Britain will remain in the European single market, and although the government has not openly stated that it wishes to leave it, its publicly declared objectives do point in that direction.</p> <p>Following this public debate can at times be deeply frustrating. As ever in the discussion of economic policy, politicians use imprecise and obfuscating language to camouflage their intentions and maximise flexibility. At present the government \u2013 and indeed the Labour opposition \u2013 are keen to talk up the need to maintain \u201caccess\u201d to the single market, but this is both distinct from \u201cmembership\u201d of the single market and, in reality, a fairly meaningless objective unless the option of a North Korean-style isolation from the global economy is on the table as a serious option.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government \u2013 and indeed Labour \u2013 talk up 'access' to the single market, but this is different to 'membership'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The single market \u2013 previously called the common market \u2013 is an altogether deeper form of economic integration than a traditional free trade deal. Its basic premise is that the movement of goods, services, capital and labour should be free among the members \u2013 the so-called \u201cfour freedoms\u201d. Crucially, membership of the single market does not require membership of the EU. Norway, for example, is in the single market but not the EU.</p> <p>The idea \u2013 one championed by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s \u2013 is that creating a larger market should encourage more competition, more economies of scale, more specialisation, and ultimately higher productivity and economic growth.</p> <p>The notion that freer trade just requires zero or low tariffs is rooted in a 19th-century view of the world, whereby global trade mainly consisted of commodities and finished manufactured goods. In the modern world things are more complicated; supply chains cross borders and services play a much larger role in the economy. So-called non-tariff barriers play a much bigger role in blocking activity out of markets.</p> <p>To prevent this, the single market consists of a common set of regulatory regimes and mutual recognition of standards. This common regulatory framework is the origin of all sorts of scare stories on the European regulation of everything from lawnmowers to kettles. Agreeing to be part of the single market means trading off the ability to make your own regulations in return for membership of a larger economic area. Instead of the UK deciding on the regulation of \u2013 for example \u2013 cleaning products, cleaning products are regulated at the European level. In effect, some sovereignty is pooled in return for the chance of higher prosperity.</p> <p>A country does not need to be a member of the single market to have access to it \u2013 if access is taken to just mean the ability to sell goods or services into the EU. But it certainly helps. And while Brexiters are keen to talk up the fact that US, Chinese or Canadian companies regularly sell into Europe without being part of the single market, this misses the point in two important ways. First, they export (proportionately) less to the EU than the UK does. Second, and crucially, their industries have not developed on the premise that they are closely entwined into the European economy. The British car industry, for example, is deeply wired into cross-European border supply chains and reliant on the easy movement of goods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/brexit-britain-genesis-myth-stewart-lee-history-archaeology-education\">Brexit Britain is desperate for a decent genesis myth | Stewart Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people in Britain appear to wish for a kind of single market-lite, to keep the free movement of goods, services and capital on which many sectors depend, but to restrict the free movement of labour. That appears unlikely.</p> <p>If the British mantra over the past few months has been \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\" title=\"\">Brexit means Brexit</a>\u201d, the European one has been \u201cthe four freedoms are indivisible\u201d. That is to say a deal that pulls back from the freedom of movement of labour will also pull back from the other three freedoms. Offering Britain a special deal could easily open the floodgates to other countries keen to keep the bits of the union they like and discard the rest. The government\u2019s talk of introducing work permits for Europeans should be seen for what it is: a government plan to leave the single market.</p> <p>Leaving the single market will be disruptive for much of the British economy. The government will no doubt aim to get good market access for certain sectors (such as automotive manufacturing and finance) at the cost of others. But this should not be thought of as creating winners and losers. In the short term, there will not be any real winners \u2013 just sectors that get to keep arrangements similar to what they have already while others lose out. The politics of that will be tricky, perhaps almost as tricky as the current politics of immigration.</p>",

But what had induced Nissan to stay?<br></p> <p>Breaking with the PM\u2019s edict of not providing a running commentary, Clark delivered a clear signal that No 10 is aiming for a free trade relationship with the EU similar to the single market and customs union:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I said was that our objective would be to ensure that we would have continued access to the markets in Europe \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>As our colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/greg-clark-brexit-negotiations-andrew-marr-show-nissan-auto-industry\">Patrick Wintour noted,</a> Clark\u2019s clear implication was that Britain\u2019s target will be not just to avoid tariff and non-tariff barriers with the EU for carmakers but probably to seek similar deals for other industries in a sector-by-sector approach.</p> <p>The first point about this is that when it comes to the negotiations, part of the government plainly sees access to the EU single market as at least as important as migration controls and ending oversight from the European court of justice. That appears to be at odds with May\u2019s stated priorities.</p> <p>The second is that the logical inference from Clark\u2019s remarks is that he believes Britain should stay in the customs union \u2013 which is not necessarily the view of Liam Fox at the Department for International Trade. </p> <p>The third is that it is by no means clear \u2013 some would say highly unlikely \u2013 that the EU will be open to such sector-by-sector negotiations. </p> <p>And the final point is the potential cost of such an approach, not just in contributions to the EU budget but \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/30/nissans-post-brexit-deal-could-lead-to-colossal-bills-for-taxpayers\">as Nick Clegg pointed out \u2013 in the \u201ccolossal amounts\u201d</a> the taxpayer could end up paying to subsidise a whole series of such deals for different industry sectors.</p> <p>It does all, though, suggest that May\u2019s views on the desirability of remaining in \u2013 or as good as in \u2013 the single market might be closer to the ones she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/theresa-may-under-fire-following-leaked-brexit-recording\">revealed privately to Goldman Sachs bankers before the referendum</a> than to those she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">trumpeted at the Conservative party conference</a>. </p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s preferred Brexit may be softer than anyone thought \u2013 which could mean trouble ahead from the Brexiters. </p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>The big news from Brussels last week was that after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/eu-canada-free-trade-deal-ceta-in-jeopardy-belgium-wallonia-parliament-vote\">a fortnight of valiant last-gasp resistance</a> from the French-speaking Belgian region of Wallonia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\">the EU and Canada finally got to sign their free trade deal, known as Ceta</a>.</p> <p>The package, which gives the EU its first trade pact with a G7 economy, still has to go before national parliaments, but the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was delighted: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are setting standards which will determine globalisation in the coming years. Nothing in other trade agreements will be able to remain below the level of what we have reached today with Canada.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although May was at pains to say Britain would not seek to replicate any existing model in its future relationship with the EU, and Juncker saw \u201cno relation between what we are signing today and the Brexit issue\u201d, there were Brexit lessons aplenty in the Ceta saga.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important is that on a continent that seems increasingly sceptical about the value of trade deals, 38 national and regional assemblies will have a final say on the future UK-EU agreement \u2013 and several will seek to use it.</p> <p>As Guillaume Van der Loo, a trade expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/29/britain-must-learn-from-the-eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-saga\">told the Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin</a>, any Brexit trade deal will be political, and Britain will need to meet the concerns of each EU county and region:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Member states are no longer reluctant to put their foot in the door and stop an agreement in order to gain what they want.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the things France might well want is the end of the Le Touquet treaty under which Britain carries out border checks on French soil. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/calais-camp-demolition-begins-charities-call-protection-minors-children-unicef\">the migrant and refugee camp in Calais was finally demolished last week</a>, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of the treaty could become part of wider Brexit talks. </p> <p>France will be one of the loudest voices calling for a hard line if Britain opts for a hard Brexit. As Alain Jupp\u00e9, the man currently most likely to be the country\u2019s next president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/alain-juppe-france-managing-migrants-uk-calais-kent-border\">reminded the Guardian recently</a>, a \u201ccomplete renegotiation\u201d of Le Touquet could well be part of the mix. </p> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>At least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney</a>, Britain\u2019s most high-profile migrant worker, is going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">hang around for a year longer than he needed to</a>, until July 2019 \u2013 and he has the full backing of the PM.

All central bankers are replaceable,\u201d said Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cIt\u2019s about a government that attacks any disagreement. So they\u2019d put in a stooge.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also rallied to Carney\u2019s defence this week, saying his party would fight to preserve the central bank\u2019s independence.</p> <p>\u201cLabour gave the Bank of England independence to stop Tory chancellors leaving monetary policy to the whims of their backbenchers,\u201d McDonnell said, calling that independence \u201csacrosanct\u201d.</p> <p>His speech also issued new demands for the government not to pursue a sweetheart deal for the City at the expense of manufacturers and small businesses.</p> <p>(Unfortunately for McDonnell, instead of warning of the dangers of a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d, a slip of the tongue saw him rail against a \u201cbankers\u2019 breakfast\u201d, presumably kippers and champagne, which sounds rather delicious.)</p> <h2>You should also know that:</h2> <ul> <li>A high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/28/belfast-court-rejects-legal-challenges-brexit\">judge in Belfast rejected two of the first legal challenges to Brexit</a>, saying the 1998 Good Friday agreement could not be used to exempt Northern Ireland from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU.</li> <li>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-defies-brexit-slowdown-fears\">UK economy turned in a better than expected performance</a> after the Brexit vote, growing by 0.5% in the three months to end-September. </li> <li>Britain will need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/sir-simon-fraser-uk-interim-deal-eu-brexit-negotiations-foreign-office-article-50\">an interim EU deal and must accept the EU will exact an economic and political price</a> for Brexit, a former top Foreign Office official said.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/28/tony-blair-remain-voters-to-mobilise-against-brexit\">Tony Blair said remain voters should organise their opposition</a> to Brexit, saying: \u201cWe are the insurgents now.\u201d Lots of people said he should shut up. </li> <li>The number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/27/uk-university-applications-from-eu-down-9-ucas\">EU students applying for places on some of the most sought-after courses in the UK\u2019s leading universities</a> has dropped by 9%, Ucas said.</li> </ul> <h2>Read these:</h2> <p>In t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/30/theresa-may-lie-and-lied-to-become-prime-minister\">he Guardian, Nick Cohen argues that Theresa May lied to get her job as PM</a> \u2013 and is lying to us now, to make us believe she is acting in our best interests whereas she is in fact \u201ca prime minister of pretences\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She pretends that we should leave the EU, even though she knows we should remain a member of the single market. She offers us the illusion that we are taking back control, even as we lose our freedom to act. She cuts deals in secret, in the hope that the public will never realise that her land of make-believe is an expensive place to live.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brief but characteristically smart, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/what-fuss-over-mark-carney-tell-us-about-brexit-britain\">Stephen Bush in the New Statesman</a> says the kerfuffle over Carney\u2019s decision to stay or go reflects Britain\u2019s increased vulnerability on international markets in the wake of the Brexit vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If for the last four decades, Britain had the security \u2013 and the limitations \u2013 of a boat in the harbour, the country is about to exchange that for the freedom and vulnerability of a ship at sea \u2026 The future direction of British politics depends to a great extent on whether the 17 million who voted for leave feel that was part of the bargain \u2013 and if the 16 million who did not can be reconciled to that trade-off at all.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd0d2ad4-9d23-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a\">FT (paywall), Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau argues the government\u2019s Nissan deal offers a pointer to a possible soft Brexit solution</a>: a lengthy transition \u2013 say 10 years \u2013 followed by either a hard Brexit or some kind of EEA-style association agreement. </p> <p>The immigration issue, M\u00fcnchau says, can be dealt with in all sorts of creative ways \u2013 including simply imposing a five-year minimum residency requirement on NHS access and welfare benefits, pretty much as Germany has done: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Starting from where we are, the EEA is the best of the remaining options. It works for Nissan. It works for Scotland and Northern Ireland. And, most importantly, it will work for the prime minister.

Lightning storms and escapees couldn\u2019t dampen the spirits of the Top End\u2019s Melbourne Cup croc race. On the track - Mr Malcolm, Whinger, Tab, Mongrel, and Handbag. Mongrel and Mr Malcolm won the first two warm ups in an exciting speed-waddle to the outer hay bales. One, perhaps the same who sensed freedom earlier today, attempted a leap over the boundary to no avail.<br></p> <p>Fashion In The Bush, shoes optional, provided halftime entertainment.</p> <p>In the grand final, the wriggling mass of reptiles were held at bay by their Crocodylus Park handler as thunder rumbled overhead. The starting gun sounded, and they were off. Mostly. One needed a hurry up, which a barefooted, fascinator-wearing punter was happy to give, climbing over the bales to give him a nudge. </p> <p>But it was Tab who brought it home for his sponsor, Belinda Harris, from Melbourne. I asked how the race compared to her home town. \u201cAbsolutely loving it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is awesome.

So it\u2019s only fair that I share my own. The preamble to it as having a chip at the PM for his Cup tip. This will all make sense.</p> <p>Mr Turnbull yesterday did what all politicians must and picked his winner. Or, as it happens, two - Bondi Beach for it is in his electorate and Hartnell because it won the Turnbull Stakes. The more cynical among us may say this is reflective of the PM\u2019s predisposition for having several positions on matters of policy. And that he has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-09-23/turnbulls-roosters-gaffe-has-labor-crowing/519378\">form</a> as well with <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/afl/a/32771390/malcolm-turnbull-makes-cringeworthy-afl-grand-final-blunder/\">sport</a>. </p> <p>Anyway, I don\u2019t want to be nasty. All in good fun, Malc. Hope you are having a nice day. </p> <p>So, to my story. </p> <p>In 2009 I was advising the then-PM Rudd on, among other things, sport. So the process was went through and I landed on Shocking. He went on the radio the day before The Cup and backed that in, which was good of him. </p> <p>The next day? Turnbull, opposition leader at the time, took a Newspoll lead over Rudd for the first time. Ever. Indeed, it was the first Newspoll Labor had trailed in since Rudd became leader in 2006, nearly three years earlier.</p> <p>Rudd wasn\u2019t happy with me. Shocking? His horse? On a Newspoll day? What was I thinking? It wasn\u2019t entirely unreasonable, but I did encourage waiting to see how the race went. </p> <p>As we know, Shocking bolted it in. The next phone call moments after the race was from Rudd to thank me for the tip. The political news that night did include the poll, but began with the PM picking the Cup winner for the second time in three years. </p> <p>When I left his office some months later the brief was returned to me as a framed gift that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/9kUYHVNPKy/\">you can see here</a>.

It\u2019s not even 1pm.</p> <p>Back to fashions, which are the point of the day. Pom-poms, according to one of the fashions on the field hosts, are definitely trending this season, which sounds like something you\u2019d only say because your co-host is wearing pom-pom shoes and you want to make her feel better.</p> <p>A judge offers some tips to the crowd:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have to convey every single aspect of the look: the hair, the makeup, even the fragrance that you wear, although obviously we can\u2019t smell it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I must admit I failed to smell anyone when, but overlooking that fashion failure, here were some of my favourite looks from the crowd:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/callapilla/status/793258540953587712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Justin Scott is dressed like an old-timey gentleman, jodhpurs, boots and all, but in pastels.

Caulfield Cup run was pretty sound but 1kg from the top weights for a G1 maiden that has never been past 2400m is a bit much.</p> <p><strong>10 - Gallante:</strong> second to Jameka first up looks OK but nothing of note behind him, forgive Mooney Valley flop, but he\u2019s not up to this.</p> <p><strong>12 - Jameka:</strong> Old school Cup prep, two very good WFA runs to open her up, flogged second-raters in Naturalism, cracking Turnbull run and then a dominant Caulfield Cup win. Not terribly badly weighted after the penalty, nice draw, lots of ticks. My tip.</p> <p><strong>18 - Assign:</strong> This time last year was getting around in a BM90. Form is OK for third-string stayers, but no.</p> <p><strong>19 - Grey Lion:</strong> Solid at Geelong but his best win is a 3YO SWP. If you like Oceanographer and Qewy, I guess you give him a chance.</p> <p><strong>20 - Oceanographer:</strong> I don\u2019t think he beat much on Saturday. It looked impressive but he won\u2019t get that much galloping room against 23 opponents and will see plenty of rump steak before he gets going. He\u2019s progressive but it\u2019d be a bit embarrassing if something like this could come here and win.</p> <p>Jameka for me. Respect the Japanese, as always, but he hasn\u2019t won for three years. Big Orange is class and well weighted for his record, could be the one to break the curse on the hit-and-run raiders. </p> <p>Bondi Beach has only missed a place once, but they don\u2019t often win if they\u2019ve raced in this before. Hartnell isn\u2019t a two-mile horse, lay all day. Don\u2019t care how good Wicklow Brave is, the Butcher is back for his umpteenth poor Cup ride. Almandin is short for mine but can win.

  "<p>In April 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/22/thefarright.france\">stunned all of Europe</a> by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the French left \u2013 including communists, Greens and the Socialist party \u2013 threw their support behind the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jacques-chirac\">Jacques Chirac</a>, a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen\u2019s Front National (FN), depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 5 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/france.thefarright2\">Chirac won the election</a> with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. \u201cWe have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country \u2013 but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1969902.stm\">Chirac declared in his victory speech</a>. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, he lauded them for rejecting \u201cintolerance and demagoguery\u201d.</p> <p>But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.</p> <p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain \u2013 and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than Jean-Marie Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e5b905a162e3f32fa2a1be95646856b6e7cedfa/0_0_3824_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen addresses the Front National (FN) party\u2019s May day rally in Paris in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites \u2026 the Front National May day rally in Paris in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/SIPA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Le Pen\u2019s own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/front-national-wins-opening-round-in-frances-regional-elections\">upwards of 40% of the vote</a> in regions from Calais in the north to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in the south.

They have made a very public break with the symbols of the old right\u2019s past, distancing themselves from skinheads, neo-Nazis and homophobes. They have also deftly co-opted the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. They have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/25/the-ruthlessly-effective-rebranding-of-europes-new-far-right-podcast\">The ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe\u2019s new far right \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the left \u2013 from gay rights to women\u2019s equality and protecting Jews from antisemitism \u2013 as their own, by depicting Muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups.

Europe\u2019s new far right is poised to transform the continent\u2019s political landscape \u2013 either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years ago \u2013 the young, gay people, Jews, feminists \u2013 may join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac\u2019s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3\">was gunned down</a> by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as \u201cscapegoats\u201d. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn\u2019s eponymous party \u2013 the Pim Fortuyn List \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/16/eu.thefarright\">became the second largest in the Netherlands</a> with 17% of the vote.</p> <p>Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative.</p> <p>It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a \u201cbackwards\u201d and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections\">Danish People\u2019s Party</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/afd-leader-frauke-petry-criticised-comparing-migrants-compost-germany\">Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways.</p> <p>Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a US-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was \u201cdefending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,\u201d argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women\u2019s liberation and gay rights.</p> <p>Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in the late 1990s. The party\u2019s then-leader, Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. \u201cHe had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,\u201d said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I cold-shouldered him \u2026 He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garb \u2013 \u201ca form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/beyond-tolerance\">a New Yorker profile</a> once described it \u2013 he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e498f179bba391b90d276a86cb881e8f9d32ac93/128_291_1872_1123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pim Fortuyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pim Fortuyn was an electrifying figure in the Netherlands, a country known for its staid politics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/07/terrorism.religion\">Theo van Gogh was murdered</a> by a young Dutch-Moroccan, Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the Somali-born Dutch parliamentarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayaan-hirsi-ali\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> \u2013 a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services.</p> <p>The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Geert Wilders</a>, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein\u2019s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the country \u2013 and has remained so ever since.</p> <p>For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac\u2019s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn\u2019s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People\u2019s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12% of the vote \u2013 transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election\">Danish People\u2019s party leader demands border crackdown after election success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn\u2019s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them.</p> <p>The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats \u2013 promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: \u201cThey took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say.\u201d Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that \u201cthe best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence\u201d. He was wrong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/jean-marie-le-pen-fined-again-dismissing-holocaust-detail\">detail of history</a>\u201d into a genuine contender for the presidency.</p> <p>\u201cVoluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,\u201d Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. \u201cI fired them all \u2026 all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the FN\u2019s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party\u2019s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews\u2019 hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, \u201cyou will be attacked straight away,\u201d Rochedy said. \u201cThere is such self-discipline these days. They are so afraid they\u2019ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the party\u2019s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. \u201cToday our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop\u201d old tropes about fascists and racists. \u201cAt a certain point this argument loses its force,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause voters see clearly that there\u2019s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left \u2013 and other constituencies \u2013 who could never have imagined voting for her father\u2019s Front National.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bcb82ae9eac10389507825747a4270de85ccdb/0_242_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti on a FN campaign office reading \u2018Racism, xenophobia, Marine and co, clear off!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-racist graffiti on a FN campaign office \u2026 but Le Pen claims that \u2018this argument loses its force because voters see clearly that there\u2019s nothing in our platform that resembles fascism or racism\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Le Monde\u2019s Olivier Faye <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/04/12/l-attraction-en-hausse-du-front-national-aupres-de-la-communaute-gay_4900269_823448.html\">has written</a>, she is \u201ctrying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN \u2013 that of homophobia\u201d. And it is working:<strong> </strong>a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32% \u2013 up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012.</p> <p>As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: \u201cFor a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the<em> banlieues</em>,\u201d Le Pen told me. \u201cIn a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that.\u201d</p> <p>Among French voters threatened by the country\u2019s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,\u201d the prominent philosopher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/right-wing-new-reactionaries-stir-up-trouble-among-french-intellectuals\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, declared in January during <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/chroniques/juppe-finkielkraut-le-grand-debat-du-point-13-01-2016-2009511_2.php\">a debate</a> with the centre-right presidential candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that \u201cthe public good isn\u2019t in the clouds, it\u2019s made from tangible things \u2013 the French of Proust and Montaigne \u2026 the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy\u201d.</p> <p>Finkielkraut, a 67-year-old Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen\u2019s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago \u2013 that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac \u201csaved\u201d the republic from Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: \u201cThe future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,\u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2026 in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation \u2013 in the camp of respect, not that of rejection.\u201d</p> <p>Fourteen years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/why-does-france-keep-getting-attacked\">the terrorist attacks</a> on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. \u201cAnti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,\u201d he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it \u201cshould be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism\u201d. The French must, he insisted, \u201cavoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn\u2019t only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies.\u201d</p> <p>He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to \u201creconquer\u201d its \u201clost territories\u201d \u2013 by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. \u201cIntegrating people is not telling them \u2018You are how you are and we are how we are\u2019 \u2026 Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he warned darkly, \u201cat best we\u2019ll have secession and at worst civil war\u201d. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the \u201cplanned demise of Europe\u201d.</p> <p>Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of B\u00e9ziers, Mayor Robert M\u00e9nard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/algeria-insurrection-bombings-independence-france\">Algerian independence</a>. M\u00e9nard comes from a family of <em>pieds-noirs</em>, French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a \u201ccapitulation\u201d, and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff0611bde0fba150bc394adf309650b133d88f7/0_271_4135_2481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine le Pen with young FN supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU, and the elderly voted to leave, in France it\u2019s the opposite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Pennant/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France \u2013 who dream of an era they never witnessed \u2013 than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen\u2019s victory. \u201cThey are afraid of leaving the euro,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are afraid of huge changes.\u201d Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. \u201cThey just want to go back 30 years,\u201d he said of his erstwhile colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a discourse that doesn\u2019t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right \u2013 the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe.</p> <p>As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a Liverpool-born academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/france-power-elitism-peter-gumbel\">many of them</a> graduates of the ultra-elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration \u2013 \u201care so disconnected from ordinary people\u201d that even former Marxists won\u2019t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,\u201d Hussey said. \u201cThis is a very communist way of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters \u201cused to be socialists, but they aren\u2019t any more\u201d, she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a socialist concept,\u201d she insisted \u2013 Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich.</p> <p>\u201cI defend fraternity \u2013 the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks.\u201d And she has seen results. She points to the northern Pas-de-Calais region. \u201cIt was socialist-communist for 80 years,\u201d she says. \u201cI won 45%.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the same time as Marine Le Pen<strong> was</strong> working to \u201cde-demonise\u201d the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam.</p> <p>Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an \u201c<a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-netherlands-idUSKCN0RA0WY20150910\">Islamic invasion</a>\u201d \u2013 the sort of comments that landed him in court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">on charges of inciting racial hatred</a>, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression.</p> <p>The presence of \u201cmasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 across Europe\u201d, Wilders warned at the peak of last year\u2019s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to \u201cour prosperity, our security, our culture and identity\u201d. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders\u2019s warning, attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/thousands-riot-in-small-dutch-town-over-plan-for-asylum-seeker-centre\">block the resettlement of asylum seekers</a> in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff\u2019s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02d25bd71d105799a7fe9384e3d0015ea45140/0_0_4308_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2010 rally in support of Geert Wilders during his trial for inciting racial hatred, with posters reading \u2018Freedom Yes, Islamisation No\u2019 and \u2018Geert is Great\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and Moroccan-born Dutch citizens became \u201cMuslims\u201d. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance \u2013 wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan \u2013 became politically loaded.</p> <p>The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can\u2019t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes.</p> <p>Wilders\u2019s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees \u2013 one of his latest memes is simply \u201cDe-Islamise\u201d \u2013 to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away.</p> <p>By framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left \u2013 including anti-racism and anti-colonialism \u2013 have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. \u201cIdealism has been bureaucratised,\u201d argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cAnd when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it.\u201d That\u2019s why there is such a strong anti-PC tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/geert-wilders-trial-throws-netherlands-divisions-in-sharp-relief\">Geert Wilders trial throws Netherlands' divisions in sharp relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Marine Le Pen\u2019s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (\u201cNo Style\u201d), a popular Breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. \u201cIt is massively important,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Tilburg University\u2019s Merijn Oudenampsen, \u201clike a social movement\u201d. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn\u2019s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of \u201creactors\u201d on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning.</p> <p>The right\u2019s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and \u201cyou were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up\u201d. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. \u201cAs soon as you say anything other than \u2018immigration is a problem\u2019 or \u2018Islam is the cause of terrorism\u2019 \u2026 the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you.\u201d</p> <p>A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, \u201cthe economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture \u2013 but none of them have any idea about theology\u201d. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today\u2019s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left \u2013 which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh\u2019s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a Marxist,\u201d the security official quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking hard to be a salafi.\u201d</p> <p>As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right\u2019s tirades about \u201cIslamisation\u201d. These days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives \u2013 the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. \u201cThere is a sense that, \u2018We are welcoming and then they do this,\u2019 says Bas Heijne. \u201cThey have been terribly let down in their good intentions.\u201d And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened \u2013 and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims.</p> <p>The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the Moroccan-born Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/12/07/parades-end-2\">first joined in Amsterdam\u2019s legendary gay pride parade</a>, he was, as he puts it, the \u201cfirst hetero-active Muslim\u201d to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, \u201cOh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,\u201d he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did.</p> <p>But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch\u2019s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them.</p> <p>In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders\u2019s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have new enemies and we need new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe\u2019s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. \u201cAnne Frank wasn\u2019t betrayed by the Germans,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut by Dutch people. Regular Dutch.\u201d Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. \u201cThe trains for the Jews will always come,\u201d he added, ominously. \u201cI\u2019d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains.\u201d</p> <p>He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. \u201cIf I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I\u2019d be very uneasy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It\u2019s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. \u201cEvery Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,\u201d he told me menacingly. \u201cWilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right VVD in the 1990s \u2013 and was briefly Wilders\u2019 boss when he was a young aide in the party office \u2013 the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base: \u201cThey made a major mistake,\u201d he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with \u201cthe choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born \u2026 and they\u2019ve paid for it dearly\u201d. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10.</p> <p>Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. \u201cTheir message to the Labour party,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018You ignored us. You let it happen.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Danish People\u2019s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats\u2019 traditional base \u2013 people who fear that the \u201cbread will be buttered more thinly\u201d, as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485d0c998c114015e268653a91c652c962a01076/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People\u2019s Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DPP has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. S\u00f8ren Espersen, the DPP\u2019s deputy leader, doesn\u2019t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. \u201cWhen one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,\u201d he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. \u201cAnd why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he\u2019s done it.\u201d</p> <p>The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The 41-year-old Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party\u2019s political misfortunes.</p> <p>For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant \u2013 or majority unemployed \u2013 he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party\u2019s leaders: \u201cMayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change.\u201d But the party leadership \u201cshut their eyes\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/muhammad-cartoons\">the Muhammad cartoons</a>. In 2005, the editors at Jyllands-Posten, Denmark\u2019s largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months \u2013 through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams \u2013 the cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. Suddenly, the DPP\u2019s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called \u201cDemocratic Muslims\u201d in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/26/danish-cartoons-muhammad-politiken-apology\">Danish newspaper apologises in Muhammad cartoons row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. \u201cWe social democrats must accept that there is a clash,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help \u2026 but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state.\u201d Frederiksen continued: \u201cMy position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism \u2013 the sort of place that <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/\">Bernie Sanders liked to mention</a> at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/danish-parliament-approves-plan-to-seize-assets-from-refugees\">jewellery law</a>\u201d, which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00a31,200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. \u201cThe goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,\u201d he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. \u201cMore important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,\u201d he added. And it wasn\u2019t just the DPP and government who supported it \u2013 the Social Democrats voted for it, too.</p> <p>Bent Melchior, Denmark\u2019s 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior\u2019s family paid the equivalent of \u201calmost a year\u2019s rent of a six-room flat\u201d just for his own passage. \u201cDenmark is not a poor country, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Melchior says. \u201cThere\u2019s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>The road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor.</p> <p>Herlev\u2019s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. \u201cWe have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,\u201d Petersen warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7662fe0c7e25d4f00611391611d0c4f03cfc2d92/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest against denmark cartoons in iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper led to protests across the world in 2006, the DPP\u2019s anti-Islamic rhetoric gained more traction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government \u2013 one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state\u2019s integration policy have failed to see. \u201cA lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,\u201d Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. \u201cIf your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,\u201d he argues.</p> <p>Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them \u2013 assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have consequences for the politicians \u2026 because they don\u2019t have the right to vote.\u201d Either way, it plays into the DPP\u2019s argument. \u201cImmigrants can\u2019t do right,\u201d said Gyldal Petersen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unemployed they\u2019re a burden to society. When they\u2019re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year\u2019s French election or Wilders\u2019 PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties \u2013 and media institutions \u2013 has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back.</p> <p>Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won \u2013 regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s elections. \u201cThe PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate.\u201d</p> <p>If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits \u2013 and flaws \u2013 of their policies and counter their messages of fear.</p> <p>Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/25/brexit-vote-poor-elite\">one more thing nobody asked them about</a>. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as Jean-Marie Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory.<strong> </strong>In a park near Calais\u2019 castle-like town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town\u2019s centre-right mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/1000-children-left-in-calais-refugee-camp-say-charities\">it was dismantled this month</a>. \u201cThose who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren\u2019t French, can do whatever they want,\u201d they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is \u201ctoo soft\u201d.</p> <p>If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. \u201cThey\u2019re sending them to all the little villages in France,\u201d says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, \u201cin two years the village will be dead\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/birth-of-populism-donald-trump\">Us v Them: the birth of populism | John B Judis | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. I met Rudy Vercucque and Yohann Faviere, the local FN leaders, on a blustery morning in June outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting EU dignitary.

Calais depends on British tourism and revenues are down sharply. The result is crippling economic and social malaise: \u201cFind a doctor who wants to move to Calais.

  "<p>Banging on about Brexit five months after the referendum may be boring to Brexiters who have wrapped themselves in the red, white and blue flag of the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d. But it is such a threat to universities it can\u2019t just be tidied away into a box labelled \u201csummer madness\u201d. The threat comes in three parts. The first can be managed, although with difficulty; the other two are more deadly.</p> <p>First, the threat to the UK\u2019s participation in European research programmes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/13/government-urged-to-protect-eu-student-exchange-scheme\" title=\"\">student exchange schemes such as Erasmus</a>. The government has given a semi-solid guarantee that research programmes will be protected, up to 2020 at any rate. The future of exchange schemes will depend on the willingness of the UK to contribute to the cost \u2013 and the enthusiasm for paying for a student mobility programme so intimately identified with the rejected \u201cEuropean project\u201d may be limited.</p> <p>Closely related is the future of staff and (non-Erasmus) students from other parts of the EU. Both are crucial. Teachers, and especially researchers, from the EU play a key role in maintaining the UK\u2019s envious position in global league tables, about which we love to brag. Other European students fill deficits in domestic demand, typically in science and engineering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/546aq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2740607\"            data-video-name=\"Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC Radio 4/TODAY \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e3afe0e4b011f2eb7120d9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_KP-29359875.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/22/160922radio4richardson_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/22/oxford-university-vice-chancellor-research-funding-brexit-audio\">Oxford vice chancellor worried about post-Brexit funding \u2013\u00a0audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is difficult to see even a Brexit government kicking out established staff from the rest of Europe, or placing significant obstacles in their way. But other EU students are a different matter. They are likely to have to pay international student fees. But, because England already charges its own students the highest fees in the world in public universities, the gap between home (and currently EU) student fees and those paid by international students is much less than in the past \u2013 about \u00a34,000 rather than more than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The second threat is much deadlier. The UK is now established as a nasty country in the world\u2019s imagination. No amount of flummery from the foreign secretary about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/786617722989846528\" title=\"\">\u201copenness\u201d</a> can cover that up. Nor can rather more honest claims by universities that they are open to all, Europe and the wider world, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">remain votes</a> in the referendum in university cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/27/universities-high-price-eu-exit-scientific-capability\">Universities will pay a high price now our future has been voted down | Peter Scott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is difficult to imagine why talented scholars and scientists, and students for that matter, should want to make their careers or study in a country unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\" title=\"\">admit a handful of refugee children without a tabloid firestorm</a> demanding dental checks. Even before the referendum our inability to evoke a moral response to global distress worthy of our history was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-government-s-shameful-response-to-the-refugee-crisis-in-four-charts-a6814391.html\" title=\"\">deeply shaming</a>. To Orwell, England was like a family with the wrong members in control \u2013 and so it increasingly seems since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The image and ethos of a country matter even if, as we must hope by relying on our sense of fair play, the direst consequences are avoided. German universities, probably the world\u2019s best before 1914, took at least three generations to recover their eminence and excellence after the world wars, the Nazis and the Holocaust. In a milder example, during the George W Bush neo-con era US universities lost out to rivals, including the UK.</p> <p>The third threat relates to \u201ctaking back control\u201d, one of the Brexit mantras. The EU has never been good at \u201ccontrol\u201d, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">veto of the EU-Canada deal by the Walloon parliament in Belgium</a> has demonstrated. Instead, it has a political culture characterised by compromise and consensus. The language of&#xa0;Europe is littered with \u201c-ities\u201d: mutuality, solidarity, subsidiarity \u2026&#xa0;Power is diffused, for historical and cultural reasons we all understand.</p> <p>But this EU culture has always been at odds with that elective dictatorship, the UK constitution. Fundamental principles, entrenched rights, legal scrutiny of political decisions, these had never been the English way (they may see things differently in Scotland); instead we rely on precedent and convention. These have protected the independence of the BBC, the courts \u2013 and the universities.</p> <p>The danger is that Brexit will further empower the strong state of which the prime minister is an admirer. There is no better example than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/07/universities-higher-education-bill-award-degrees\" title=\"\">higher education and research bill</a> currently before parliament. Safeguards are being swept aside and conventions ignored, as the secretary of state accumulates unprecedented powers over universities.</p> <p>There will no longer be even the semblance of a buffer body between universities and the state when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/30/hefce-buffer-ministers-universities-higher-education-funding-council-for-england\" title=\"\">Higher Education Funding Council</a> is replaced by the Office for Students. The&#xa0;dual-support system, which distinguishes between core research funding and research council grants, cannot long survive when both come from the same source, UK Research and Innovation (headed by a civil servant not a scientist). Universities can be stripped of their degree-awarding powers by ministerial fiat. A frightening demonstration of who, post-referendum, is \u201ctaking back control\u201d.</p>",

The IRS views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income - which would normally mean that after the floundering of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, Trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strategy - known among tax practitioners as a \u2018stock-for-debt swap\u2019 - relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.</p> <p>Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Trump campaign dismissed the Times\u2019 allegations, which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cYour e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\u201d Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks told the New York Times. \u201cYour thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe.

But a number of polling and election law experts cast doubts on the methodology and suggested the process could be a smokescreen for voter intimidation.</p> <p>The Republican nominee has for months warned supporters of a \u201crigged election\u201d and encouraged them to monitor polling areas in cities such as St Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia. The lawsuits, filed by state democratic parties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada would cover many of the cities Stone said he intended to target.</p> <p>The filings argue that such efforts, along with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, could violate both the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices in the American south and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlawed intimidation against African American voters.</p> <p>Election law experts said it was unclear whether courts would issue a broad order, as requested in the filings, to simply prevent voter intimidation, but could look in more detail at the temporary restraining order requested against Stone\u2019s exit polling.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be useful in getting the word out about these activities and secondly getting the [Republican state] parties and [Trump] campaign on record saying they will not engage in these activities,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California and whose <a href=\"http://electionlawblog.org/?p=88351\">Election Law blog first reported the lawsuits on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The Republican National Committee has been under a consent decree since the 1981 gubernatorial election in New Jersey when the group sent armed off-duty law enforcement officers to patrol polls in minority neighborhoods. These volunteers wore arm bands that identified them as an unofficial \u201cBallot Security Task Force\u201d and erected posters warning against voting fraud. The RNC dismissed the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d last week.</p> <p>Stone\u2019s exit pollers, self-titled \u201cvote protectors\u201d, had originally planned to use similar non-official identification badges, until these were removed from the organisation\u2019s website late last week.

Because of security concerns, little information about this time has previously been made public:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>McMullin joined the CIA as a student trainee while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. He would alternate semesters between the university and training at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. During that time, he spent a year in Israel and Jordan learning Arabic. He also worked for a refugee resettlement program run by the United Nations.</p> <p>After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA\u2019s directorate of operations, which runs clandestine missions abroad. He was in a computer training class at Langley headquarters when the 9/11 attacks occurred. After that, McMullin\u2019s 18-month training to be an undercover operative was sped up, and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. The specific country remains classified to protect his contacts there.</p> <p>The CIA station chief who supervised McMullin in his first overseas assignment told me that McMullin stood out among all the new case officers because of his insistence on going outside the safe confines of the embassy to meet and develop human- intelligence assets. As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage.</p> <p>... McMullin served his later years as an undercover officer in Iraq while the U.S. military was battling a brutal Sunni insurgency and collecting intelligence on what was then called al-Qaeda in Iraq but is now the Islamic State. McMullin worked in Iraq until 2010, when the country achieved a degree of stability and the terrorist threat was temporarily minimized.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58177231e4b08d944ba4caa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-31T16:37:02.264Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CNN 'completely uncomfortable' with leaked Clinton debate question</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN is \u201ccompletely uncomfortable\u201d with news that acting DNC head Donna Brazile allegedly leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas released a statement on the revelations from today\u2019s latest Wikileaks release of emails supposedly from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, that show Brazile alerted Clinton that a question on the Flint water crisis would be asked during her debate with Bernie Sanders. </p> <p>Pratapas\u2019 statement reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile\u2019s resignation as a CNN contributor.

We will need assistance with travel documents out of France.

They are children with no relatives in the UK but who are deemed eligible to travel to the UK as a result of their vulnerability.</p> <p> This new rescue mission has emerged amid growing concern for the welfare of those still in France. It is not clear whether some of the children have already been moved out of Calais to other parts of France.</p> <p>The children have been housed in containers on the site of the former refugee camp. Each container has 12 beds but there are reports of 20 children in each container with some sleeping on tables and on the floor with concerns raised about shortages of food and water. </p> <p>Efforts to bring some of the children to the UK stalled on Saturday after the French authorities reportedly asked the British authorities to suspend their work in the Calais camp for several days.</p> <p>A French embassy source told the Guardian: \u201cNegotiations are still under way with the British government in terms of how the children\u2019s applications are processed.

Those forced to flee persecution need and deserve conducive conditions of protection, and a sustainable long-term solution.\u201d</p> <p>Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, said on Tuesday the proposed ban was \u201cthe last piece of the work that we have to do to clean up the chaos after Labor\u2019s border protection policies\u201d.</p> <p>Albrecht said the policy of offshore processing did not diminish Australia\u2019s legal responsibility for people who sought asylum in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/24/nauru-detention-the-abc-and-us-putting-misconceptions-about-australia-and-refugees-to-rest\">Nauru, detention, the ABC and us: putting misconceptions about Australia and refugees to rest | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia retained responsibility for refugees and asylum seekers, even when they were transferred to another state under bilateral arrangements. And where transfer arrangements were used, Australia retained the obligation to ensure their wellbeing and to find adequate long-term solutions for those found to be refugees, Albrecht said.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s refugee agency maintains that asylum seekers should have their claims processed in the territory of the state from which asylum is sought or which otherwise has jurisdiction over them. In the case of those now held on Manus Island or Nauru, that would mean processing on Australian soil.</p> <p>There is significant disquiet politically at the government\u2019s proposed bill \u2013 the Labor leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/labor-mps-oppose-refugee-ban-despite-leadership-saying-it-will-wait-and-see\">Bill Shorten, described it as \u201cridiculous \u2026 on its face\u201d </a>\u2013 and it may breach Australia\u2019s international legal obligations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/en-au/3b66c2aa10\">Article 31 of the refugees convention</a> \u2013 to which Australia is a party and legally bound \u2013 prohibits states from imposing any sanction or punishment on an asylum seeker because of the way in which they arrived, or imposing any permanent restriction on movement.</p> <p>\u201cStates shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who \u2026 enter or are present in their territory without authorisation,\u201d the convention states.</p> <p>\u201cStates shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Barns of the Australian Lawyers Alliance said if the bill were passed it was \u201clikely to be scrutinised critically by the high court\u201d and could be ruled unconstitutional.</p> <p>\u201cThe court has made it clear the government has international obligations and that it is not above the law when it comes to people\u2019s rights. To ban a person simply on the basis of mode of transport might be a step too far.\u201d</p> <p>The government has defended the proposed legislation, with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, saying the legislation did not breach any of Australia\u2019s international obligations.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal advice is very clear \u2026 there are no constitutional issues here \u2026 and we are absolutely confident in terms of the constitutionality and that we meet our international obligations.</p> <p>Dutton said the new law would enable third-country resettlement. \u201cWe are keen to get people off to third countries if they can\u2019t return to their country of origin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working with a number of countries now.</p> <p> \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is if somebody is to go to a third country that they apply for a tourist visa or some other way to circumvent what the government\u2019s policy is by coming back to Australia from that third country.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed legislation is widely seen as a pre-emptive move ahead of an announcement on third-country resettlement options for those held on Manus and Nauru. It would be a legislative instrument to prevent people resettled elsewhere from then applying to come to Australia by another migration channel.</p> <p>Both offshore detention centres have been plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/17/australian-immigration-regime-on-nauru-an-open-air-prison-and-akin-to-torture-says-amnesty\">systemic physical violence and sexual assault of detainees</a>, epidemic rates of mental health damage, and acts of self-harm and suicide, including public self-immolation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within the upper echelons of the immigration department, it is widely accepted the two offshore islands are unsustainable solutions, and, in the words of one department official \u201cthey are ticking time bombs\u201d, for further acts of self-harm, violence and unrest, unless other options are found.</p> <p>The government is furiously working diplomatic channels to secure a third-country resettlement deal and, internally at least, believes a deal with a new country can be brokered in coming months.</p> <p>Publicly the government maintains that Cambodia is a viable resettlement option for those on Nauru but it is conceded inside the department that the attempt to encourage people to go there has been a catastrophic and costly \u2013 more than $40m \u2013 failure, resettling only one person so far.</p> <p>Ministers have resolutely refused to be drawn on possible resettlement countries, but the US, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand and Malaysia (which would now be legal after being struck down by the high court in 2012) are those most commonly discussed.</p> <p>But it is understood Australia\u2019s search for a suitable third-country has extended across the globe and it appears likely any deal might need to involve several countries to clear both islands.</p> <p>The rhetoric surrounding the proposed legislation, reinforcing the position that those who arrive by boat will never be allowed into Australia, is seen by the government as vital \u201cmessaging\u201d to potential asylum seekers in the region who might be willing to consider a boat journey to Australia.</p> <p>It is also aimed at those on Nauru and Manus, aimed at encouraging them to accept a third-country resettlement deal when it is offered.</p>"
