  "<p>Richard Di Natale has warned that the Greens will not support superannuation reforms if the government waters down a package designed to limit the use of super as a tax minimisation strategy.</p> <p>The warning creates a dilemma for the treasurer, Scott Morrison, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/22/scott-morrison-rejects-backbench-call-for-1m-non-concessional-super-cap\">being pressured by conservative colleagues to lift the lifetime cap</a> on non-concessional after-tax super contributions above the proposed level of $500,000.</p> <p>Leaving the proposed cap at $500,000 could risk a backbench revolt in the Coalition, but watering down the changes may hamper the government\u2019s ability to win crossbench support to pass the changes in the Senate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/sarah-hanson-young-will-keep-fighting-for-refugees-despite-losing-portfolio\">Sarah Hanson-Young 'will keep fighting' for asylum seekers despite losing portfolio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Di Natale has also defended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/sarah-hanson-young-will-keep-fighting-for-refugees-despite-losing-portfolio\">the Greens\u2019 frontbench reshuffle</a>, which saw Sarah Hanson-Young lose the immigration portfolio and Adam Bandt trade treasury for the climate change portfolio.</p> <p>Asked on Radio National on Friday if the Greens would support super changes, Di Natale said: \u201cWell if they keep watering them down, if Malcolm Turnbull keeps making concessions to the hard right of his party, we won\u2019t support them.\u201d</p> <p>The Greens leader accepted the need for reform. He advocated taxing contributions to make the system more progressive as the \u201cfairest and most effective\u201d way to fix the system.</p> <p>\u201cThe great danger here is Malcolm Turnbull being so compromised within his own party, [it] looks like he\u2019s making more and more concessions to the hard right and what we\u2019re going to end up with is a very watered-down version and, certainly, if that happens we won\u2019t support it.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/bill-shorten-offers-malcolm-turnbull-compromise-on-superannuation-changes\">offered the government a compromise on super reform</a> to remove the backdating on the $500,000 lifetime cap in return for lower thresholds for high-income contributions.</p> <p>Morrison immediately rebuffed the offer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/liberal-mp-criticises-scott-morrison-should-reach-out-to-labor-on-superannuation\">prompting criticism from the backbench MP Russell Broadbent for failing to reach a compromise</a>.</p> <p>Di Natale said Hanson-Young, who wanted to keep the job, had been doing well in the immigration portfolio but after nine years in the job it was time to \u201crefresh and reinvigorate the team\u201d.</p> <p>On ABC News Breakfast he said he was \u201cvery keen for Sarah to work on a super-education portfolio\u201d including early childhood education, schools and higher education.</p> <p>Di Natale defended giving Hanson-Young the economic portfolios of finance and trade portfolios, despite her struggling to explain superannuation policy during the election. \u201cShe is actually very talented,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for her to demonstrate that she is somebody who can engage in the economic debate in a really sophisticated way. It\u2019s hardly a hanging offence for people to make a mistake during the election campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Di Natale accepted there was a structural deficit in the budget that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>Noting the treasurer\u2019s speech about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/scott-morrison-hits-out-at-taxed-nots-and-warns-of-recession-risk\">Australia being divided into the \u201ctaxed and the taxed-nots\u201d</a>, the Greens leader said Morrison had neglected to address tax avoiders and tax concessions such as negative gearing that benefit high-income earners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/hannah-gadsby-marriage-equality-plebiscite-will-ruin-and-end-some-young-lives\">Hannah Gadsby: marriage equality plebiscite 'will ruin and end some young lives'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the government was \u201ceffectively proposing to abolish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency\u201d through a $1.3bn cut.</p> <p>He also said his party would announce its position on the same-sex marriage plebiscite \u201cvery shortly\u201d.

Having finally regained independence and control over Poland after 123 years of military occupation, Poles had no intention whatsoever of fleeing the land their ancestors had fought so hard for.</p> <p>Having fought in the Atlantic and the Battle of Britain, they settled across the UK; their tightly-packed bags remaining the only symbol of their homeland and their hope of return to Poland. </p> <p>Although they admired their new country, they wanted one thing above everything else: to go home. The packed bag was always ready, as if they were just waiting for a connecting flight; waiting for the opportunity to return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a9c1da85de8aecdd71e355ac2c1ed45f25f9ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a9c1da85de8aecdd71e355ac2c1ed45f25f9ef/217_201_2112_2113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of Polish immigrants work at a farm in Gloucestershire in 1955.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of Polish immigrants work at a farm in Gloucestershire in 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bert Hardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as a Moscow-imposed government took power in Poland, it was clear they would need to wait longer.

  "<p>It is hard to anticipate whether Turkey\u2019s unprecedented military incursion into Syria this week will change the dynamics of the multiple wars that have ravaged the region and put civilians through hell. If things already seemed complicated in the Middle East, they may have just become even more so. What started on Wednesday ranks as the largest Turkish military operation inside Syrian territory since the civil war began five years ago. A dozen tanks, reportedly followed by a bus transporting Syrian rebels, rolled into northern Syria to drive Islamic State forces from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/turkey-and-us-unite-to-oust-isis-curb-kurds-syria\" title=\"\">the town of Jarablus</a>, one of their last footholds on the Turkish-Syrian border. Today Turkey sent more tanks in and told the YPG Kurdish armed group it had one week to retreat from the border areas.</p> <p>Western anti-Isis coalition forces facilitated Operation Euphrates Shield with air strikes. It came days after a terrorist attack killed 54 people at a Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border \u2013 highlighting both how exposed Turkey has become to the insurgency and the multiple pressures the Kurds face.</p> <p>Although Turkey carried out this operation with US back-up, its priority \u2013 evident in other recent foreign manoeuvrings, such as detente with Russia and overtures to the Syrian president, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-syria-idUSTRE7AL0WJ20111122\" title=\"\">having previously urged him to quit</a> \u2013 is to curtail the territorial ambitions of Kurdish combatants, some of which happen to be US proxies in the war against Isis. Turkey is in effect deploying forces in Syria with US support, with the aim of pushing back Kurdish groups that the US also supports. The US has equipped and trained local forces to fight Isis, under the label \u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\u201d. They are dominated by Kurds, but include anti-Assad rebels. Nuances easily get lost: united against Isis, these groups are less so when it comes to confronting Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces. Little noticed in Aleppo\u2019s plight is the fact that Syrian Kurdish fighters have played no small role in the siege of the city. The YPG has been more of a problem for the Syrian opposition than for the Assad regime.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s advance now puts these Kurdish groups under pressure, especially given its warming relations with Russia. Moscow may have qualms about Kurdish groups working tightly with the US and its protest against Turkey\u2019s move into Syria may have less to do with protecting the Kurds than keeping the upper hand in Syria\u2019s quagmire. As the Jarablus operation unfolded, US vice-president Joe Biden was in Ankara to attempt to woo Turkey back from Russia. Relations between the US and its Nato ally have been fraught since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-ankara-istanbul\" title=\"\">July\u2019s coup attempt</a>, but getting them back on track now seems a shared objective. So, having used Kurdish forces to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/isis-kidnaps-human-shields-manbij-syria\" title=\"\">take Manbij</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/us-military-photos-syria-soldiers-fighting-isis\" title=\"\">stalk Raqqa</a>, Mr Biden warned the YPG to move back across the Euphrates or lose US support.</p> <p>Syria is racked by multiple wars in which protagonists claiming to share common goals pursue their own distinct priorities. Turkey is part of the anti-IS coalition but wants to fight Kurdish militants in Syria as it does the PKK in its own south-eastern regions. Its role has shrunk from active intervention on multiple fronts to more narrowly defending its border. Even the renewed enthusiasm for Syrian rebels is not about toppling Mr Assad, but ensuring that the Kurds do not prop him up. Russia claims its military involvement is all about combatting Isis but has done much more to ensure the survival of the Assad regime. Syrian Kurdish groups have been \u201crecruited\u201d by the US against Isis, but their ultimate goal is to carve out an autonomous region. Anti-Assad revolutionaries have all along wanted to get rid of a dictatorship but are increasingly associated with radical Islamist groups, largely for a desperate lack of other options. The US has prioritised bombing Isis but at the expense of forging a solution to Syria\u2019s civil war, which has helped Isis grow. With its tanks, Turkey has played one more card in a multi-pronged war that has created immense suffering and has no end in sight.</p>",

With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by.

For years these socially dysfunctional millennials have sheltered behind their bedroom laptops, watching porn, sending abusive tweets (anonymously) and eating pizza in their underpants. Mainstream politics \u2013 both left and right \u2013 has previously ignored this developing phenomenon. But with Donald Trump they have found a champion who understands their anger. And they have become his digital vanguard. Tonight in Nevada, Hilary Clinton will give a major speech linking Trump to the alt right. And&nbsp;with this speech the alt right will further enter the political mainstream.</p> <p>One account of their rise to political significance cites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/03/gamergate-corruption-games-anita-sarkeesian-zoe-quinn\" title=\"\">the 2014 Gamergate controversy</a>.

These burgeoning alt right gamers have little in common with traditional Republican conservatives and their evangelical Christian values. They don\u2019t go to church. Indeed, many are aggressively atheistic.</p> <p>Rather, they come together on blogs and online community forums like 4chan where they fulminate against social justice warriors \u2013 SJWs \u2013 who want to spoil their fun. They hate the liberal apparatus of the state, including the mainstream press and Ivy League academia that they collectively dub as The Cathedral. And they hate normies \u2013 normal people \u2013 and their repressive political philosophy, democracy. Instead of democracy, they propose that the US should be run like a large company with a CEO at its head, preferably one from Silicon Valley. Someone like PayPal founder Peter Thiel, whose views include : \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/22/peter-thiel-paypal-donald-trump-silicon-valley-libertarian\" title=\"\">I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.</a>\u201d But Trump will do for now. Oh, and only intelligent people should be in charge, and that means white people.</p> <p>\u201cEver since Mill wrote his response to Carlyle on The Negro Question, writers of the English Protestant tradition have been defending the blatantly theological position that \u2018all men are created equal\u2019,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11434098/alt-right-explained\" title=\"\">wrote the computer programmer and alt-right hero Curtis Yarvin</a> under his pen name Mencius Moldbug. He continued: \u201cNote that exactly the same rhetorical strategy can prove the existence of God or the Flying Spaghetti Monster for that matter.\u201d</p> <p>Traditional Republicans are now regularly dismissed by the revolting term cuckservatives \u2013 an insult first used by white supremacists of Christian conservatives who, they said, have allowed themselves to be cuckolded by racial minorities. They darkly summon the idea of interracial sex \u2013 a theme that was also an obsessive preoccupation of the KKK. And its meaning broadens out to refer to those who witness their country being taken away and don\u2019t have the balls to do anything to stop it. That\u2019s why they want a US version of Putin. Because they don\u2019t think he would allow that to happen.</p> <p>Of course, racism has a long and inglorious history in US politics. But it now has a very new iteration in the nerdy tech-savvy generation of the alt right. Racism 2.0. They don\u2019t speak of eugenics but rather of maintaining \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d. And they have a thing about IQ tests showing that white people are cleverer than others.</p> <p>I know, we\u2019ve heard all this crap many times before. But there is something new here. For in cross-pollinating with the anonymity and viciousness of the internet, with porn and video games replacing Christianity as the common language in which conservatives talk to each other, with openly anti-democratic impulses being justified as rationality, the virus of racism is capable of spreading as never before.

And could I do it without having uncomfortably close encounters with the sometimes sour, hirsute locals: grizzlies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f649e4de835b9e33d9ca86dcbedbccf6aa201c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f649e4de835b9e33d9ca86dcbedbccf6aa201c/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grizzly bear in Yellowstone National Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grizzly bear in Yellowstone National Park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diana Robinson Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> It wasn\u2019t going to be easy \u2013 it would take a week of backpacking to hike in and out \u2013 but I\u2019d done several long trips into Yellowstone and thoroughly looked forward to this one. I chose Dave Gaillard, a long, lean, carrot-headed scientist as my partner. An indefatigable backpacker, Gaillard was a specialist in endangered species, namely the wolf, wolverine, grizzly and lynx. These are species that only thrive where there are very few humans. All four of them had been exterminated from 95% of their natural habitat, only surviving in the most remote pockets of America\u2019s backcountry. The lynx and wolverine were already so rare that the chances of us seeing either was small. But we had high hopes of spotting wolves and, at a distance, grizzlies. </p> <p> Our plan was simple: hike through the largest roadless area in the lower US, an 80-mile jaunt exploring the most unknown part of our most well-known national park.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u201cBest watch yerselves!

It was late October, snow had fallen and the hunting season was in full swing. We weren\u2019t on the trail 10 minutes before a wrangler high on a black horse and trailing six mules trotted by.</p> <p> \u201cBest watch yerselves!\u201d shouted the wrangler, pushing a plum-size wad of chewing tobacco from one side of his mouth, \u201cSeen 11 grizzlies in seven hours!\u201d</p> <p> \u201cHow far down the trail?\u201d asked Gaillard excitedly.</p> <p> \u201cJust a little ways back there was a sow with a cub.

We\u2019d both spent months in grizzly bear country, from the Beartooth Wilderness in Montana to Katmai National Park in Alaska. Grizzly bears have little fear of humans and often use foot trails like the one we were on. </p> <p>As we hiked, we talked loudly so as not to surprise a griz on the path. We had bear spray and knew how to use it. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67b45ef257b879b20e9be0544d77d176ef8da65b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67b45ef257b879b20e9be0544d77d176ef8da65b/0_249_5150_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grizzly bear sow and her cubs walk through the underbrush in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grizzly bear sow and her cubs walk through the underbrush in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NPS Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> At the time of Lewis and Clark, it is estimated that there were over 50,000 grizzlies in North America.

We camped that first night in a meadow, hanging our food in a tree. The night air was cold and pine-scented and it felt good to sleep on the ground.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p> The next morning there was frost in the meadow and a skim of ice on the pond. My hands froze filling our pot but soon warmed up clamped around a scalding cup of hot chocolate. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, but camping does simplify your life. Your biggest concerns are staying warm, staying dry, eating, moving.

We spent the whole day gamely walking through mud in the low country and snow in the high country, our feet getting soaked despite waterproof boots and gaiters.</p> <p> Dave regaled me with stories of critters that inhabited the landscape. How wolverines build snow caves as far as they can get from humans and have their kits in the winter, which are born snow white. How the primary diet of the lynx is the snowshoe hare, and without it, the population dies.</p> <p> \u201cThere probably aren\u2019t more than 300 wolverines left in the Rockies,\u201d he lamented.</p> <p> The next night we camped just outside the Yellowstone boundary on a bluff that burned during the 1988 fires. Already, tall, brilliant saplings were taking over the blackened totem poles of their ancestors.</p> <p> We made a little fire, just enough to warm our knees and hands, but not enough to alter the starlight pouring down through the trees. We were tired, that good tired, and didn\u2019t speak much.

But due to government bounties and predator control policies designed to help ranchers, the last original Yellowstone wolf was killed in 1926. Then, over vociferous objections of ranchers, wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995.</p> <p> \u201cToday there are an estimated 1700 wolves in the Northern Rockies,\u201d Dave said. \u201cThey are a keystone species.\u201d</p> <p> A keystone species is one that directly impacts the balance of the ecosystem. In Yellowstone, the extermination of wolves caused the elk population to explode. With no wolves to disperse them, elk chewed down the aspen saplings and willows along streams, which depleted the food source for the beavers, reducing their numbers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fewer beavers caused a drop in beaver dams, which reduced the amount of cool, shaded water, which reduced the fish populations. Fewer willows caused a drop in migrating neotropical songbirds.</p> <p> \u201cEverything is connected,\u201d said Dave, poking the fire with a stick.</p> <p> Today, what visitors to Yellowstone most want to see \u2013 more than elk or buffalo or even geysers \u2013 is a wolf.</p> <p> That night, after days of hard hiking, I slept like a dead man. I awoke to a deep-throated howl. The roar was so close and so loud I thought Gaillard was having me on. I crawled from my tent to find him pumping the camp stove, his furred red face grinning ear to ear.</p> <p> \u201cQuite a wake-up call isn\u2019t it!\u201d he said. \u201cNot 50 yards away. Biggest wolf I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201d</p> <p> Envious, I scanned the valley. It was twilight, the stars still vanishing into a lavender sky, straight dead pines white with frost.</p> <p> I didn\u2019t see a wolf. I saw wild, open, primeval country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf73e11ca2ae44073f634f356fb2bba5d53875b4/0_30_1919_1151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> After that first howl, we assumed a portent silence. Wolves have an acute sense of hearing. I knew they were watching us right now, through the gloaming, but we couldn\u2019t see them. Like dogs and cats, wolves have a thin, reflective film inside their retinas, called the tapetum lucidum, which gives them night vision.</p> <p> Dave headed off to break a hole in the ice and fill our pot while I lowered the food bag out of the tree. A short time later we were standing over the dead coals of last night\u2019s fire, stomping our frozen boots, digging into our bowls of hot granola and watching the sunlight gild the surrounding summits.</p> <p> Then the gorgeous howl came back. This time it was much farther away and echoed across the still-shaded valley. Another howl answered it from the stony mountainside to the northwest, then another from the dark line of forest to the southeast.</p> <p> The wolves had triangulated us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black as night, the wolves looked right at me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> \u201cThis is the Delta pack,\u201d said Dave, \u201ccould be as many as a dozen.\u201d</p> <p> We were standing in the most remote place in the lower 48, two small, pink creatures inside a prodigious sanctuary. The wolves commenced to sing. Perhaps three or four in a group, a call and refrain. Dave threw his arms back like a preacher.</p> <p> \u201cNow this is Yellowstone!\u201d</p> <p> They howled together in thundering choruses, bringing music to the morning. Individual voices could be distinguished, just like in a choir. Numerous basses, two baritones, even a tenor trying out her young pipes. They ululated for perhaps five minutes, then abruptly stopped.</p> <p> I began glassing along a bank of trees to the south from whence the closest howling had come, stopping for some reason on a stand of spruce. I was studying the conifers when two huge wolves stepped out into the open. Black as night, they looked right at me, then loped off through the trees.</p> <p> I had so desperately wanted to get away, to escape \u2013 and I\u2019d done it. But now everything was inverted. Being there in the moment in the mountains with the wolves, I realized we actually hadn\u2019t gotten away from it all, we gotten right into the middle of it. The office and the asphalt are what felt strange now. We had hiked ourselves back in time into an environment that was once common and now barely exists, a place I had imagined to be silent and austere but was in truth songful and profoundly complex. </p> <p> And is this not the very point of a national park? To reveal a world in which humans are just another species in a beautifully intricate ecosystem. </p>",

Rescue workers pulled five bodies from the rubble of the hotel but had to halt rescue operations late Wednesday night because it was too dangerous working in the dark.</p> <p>Roberto Renzi said he was sleeping \u201csoundly and most tranquilly\u201d when he was jostled awake by the 6.2-magnitude tremor. He said he instantly knew this quake was far, far worse than the \u201clittle movements\u201d locals are used to in this quake-prone belt straddling Italy\u2019s rocky Apennines mountains.</p> <p>His three-story house and the one next to it miraculously remained standing, but the door to his third-floor bedroom was jammed by the quake. </p> <p>He grabbed a fire stoker and pried the door open and ran with his wife to the safety of the street. Renzi said a woman who owns a bed and breakfast across the street escaped by knotting bed sheets and climbing down her building.</p> <p>Some people never made it out of their beds at all. Dozens are dead in Amatrice amid an overall toll of at least 120 people killed and over 360 injured in the region by the quake, according to Italy\u2019s prime minister.</p> <p>And the death toll could rise as rescuers with sniffer dogs prepared to work through the night, checking house after house that had collapsed into mounds of dust and twisted metal.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be350ee4b048662988fd49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T00:34:07.875Z\">1.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some more of the shocking images coming out of Amatrice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cnni/status/768462253876244480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No one allowed to spend Wednesday night in quake-hit town of Amatrice, Italian officials say <a href=\"https://t.co/a6dm6wahsC\">https://t.co/a6dm6wahsC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/pv7yh7pbGb\">pic.twitter.com/pv7yh7pbGb</a></p>&mdash; CNN International (@cnni) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cnni/status/768462253876244480\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/768456624935735296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6-man team from the Vatican City State&#39;s fire squad has been sent to quake-hit Amatrice <a href=\"https://t.co/VcuCrK2MXk\">https://t.co/VcuCrK2MXk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VU2FAEzYQl\">pic.twitter.com/VU2FAEzYQl</a></p>&mdash; BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/768456624935735296\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/768426350831075329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The historic town of Amatrice is at the epicenter of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItalyEarthquake?src=hash\">#ItalyEarthquake</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/D052oLDHoV\">https://t.co/D052oLDHoV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Y65jQwbMCc\">pic.twitter.com/Y65jQwbMCc</a></p>&mdash; CNN (@CNN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/768426350831075329\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be3412e4b0fe30498a4790\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T00:12:28.841Z\">1.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One reader has sent in this harrowing account of the moment the quake struck:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was exactly 3.37 am.

As it also notes, the location is quite close to another extensive quake that occurred in 2009 which caused widespread damage:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The August 24, 2016 M 6.2 earthquake southeast of Norcia, Italy, occurred as the result of shallow normal faulting on a NW-SE oriented fault in the Central Apennines. The Apennines is a mountain range that runs from the Gulf of Taranto in the south to the southern edge of the Po basin in northern Italy. Geologically, the Apennines is largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction. This region is tectonically and geologically complex, involving both subduction of the Adria micro-plate beneath Eurasia and the Apennines from east to west, continental collision between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates building the Alpine mountain belt further to the north and the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin to the west. The evolution of this system has caused the expression of all different tectonic styles acting at the same time in a broad region surrounding Italy and the central Mediterranean. The August 24, 2016 normal faulting earthquake is an intraplate event, an expression of the east-west extensional tectonics that now dominate along the Apennine belt, primarily a response to the Tyrrhenian basin opening faster than the compression between the Eurasia and Nubia (Africa) plates.</p> <p>The central Apennine region has experienced several significant earthquakes in recorded history.

In each episode, a wealthy family assisted one that was living below the poverty line.</p> <p>The Gumpos were sponsored by the Brotherstons, a wealthy couple who had children at Brighton college. The relationship between the families grew and the Brotherstons introduced Moesha to the school.</p> <p>Recognising that she was academically gifted, the school awarded Moesha a 110% scholarship when she was 13. And its faith was repaid on Thursday when she achieved two A*s and 7 As in her GCSEs.</p> <p>She told South Coast News: \u201cI\u2019m so happy. My hopes were very, very low so I am ecstatic. Thank you so much.\u201d</p> <h2>Fast learner</h2> <p>In just eight years, Lucy Lei has gone from barely speaking a word of English to taking top grades in her GCSEs. When Lucy left Yanping in China with her mother, she only knew a few words such as \u201cgood morning\u201d. The pair settled in Darlington, where she attended Haughton academy. She told Press Association: \u201cI still remember my first day at primary school, seeing all the faces, and feeling homesick and scared, but I am very happy now. Everyone has been so nice and supportive and my results are better than I thought they would be.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The right notes</strong></h2> <p>Naomi Bazlov, 13, a talented pianist, is celebrating achieving an A* in her Russian GCSE, three years early. </p> <p>Naomi, who attends King Edward VI high school for girls in Birmingham, has been selected for the prestigious National Maths Camp at Queen\u2019s College in Oxford next week and got stellar results in several UK competitions including the Nottingham young musician of the year. She has taken her piano licenciate diploma, an honour normally only achieved by adults.<br></p> <h2>Road to recovery</h2> <p>Having to sit an exam that you have hardly studied for is the stuff of nightmares, but that didn\u2019t stop Tom Verelst-Way from achieving 10 A*s and one A in his GCSEs. <br></p> <p>The 16-year-old was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in the run-up to his exams, and was left almost unable to study as a result of tiredness and recovery from treatment. </p> <p>He told Press Association: \u201cIt really affected the way I could work because it gives you really severe headaches. It was very, very severe. </p> <p>\u201cI could hardly do any work, which meant I had to catch up a lot and have extra lessons. I\u2019m on the road to recovery now. I want to go to Oxford so I\u2019ve got my work cut out for me.\u201d</p> <h2>Surprise success</h2> <p>Jess from Gloucestershire got in touch via GuardianWitness to let us know that she has also overcome illness to secure impressive GCSEs.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had 30-40% attendance to school due to an auto-immune disease,\u201d she told us. \u201cI\u2019ve surprised myself massively in my results! I got an A*, 3 As and 4 Bs which I didn\u2019t expect at all because of how much I\u2019ve missed, so I\u2019m really pleased. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea how I got an A* in English literature. It\u2019s not a strong subject of mine, but I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m also insanely proud of all my friends who have all got the grades they needed to take their A-levels.\u201d</p> <h2>Proud parent</h2> <p>Chloe Beaney had to miss the majority of year 10 at Cramlington Learning Village after undergoing a life-saving heart transplant \u2013 but has managed to achieve C grades in her GCSEs.</p> <p>The teenager also battled acute myeloid leukaemia - a rare type of blood cancer - after being diagnosed with the disease aged two. </p> <p>She told PA: \u201cI\u2019m really happy, I did better than I thought. I knew that I had to work really hard to be able to get where I wanted to be. I stuck in as hard as I could.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother Catriona Wilkinson added: \u201cI am absolutely thrilled. It has been really difficult for her as she had home tuition for a while until she was ready to come back to school. </p> <p>\u201cShe has been through an awful lot but she has just worked really hard. I could not be more proud.\u201d </p> <p>Chloe plans to go to sixth form at Cramlington Learning Village and has ambitions to become a mid-wife. </p> <h2>On the ball</h2> <p>GCSE results weren\u2019t the only exciting envelope that Sam Naylor has opened lately \u2013 the 16-year-old has been offered a contract with a professional football club.</p> <p>Sam picked up nine GCSE grades at St Michael\u2019s Catholic Academy in Billingham today, but had leave quickly to travel to Coventry City Football Club for training.</p> <p>He told PA: \u201cI\u2019ve achieved all nine GCSE grades and I\u2019m now an under-18s goalkeeper for Coventry City. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually got to go down to Coventry for training this afternoon and I will generally spend the majority of the week down there and come home on the weekends.\u201d</p> <p>Sam has been offered a two-year scholarship at the club and says he hopes to play for them afterwards.</p> <h2>All-round achievements</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4160f962cb55e22cf2aa22f72b6c7c59d5099f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4160f962cb55e22cf2aa22f72b6c7c59d5099f4/0_0_868_1192/728.jpg\" alt=\"Jemima Kite\" width=\"728\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jemima Kite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jemima Kite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two pupils from the King\u2019s school in Rochester added glittering GCSE results to their impressive sporting and artistic achievements.</p> <p> Jemima Kite is an Irish dancer who competed against 18,000 others at the World Irish Dancing Championship in Bucharest last year, and earned an A*, six As, two Bs and one C on Thursday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, her classmate Will Humphries added three A*s, three As and four Bs to his accomplishments on the water as a regional and national competitor in rowing.</p> <p>Their headteacher, Jeremy Walker, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are delighted with the results achieved by all of our pupils today \u2013 they have obtained them alongside a full commitment to other, extracurricular and co-curricular opportunities. I always say to my students it\u2019s the exam results that get you the interview, but it\u2019s the person who walks through the door who gets the job.\u201d</p> <h2>Star turn</h2> <p>Seren Hawkes, one of the young stars of the new Swallows and Amazons film, has received a C in her drama GCSE, and says she is \u201cextremely happy\u201d.<br></p> <p>The 16-year-old, who studied at St John\u2019s college in Southsea, plays Nancy Blackett in the new film \u2013 a part she won after casting agents visited the school.</p> <p>Seren told PA: \u201cDoing GCSE drama really helped me get the role \u2013 it\u2019s the only acting I\u2019d done, although it\u2019s stage acting which is different from screen. I\u2019m not that good at the writing part of drama though, which is probably why I got a C in GCSE.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI\u2019d never specifically wanted to be an actress before. It was one of those things you think about when you are a kid, that you could possibly be an actress.\u201d</p> <p>Seren will go on to Peter Symonds college in Winchester to study A-levels, including performing arts.</p>",

We received at least 13 bullets, hitting different parts of the bridge. People who were on the bridge, the command-and-control part of the ship, could have been killed or seriously harmed.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, MSF said: \u201cMSF believes that the intruders aimed to physically harm the Bourbon Argos\u2019s staff but thanks to the sound security procedures enacted, all team members were safe. Nothing was taken during the incident and the damage to the ship was only minimal.\u201d</p> <p>The group added: \u201cMSF strongly condemns this shameful act towards a humanitarian organisation rescuing and delivering lifesaving medical care to those crossing the central Mediterranean Sea.\u201d</p> <p>MSF has rescued more than 25,000 refugees from the southern Mediterranean over the past two years, and currently has three different boats operating off the coast of Libya. While the flow of refugees between Turkey and Greece has all but stopped, near-record numbers are still heading from Libya to Italy, and dying in the process. At least 3,100 are thought to have drowned so far this year, leaving MSF with a crucial lifesaving role in the southern Mediterranean.</p> <p><a href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105\">More than 100,000</a> refugees have survived the journey and reached Italy in 2016, mainly fleeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/nigeria-says-boko-haram-commanders-killed-airstrike-wounded-abubakar-shekau\">war and poverty in Nigeria</a>, and dictatorships <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/22/eritrea-migrants-child-soldier-fled-what-is-going\">in Eritrea</a> and the Gambia.

He also questioned the role of the naval operations, which are first and foremost meant to be anti-smuggling missions aimed at deterring future migration across the Mediterranean. \u201cIs the deterrent bringing any of the intended results?\u201d said Argenziano. \u201cPeople keep on dying in large numbers, while the [arrival] numbers are not going down.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s avoid cholera by washing our hands,\u201d reads a sign in a refugee camp just south of Uganda\u2019s border with South Sudan. It\u2019s a new sign, handwritten in a hurry \u2013 and the commotion a few metres away at the entrance to the camp hints at why it\u2019s so necessary. </p> <p>Hundreds of South Sudanese refugees are arriving from the border, further swelling the numbers of an overcrowded camp that is already at four times its capacity, and increasing the risk of disease. Crammed into three coaches, these are the latest of more than 88,000 South Sudanese refugees to seek asylum here since early July, when civil war restarted in the world\u2019s newest country. Earlier arrivals reached Uganda by canoe. Now they come by bus.</p> <p>The huge influx has caused a crisis in northern Uganda, with twice as many refugees arriving in the past six weeks as during the first half of the year. On the most chaotic days, up to 8,000 people have arrived. </p> <p>They came with stories of profound brutality, of soldiers looting villages and raping their residents. \u201cThey went home to home,\u201d 16-year-old Lilian said of the attack on her village in late July. \u201cIf there was a boy inside, they would beat him. If there was a woman, and the woman would not sleep with them, they would beat them, and then rape them. They would rape any woman. They wanted us to fear staying there.\u201d</p> <p>So Lilian fled into the bush the following day with her two sisters. First, they dug a hole to hide in, she said. Later, they sheltered inside a truck, the driver of which had been shot.

That deal was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/19/south-sudan-violence-fear-looting-juba\">broken in July</a>, when supporters of President Salva Kiir clashed once more with those of the opposition leader, former vice-president Riek Machar, leaving Uganda and Sudan to shoulder the bulk of the humanitarian fallout.</p> <p>\u201cThe response from the international community \u2013 we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because their attention is elsewhere, but it hasn\u2019t been operating as it has been previously,\u201d said Uganda\u2019s commissioner for refugees, David Kazungu.</p> <p>Since the surge began, food rations have been slashed, halving the calorie intake for all but the most vulnerable. The UN refugee agency\u2019s funds are at only 20% of what they should be. Some reception centres are housing four times more refugees than their limit, leading to water shortages, and a cholera outbreak at one of the most overcrowded camps.</p> <p>\u201cPhysically and mentally, I am tired,\u201d said Pascal Aklusi, one of the officials overseeing the aid effort in northern Uganda. \u201cWe really require support in terms of funding.\u201d</p> <p>A few South Sudanese head for Europe, but the number within east Africa is comparable in scale to recent refugee flows to Europe from the Middle East. And their experiences are often just as hellish. </p> <p>\u201cThis is such an important issue,\u201d said Charlie Yaxley, the UN refugee agency\u2019s spokesperson in Uganda. \u201cAlmost every refugee we speak with has incredibly traumatic tales of what they\u2019ve left behind, [of] these armed groups who are burning down people\u2019s entire homes, sexually assaulting young women and girls, and forcibly recruiting young men.\u201d</p> <p>Fighting has subsided in the capital, Juba, where Human Rights Watch <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/15/south-sudan-killings-rapes-looting-juba\">reported</a> women being assaulted outside UN compounds, and the Associated Press <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\">said</a> aid workers were raped in their lodgings by government soldiers.

Jen Gune, a 30-year-old police officer, was on duty on 21 July when she said she saw soldiers stop an 18-year-old on his motorcycle, and summarily execute him. At a nearby funeral service, Gune said: \u201cSomeone stood up to see what was happening \u2013 and was also shot.\u201d </p> <p>As a constable, Gune said she documented four cases of soldier-led rape in recent months in her area of Pageri. Since fighting broke out in July, however, she had seen only murder and looting. \u201cWhen they come to your home, if your door is open, they will come in and loot everything, and if it\u2019s locked, they will break it, enter and take everything anyway,\u201d said Gune. \u201cWhether you were on the road, and whether you were at home, they would kill you.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in the state, 16-year-old Grace Mandera said her neighbours had been abused by rebels and government troops. First the rebels took over the town and started forcing young men to join their ranks, she said. Then, once the army re-took it, soldiers sexually assaulted at least three girls, Mandera was told by a victim after she escaped with her brother. \u201cI thought to myself,\u201d Mandera said, \u201cif I had been held up in the village I would have been raped.\u201d</p> <p>Rape, survivors said, is being used as a weapon of war. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of forcing the people of that area to go out,\u201d said Sam Siyaga, 34, a civil servant who escaped a nearby area. \u201cIt is very common.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9e40c161341903cb7be36c2d87999f9866157d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9e40c161341903cb7be36c2d87999f9866157d/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Siyaga, a 34-year-old civil servant from South Sudan, sits in a refugee settlement in northern Uganda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Sudanese refugee Sam Siyaga says rape is being used as a weapon of war to force people to leave areas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kingsley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armed groups have robbed people trying to escape, with men and young people sometimes prevented from leaving, and forced to join the fighting. To evade detection, some refugees described hiding in the bush for days on end, surviving mainly on leaves and wild cassava plants. Others waited near a main road until the arrival of a Ugandan military convoy, returning from Juba after rescuing stranded Ugandan expatriates.</p> <p>Neither the South Sudanese government nor the rebels inspired confidence, several survivors said after reaching safety. \u201cFor us in the communities, we blame all of them,\u201d said Peter Paul Odong, a headteacher from Magwi, as he dangled from the back of a truck just inside the Ugandan border. \u201cAfter the [peace agreement] was agreed, the conflict still continued. And that is both sides\u2019 fault.\u201d</p> <p>Amid this chaos, officials say, a wider mix of people has been sucked into the fighting than usual. Kiir and Machar fought for different factions within the country\u2019s liberation movement \u2013 and represent the country\u2019s two largest ethnic groups, respectively the Dinka and the Nuer. But many of the newly displaced are from smaller tribes, include the Madi. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen refugees from tribes and areas that we didn\u2019t see previously, which means the fighting has spread to the villages,\u201d said Kazungu.</p> <p>There has also been a worrying spike in unaccompanied child refugees, according to the charity <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/support-our-emergency-fund\">Save the Children, which is appealing for donations to help care for the new arrivals</a>.</p> <p>Since early July, nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minors, or children separated from their parents, have arrived in Uganda, around seven times the number recorded during the first half of the year, Save the Children said. The youngest was five. Some came alone because their parents were forced to stay and fight. Others got separated amid the chaos of the situation, prompting <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us/emergencies/support-our-emergency-fund\">Save the Children to begin a programme to reunite separated families, and find foster care for lone children</a>. </p> <p>\u201cMany of the separated children arrived in their school uniforms because there was no chance for them to go back home,\u201d said Tonny Kasiita, the NGO\u2019s acting team leader in one of the border provinces. \u201cThey just came with their teachers and classmates.\u201d</p> <p>In the rush to accommodate so many new children, many teenagers have yet to be placed in secondary education. But Uganda is otherwise comparatively<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/567414b26.html\"> generous to refugees</a>. Unlike countries such as Britain, Uganda lets refugees work as soon as they arrive in the country.

But it is also born of enlightened self-interest, says Kazungu. \u201cWe are not seeing refugees as a burden, but as part of the economic development of the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere they are, there is development, schools are built, health services are built, and they are also a market for the nationals. They buy food from the nationals, and nationals also buy from them.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/refugeeeconomies\">Research by Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre</a> highlights the economic benefits of Uganda\u2019s refugee policies. More than one in five refugees in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, run businesses that employ at least one person \u2013 and 40% of those employees are Ugandans. </p> <p>\u201cOur research in the country highlights the positive benefits of moving beyond encampment and giving refugees basic socio-economic freedoms,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/people/alexander-betts\">Professor Alexander Betts</a>, the centre\u2019s director. \u201cRefugees become producers, consumers, entrepreneurs, employees and employers. They help themselves and their communities. The policy is not perfect but in offering basic autonomy to refugees, its offers a model from which other countries should learn.\u201d</p> <p>In the short-term, however, many of Uganda\u2019s newest refugees were just happy to find any kind of sanctuary. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to leave my home,\u201d said Ottoviana. \u201cBut what I want most of all, and what my children want most of all, is to live.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some refugees\u2019 names have been changed</em></p>",

Last year saw its largest ever festival with an estimated 60,000 attendees; satellite events in Paris, Los Angeles and Atlanta; and the decision to begin charging for admittance. There have also been, inevitably, some growing pains. </p> <p>Earlier in the summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/19/grace-jones-replaces-mia-at-afropunk-festival\">MIA was announced as the headliner</a> for the first-ever London festival though she is not black, and freely complained via Twitter that \u201cin America the problem you\u2019re allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter\u201d accompanied by the hashtag #muslimlivesmatter. I was never going to attend Afropunk London, but still, I felt a pang, seeing a non-black artist, dark and lovely though she is, as the headliner. Wasn\u2019t there somebody else who better fit the bill?</p> <p>The Brooklyn festival, announcing its lineup, appeared to be thoroughly black and male: Ice Cube, TV on the Radio, Tyler the Creator, and Flying Lotus are the top four headliners, followed by Janelle Monae \u2013 and then more dudes. A lot more, including Cee-Lo Green, who, after being accused of rape and drugging a woman in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/02/cee-lo-green-it-isnt-if-the-victim-is-unconscious\">suggested that if you can\u2019t remember being raped, then it didn\u2019t happen</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86c084190f3ec47aa6bd5d717a9c26414b77a07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86c084190f3ec47aa6bd5d717a9c26414b77a07f/68_99_1913_2392/800.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Jones headlined last year\u2019s New York edition of the festival\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace Jones headlined last year\u2019s New York edition of the festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afropunk has since pulled MIA from the London show, and Brooklyn has added Laura Mvula (Cee-Lo remains). Though it was a worthy criticism to question why MIA had been invited in the first place, it\u2019s also meaningful that the festival, despite its sprawling, worldwide reach, is still an organ which breathes and responds to the voices of its patrons.</p> <p>At least, that\u2019s how I see it. Last year, after Afropunk Brooklyn announced it would charge an entry fee, some said the festival had gone corporate \u2013 a harsh criticism for a space that began as anything but. Going corporate means accepting financial support from brands and corporations, but euphemistically means selling out\u2013 and is rarely seen as a necessary economic decision. Festival co-founder Matthew Morgan once financed the festival out-of-pocket for $15,000; but since those humble beginnings, the price has swelled to $2m. </p> <p>When you\u2019re young, as are most of Afropunk\u2019s attendees, as were its founders when they first felt inspired to create it, you often can\u2019t imagine how soothing and seductive financial security is; or, that without some sponsorship, many of the \u201cfree\u201d things we love would cease to exist. But when you get down to it, Afropunk\u2019s shift from a one-day black rock event in a parking lot to a multi-city, multi-million dollar blowout is not about money, but about how personal it feels when something we love changes without our permission; about the expectation that its heart and skin will forever stay the same; that black won\u2019t crack.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/aug/24/in-style-at-afropunk-festival-come-as-you-are\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4bn6h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2359223\"            data-video-name=\"In style at Afropunk festival: come as you are \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian America Remote Mastering\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55db1f47e4b084894f222b7f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/08/24/20150822AFROPUNKFINAL_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/08/24/20150822AFROPUNKFINAL_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/08/24/20150822AFROPUNKFINAL_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/08/24/20150822AFROPUNKFINAL_FromGuAmRM/20150822AFROPUNKFINAL_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10710456&amp;format=video/mp4\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2015/aug/24/in-style-at-afropunk-festival-come-as-you-are\">In style at Afropunk festival: come as you are</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/21/afropunk-the-festival-that-takes-black-punk-pride-worldwide\">Afropunk: the festival that takes black punk pride worldwide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I feel that. On more than one occasion, Afropunk has been where I reunited with a close friend I\u2019d fallen out with. You can count on seeing your people there, far too many to stop and speak to; and sometimes, as in life outside the gates of Commodore Barry Park, a chance encounter might be your only means of reaching someone who\u2019s floated out of your orbit. Afropunk has never been solely about the music; it\u2019s always been about the full experience of going with one group and leaving with another; suiting up in your Saturday-and-Sunday best; connecting with like minds and faces. Even in a crowd of 60,000, it seems the cosmos swirl to draw our endless brown bodies into perfect alignment.</p> <p>Like so many things, it\u2019s complicated. But it has to be. What makes Afropunk special is the tapestry of people who come from throughout the diaspora to experience this one, pulsating moment of a thousand kinds of black love: young, old; rich, poor; self-identified punks, and those who just like to lie in the grass and have a good time. If nothing else, it remains like the people it serves: infinite.</p>",

Here was a privately educated former City trader standing alongside a hereditary tycoon to announce that Brexit was \u201cfor the little people, for the real people\u201d. </p> <p>The parallels between Farage\u2019s EU efforts and Trump\u2019s policies are arguably limited, with little beyond a broad populism and focus on immigration. Farage himself emphasised the idea of an insurgent political force taking on the establishment.</p> <p>He did not endorse Trump, but made plain his distaste for his Democrat foes, condemning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/24/leave-campaign-obama-trade-warning-eu-referendum\">Barack Obama\u2019s decision to intervene</a> in the EU referendum to urge Britons to vote remain.</p> <p>\u201cI could not possibly tell you how to vote in this election,\u201d Farage said, \u201cbut I will say this, if I was an American citizen I wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.\u201d</p> <p>The speech indicates Farage is not entirely committed to a quiet retirement. As a man who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\">promised to step down as Ukip leader more than once</a> only to return, he has thus far said he could return to frontline British politics only if the government delayed too long on invoking article 50, which begins the formal timetable for EU departure.</p> <p>The slightly modest CVs of his would-be replacements \u2013 second-favourite Lisa Duffy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaduffy1968\">boasts on her Twitter profile</a> that she chairs the Christmas lights committee for the 8,000-population Cambridgeshire town where she is a councillor \u2013 will prompt more speculation that Farage\u2019s taste for the limelight will lead him to come back yet again. </p>",
  "<p>The 2016 Summer Olympics are over. Baseball is an Olympic sport again. <br>Left out of the Games in London and Rio, baseball (along with its pal softball) is set to return again in Tokyo in 2020. There is no commitment to the sport beyond Tokyo, however, which means the sport can\u2019t afford to blow its opportunity on the international stage. As big as the \u201cWorld\u201d Series claims to be, baseball\u2019s only truly global showcase comes when it\u2019s allowed to be seen every four years along with the rest of the big-time Olympic sports: track and field, swimming, dressage and the like. </p> <p>The sport needs to put on a show in Tokyo or it might not get another chance \u2013 and doing so will require participation from the best players in the game. Think about the excitement surrounding the 1992 Dream Team, only imagine Michael Jordan as a baseball player. OK, bad idea. But you get my point. </p> <p>Mike Trout, Kris Bryant, Mookie Betts, Clayton Kershaw, all in red, white and blue and taking on the best of the best from the other top baseball nations. Bat flips from around the world, chanting, brushback pitches, baseball\u2019s unwritten rules unwritten in every language. Host nation Tokyo might even feature a 46-year old, .300-hitting Olympian Ichiro. Everything about it sounds amazing.</p> <p>A star-studded tournament would get attention both in the US and around the world and the huge, enthusiastic crowds that would undoubtedly show up to the games in Tokyo would make the sport one of the Games\u2019 big stories. This would be far from the contrived World Baseball Classic, an event with no history. This new form of Olympic baseball would feature the best baseball players in the world playing in the ultimate global sports tournament, with hundreds of millions watching around the world (give or take a few tens of millions of millennials, right NBC?)</p> <p>The only problem is that Major League Baseball doesn\u2019t want to send its stars to the Olympics because the Summer Games happen just as the pennant chase heats up. The 2020 Games will run from 24 July to 9 August, holy summer days for those who worship baseball as it has always been. But this is old thinking that new commissioner Rob Manfred hopefully won\u2019t adopt. Manfred has already said he is open to reducing the regular season to 154 games. So cut eight games off the regular season in 2020, ditch the all-star game along with it \u2013 the wildly unpopular event earned record low ratings in July \u2013 and, abracadabra, we\u2019ve instantly found the two weeks we need to sell baseball to the world.</p> <p> There is no downside. The players who don\u2019t make an Olympic team get time to nurse injuries and rest up for the pennant chase, MLB can make the 31 July trade deadline into a multi-day, mega-hyped event, the game\u2019s best players will get to battle it out for their countries \u2013 while staying fresh for their U.S. teams \u2013 and maybe just win a few million fans the world over will fall in love with the sport. It\u2019s a win, win, win, etc.</p> <p>The safe bet is that baseball goes its regular route and fills the US Olympic roster with the usual retreads and nobodies. For who, outside of everyone, can forget the fearsome 2008 Team USA lineup with Nate Schierholtz, Jayson Nix and Taylor Teagarden? Or it can do something very un-baseball-like, go bold and try to sell the game to a new generation. </p> <p>The NHL has allowed its season to be interrupted for the Olympics since 1998 and ice hockey has been a huge part of the Games ever since. And this during the tenure of Gary Bettman. Gary Bettman. Does Manfred want his legacy to be that he was a worse commissioner than Gary Bettman? That\u2019s his choice. And there\u2019s only one good option for him and the sport: baseball must go all-in on the 2020 Olympics. <br><br></p> <h2>Video of the Week</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyejUGoTBTk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyejUGoTBTk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Oregon Little League coach Joel Jensen called timeout on Tuesday at the LLWS to tell his son that he loves him. It\u2019s easy to be a little cynical about ultra-competitive youth sports, but this is undoubtedly a nice, tender and sincere moment. Although, if you are very cynical about youth sports, you could say he feels this way about his talented son because the kid has major league potential. Who doesn\u2019t love a meal ticket? </p> <h2>Quote of the Week</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s boring out there.\u201d - Mets broadcaster Keith Hernandez, explaining why infielders often go to the mound when the pitching coach comes out to speak to the pitcher. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dschoenfield/status/768262436461940736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Keith Hernandez on why infielders go to the mound when the pitching coach comes out: &quot;It&#39;s boring out there.&quot;</p>&mdash; David Schoenfield (@dschoenfield) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dschoenfield/status/768262436461940736\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Be honest, Keith. Infielders go to the mound because they hope their coach will tell them that he loves them. <br></p> <h2><br>Who\u2019s closer to victory: Donald Trump of the Cubs? </h2> <p>Donald Trump continues to trail in most every national poll and is down big in several key swing states, while the Cubs became the first MLB team to 80 wins this week and remain the favorite to win their first World Series. Of course, things could change if Trump follows trough on his old threat and drops an October surprise on the Cubs. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/701779181986680832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $&#39;s against me.

Feels like a lose-lose for Trump. <br><br></p> <h2>How did the kids piss off Goose Gossage this week? </h2> <p>While there is no particular Goose Gossage connection to this week\u2019s lesson in baseball\u2019s code, it does harken back to the fight the former Yankees reliever got into with teammate Cliff Johnson in 1979. That brawl left Gossage with a broken thumb, whereas this week\u2019s baseball punching left A\u2019s DH Billy Butler with a head injury thanks to team-mate Danny Valencia. </p> <p><br>The Butler-Valencia bout reportedly started when Butler told a shoe brand representative that Valencia was wearing a pair of off-brand cleats in breach of his contract. For this bit of teammate snitching, Butler received a punch to the face from Valencia. Sometimes baseball\u2019s code is confusing. Not in this case. Go out of your way to tell on a coworker and get punched in the face. That\u2019s common sense and karma.</p> <h2>Nine thoughts in order</h2> <p>1) It\u2019s still too early to determine who truly \u201cwon\u201d and \u201clost\u201d last month\u2019s non-waiver trade deadline, but there are definitely early contenders. Andrew Miller has been outstanding since going to Cleveland from the Yankees, posting a 1.69 ERA and 0.46 WHIP with two saves and 16 strikeouts in 10 and two-thirds innings. Watch him dominate the A\u2019s here on Monday night with three straight Ks to pick up the save in a 1-0 win. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WFNYScott/status/768055590715351045\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Schools back in.

He\u2019s hitting .149 under the careful watch of Magic Johnson in LA, including no home runs and no runs batted in more than 70 plate appearances. That\u2019s pretty tough to do. Even tougher to do? Injure yourself while getting room service. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/McCulloughTimes/status/767836765528915971\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Josh Reddick hurt his finger when his hand got caught in a door last night while ordering room service. &quot;This is rock bottom,&quot; he cracked.</p>&mdash; Andy McCullough (@McCulloughTimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McCulloughTimes/status/767836765528915971\">August 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>2) The Cardinals still have a hold on the last wildcard spot in the National League, but they\u2019re not making it look easy. Despite having the Best Fans in Baseball\u2122 St Louis somehow have the fourth-worst home record in all of baseball. That becomes a serious problem due to the fact that the Cardinals have a narrow lead over the Marlins and Pirates for that last wildcard spot and close out their season with six games at Busch Stadium \u2013 including Games 160, 161 and 162 versus Pittsburgh. Imagine a scenario in which the Cardinals go from a playoff position in the final week to missing the postseason completely thanks to gagging on that final homestand. Could they end their season by get booed off their home field by the Best Fans? This truly could be a dream season for Cubs fans.</p> <p>3) Yankees COO Hank Steinbrenner <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/18/hal-steinbrenners-unusual-reaction-to-yankees-youth-turn/\">told the New York Post</a> that part of what convinced him to go all-in on the team rebuilding was because Yankee fans on social media supported a youth movement. They no doubt did. Because the general consensus on social media about sports, politics/movies/music/gardening/whatever issue is dominating the news cycle sucks big time. In fact, it might just be the worst ever and the complete opposite must be done straight away. So expect Yankees fans on social media to be pushing for some veteran additions upon completion of the first three-game losing streak. </p> <p>4) The first place Dodgers currently have seven starters on the DL: Clayton Kershaw, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Brandon McCarthy, Rich Hill, Alex Wood, Brett Anderson and Scott Kazmir. That is more than $79m in payroll on the disabled list, meaning the Dodgers have to battle on with barely $185m worth of healthy players. Please keep them in your thoughts during this difficult time.</p> <p>5) The art of pitch framing has been around since the first catcher wanted to buy a call from the home plate ump, but it\u2019s only in recent years \u2013 beginning around 2006 with the introduction of the PITCHf/x pitching tracking system \u2013 that teams were able to quantify the skill and then compensate catchers who do it well. Now we are beginning to see catchers who grew up in this era arrive on the big stage of the Little League World Series. Expect this kid to receive a large bubble gum bonus from management. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-vine\"> <iframe class=\"vine-embed\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/5MY72UHaOHL/embed/simple\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><script async src=\"//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>6) Blue Jays slugger Edwin Encarnacion is being sued for more than $11.5m by a woman who claims he gave her STDs. His agent has said that the charges are \u201ccompletely inappropriate and meritless\u201d and that the designated hitter will \u201ctake every legal measure to defend himself against this meritless claim.\u201d The courts will decide that, but I think we can all agree that STD feels a bit outdated in modern baseball. Surely there is something like xSTD, STD+ or VORstD that can more accurately judge what Encarnacion did or did not give. </p> <p>7) With Derek Jeter retiring from baseball two years ago, A-Rod going out two weeks ago and David Ortiz leaving the game two months from now, there may be a lot of fans without a favorite player in the sport. If you are such a fan, consider filling that hole with Royals third baseman Cheslor Cuthbert. He\u2019s a 23-year old rookie batting .292 with 10 home runs. That covers the baseball part.</p> <p>Now for the much more interesting off-the-field component: the Venezuela native used a chunk of the $1.9m signing bonus he received in 2009 to buy chickens and now has nearly 300 of them waiting for him back at home. \u201cHe gets photos and videos and makes calls to their caretaker everyday,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article97360007.html\">his sister told La Prensa</a>. \u201cHe adores them.\u201d How can you not root for a man with a phone full of pictures of his pet chickens? And, please, people of Kansas City, try to consider the man\u2019s feelings. Don\u2019t eat your massive platters of barbecue chicken right in front of him. </p> <p>8) MLB released the postseason schedule this week. A few dates you\u2019ll want to keep open: </p> <p>\u2013 Tuesday 25 October: Game 1 of the World Series.</p> <p>\u2013 Wednesday 2 November: Game 7 of the World Series, if necessary.</p> <p>\u2013 Friday 7 October: four playoff games in one day with the NLDS Game 1s and the ALDS Game 2s.</p> <p>\u2013 Tuesday 4 October: postseason opens with the AL wildcard game.</p> <p>\u2013 Wednesday 5 October: Pittsburgh Pirates lose in the NL wildcard to team TBD. </p> <p>9) After each of the last three Summer Olympics, the football world has pondered if Usain Bolt could play in the NFL. Just last week, former coach Tony Dungy said he\u2019d use Bolt as a receiver to \u201cclear out one side of the field\u201d with his speed, while Falcons receiver Julio Jones said Bolt <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/08/why-usain-bolt-wouldnt-make-it-as-a-wide-receiver-in-the-nfl-according-to-julio-jones \">would struggle without the \u201cburst\u201d</a> he\u2019d need to get off the line of scrimmage.</p> <p>But why are we always projecting Bolt into football? Why couldn\u2019t he be a MLB pinch runner? And a late-inning defensive replacement to run down balls hit into the gap <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/5O6z2Lw1XvP\">Billy Hamilton-style?</a> Sure, it\u2019s improbable, but it seems more likely to happen than a football career. That reminds me, there\u2019s one more date coming up on the baseball calendar that you\u2019ll want to remember: Tim Tebow\u2019s baseball tryout is now set for 30 August in Los Angeles.</p>",
  "<p>The EU and Turkey are poised for a fresh round of diplomacy in an attempt to keep their migration pact working, despite the rancorous downward spiral in relations since Ankara\u2019s crackdown on tens of thousands of people it says are supporters of the exiled cleric it blames for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/whats-happened-in-turkey-first-hours-of-the-coup\">failed military coup</a>.<br></p> <p>The two sides will reach a moment of truth in September, when the European commission is due to report on whether Turkey has done enough to gain visa-free travel to Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen zone, a linchpin of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa\"> migration deal</a>.</p> <p>A delegation of EU officials is expected in Ankara in the coming weeks to assess Turkey\u2019s progress, while a visit by the EU commissioner responsible for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, is also being discussed.<br></p> <p>The diplomatic move comes amid an increase in migrants crossing the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. In August, 109 people a day on average have been arriving on Greek shores, compared to 62 in July, although still far below January\u2019s tally of 2,000. The UN refugee agency warned that Europe could see a repeat of last year\u2019s chaotic mass arrivals, unless EU governments did more to help asylum seekers in the Middle East as well as resettling more refugees.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe feeling in Europe is that the problem has been solved,\u201d UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said. \u201cPeople have forgotten about the problem, because they do not see the immediacy of it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99945507e26f233104f45414758d7f1d29b91ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99945507e26f233104f45414758d7f1d29b91ec6/0_213_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, during his visit to the refugee camp of Lagadikia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, during his visit to the refugee camp of Lagadikia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around 50,000 people are stranded in Greece, many living in dire conditions in reception centres, not knowing when they will move on. Save the Children reported this week that Greek refugee camps were bursting at the seams: people are living in dirty and unsafe conditions, as camps lack sufficient drinking water, showers and toilets.</p> <p>Under the pact with Ankara, Europe promised an initial \u20ac3bn aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey, in exchange for being able to send back irregular migrants who had arrived in Greece. The deal was sweetened by the promise of visa-free travel for Turks throughout continental Europe.<br></p> <p>But even before the botched coup in Turkey, the deal had been hanging by a thread with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, insisting he would not re-write Turkey\u2019s counter-terrorism laws - a key condition of the visa deal.</p> <p>Officials from both sides working on the visa deal insist it is viable, despite deteriorating EU-Turkey relations in the aftermath of the failed coup. Selim Yenel, Turkey\u2019s most senior diplomat in Brussels, believes a visa agreement in October is still possible, although he said \u201cemotions are still very high\u201d.</p> <p>In the weeks before the coup, both sides had met to search for compromise on Turkey\u2019s anti-terror laws, which are so widely drawn that journalists and opposition figures are targets. \u201cWe have gone through a lot of wordings [on the counter-terrorism law] that would be appropriate for us and sufficient for the EU,\u201d Yenel told the Guardian. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finalised it but it is doable.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/whats-it-like-living-in-turkey-one-month-after-the-failed-coup\">What\u2019s it like living in Turkey one month after the failed coup?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe feel that if the commission gives a green light in its report in September, then the council [of ministers] will most probably go ahead and the assumption is that the European parliament will also say yes.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ambassador, who returns to Ankara in September, also said he couldn\u2019t imagine Turkey adopting the death penalty, which the EU opposes, arguing there was no majority in the Turkish parliament for capital punishment.

The EU has warned Turkey that re-instating the death penalty would end its membership hopes. </p> <p>The two sides are also at odds over money. While Brussels likes to stress the \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.8bn) \u201cmobilised\u201d to help Syrian refugees in Turkey, only \u20ac105m has been disbursed to aid agencies on the ground. A plan to bring refugees to Europe from Europe has also got off to a stuttering start: only 1,085 Syrians in Turkey have been resettled in EU countries, despite initial talk of 72,000 places.</p> <p>Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, maintained an agreement was possible, but insisted Turkey had to meet all 72 conditions (\u201cbenchmarks\u201d) to get the visa deal. \u201cWe are on the same side. The intention of the visa liberalisation benchmark has never been to reduce Turkey\u2019s capacity to fight terrorism effectively, quite the contrary,\u201d he said in a written answer to the Guardian.</p> <p>Kati Piri, a Dutch Socialist MEP, who works on EU-Turkey relations in the European parliament, did not share this optimism.

  "<p>A new study measures the loss of ice from one of world\u2019s largest ice sheets. They find an ice loss that has accelerated in the past few years, and their measurements confirm prior estimates.</p> <p>As humans emit heat-trapping gases, we expect to see changes to the Earth. One obvious change to be on the lookout for is melting ice. This includes ice atop mountains, ice floating in cold ocean waters, and the ice within large ice sheets or glaciers. It is this last type of ice loss that most affects ocean levels because as the water runs into the oceans, it raises sea levels. This is in contrast to melting sea ice \u2013 since it is already floating in ocean waters, its potential to raise ocean levels is very small.</p> <p>So measuring ice sheet melting is important, not only as a signal of global warming but also because of the sea level impacts. But how is this melting measured? The ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are huge and scientists need enough measurements in space and time to really understand what\u2019s going on. That is, we need high-resolution and long duration measurements to fully understand trends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459049e38885240e7998381ba17186a1a7845f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459049e38885240e7998381ba17186a1a7845f64/0_0_468_351/468.jpg\" alt=\"Greenland Ice Sheet\" width=\"468\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenland Ice Sheet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Briggs/CPOM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069666/full\">a very recent publication</a> in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, an international team reported on a new high-resolution measurement of Greenland. The lead author, <a href=\"http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.mcmillan\">Malcolm McMillan</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.cpom.org/\">Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling</a>, and his colleagues mapped Greenland with incredibly high resolution (5 km distances). <br></p> <p>They accomplished this mapping by obtaining data from <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_Explorers/CryoSat-2/ESA_s_ice_mission\">the Cryosat 2</a> satellite. This satellite uses a technique called radar altimetry to measure the height of surfaces. It is able to track the elevation of the ice sheets on Greenland with high precision. If the height of the ice sheet is growing, it means the ice is getting thicker. If the heights are decreasing, it means the ice layers are getting thinner.</p> <p>A simplistic view would be that if ice sheets become taller, then they contain more frozen water. If they are shorter, they contain less water. But, this isn\u2019t the entire story. Scientists also have to account for other changes, such as changes to density, surface roughness, and water content. When you realize that the Greenland Ice Sheet is thousands of meters thick, and the top layers include both snow and firn (which later get buried and compressed into ice), it becomes apparent that accounting for the constitution of the ice sheet is important when estimating how much water is being delivered to the ocean.</p> <p>The authors of this study did such an accounting and they discovered that not only is Greenland losing a lot of ice, but the loss varies a lot depending on location and year. For example, 2012 was a year of incredible ice loss compared to other years. Also, the western side of the ice sheet is losing much more ice than the eastern side. They also found that a small part of the ice sheet (less than 1% of the sheet) is responsible for more than 10% of the mass loss. </p> <p>In total, they estimate approximately 270 gigatons of ice loss per year for 2011\u20132014. This result is almost a perfect match to independent measurements made by other researchers and builds our confidence in their conclusions. To put this in perspective, the Greenland Ice Sheet is losing approximately 110 million Olympic size swimming pools worth of water each year. </p> <p>Lead author Malcolm told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Using high resolution satellite data from ESA\u2019s CryoSat-2 mission, we have produced a detailed and comprehensive picture of how Greenland has changed in recent years. In particular, we have been able to map the changing ice sheet in fine detail, and pinpoint where, and when, the greatest ice losses have occurred.</em></p> <p><em> These observations reveal not only the extent of Greenland\u2019s contribution to sea level in recent years but, thanks to their high resolution, allow us to identify the key glaciers that are showing the greatest signs of change. The data also enable us to look at how much ice has been lost in each year and, for example, to quantify the large impact on the ice sheet of the record summertime temperatures occurring in 2012.</em></p> <p><em> Within a wider context, satellite records such as these are crucial for systematically monitoring our climate system, and assessing the impact of rising temperatures across Earth\u2019s polar regions. In particular, they help us to understand the sensitivity of the ice sheet to changes in its surrounding atmosphere and ocean environment, and aid the development of reliable sea level rise projections.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The duration of this study is pretty short (4 years). I will be very interested to see if the mass loss continues at the same rate in following years. If the rate of mass loss increases, it may signify a larger future contribution to sea level from Greenland. This would be bad news for vulnerable coastal cities like Miami and certainly something coastal areas should plan for.</p>",
  "<p>More than 170 Iranian students have been forced to defer enrollment and turn down funding at US universities this year because of delays in visa processing.</p> <p>The students were accepted into graduate programs to study subjects ranging from English to engineering, but as classes begin, their lives have been put on hold as they wait for the documents needed to travel to the US. </p> <p>It is unclear why so many visa applications have been held up. Possible explanations offered by students, advocates and immigration experts included the Iran nuclear deal, the attempted coup in Turkey and a lack of Farsi speakers at US embassies.</p> <p>Iranians face more obstacles in getting student visas because the US and Iran do not have diplomatic relations.</p> <p>Afshin Ahmadi was supposed to have begun his third year studying electrical engineering at Clemson University in South Carolina last week, but his visa has not been approved.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything,\u201d Ahmadi said. \u201cI just need to stay at home, and check the internet and see if I\u2019m clear or not.\u201d</p> <p>He has spent the past two years studying in the US and applied for a new visa after he made his first trip back home this summer. But 85 days after his interview at the US embassy in Ankara, Turkey, his application is stuck in the additional screening process known as \u201cadministrative processing\u201d. </p> <p>Ahmadi does not know why the visa is being held up now, after two years of living in the US and after another Iranian student in his research group at Clemson had her visa approved in late July. </p> <p>But if the visa does not arrive soon, he will have to defer enrollment. This means being a year behind on courses only offered in the fall semester, losing a teaching position and missing his November PhD exam day. \u201cIt will ruin all my plans,\u201d Ahmadi said.</p> <p>To apply, an Iranian citizen must visit a US embassy in a different country, usually in the UAE, Turkey or Armenia. The wait for approval can be expected to last long past the US state department\u2019s estimates. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can count on anything, there\u2019s no way of knowing when you\u2019ll be approved,\u201d said Leila Mansouri, the DC chapter president of the Iranian American Bar Association. </p> <p>Mansouri said she has noticed the visa application process taking longer this past year, and knows of some recent cases where administrative processing has taken a year, even though the state department said it usually takes 30 days. </p> <p>The situation is a far cry from the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Iran was for eight years the top sender of students to the US, according to the Institute of International Education. </p> <p>That rate has declined dramatically from the peak in 1979, when 51,310 students from Iran were studying in the US, though it is rising back up slowly, with 11,338 students from Iran from 2014 to 2015, the most in 26 years. The IIE said these students contributed $323m to the US economy in 2014. </p> <p>Students like Ahmadi are attracted to the US because of its top-ranking research facilities and funding opportunities, but the visa process is wearing on him and his peers. </p> <p>About 170 of them gathered on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/08/telegram-the-instant-messaging-app-freeing-up-iranians-conversations\">the Telegram instant messaging app</a> to discuss tips on how to study for graduate school qualifying exams but are now discussing their visa woes. </p> <p>They have collected and analyzed their own data to try and predict when they could expect visa approval, but the results are predictably murky. Of the 170 students, 56 people have already missed the start of their classes. </p> <p>\u201cAmerican governments say they differentiate between the Iranian government and Iranian people, but this specific case shows that is not true at all,\u201d said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American council. </p> <p>The state department said the US welcomes people from across the globe and that \u201cacademic cooperation increases cultural understanding and contributes to mutual progress in research and knowledge\u201d. But it did not explain why these students are facing such a long delay.</p> <p>Most of the Telegram group applied through the US embassy in Ankara, which directed the Guardian\u2019s inquiries to Consular Affairs in Washington DC. The day after the Guardian contacted the US embassy in Ankara, 50 students received updates on their cases. </p> <p>But the updates came too late, as most of the students had already deferred their admission or are worried they still will not get their visas before their individual deadlines to be at school.</p> <p>While they wait, students are living with friends to avoid renting apartments that they will have to move out of abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing and this is killing us,\u201d said Amin, who asked that his real name not be used out of fears of retribution from the US or Iranian government. </p> <p>\u201cWe have no jobs, no houses, no homes\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>There was a 14% spike in applications for British citizenship by European Union nationals living in the UK in the run-up to the EU referendum in June sparked by uncertainty over the outcome of the vote, Home Office figures show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/eu-nationals-have-you-recently-applied-for-british-citizenship\">EU nationals: have you recently applied for British citizenship?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 14% rise in applications for British passports from EU nationals to 15,501 included a 26% rise in applications from Italians and a 9% rise from Polish nationals in Britain. </p> <p>The disclosure comes as the latest set of immigration figures published on Thursday show that net annual migration to Britain had already started to dip before the referendum. </p> <p>The referendum campaign was dominated by the publication of net migration figures showing annual net migration in 2015 rising to a near-record level of 333,000 and appearing out of control.</p> <p> But the latest figures published by the Office for National Statistics show that annual net migration to Britain actually fell by 9,000 to 327,000 in the 12 months to March 2016. <br></p> <p>The detailed figures also show a sharp fall in the number of overseas students coming to Britain in the year to March. Their numbers are down by 28,000 to 164,000 and the lowest level since 2007. The Home Office figures show the largest falls were in numbers coming to study in further education colleges and English language schools but there was also a drop in those going to universities as well.</p> <p>Polish people have become the biggest foreign-born population in Britain, overtaking the Indian community for the first time, with 831,000 living in the UK in 2015 compared with 795,000 Indians.

The largest numbers applying for refugee status came from Iran and Iraq.</p> <p>Nicola White, the head of migration statistics at the ONS, said: \u201cNet migration remains at record levels although the recent trend is broadly flat. The influx of Romanians and Bulgarians has also reached a new high, although that\u2019s offset by falls in non-EU immigration and from other central and eastern European countries. </p> <p>\u201cWork remains the main reason for migration followed by study, which has seen a significant fall in the number of people coming to the UK for education.\u201d</p> <p>White said it was important to remember that the figures only go up to the end of March and do not cover the period following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, said that reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK would be a priority for the negotiations to leave the EU. \u201cWe are also committed to reducing non-EU migration across all visa routes in order to bring net migration down to sustainable levels as soon as possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cToday\u2019s figures demonstrate the reforms we have already introduced to cut abuse across non-EU visa routes and toughen welfare provisions are working. We are also removing more foreign national offenders than ever before and have legislated twice to stop illegal migrants operating under the radar. But there is no doubt there is far more to do.\u201d</p> <p>The Migration Observatory, based at Oxford University, said the latest figures showed that net migration to the UK had relatively stabilised before the EU referendum, and pointed to Poland becoming the top country of birth for migrants living in the UK. </p> <p>Its director, Madeleine Sumption, said: \u201cThis data comes at a time of considerable uncertainty for EU migrants living in the UK, as most EU migrants are not UK citizens. Although the government has committed in principle to allow EU migrants to remain in the UK, there are many unresolved questions about their status.\u201d<br></p> <p>Data on net migration after the referendum will not be available for some time. Figures for the period ending September 2016, for example, will be released in February 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWhile high levels of EU migration were a major theme in the referendum debate, predicting how they will change after Brexit is still an impossible task. We don\u2019t yet know what policies will apply to EU citizens after Brexit. The impact of the referendum outcome on the economy \u2013 and thus whether the UK will continue to be an attractive destination for migrants looking to work in the UK \u2013 also remains uncertain,\u201d Sumption said.</p>",

In 1953, when he was in his 20s and suffering from devastating and seemingly intractable epilepsy, he was the subject of a piece of bravura experimental surgery which removed a large region of his brain. The treatment mitigated the epilepsy but also left him with a profound memory deficit. Although he could remember much about his life before the surgery, he could remember nothing after it for more than a few minutes. For Molaison, \u201cevery day is alone in itself\u201d, wrote Brenda Milner, the psychologist who first studied him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/05/henry-molaison-amnesiac-corkin-book-feature\">Henry Molaison: the amnesiac we'll never forget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the remaining 55 years of his life, he became patient HM, the prize specimen of generations of psychologists exploring the minutiae of his memory loss, and of neuroscientists studying the role played by the brain region which his surgeon removed in making and recovering memories. This is the hippocampus, a curved structure deep in the brain, named for its resemblance to a seahorse.</p> <p>Hundreds of research papers, a&#xa0;clutch of Nobel prizes, novels and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/feb/13/1\" title=\"\">films</a> followed. So did the memoirs of some of those whose careers had been built on the assault on Molaison\u2019s brain, including, most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/27/permanent-present-tense-corkin-review\" title=\"\">those of Suzanne Corkin</a>, the psychologist who jealously guarded HM\u2019s identity for more than four decades, until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/05/obituary-henry-molaison\" title=\"\">his death in 2008</a>. Ever since details of the surgery and its effects were first published, patient HM has been a fixture in psychology textbooks. One might wonder what else there is left to say.</p> <p>Luke Dittrich is not just a science writer in the rather florid American style that reads so uncomfortably to a more austere English ear. He is also the grandson of William Beecher Scoville, the buccaneering surgeon who removed Molaison\u2019s hippocampus, and with it his memory. And in this book, subtitled <em>A Story of Memory, Madness and Family Secrets</em>, he has an uncomfortable family story to tell.</p> <p>The 1950s were the heyday of psychosurgery, and the almost evidence-free belief that removal or sectioning of the large frontal lobes that distinguish the human brain from those of even our nearest primate relatives could alleviate&#xa0;the pains and sorrows of anxiety, depression and even schizophrenia \u2013 to&#xa0;say nothing of politically dangerous&#xa0;thoughts.</p> <p>Flamboyant psychosurgeons in the US and Europe competed in hacking and slicing, with theatrical demonstrations of their techniques. Scoville specialised in opening the skull and slicing connections like cutting through a block of cheese. His rival, William Freeman, used an ice-pick to&#xa0;penetrate the brain through the eye socket \u2013 once, it is claimed, operating on two conscious patients simultaneously, one with each hand. In Britain, Scoville\u2019s main competitor was William Sargant, who claimed that lobotomising depressed housewives would ensure that they could go about their daily chores perfectly well, but more cheerfully.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dittrich is not so much eulogising as digging a grave for his grandfather\u2019s reputation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dittrich has interviewed those who studied HM and are still alive, including Milner, who is now in her 90s. And where data fails him, he speculates extensively about the dead, including his grandparents. Surgical procedures are described in almost excessive detail. The book is replete with invented dialogue, suggestions as to what clothes his grandfather and Molaison may have been wearing when they first met, the cars Scoville drove, even what Molaison may have been thinking as he was prepped for the surgery. And do we really need to know that Milner grew up in Manchester in a house surrounded by delphiniums? It\u2019s even more frustrating that the book is reference-free, so there is no way of checking what is invented, or the sources for what is not. But such digressions are only minor irritations compared with the many disconnected detours the book takes through the author\u2019s holidays with his daughter and his experiences as an amateur bullfighter. The thread of his argument is often lost for pages, even chapters.</p> <p>Finally, in the last few pages of the book, comes Dittrich\u2019s denouement, explaining his subtitle: the strong, scandalous hint that his grandmother, who had spent much of her life institutionalised, was also lobotomised by her husband Scoville, prior to his divorcing her and marrying a much younger woman. Dittrich is not so much eulogising his grandfather as digging a grave for his posthumous reputation.</p> <p>Within moments of his death, Molaison\u2019s brain was removed and passed to a young neuroanatomist, Jacopo Annese, for sectioning, and, as Annese believed, for him to study. Not so, according to Corkin, who claimed rights over the tissue.</p> <p>The many slides on to which HM\u2019s brain sections are mounted are now in the custody of neuroscientists, though not Corkin\u2019s 30 years of accompanying primary research data, much of which she shredded before her death. Not, in a sense, that it matters. Molaison was an old man when he died and, irrespective of the surgery, his brain would have shown signs of atrophy. What possible useful information could be gained from studying these brain sections, any more than the brain of Lenin (for which the infant Soviet Union built an entire Brain Institute) or Einstein (whose pathologist sectioned his brain and packed it into mayonnaise jars for his various friends), or the many other great or notorious individuals that have been so treated in the past? Molaison\u2019s botched operation opened doors into the study of one of the most mysterious of human faculties, memory. But science has moved on, and it is surely time to give him, and his brain, a decent burial.</p> <p>\u2022To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/patient-h-m.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Patient HM</a> for \u00a315.57 (Chatto, RRP \u00a318.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

I was wearing a classic headscarf. I had no intention of swimming,\u201d said the former flight attendant from Toulouse, giving her name only as Siam.</p> <p>She told the police that she thought her clothing was normal and appropriate, she had not shocked anyone and there was no law stopping her being dressed as she was.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in a burkini, I wasn\u2019t in a burqa, I wasn\u2019t naked, so I considered my clothing was appropriate,\u201d she said. She described a mini-riot around her as about 10 people ran over in support, telling the police that the family was not bothering anyone, while about 10 others verbally insulted her. \u201cThere were insults like \u2018Go home\u2019, \u2018We don\u2019t want that here\u2019, \u2018France is a Catholic country\u2019. My daughter was crying, she didn\u2019t understand why her mother was being asked to leave.\u201d</p> <p>She was fined by police, who wrote on her ticket that her clothing did not conform with \u201cgood manners\u201d or French secularism.</p> <p>Sarkozy, who is running for the presidency again next year, is stepping up his hardline rhetoric ahead of must-win primaries organised by the French right in November where he is expected to face tough competition. He is expected to campaign on a hard-line platform on immigration and security issues in a country marked by recent attacks carried out by Islamist extremists.</p> <p>In the TF1 channel interview, Sarkozy insisted that Muslims in France are French people \u201cexactly like any other ones\u201d but, when living in the country, they must \u201cassimilate\u201d the French language and way of life, the French regions and the history of France.</p> <p>The French Council of the Muslim Faith has requested urgent talks with the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, citing the \u201cgrowing fear of stigmatisation of Muslims in France\u201d.</p> <p>The bans follow the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/one-eye-on-the-emergency-exit-the-anxious-mood-in-germany-and-france\">Bastille Day attack in Nice</a> and the murder of a priest in Normandy. The various mayoral decrees do not explicitly use the word burkini; instead they ban \u201cbeachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation,\u201d citing reasons such as the need to protect public order, hygiene or French laws on secularism.</p> <p>The burkini bans have prompted a row over the French principle of <em><em>la\u00efcit\u00e9 </em></em>(secularism), amid accusations that politicians are twisting and distorting this principle for political gain, and to target Muslims.</p>",

And yet he is still living in the makeshift refugee camp, with no way of knowing when he will be able to leave. He has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/peer-condemns-shocking-delays-over-help-for-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">waiting for his transfer to the UK</a> for almost two months. </p> <p>Volunteers working in the camp say <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/18/conditions-for-unaccompanied-children-in-calais-camp-worsening-says-report\">violence is increasing</a> as its population increases with the good weather, meaning more people are attempting the journey.

There is no answer, other than paperwork.</p> <p>The Syrian community has shrunk to around 50 of the 8,000 people living in the camp. Volunteers say though the system is slow, there are now official routes in place to help Syrians claim asylum in France or help children reach families in the UK. </p> <p>Around 30 Syrian boys have been reunited with their families in the UK, through the work of Safe Passage. But for others, no such systems exist. Volunteers are particularly worried about unaccompanied young girls, mostly from Eritrea, whose numbers are growing, with up to 50 now in the camp. </p> <p>Were they to decide to claim asylum in France and move to the official housing, only six beds for young women are on offer and volunteers say many young asylum seekers of either sex are regularly turned away, despite being actively encouraged to claim asylum in France. </p> <p>Johnny Willis, a volunteer co-ordinator with Help Refugees who runs the camp\u2019s brightly painted youth centre, said he had had 10 asylum seekers turned away by the authorities in one day. </p> <p>\u201cStaying in France is the only safe thing we can really recommend. And they are wasting their youths here, this really talented bunch of kids, they have so much to offer and it is just painful to watch them here for months on end.

  "<p>Two centuries and a world apart, the Brothers Grimm and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shaun-tan\">Shaun Tan</a> share an ability to confound those who attempt to categorise them. When the German Grimm siblings released the first edition of their tales in 1812, it was under the name Kinder-und Hausm\u00e4rchen, or Children\u2019s and Household Tales, a title that belied the incest, infanticide and cannibalism found within. It didn\u2019t sell. Even after they spent 45 years making increasingly child-friendly revisions over seven editions, their tales of princesses and princes, step-mothers and witches remained controversial; after the second world war, allied forces briefly banned the publication of the Grimm tales in Germany, believing that their violence and nationalism had fuelled Nazi savagery, while around the same time, Disney was hijacking them for saccharine retellings of Cinderella (featuring less eye-plucking) and Snow White (less death by dancing).</p> <p>Tan also ostensibly writes books for children, but has a history of confusing adults with his surreal, often political picture books. The Australian artist quickly became famous for his intricately illustrated and laconic stories. He picked at the scabs of Australian history in books including The Rabbits (1998), a surreal allegory about colonisation, and The Arrival (2006), an entirely wordless graphic novel about refugees, and he pulled apart mental illness and depression in picture book The Red Tree (2001). Tan was dismissed by some on Australia\u2019s right for producing \u201cpolitically correct propaganda\u201d; for those who loved him, the greatest criticism could be that his books \u201cwould almost rather be looked at than read\u201d, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Yang-t.html?_r=0\">the New York Times once wrote</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ade682f6c1608cd44f7ceccfd958d394d2297a4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ade682f6c1608cd44f7ceccfd958d394d2297a4c/0_459_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shaun Tan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I remember having a massive argument with a kid because I said bats weren\u2019t real\u2019 \u2026 Shaun Tan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tan\u2019s breakthrough came in 2011, when he won an Oscar for the short film version of his book <a href=\"http://www.thelostthing.com/\">The Lost Thing</a> \u2013 narrated by fellow Perthling and Tan fan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tim-minchin\">Tim Minchin</a> \u2013 as well as the biggest award in children\u2019s literature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/mar/29/shaun-tan-astrid-lindgren-prize\">the Astrid Lindgren prize</a>. Suddenly, bookshops across Australia spawned \u201cadult picture book\u201d sections, to create a home for an author perhaps more likely to be appreciated by parents than children. Even Tan himself warns of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/18/the-rabbits-review-triumphant-adaptation-of-a-deeply-tragic-story\">The Rabbits</a>: \u201cIt is not necessarily a good choice for pleasant bedtime reading.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up in the blistering heat of Perth\u2019s suburbs, Tan remained indifferent to fairytales well into adulthood. \u201cI know a lot of kids my age had a fascination with feudal times,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it was so exotic. But I had weird ideas about what was fact and fiction; if you\u2019d asked me if kings or castles were real, I would\u2019ve said no, they\u2019re made up. I remember having a massive argument with a kid because I said bats weren\u2019t real.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re so massively removed from where these stories come from \u2013 things like reindeer and fir trees and snow are just fiction.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he was an adult that Tan began to appreciate the Grimm tales, \u201cfor their complexity, ambiguity and endurance\u201d. But when Tan was asked to illustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/grimm-tales-philip-pullman-review\">Philip Pullman\u2019s Grimm Tales</a> by a German publisher in 2012, he was sceptical. Pullman wrote in his introduction that illustration did not suit the Grimm\u2019s giant cast of two-dimensional archetypes. \u201cThat had always bothered me, too,\u201d says Tan. \u201cThere are a lot of Grimm illustrators I love, like <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/29/arthur-rackham-brothers-grimm/\">Arthur Rackham</a>, but they always conflicted with my own mental images. I can only look at the pictures, or read the story, because I have a completely different take on the evil queen or the wolf or the fox.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a710917ceca1199ca39a8c345c01b338a1462a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a710917ceca1199ca39a8c345c01b338a1462a1/0_252_2244_2370/947.jpg\" alt=\"Hansel and Gretel by Shaun Tan\" width=\"947\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hansel and Gretel by Shaun Tan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Tan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Tan had long craved a sculptural project, and when he discovered <a href=\"https://www.inuitsculptures.com/\">Inuit soapstone carvings</a> and <a href=\"http://www.artemisgallery.com/pre-columbian-all.html\">pre-Columbian pottery</a> on trips to Canada and Mexico, it sparked the idea of using small sculptures to tell the Grimm stories. The first tale he sculpted was Hansel and Gretel: a home adorned with cake decorations and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/the-babadook-review-chilling-freudian-thriller\">Babadook</a>-ish witch looming nearby. Tan loved it. \u201cWith drawing, you have to redraw it until you get it right. The great thing about sculpture is that if a line is in the wrong place, you just push it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it truly isn\u2019t working, you just squeeze until it becomes something new.\u201d</p> <p>All between 6cm and 40cm high, Tan spent around three days on each of the 75 sculptures, moulding, painting, drying and photographing \u2013 another medium he is not known for and \u201cspent a lot of time trying to get right so it didn\u2019t look like some bad archaeological catalogue from the 70s\u201d. Working in clay and papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 forced him to keep things simple: \u201cI am not so good at doing simple things because I have this tendency to revisit again and again to add more stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The resulting figures are almost primitive in their simplicity, a nightmarish mix of cute and gruesome. Rapunzel doubling as her own tower is sweet; the bloodbath in Fitcher\u2019s Bird less so. In his foreword, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/neilgaiman\">Neil Gaiman</a> praises their tactility: \u201cI want to squeeze them in my hands as I walk in the dark, to put them in my pockets and feel them there, reassuring me \u2026 [Tan] makes me wonder what damage I could do with them, how badly I could hurt someone if I hit them with a story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5923b33244b1e2bd367edd363919a87e14123b64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5923b33244b1e2bd367edd363919a87e14123b64/0_731_2244_1674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tan\u2019s statue of the Grimm tale The Fox and the Cat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tan\u2019s statue of the Grimm tale The Fox and the Cat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Tan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHonestly, I thought it might be boring,\u201d Tan says wryly. \u201cI\u2019m pleased it is not. When you\u2019re doing a painting or drawing, you tend to get a little bit hypnotised with it, enamoured in a way someone looking at it will never be. But when you\u2019re working quickly with clay, you never get hooked. It allows you objectivity, to notice when it is going wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Famously economical with words, Tan shortened each Grimm story into a snapshot, pinpointing what he calls \u201cthe DNA of the tale, the core that haunts people forever\u201d; Little Red Riding Hood is reduced to a conversation between the girl and the wolf, The Frog King focuses on the princess\u2019s dismissive thoughts towards her amphibian beau. For readers familiar with the tales, these are triggers; in the unfamiliar stories, the brevity of the writing makes for an unsettling, dreamlike experience, particularly in the bloody ones.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when you wake up from a bad dream \u2013 you never remember the whole dream, you remember the most disturbing part,\u201d Tan says. \u201cSo I eroded these stories down.\u201d The sculptures also reflect this idea: some are as featureless as river stones, with Tan even sanding off the face of Snow White\u2019s evil queen, a woman whose looks have been destroyed by jealousy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25bcc278a5dd8205b6f0b4147f35c00056e5536c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25bcc278a5dd8205b6f0b4147f35c00056e5536c/73_79_2118_2646/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tan\u2019s rendition of Snow White\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaun Tan\u2019s rendition of Snow White</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Tan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is any part of him attracted to the violence in the tales? \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, yes. I can\u2019t handle violence in the real world, but in this transfigured state, it is kind of playful and interesting. But if you made any of these into a live-action film, they\u2019d be too horrible to watch. The Juniper Tree is awful \u2013 imagine a film where a woman feeds a child to its father. It would make you feel awful! But there is something about depicting violence obliquely that makes it appealing.\u201d</p> <p>Tan is now working on other stories while keeping an eye on several TV and film adaptations \u201cthat seem to be eternally floating around, like a plane trapped at Heathrow in a holding pattern\u201d. It\u2019s a process he alludes to with contained frustration: \u201cWhen they get done, they do have the potential to be fantastic, but at least when I decide to write a book, it always gets done.\u201d</p> <p>He has since sold many of the statues, but kept some delicate favourites \u2013 Hansel and Gretel and Hans My Hedgehog, which was also Pullman\u2019s pick: \u201cI said, \u2018Sorry Philip, I can\u2019t give you that one in good conscience, as it might fall apart.\u2019 He\u2019s happy with Briar Rose, though. I gave Neil The Juniper Tree.\u201d Hang on, wasn\u2019t that one of the more horrible ones? Tan cracks a smile. \u201cYeah, but I bet he likes it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Singing Bones by Shaun Tan is published by Walker in the UK and by Allen &amp; Unwin in Australia.

  "<p>If you demolish a historic building in Timbuktu you commit a war crime. If you demolish one in Britain you apply for retrospective planning permission. What is the difference?</p> <p>The decision of the international court in The Hague this week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ahmad-al-mahdi-trial-the-hague-timbuktu-cultural-destruction\">prosecute a former al-Qaida insurgent, Ahmad al-Mahdi</a>, for destroying nine ancient tombs in Mali is deeply significant. For the first time, the concept of war criminality has been extended from killing people to trying to wipe out their cultural heritage.</p> <p>In 2012 al-Mahdi led a band of jihadis in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/mali-islamists-attack-world-heritage-mosques-timbuktu\">systematic destruction</a> of relics of Mali\u2019s ancient culture of pluralism, claiming it as an offence to Islamic fundamentalism. Timbuktu\u2019s three mosques and its mausoleums were the great treasures of Saharan Africa, a culture that flourished at the time of Renaissance Florence. Despite the efforts of their custodians, manuscripts and books dating back to the 13th century were lost. Unesco\u2019s director general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/03/irina-bokova-un-unesco-world-heritage-palmyra-isis\">Irina Bokova</a>, called the attack part of \u201ca genocidal project, an attempted annihilation of otherness\u201d. The mayor of Timbuktu said the shrines \u201cbelong to the whole world\u201d.</p> <p>In theory, the definition of a war crime has long gone beyond killing. It embraces torture, rape, the use of certain weapons and the destruction of property. Conventions in 1954 and 1977 specifically extended the protection of international law to \u201ccultural property\u201d, including sites, monuments, museums and art works. A <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590\">1999 protocol</a> set out criminal sanctions covering such matters.</p> <p>Prosecutions were never brought. This was partly for fear of appearing to elevate objects above people, but also because few hands are clean in this matter. No action was taken over the 1993 demolition by Serbs of Bosnian mosques and other historic structures. No action was taken in 1999 over Nato\u2019s senseless bombing of historic structures in Novi Sad in north Serbia. Britain itself has never even ratified the 1954 convention, despite promises as recently as in last May\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech. It is believed the RAF lobbied against doing so.</p> <p>In other words, the Hague case could open a can of worms \u2013 and with luck will do so. One of the most depressing books I have read is Robert Bevan\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/351135/\">The Destruction of Memory</a>. From Cort\u00e9s in Mexico to Britain\u2019s bombing of historic L\u00fcbeck and the retaliatory Baedeker raids in the second world war, Bevan records systematic attacks on heritage targets as integral to military conquest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2ab135b9f9cdcda0b23d453326e1d1b18efc8be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2ab135b9f9cdcda0b23d453326e1d1b18efc8be/0_118_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad al-Mahdi on trial at the international criminal court in The Hague.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmad al-Mahdi on trial at the international criminal court in The Hague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In case after case - mostly recently the Taliban in Bamiyan and Isis in Palmyra - wiping out the culture of a hated people was a means of subjugating them. Even in peace, communist regimes knew that destroying old buildings played a part in countering the conservative enemy within.</p> <p>The jihadis\u2019 destruction of Islam\u2019s past may have seemed appallingly systematic. But its effect on the ground was no more appalling than the reckless western, and now Russian, aerial bombardment of urban targets in Iraq and Syria. Some 50,000 bombs and missiles have fallen on these countries since 2003. The tally of civilians killed by such bombs is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/does-the-us-ignore-its-civilian-casualties-in-iraq-and-syria.html?_r=0\">almost certainly greater than those killed by Islamic State</a>. The cultural devastation cannot be computed. America standing by during the firing and looting of Baghdad\u2019s library and museum during the 2003 invasion was in flagrant defiance of the Hague convention. It makes al-Mahdi\u2019s crime seem almost petty.</p> <p>Timbuktu\u2019s assiduousness in pursuing its case reflects the complex relationship of all countries to their past. Old places are not simply relics for scholars. Millions visit historical sites because they see them as exemplars of continuity and stability amid change. As Bevan points out, that conquerors so crave their destruction is a measure of their significance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/03/irina-bokova-un-unesco-world-heritage-palmyra-isis\">Irina Bokova: the woman standing between Isis and world heritage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I like old places not because I always find them beautiful \u2013 many are not beautiful while some new buildings are.

This applies even where they have been drastically rebuilt. If the 19th century had not restored so many gothic cathedrals and old towns, 21st-century Europe would be immeasurably the poorer.</p> <p>Historic buildings possess the same cultural vitality as do great sculptures and paintings. We have international laws governing the restitution of art to its owners. The Hague prosecution suggests that we might treat destroyed old buildings the same, protecting them in time of war and restoring them to their cities if damaged afterwards.</p> <p>Warsaw rebuilt its old square, Dresden its Frauenkirche and the National Trust its fire-damaged Uppark. It is to Unesco\u2019s credit that it has already used local craftsmen to rebuild the shrines smashed by al-Mahdi, even if it cannot recover their books and contents. By prosecuting those who did the smashing, the court greatly strengthens the case for such rebuilding.</p> <p>Yet a new fundamentalism is emerging, that of \u201chistorical authenticity\u201d. Unesco still cannot make up its mind to restore the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/rebuild-bamiyan-buddhas-taliban-afghanistan\">Bamiyan buddhas</a>, even though parts of them were already copies.

The future of old Aleppo faces those caring for Syria\u2019s past with a clear choice: to restore as in Warsaw, or to \u201cmodernise\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If a vase is broken we do not leave it unrepaired.

The cause may be development value rather than war. The loss to communal memory is the same.</p> <p>If a vase is broken or a picture slashed we do not leave them unrepaired. Why treat a building or a neighbourhood or a whole culture more harshly, when we now have the means and the skills to repair them? To retreat into some ideological \u201ctruth to materials\u201d or \u201cconserve as found\u201d is elitist, obscurantist and, in the case of jihadi outrages, a glorification of terrorism.</p> <p>The Hague trial honours the obligation of today\u2019s generation to guard the evidence of the past, at least in times of conflict. In admitting his guilt, al-Mahdi\u2019s lawyer says \u201che regrets all the acts he committed\u2026 and feels pain and a broken heart at what he has done\u201d. Would that all who perpetrate similar destruction, in war or peace, might say the same.</p> <p>Imprisoning al-Mahdi cannot do much good. Making amends by correcting his destruction is far better. If Timbuktu is any guide, the miseries lately inflicted on Iraq and Syria could yet be turned to recompense and renaissance. When peace returns, we cannot breathe life into dead bodies, but we can redress the murder of memories.</p>",
  "<p>The tweet was sent by Germany\u2019s federal agency for migration and refugees a year ago today. \u201cThe #Dublin procedure for Syrian citizens is at this point in time effectively no longer being adhered to,\u201d the message read.

But in Germany it is being spoken of as the first post on social media to change the course of European history.</p> <p>Referring to an EU law determined at a convention in Dublin in 1990, the tweet was widely interpreted as a de facto suspension of the rule that the country in Europe where a refugee first arrives is responsible for handling his or her asylum application.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BAMF_Dialog/status/636138495468285952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dublin?src=hash\">#Dublin</a>-Verfahren syrischer Staatsangeh\u00f6riger werden zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen Zeitpunkt von uns weitestgehend faktisch nicht weiter verfolgt.</p>&mdash; BAMF (@BAMF_Dialog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BAMF_Dialog/status/636138495468285952\">August 25, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>By this point in 2015, more than 300,000 asylum seekers had reached Europe by boat \u2013 a figure that was already 50% higher than even the record-breaking number of arrivals in 2014.</p> <p>Although the German agency\u2019s intervention certainly did not start the crisis, it did make Germany the first-choice destination for Syrians who previously might have aimed for other countries in Europe, such as Sweden, which at the time offered indefinite asylum to Syrians.</p> <p>It also created an impression of confusion and loss of political control, from which Angela Merkel\u2019s government has at times struggled to recover.

After BAMF\u2019s tweet, many refused to do so, reportedly holding up their smartphones displaying the message to police and border officers. Hungary\u2019s ambassador to Germany later claimed that the day after the tweet, Serbian police had found thousands of discarded passports on their side of the border. \u201cFrom that moment on, every refugee was a Syrian,\u201d Peter Gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s said<em>.</em></p> <p>When Gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s called the German interior ministry, officials said they were not aware of the tweet. In a press conference the following day, Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, said that the suspension of the Dublin agreement was \u201cnot as such a legally binding act\u201d, but more of a \u201cguideline for management practice\u201d.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Manfred Schmidt, the head of BAMF, stepped down for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, although in many quarters it is assumed that he was forced to do so because of his agency exposing the government\u2019s loss of political control.</p> <p>But a year on, the long-term consequences of the tweet are gradually becoming apparent. In April, the European commission revealed a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/eu-unveils-plans-reform-asylum-rules-refugee-migrant\">wide-ranging shake-up of the Dublin system</a>, which has long been criticised by human rights lawyers for unfairly pushing the main burden of asylum applications to poorer countries on the periphery of the EU while protecting wealthier landlocked member states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/eu-unveils-plans-reform-asylum-rules-refugee-migrant\">EU unveils plans to reform asylum rules to help frontline members</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet sources close to BAMF insist the tweet had not been intended to torpedo the unloved law, but as an emergency decluttering measure, freeing the agency from additional bureaucracy before it was unable to cope. </p> <p>According to Gerald Knaus, the initial architect of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">EU-Turkey deal</a> and the head of the European Stability Initiative thinktank, the tweet was not intended to signal a major policy change, and was not written by senior policymakers.</p> <p>\u201cIt was seen as simply stating the obvious \u2013 they had already stopped trying to send Syrians back \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t considered how it would be perceived,\u201d said Knaus. \u201cIt took on a life on its own, because it confirmed that anyone who got to Germany could stay. It wasn\u2019t a new decision \u2013 but it sent out a signal.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the scenes at the time, Knaus said, German officials were split between those who felt it was necessary to send people back to Hungary and viable to close the German border, and those who felt that it was logistically impossible and morally unjustifiable.

It\u2019s a very, very hard thing.\u201d</p> <p>The remarks are the strongest evidence yet that Trump is softening his previous stance on illegal immigration, after a meeting with Latino Republicans over the weekend led multiple outlets to report that Trump had vowed to move beyond his pledge to deport all undocumented immigrants from the country, as well as US citizens born to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign threw cold water on those reports at the time. Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said on Saturday: \u201cTrump said nothing today that he hasn\u2019t said many times before, including in his convention speech \u2013 enforce our immigration laws, uphold the constitution and be fair and humane while putting American workers first.\u201d</p> <p>Since fall of last year, Trump vowed to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to eject undocumented migrants from the US, but campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, a new addition to the campaign after a leadership shakeup earlier this month, waffled on whether the candidate still embraced that idea on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cAs the weeks unfold, as the weeks unfold, he will lay out the specifics of that plan that he would implement as president of the United States,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked about whether those specifics included a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d Conway replied: \u201cTo be determined.\u201d</p> <p>John Weaver, former senior strategist for the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, told the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs that Trump\u2019s newfound openness to legal status for undocumented immigrants reads highly familiar - despite Trump decrying the position as tantamount to amnesty during the Republican presidential primaries.</p> <p>\u201cHe has jack rabbit trailed his way to John Kasich\u2019s correct view on immigration,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBut, alas it won\u2019t last.

Using his prepared remarks in the same way John Coltrane used the sheet music to My Favorite Things, the Republican nominee went on a number of memorable riffs. Voters learned that many of the Hollywood celebrities supporting Hillary Clinton \u201cweren\u2019t very hot any more,\u201d that Trump\u2019s much vaunted border wall would also have \u201cprotection for tunnels\u201d and that in a succinct summation of his message \u201ceverything is bad.\u201d</p> <p>With the hire of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week, Trump had started to resemble a more traditional candidate. The teleprompters which he once disdained became a staple of rallies and the campaign\u2019s press office would send out prepared remarks for every speech. It was a far cry from the \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d philosophy which guided the nominee\u2019s first campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and it was far more effective than efforts of replacement Paul Manafort to rein the outspoken real estate developer. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-tries-out-a-new-campaign-tactic-saying-sorry\">expressed a statement of regret</a> last week in North Carolina, the closest he has ever come to an apology for his multitude of controversial remarks in the course of his campaign.</p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s remarks Wednesday were classic unscripted statements from the candidate. He stoked controversy by hinting at unfounded rumors about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health when he apparently misspoke that his Democratic rival was \u201cpremedicated\u201d in lieu of saying \u201cpremeditated\u201d as was in his prepared remarks. Trump dwelled on the phrase and suggested that he liked \u201cpremedicated\u201d better. It was a return to form for the Republican nominee and one that was received to cheers from his supportive crowd. The question as Trump moves forward with yet another reinvented campaign team is whether this was a brief lapse in style or if it simply further evidence that no operative can tame the bombastic populist on the stump.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0c60e4b0fe30498a473f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T21:11:28.665Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of Donald Trump\u2019s Maryland and Northern Virginia campaigns has suggested that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and would not survive a year in office during a \u201cMoms 4 Trump\u201d event in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69aa6007102949ca4c53ad9e5a5fdfa8db53f0a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHow many of you would wear a wool coat in August?\u201d John Jaggers asked the a crowd of Trump supporters at Salamander Resort in Middleburg, Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/trump_campaign_operative_suggests_clinton_will_die_during_first432\">according to the Loudoun Times-Mirror</a>. \u201cThe woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/donald-trump-louisiana-floods-supplies\">visited Baton Rouge last Friday</a>, handing out water and diapers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, one of the benefits of being five months short of leaving here is I don\u2019t worry too much about politics,\u201d said Obama, wearing a checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and an unbuttoned collar, standing in front of piles of waterlogged debris. \u201cThe second thing I have seen historically is that, when disasters strike, that\u2019s probably one of the few times when Washington tends not to get political.</p> <p>\u201cI guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you\u2019re Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they\u2019re getting the drywall out and the carpet out, there\u2019s not any mould building, they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible. That\u2019s what they care about. That\u2019s what I care about.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/louisiana-flooding-disaster-obama-baton-rouge-mississippi\">The storm and its flooding</a> have damaged an estimated 60,000 homes and forced thousands to seek temporary housing. More than 115,000 people have registered for federal disaster aid. Obama said federal support is at $127m so far. At least 40 state highways remained closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/barack-obama-fema-louisiana-flood-recovery-culture-katrina\">Obama praises Fema's 'change of culture' during tour of Louisiana flood recovery</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57be0242e4b048662988fcc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T20:23:53.754Z\">9.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Video: </strong>At a private fundraiser on Sunday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Cher praised Clinton while comparing Donald Trump to Stalin and Hitler.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5x6qd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2681977\"            data-video-name=\"Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57bdf9ebe4b0fe30498a4716\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/24/160824cher_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/24/160824cher.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/24/160824cher_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/24/cher-trump-hitler-video\">Cher compares Donald Trump to Hitler at Clinton fundraiser</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDo you remember Fun With Dick and Jane?

Clinton\u2019s personal physician, <a href=\"https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf\">Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said</a>: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/clinton-responds-to-deranged-conspiracy-theories-about-her-health-746921539976\">conspiracy theories</a> about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12505078/hillary-clinton-health-stroke-conspiracy-fake\">no evidence</a> these claims are true.</p> <p>I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor. I don\u2019t diagnose patients in the absence of unbiased, reliable information, such as performing a physical exam or reviewing tests. When I write or am interviewed on television or the radio, I\u2019ll talk about what new research will mean for patients and the science behind the latest guidelines. I\u2019ll explain why we\u2019re seeing increasing rates of certain diseases and whether policies to combat them make sense. I don\u2019t talk about individuals except to say what one might expect more generally with regard to a particular medical illness.</p> <p>But the scientist in me understands that the real issue here isn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s health. Conspiracy theories signal fear; in this case, Trump\u2019s realization that Clinton may well be the next president of the United States.</p> <p>This is not the first time rumors of illness have been deployed to attack a seemingly untouchable political adversary. At a time when Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis had a 10-point lead over then vice-president George HW Bush in the polls, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/03/15/exp-rftwh-bush-vs-dukakis-1-1.cnn/video/playlists/race-to-the-white-house--original-series/\">reports circulated</a> that Dukakis suffered severe depression after losing his first re-election campaign. When asked if Dukakis should release his complete medical records, Ronald Reagan did little to dispel those rumors,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/us/dukakis-releases-medical-details-to-stop-rumors-on-mental-health.html\">saying</a>: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to pick on an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump surrogates are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMarcSiegel/status/764541927152820225\">calling</a> on Clinton to release her medical records. Trump has not released his, and a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/trump_health_record.pdf\">letter from his physician</a> reads as if Trump had written it himself: little in the way of detail but plenty of superlatives like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d. Meanwhile, in contrast to Clinton and every other presidential candidate in the last 40 years except Gerald R Ford, Trump has yet to release his tax returns.</p> <p>The scientist in me knows that attempts to debunk conspiracy theories \u2013 whether they\u2019re about Clinton\u2019s health or the myth that vaccines cause autism \u2013 are at best futile and may in fact <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/AS/PoliSci/Peffley/pdf/nyhan-reifler%202007%20When%20Predictions%20Fail.pdf\">backfire</a>. We pick and choose those facts that add up to the truth we\u2019ve already chosen to believe. The more someone tries to disprove the reality we\u2019ve constructed, the more we dig in our heels.</p> <p>In 2008, questions about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/03/24/party-of-nuts-poll-shows-gop-thinks-obama-is-muslim-socialist\">President Obama\u2019s citizenship</a> intensified with his likelihood of clinching the Democratic nomination. So long as the odds of winning the election remain in Clinton\u2019s favor, we can expect to see more conspiracy theories emerge between now and November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/hillary-clinton-health-rumors-doctor-column\">I'm a doctor.

  "<p>I\u2019m guessing that Malcolm Turnbull gets a fair few letters on any given day. You wonder how he has the time to read them all.</p> <p>How do you prioritise the ones worth your attention and the ones that you can toss in the round-shaped filing cabinet under your desk? </p> <p>Perhaps there\u2019s some formula involved in picking out the ones worthy of a public response \u2013 some sort of computer model that measures time and effort against the votes you might get, the donors and lobby groups you can afford to upset and the sort of reaction you can expect from the mainstream media. </p> <p>Either that, or the letters all get dropped into a giant hessian sack ready for a morning lucky dip. </p> <p>Honestly, I\u2019ve no idea. </p> <p>But a factor that appears not to be all that important are ones warning of an unfolding crisis that threatens people\u2019s way of life, impacts countries across the globe, condemns future generations to several metres of sea level rise and generally makes the future not all that pleasant. </p> <p>The number of letters coming into the prime minister\u2019s office of late from climate change and marine scientists warning of these sorts of scenarios would be very hard to miss, especially when they\u2019re signed by some of the best informed scientists from Australia and the rest of the world.</p> <p>The latest one to drop into Turnbull\u2019s office/social media feed/sack/bin carries the signatures of more than 150 of Australia\u2019s leading scientists who work at universities and government agencies across the country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/154-australian-scientists-demand-climate-policy-that-matches-the-science-64359\">letter says</a> \u201cgovernments worldwide are presiding over a large-scale demise of the planetary ecosystems, which threatens to leave large parts of Earth uninhabitable\u201d and asks for \u201cmeaningful reductions\u201d in greenhouse gas emissions and cuts to coal exports. </p> <p>The letter, coordinated by Australian National University Earth scientist Dr Andrew Glikson, lays out a few facts. </p> <p>July 2016 was the hottest month the world has experienced on a temperature record going back 136 years. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising at a rate not known in at least 55m years. Daytime heat records in Australia are being broken three times as often as cold records. Ice sheets are melting at an increasing rate and sea level rise was is accelerating. </p> <p>Once he had collaborated with colleagues to refine the text, it only took Glikson a couple of days to gather the signatures. </p> <p>He told me there was an increasing sense of frustration among scientists that warnings and predictions, stemming from peer-reviewed research over many years, were going unheeded in the corridors of power. </p> <p>He put the lack of genuine action to cut greenhouse gas emissions down to two things: a media that downplays or ignores the issue, and a fossil fuel industry with too much power over the political process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people just don\u2019t understand the issue because there has been something of a cover-up across many parts of mainstream media, with a few exceptions. Sure, the media reports the issue, but they don\u2019t explain it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But the fossil fuel industry is the largest in the world by far. There\u2019s an enormous vested interest and the political elites just follow that money.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Glikson admitted he didn\u2019t \u201canticipate a response\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s office. </p> <h2>Scientists ask for coal cuts</h2> <p>The letter, like several others over the last year or so, have called for Australia to move away from its support for the fossil fuel industry, in particular coal.</p> <p>In October last year, just before the United Nations climate talks in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.nonewcoalmines.org.au/open_letter\">scientists joined campaigners and advocates to sign an open letter</a> to world leaders asking for a moratorium on new coalmines in Australia.</p> <p>Australia was in the process of doubling its coal exports, the letter said, something that was \u201cincompatible with the world\u2019s objective of limiting global warming below dangerous levels\u201d. </p> <p>In February this year, about <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/02/11/scientists-60-countries-condemn-cuts-vital-climate-research-australia-s-csiro-agency\">3,000 scientists from more than 60 countries sent a letter to the prime minister</a> pleading for reconsideration of the drastic cuts to climate research planned at the CSIRO.</p> <p>The letter said that rather than cut climate change research, what was needed was more investment. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Without committing to the continued development of next generation climate monitoring and climate modelling, billions of public investment dollars for long-term infrastructure will be based on guesswork rather than on strategic and informed science-driven policy. The societal benefits of climate science far outweigh the likely high costs of reacting to future climate change instead of strategically planning for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>In June more than 2,000 marine scientists and reef managers from across the world sent Turnbull a letter asking his government to \u201cstop endorsing the export of coal\u201d and to \u201cstop or revoke the approval of new mines\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/readfearn/status/746917373429506049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Letter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm\">@TurnbullMalcolm</a> from 2k+ coral scientists asks for end to backing of coal exports and no more coal mines <a href=\"https://t.co/4Cx6p2obWj\">pic.twitter.com/4Cx6p2obWj</a></p>&mdash; Graham Readfearn (@readfearn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/readfearn/status/746917373429506049\">June 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Coral reefs supported 500 million people worldwide, the letter said, but reefs were \u201cthreatened with complete collapse\u201d</p> <p>A quarter of marine species were at risk, exposing \u201chundreds of millions of people to decreasing food security and increased poverty\u201d. </p> <h2>Advice from a former Malcolm</h2> <p>So let\u2019s say thanks to either the luck of the draw or advice from his policy team, Turnbull finds himself reading the latest open letter from scientists asking for leadership on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. What should he do? </p> <p>Maybe he could take some words of advice from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2015/sep/18/is-new-australian-prime-minister-malcolm-turnbull-already-a-climate-change-turncoat\">former version of himself</a>? </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We know that the consequences of unchecked global warming would be catastrophic.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>We as a human species have a deep and abiding obligation to this planet and to the generations that will come after us \u2026</p> <p>A zero emission future, we know, is absolutely essential if we are to leave a safe planet to our children and the generations that come after them.</p> </blockquote>",
