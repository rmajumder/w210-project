Pieters tries to knock in his birdie putt for insurance, but that\u2019s just a par. So here we go, then, a slippery downhill one for the point. And it\u2019s never going anywhere but in! Rory was snoozing for much of that back nine, but look how he came to life: an eagle to seal a 3&amp;2 victory! He pointedly takes a theatrical bow to all four corners of Hazeltine, then shouts EFFING COME ON, or something like it, before chest bumping his partner with some feeling. Pieters being the best part of a foot taller than McIlroy, he nearly knocks Europe\u2019s star turn over, and looks back sheepishly to check he hasn\u2019t done exactly that. Don\u2019t worry, Thomas, it\u2019s fine. Everyone\u2019s fine. Europe have dug themselves out of a massive hole here, and you\u2019ve been a big part of it this afternoon.

So in turn, the pressure has now been shuttled onto Dustin, and he buckles, pulling his approach into the drink front left. He blames a mud ball, but the match-play moxie of McIlroy was surely to blame for that aberration.

He can\u2019t make it, the ball drifting away to the right, all those heroics for naught. A deserved win for Europe, though, with Cabrera Bello particularly impressive on debut. He strutted onto the course with purpose, and instantly looked like he belonged. What an attitude! It was an attitude Europe desperately required, too. He\u2019s done his bit.

And he\u2019s not able to make his ten-footer, the ball sliding off to the right, a lack of pace the problem. Kuchar has a chance to knock in a birdie putt from a similar position, but leaves his up on the left! So it\u2019s down to Dustin from three feet. And he only just squeaks it in, a very nervous dribbler that catches the left edge of the cup. But it still counts, doesn\u2019t it.

McIlroy appears to have been shaken from his lethargy, and has blistered one hell of a drive down the track at 15. Sergio meanwhile dices with the water front left of the green at 16, but his approach just makes it over. With Moore in the rough to the right of the green, and Holmes forced to chip out from behind a tree, Europe are in pole position here.

The onus is on Pieters again, and he\u2019s just flown his second down into thick cabbage down the side of the green. Meanwhile what about Ryan Moore? How about this! He really is nuclear resistant. Rory McIlroy had to throw several kitchen sinks plus assorted shaker-style cupboards at him to win the Tour Championship last week. Now on 15, Cabrera Bello has hit his second pin high to ten feet. Moore is just off the back, but he rakes in a huge left-to-right 40-foot curler for birdie!

There\u2019s a left-to-right break, and he reads it perfectly! In it drops, albeit at quite the rattle! McIlroy, the four-time major winner with three Ryder Cups already under his belt, dumped his ball in the water - and the rookie wins the hole anyway!

Gentleman Zach. It\u2019s not exactly Birkdale \u201869, but that was generous under the circumstances. Europe remain one up in that match.

Meanwhile back on 7, Fowler rakes in a long birdie putt to ensure victory on a hole the Americans were bound to win anyway after Rory\u2019s dip in the drink. The last two holes in that match have been exchanged in rather farcical circumstances. So if these matches were to finish right now, it\u2019d be all square on the leaderboard.

Dustin Johnson strokes in a lovely 25-footer across 5, and Darren Clarke\u2019s wildcard picks Pieters and Westwood are in all sorts of bother, three down already. And up on 7, Rory, behind a tree on the right, rather recklessly tries to take on the branches with his lob wedge. The branches win, sending his ball pinging off to the right, and into the water.

Back on 5, Kaymer fails to hit a 20-footer that would have given Europe a two-hole lead. It just needed one more turn. That was a fairly easy straight putt; by the look on Kaymer\u2019s face, that\u2019s a half that feels like a loss. Better news for Europe in the second match, though: Mickelson\u2019s wild drive gets the States into all sorts of trouble from the get-go, and all McIlroy has to do is find the centre of the green with Europe\u2019s third, because his opponents have taken six and aren\u2019t even on the putting surface.</p> <p><em>3UP Spieth/Reed v Stenson/Rose (7)<br>Mickelson/Fowler v McIlroy/Sullivan 2UP (6)<br>Walker/Z Johnson v Garcia/Kaymer 1UP (5)<br>2UP D Johnson/Kuchar v Pieters/Westwood (4)</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ee6ea4e4b0ab006308685c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T14:09:03.261Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Apologies for the radio silence; you can\u2019t trust these computers.

Garcia hooked his tee shot miles to the left of the par-three, and Kaymer didn\u2019t chip particularly close. But Sergio drains a 30-footer to scramble an unlikely half. Westwood redeems himself slightly by knocking in a missable eight-footer on 3 to save a half.

Sullivan looks as though he\u2019s drained his to win the hole, but the ball skates off to the left with its last couple of turns. And he\u2019s hit that hard enough for Rory to be faced with a four-footer of his own coming back.

You\u2019d be down on your hands and knees, shaking quite a lot. \u201cWelcome to the first day, morning matches of the 41st Ryder Cup!\u201d Stenson and Rose are given generous receptions; the needle goes off the scale when Spieth and Reed are introduced. Justin Rose will hit the first shot into the morning mist. And he splits the fairway! Patrick Reed follows him, with added commentary from the crowd: \u201cBoom! USA! USA!\u201d And with that, they\u2019re sent off down the hole. This is happening, folks. Buckle in, this weekend\u2019s going to be some ride.

Of course you are, silly of me to ask.</strong> Here\u2019s Ben Hendy: \u201cFor me the Ryder Cup is the best sporting event there is, particularly going into the last day, but the whole thing in general. It\u2019s infrequent enough, both in itself and in the format (what little team matchplay there is isn\u2019t generally constructed in such an entertaining manner) to make the event special when it comes around. It has allowed players who otherwise barely get a moment in the sun to become heroes (particularly on the European side). There have been moments of intense catharsis the likes of which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve witnessed anywhere else in sport - I\u2019m thinking of Darren Clarke and Jose Maria Olazabal in particular. And there has been a consistent recent bias towards the team I support winning (though I suppose the Americans need to win it once in a while to make the victory mean something). It really is an event like no other and I for one cannot wait for it to get started.\u201d We\u2019ll be off in a minute.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ee58afe4b0b4439e747648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T12:25:19.268Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Davis Love III speaks! </strong>\u201cWe\u2019re confident.

They\u2019re up against rookie Andy Sullivan and Rory McIlroy, the latter simply outstanding last Sunday evening at the Tour Championship. Some of his approach play was beyond brilliant, and ballsy too; if he could putt like Jordan Spieth circa 2015, he\u2019d be unbeatable. The form book suggests advantage Team Rory, with the man himself high on life and his $10m FedEx booty. But Phil and Rickie in front of their own fans? Gulp.

Wonderful. And then throw in a two-time major-winning 23-year-old, and the current Open champion. Hee! The sappy young pups Spieth and Reed started out at Gleneagles like a train, winning their morning match 5&amp;4.

An hour ago, Rickie Fowler quietly tumbled out of a car with heavy eyelids, a coffee in his hand, preparing to venture out into the pitch dark and an appointment with a bucket of balls on the range. Morning gently breaks. The grandstand at the 1st tee, by contrast, is already packed and bouncing with high energy. Spieth wanders out to the front of it, and waves his arms up and down to get everyone going a wee bit more. Was that possible? Yes, it was possible: the crowd turn it up to 11.

Partly because it was the last Ryder Cup on American soil; partly because Europe\u2019s improbable comeback represents the most wounding segment of the USA\u2019s current three-time losing streak; but mainly because this year\u2019s host, Davis Love III, was on the receiving end of history that day. Thing is, though, Captain Love really shouldn\u2019t beat himself up too hard. He did very little wrong: going into the singles 10-6 up attests to that. And there was simply no accounting for what happened next. Somebody up there had Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal\u2019s back, that\u2019s all. You know who. It still brings a flush to the cheeks, recollecting the moment an out-of-form Martin Kaymer simply refused to buckle and made that tickly six-footer, and Olly pulled his cap over his eyes to mop up the emotion.</p> <p><strong>There are going to be a few hot tears shed this weekend, too, one way or another.</strong> Seve and Jos\u00e9 were some Ryder Cup partnership: 11 wins and two halves in 15 matches! But how about Arnold Palmer and Gardner Dickinson? Five matches, five wins! Dear me! You\u2019re not beating that. The King passed last Sunday. Whoever wins this weekend, and whatever your philosophical take on the afterlife, it\u2019d be nice to think Arnie will be at Hazeltine, somewhere, somehow, reading the line of a few 30-footers, making sure one or two crucial putts topple into the hole for the USA. Perhaps he\u2019ll instigate a trademark birdie charge here or there, too, who knows. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\">Perhaps he\u2019s at it already.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55at8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2763404\"            data-video-name=\"Ryder Cup heckler makes putt to win $100 bet \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ee2278e4b0c38a12e7152b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733742&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-heckler-makes-putt-to-win-100-bet-video\">Ryder Cup heckler makes putt to win $100 bet</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Such a shame the great man will miss the next three days. </strong>They promise so much. Why? Because 2016 has unquestionably been one of the greatest years in golf history, that\u2019s why! Jordan Spieth\u2019s uncharacteristic collapse at the Masters, allowing Danny Willett to seize the day. Dustin Johnson shaking the major monkey off his back under unnecessary pressure from the suits at the US Open. Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson reprising, arguably besting, the Duel in the Sun at Troon. Jimmy Walker and Jason Day going mano-a-mano down the stretch at the PGA. Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson toe to toe in Rio. And only last weekend, Rory McIlroy flinging several kitchen sinks at the nuclear-resistant Ryan Moore before he was finally able to claim the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup. Phew <em>(x6)</em>! The Ryder Cup isn\u2019t going to let us down, is it? Not if what those lads have served up this year is any guide.</p> <p><strong>So here we go!</strong> It\u2019s on! And here\u2019s how the Titleist rolls ...</p> <p><strong>United States of America:</strong> Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Jimmy Walker, Brooks Koepka, Brandt Snedeker, Zach Johnson, JB Holmes, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Ryan Moore.<br> <em>Non-playing captain: Davis Love III</em></p> <p><strong>Europe: </strong>Rory McIlroy, Danny Willett, Henrik Stenson, Chris Wood, Sergio Garcia, Rafael Cabrera-Bello, Justin Rose, Andy Sullivan, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer, Thomas Pieters.<br> <em>Non-playing captain: <strike> Peter Willett </strike> Darren Clarke</em></p> <p><strong>The format: </strong>The 41st Ryder Cup Matches, to use the official title, is a matchplay event. Each match is worth a point. There are 28 points available over the three days, so the first team to get to 14.5 points will win the Cup. Should the Matches be tied at 14 points apiece, Europe will retain the trophy as current holders.</p> <p><strong>Match-play explained for those dipping their toe into the murky world of golf for the first time: </strong>In common-or-garden championship golf, such as the Open or the Masters, tournaments are scored using the stroke-play system. Whoever takes the fewest shots over all four rounds in a championship wins. All shots count and are added up for a cumulative total. So if, say, in next year\u2019s Masters Rory McIlroy shoots 63-63-63-63 and Jordan Spieth shoots 87-87-87-87, Rory will have taken 252 strokes, and beaten a teary Jordan by 96 shots. You\u2019ll get good odds on this happening at Augusta National next April, if you enjoy the sound of metal on porcelain as you flush the contents of your purse down the lavvy.</p> <p><strong>Anyway, in match play, each player or team wins a hole, or a point, for every hole they better their opponents. </strong>So if Rory takes five shots at the 1st, but Jordan needs only three, Jordan goes 1up. If Jordan wins the next hole too, he\u2019s 2up. If the pair share the same number of shots on the 3rd, the hole is halved, and Jordan remains 2up. It doesn\u2019t matter if Rory took 13 shots on the 2nd, by the way; a bit like the unwritten rules of stag weekends, or visits to purse-porcelain interface venue Las Vegas, what happens on each hole stays on each hole. There is no knock-on effect.</p> <p><strong>So let\u2019s say the Texas Kid wins the first nine holes. </strong>With nine played, and nine remaining, Jordan is 9up. McIlroy can only tie at best; Jordan can\u2019t lose. This is known as dormie. (And more specifically, in this slightly ludicrous example, as dormie nine.) If Rory wins the next nine, the game will end all square, and each team will get half a point to their overall total. But if Jordan wins the 10th, he\u2019s 10up with eight holes to play. He has won 10&amp;8. If the 10th hole is halved, Jordan would be 9up with eight to play. He\u2019s won 9&amp;8. Similarly McIlroy can be said to have lost 9&amp;8. The USA would add a point to their overall total. I\u2019ve probably made this sound way more complicated than it needs to be, but there it is anyway.</p> <p><strong>There will be three types of match:</strong> foursomes (teams of two players use one ball, taking alternate shots); fourballs (teams of two players play a ball each and take the best score, known as the better ball); and singles (this is when it gets quite wild and everyone across two continents starts with the shallow breathing and chest clutching). And these matches are arranged in a schedule like this:</p> <p><strong>Today:</strong> four matches of morning foursomes; four matches of afternoon fourballs.<br> <strong>Tomorrow: </strong>four matches of morning foursomes; four matches of afternoon fourballs.<br> <strong>Sunday: </strong>12 singles matches.</p> <p><strong>Today\u2019s foursomes tee off at <em>(all times CT)</em>:</strong> 7.35am Spieth/Reed v Rose/Stenson, 7.50am Mickelson/Fowler v McIlroy/Sullivan, 8.05am Walker/Z Johnson v Garcia/Kaymer, and 8.20am D Johnson/Kuchar v Pieters/Westwood. The fourballs tee off at 12.30pm, 12.45pm, 1pm and 1.15pm; the captains will announce the pairings later. So in the British Summer Time, we get going at 1.35pm. This really is on!</p> <p><strong>Your MBM reporter apologies in advance for: </strong>outrageous pro-European bias; outrageous pro-Sergio bias; outrageous pro-American bias through the prism of a self-hating European; childish excitement; childish tantrums; childish tears.</p> <p><strong>And finally, your cast-iron, no-quibble, OFFICIAL GUARDIAN GUARANTEE!!! </strong>There\u2019ll be not a single mention here of Brexit.

Con esto, busca distraer la atenci\u00f3n de sus reales problemas y de su incapacidad para pretender ser el l\u00edder de este gran pa\u00eds.

All this in order to intimidate, humiliate me and throw me off balance again. The attacks that have emerged are slander and lies cheap generated with bad intentions, which have no foundation that have been spread by sensationalist media. This, of course, is not the first time that I face such a situation. Through their hate campaign, the Republican candidate insists discredit and demoralize a woman, which is definitely one of the most terrifying features. with this, seeking to distract attention from their real problems and its inability to pretend to be the leader of this great country. When I was a young girl, the now candidate, I was humiliated, insulted me, I disrespected publicly, as he usually did privately in the cruelest way. as this happened to me, it is clear over the years that their actions and behavior have been repeated with other women for decades. Therefore, I will keep standing, sharing my story, my absolute support Mrs. Clinton on behalf of women, my sisters, aunts, grandmothers, cousins, friends and female community. My Latin and in general, I want to thank all the support, love and respect, my career, my person as a human being and my family. I became a citizen of this great country because my daughter was born here and because I wanted to exercise my rights, including voting. I will continue standing firm in my lived experience as Miss Universe and you with me supporting me. I\u2019ve been so pleased with many kind words, for so much love. I\u2019m focusing on my busy career, in my work as mother and I will continue taking positive steps for the Latino community, I will continue as activist for women\u2019s rights and respect we deserve.

  "<p>Texas has announced its withdrawal from the federal refugee resettlement programme, effective from 31 January next year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/trump-syrian-refugees-terrorism-quality-life-bombing-attacks\">Trump says Syrian refugees aren't just a terrorist threat, they'd hurt quality of life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/trump-syrian-refugees-terrorism-quality-life-bombing-attacks\">rightwing concerns about national security</a>, the announcement sent a political message. In a statement released on Friday, the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, said he had authorised the withdrawal in order to \u201ccontinue to prioritise the safety of all Texans\u201d. </p> <p>The move will not, however, prevent refugees from coming to Texas. Not-for-profit groups have said they will continue to settle arrivals in the state without cooperation from the state government and there is no practical way of stopping people from crossing state borders once in the US.</p> <p>A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.rstx.org/\">Refugee Services of Texas</a> told the Guardian the organisation was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Abbott\u2019s decision, and said resettlement agencies would \u201cwork diligently\u201d to increase numbers of refugees accepted in the state.</p> <p>The Texas state government signalled its intention to withdraw from the federal programme on 21 September, sending to the <a href=\"http://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr\">Office of Refugee Resettlement</a> (ORR) a letter in which it demanded that the federal body approve its plan for increased screening.</p> <p>Refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war are at the heart of concern in Texas. Republicans including Senator Ted Cruz have sounded an alarmist note, arguing that the Obama administration\u2019s vetting process is inadequate and that prospective terrorists may be slipping across the border. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Donald Trump Jr, the son of the Republican presidential candidate, tweeted an image likening refugees to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">poisoned Skittles candies</a>.</p> <p>Last November, Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a Facebook post that compared Syrian refugees to rattlesnakes, with the text: \u201cCan you tell me which of these rattlers won\u2019t bite you? Sure some of them won\u2019t, but tell me which ones so we can bring them into the house.\u201d</p> <p>The federal government contends that applicants are carefully scrutinised during a lengthy screening process. In August, the national security adviser, Susan Rice, said in a statement the US would admit at least 85,000 refugees in the 2016 fiscal year and had met Obama\u2019s goal of 10,000 Syrian arrivals ahead of schedule. </p> <p>At a United Nations summit earlier this month, Obama announced that the US would increase its intake to 110,000 refugees for the new fiscal year, starting 1 October.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/gov-abbott-says-texas-is-leaving-refugee-resettlem/nshns/\">a statement on Friday</a>, Governor Abbott said: \u201cTexas has repeatedly requested that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence provide assurances that refugees resettled in Texas will not pose a security threat, and that the number of refugees resettled in Texas would not exceed the state\u2019s original allocation in fiscal year 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Both these requests, he said, \u201chave been denied by the federal government\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result,\u201d he added, \u201cTexas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement programme. As governor, I will continue to prioritise the safety of all Texans and urge the federal government to overhaul this severely broken system.\u201d</p> <p>Last December, weeks after the Paris terror attacks, Texas tried to block the imminent arrival of several Syrian refugees by filing a lawsuit against the federal government and the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based humanitarian organisation. </p> <p>The lawsuit was dismissed, but Texas has <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/09/01/texas-appealing-judges-dismissal-lawsuit-over-syri/\">continued its legal fight</a>.</p> <p>Refugee resettlement is overseen and funded by the federal government, but states typically work with humanitarian groups to provide services such as welfare and case management. In Texas, such organisations and the government will have to develop an alternative arrangement. Kansas and New Jersey withdrew from the programme earlier this year. </p> <p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Texas\u2019s decision.</p> <p>In 2015, according to the <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/refugees-and-asylees-united-states#Top%20Refugee-Receiving%20States\">Migration Policy Institute</a>, Texas resettled more refugees than any US state \u2013 7,479 people, comprising 11% of the total.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed in Governor Abbott\u2019s decision after nearly 40 years of a really strong programme to welcome refugees who are fleeing for their lives,\u201d said Chris Kelley, a spokesman for Refugee Services of Texas, a social services group. </p> <p>\u201cThe state has opted out of the programme at a time when Texas state government really should be stepping up. We want to assure all Texans, resettlement of refugees will continue through a nonprofit model that will be created.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than accept a reduction, Kelley said, \u201cresettlement agencies across the state will be working diligently\u201d to grow the numbers of refugee arrivals in line with federal targets.</p>",
  "<p>In a deposition released on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">his infamous statement</a> that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the United States was planned in advance.</p> <p>In testifying in June in an ongoing court case, prompted when restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of a lease in Trump\u2019s Washington hotel after the presidential candidate\u2019s remarks caused a national furor, Trump insisted his comments were not ad-libbed. However, he made clear that they weren\u2019t scripted and said that he did not anticipate any damage to his brand. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the comments, which came when Trump announced his candidacy on 16 June 2015, the real estate developer saw a number of former business partners pull out of commercial enterprises with him <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/macys-fires-donald-trump-mexico\">including Macy\u2019s</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/univision-donald-trump-miss-universe-mexican-immigrants\">Univision</a>. In addition to Zakarian, chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s also pulled out of a planned restaurant project in the same hotel.</p> <p>The multi-hour deposition was released by a court order on Friday after a number of organizations, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/danielwagner/trump-video-depositions?utm_term=.hgj07DgZE#.bwnApgKbm\">led by Buzzfeed</a>, sued to have the video unsealed. Trump insisted that his comments should not be controversial because \u201cI\u2019ve been making this statement for many years. This is not just new.\u201d He also insisted that he thought his candidacy would draw more Hispanic customers than otherwise, insisting: \u201cI think you will get more business. I think you\u2019ll get more business,\u201d although he acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s always possible\u201d that some might not patronize his hotel as a result.</p> <p>The Washington hotel project in the Old Post Office building has long loomed over the Trump campaign.

  "<p>Savour your morning juice and coffee this weekend, because the price of your favourite breakfast drinks may be on the way up.</p> <p>Unfavourable weather in Brazil \u2013 varying from droughts to heavy rainfall and frosts \u2013 has driven up the price of coffee, sugar and orange juice around the world by more than 20% in the past few months.</p> <p>The London traded November futures contract on robusta beans, the type mostly used to make instant coffee, has risen by a third since June to $2,027 (\u00a31,561) a tonne on the ICE exchange after the main growing areas of Espirito Santo and Bahia were hit by drought, leaving farmers with only half their potential crop. </p> <p>The recent rise in price was also driven by concerns about next year\u2019s crop. With reservoirs dry or nearly empty in the regions, farmers have been reliant on annual rains to provide the moisture needed to kickstart coffee plants\u2019 flowering season, and there has been precious little precipitation.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been rain but it\u2019s not enough to repair the damage,\u201d said Carlos Mera, a commodities analyst at Rabobank.</p> <p>Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest producer of high quality arabica coffee and the second largest grower of robusta beans. More than a quarter of coffee imported to the UK comes from Brazil. </p> <p>The country also produces 80% of the oranges traded on worldwide markets, more than half of which head to Europe, and exports nearly three times more sugar than any other country.</p> <p>The price of orange juice concentrate has risen 21% since June to more than $2 a lb on the New York futures market, a level described as \u201castronomically high\u201d by Andres Padilla, a senior commodities analyst at Rabobank based in Brazil. Padilla says prices have not been close to this level since 2006. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b72870252fcf15c1cd020365735aacd2992d08c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b72870252fcf15c1cd020365735aacd2992d08c7/22_2065_2460_1476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orange juice, with orange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The price of orange juice concentrate has risen 21% since June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although globally we are drinking 4% to 5% less orange juice every year, production fell by a fifth in Brazil in the latest harvest year which finished in June, and by nearly a quarter in the world\u2019s second biggest producing region \u2013 Florida.</p> <p>Both areas were affected by the tree-killing Huanglongbing bug, better known as citrus greening. Brazil\u2019s harvest was already expected to be down year-on-year because of the bug, but as the crop was processed it emerged that heavy rains had left oranges with lower sugar content so that it takes more fruit to make each tonne of concentrate, the commodity exported around the world.</p> <p> \u201cAlthough demand is shrinking as the consumer is shifting to other products, there is more competition for orange juice as supply is shrinking faster than demand,\u201d said Padilla.</p> <p>Padilla added that prices were likely to stay high as several years of poor harvests meant that stocks of frozen juice built up in better years, before 2012, were now dwindling. Farmers in Brazil have also been tearing up trees and replacing them with more profitable crops such as sugar cane.</p> <p>Meanwhile, sugar is up 22% since June to about 23.5c per lb as weather problems in Brazil have combined with concerns about production in India to push up prices.</p> <p>Some sugar cane was harvested prematurely in early September after frosts in Brazil, and the harvest was also affected by extreme heat and dry weather earlier in the year. In some regions, yields were as much as 12% below expectations, according to Rabobank.</p> <p> Jara Zicha, a commodities analyst at Mintec, said sugar prices had risen amid \u201cexpectations that the global market will be in a supply deficit for the second consecutive year in 2016-17 and stocks will fall to six-year lows.\u201d </p> <p>As he reported Sainsbury\u2019s quarterly sales figures this week, the supermarket\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe reflected industry fears about price rises, pointing to a potential rise in coffee prices while other foodstuffs may fall.</p> <p>One supermarket source said it was not clear that commodity prices would feed through directly to supermarket shelves as retailers were facing tough pricing pressures from rival chains. All the major supermarkets are trying to fight back against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl by reducing prices on basics such as fruit, veg, tea and coffee, and so may be forced to absorb higher commodity costs.</p>",

How can you say you\u2019ve got a national economic strategy if your aviation strategy seems to be over-emphasised on the south-east?\u201d</p> <p>In the fierce PR battle over the third runway, Heathrow has said that <a href=\"https://your.heathrow.com/takingbritainfurther/jobs-and-growth/uk-benefits-by-region/\">expanding its airport would deliver \u00a312.5bn of growth</a> to the north-west compared to Gatwick\u2019s \u00a38.6bn by 2050. But Manchester airport bosses say it will deliver more than \u00a370bn for the region over the same period, nearly six times the figure put forward by Heathrow.</p> <p>Pointing out that the \u00a316.8bn Heathrow scheme could take up to 20 years before it is built, O\u2019Toole said there was \u201ca gap in terms of an aviation policy that\u2019s going to make best use of what\u2019s in the UK for those 15 to 20 years while we\u2019re waiting for something to come along\u201d.<br></p> <p>Manchester airport is the third-biggest in the UK and the only hub, other than Heathrow, with two runways. Twenty five million passengers travel through Manchester airport every year but it has the capacity to carry 55 million, meaning it could overtake Gatwick to become the UK\u2019s second-biggest airport within 15 to 20 years. <br></p> <p>The airport was at the heart of former Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse agenda, in part because it funnels as much as 60% of the business travel into the north of England. In October last year it hosted the Chinese president Xi Jinping on his state visit to the UK, when he launched a new direct flight from Manchester to Beijing \u2013 the first outside London.</p> <p>O\u2019Toole said the vote to leave the European Union would slow the airport\u2019s growth because airlines and passengers \u201cdon\u2019t like uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAirlines are deciding where to put planes and routes 12 to 18 months in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the uncertainty goes on the more likely that the UK misses out.\u201d</p> <p>He urged Brexit minister David Davis to urgently clarify whether Britain will seek to remain part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/22/europeanunion.theairlineindustry\">historic EU open skies deal</a>, which lets airlines fly from anywhere in the US to anywhere in the EU. Withdrawing from the deal would potentially mean airlines such as easyJet or Jet2 having to negotiate individual deals for each country they fly to.</p> <p>O\u2019Toole, who is on the board of Manchester Airports Group, which owns London Stansted, east Midlands and Bournemouth airports, described the government\u2019s aviation policy to date as \u201csome progress, but a lot more to do\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cDo we have integrated road, rail and airports? No. Do we have a taxation regime that supports and encourages airlines to bring capacity into the UK? No.</p> <p>\u201cDo we have an immigration service that while protecting the border, which is critical, actually makes it easy and appealing for people to visit the UK? I contend we don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cIs it easy, cheap, quick and convenient to gain a visa to the UK? Again, it\u2019s improved. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t progress being made but there is a lot more that could be done.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the song nearly goes, I wanna be a paperback reader. Cheaper and more portable than its austere hardback cousin, the paperback is the true everyman\u2019s book.

This led to infighting which kept the party out of power for 13 years.</p> <p>After the Wilson/Callaghan governments of the 60s and 70s we got the infamous i infighting of the 80s. Corbyn's mentor helped build a myth that the party had betrayed socialism and was just the same as the Tories. This helped keep Labour out of power for 18 years.</p> <p>So now after the Blair/Brown governments we're getting the same thing. The left are trashing the parties record and focusing on the past.

How can you win? You put white thing women in an advert, you're not representative (true). You put a diverse range of women in an advert, you're pandering. True, there was something a bit tokenistic about the campaign, and they could have maybe done it a bit more subtly than having a bunch of &quot;diverse&quot; women in one advert saying &quot;see how diverse we are???&quot; <br />Then again, you have to start somewhere. If this signals a change in H&amp;M's advertising that includes more diversity in all of their media going forward, then I'm in. Let's just see if they carry it forward.<br />Oh and on the unrelated paragraph about portraying mixed race couples - I had no idea it produced such backlash. I am a product of a mixed marriage myself, so I am frankly just bemused at furious reactions over mixed marriages and relationships. They've been a fact of life for thousands of years and have been increasingly common and will only get more common as air travel and multi-culturalism increases. I'm not even offended, I just find it highly amusing that there are still people out there who honestly believe that &quot;mixing&quot; is wrong. Next fact of life to get offended over - the sky is blue.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018The problem is down to agencies insisting on hiring privately educated individuals with degrees\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women#comment-84218146\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11391682\" title=\"View FreddieValentine\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/11391682\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for FreddieValentine\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11391682\" title=\"View FreddieValentine\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">FreddieValentine</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84218146\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 1:50pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I work in advertising. I've worked at several agencies and can tell you from experience that the problem is not down to gender imbalance (though this is definitely the case at the very senior levels). Nor is it necessarily down to a lack of ethnic diversity (though this still has a long way to go). In my opinion, the problem is down to these agencies insisting that they generally hire privately educated individuals with degrees. This means that my colleagues are effectively homogenised in their views and experiences. How then, is it possible for them to create ads which resonate with society at large, when they only hire individuals who have been living in a lovely middle-class bubble their whole lives? A lot of the products we make ads for would never be bought by such people. Rather, it's those in the council estates that flock to buy them en masse. And the disconnect between what they want, and what a lot of my colleagues think they want, is marked.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018This is just the voice in the doorman\u2019s earpiece saying, \u2018It\u2019s a flat night, let the people in we wouldn\u2019t last night\u2019.\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women#comment-84234753\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16541740\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for ID665310\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16541740\" title=\"View ID665310\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">ID665310</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84234753\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">28 September 2016 6:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Okay, I've watched it.

She responds to the question \u2013 why are women more affected?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Women have always felt more comfortable coming forward and I don\u2019t think men self-harm as much. Instead, they tend to turn to other things to ease their distress, such as alcohol. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have gender specific services. We are seeing more women with post traumatic stress disorder from domestic violence, after childbirth and from sexual violence they experience in relationships. Those sort of conditions need a different approach to ones we have as standard at the moment.</p> <p>Similarly with men a different approach is also needed, and for them we need to make services and treatment accessible. We know that middle-aged men have the highest suicide rate, so what are we doing to get that group into treatment and support earlier. It\u2019s good that we have identified these new statistics as if we know about these problems then we can plan services better and think, why is this happening? </p> <p>Mental health problems are increasingly (there\u2019s lots of reasons for this). I worry, in particular, about the impact of the media and social media. People are seeing things like self-harm on social media dn it makes it more accessible and we need to be really alert and able to talk to our children. We need to have that conversation around those issues and make sure they are safe. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:41:29.230Z\">at 2.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee3b0de4b035c40686bf13\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joanna-ruck\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T13:29:14.557Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pictures of the week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Picture editor Joanna Ruck shares some of her images of the week.</em></p> <p>First, the images from Aleppo have been particularly hard to look at this week and very graphic and distressing.

But at the moment, I'd vote Tory because I'm not agreeing with labour on a lot of issues &amp; I feel harassed by the tory-bashing. I don't like voting because of a party leader but jeremy &amp; those around him don't appeal to me either. </p> <p>I think this will be one of their problems come election time if things don't change - they paint anything tory as evil (despite tories winning more votes than labour) &amp; they need tory votes to win anything. If they could just stop the tory-bashing &amp; actually get on with policy, they might get a better message across the divide. They need to start saying how they are similar, not how they are different (although this will alienate momentum et al.)</p> <p>What I really fear though is all those right-leaning labour voters, who tend to be socially right-wing, voting UKIP. UKIP are already on-course to win more votes despite the referendum &amp; any equivocation from the tories or labour (which has already happened to a greater extent) on leaving EU &amp; they'll push more &amp; more to UKIP. Lib dems are a non-starter as corbyn has sapped any hard-left votes that may have gone their way. That leaves UKIP as the 3rd largest party in the HoC (future HoL?!) &amp; they'll likely vote tory on many issues in the house. Overall, I think the future is grim-dark for labour unless they change tactics soon.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/10104875\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for fresher\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10104875\" title=\"View fresher\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">fresher</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/84361823\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 September 2016 1:41pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Labour can't beat the Tories, but the Tories could conspire to lose.

I'm in a supposed Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party of their conscience.<br />2.

As far as immigration is concerned, it really isn't rocket science. Saying Labour will build 60k new council homes a year is great but it is also arbitrary.

  "<p>It was the night of the Stanley Cup final, the climax of Canada\u2019s ice hockey league. Vancouver\u2019s team, the Canucks, were beaten 4-3 by the Boston Bruins \u2013 a particularly bruising defeat as it was a home game. Alex and I were watching the game at a friend\u2019s house downtown, a few blocks from the stadium. We\u2019d been together six months, after meeting through friends in a bar.</p> <p>In the past, when the Canucks had won games, I\u2019d seen people come out into the streets high-fiving each other. But that night, the atmosphere was tense; a couple of cars were set on fire before the game even finished.</p> <p>We left our friend\u2019s apartment and walked through the streets towards the station, to catch a train back to east Vancouver, where I was living. At first there wasn\u2019t a lot happening, but then people started smashing windows. The riot police showed up, and we got caught up in a crowd.</p> <p>Suddenly the line of police charged us. Everyone started running; we weren\u2019t quite quick enough and got knocked down. Two police came over and kicked us, trying to get us to move along. Alex was on the ground and I was trying to protect her. After a few seconds they moved on, and left us in the empty street. Alex was hysterical; I kissed her to calm her down.</p> <p>We were on the ground for a few minutes, and then people started coming over to see if we were all right. We only had a few scratches. We walked to the train station and found it had been closed because of the riot, so we had to keep walking to find the nearest station that was still open. The other people on the train were all in good spirits; it was strange.</p> <p>The next morning, I woke up to a text from a friend we\u2019d seen the night before: \u201cWas that you in that photo?\u201d I had no idea what she was talking about. I looked it up on Facebook, where she had tagged us. A newspaper had published pictures of the riot and there we were, among photos of burning cars.

It was the home of Assunta Maresca, known as Pupetta, who was a former beauty queen, convicted murderer, and Camorra boss described as a trailblazer and suffragette in the syndicate.</p> <p>Unlike the highly organised Sicilian mafia, the Camorra is an \u201carchipelago of gangs\u201d, Dickie said, with some branches being more sophisticated than others.</p> <p> \u201cIt is easy to say the Camorra did it and then jump to the conclusion that the Camorra is moving into the art market,\u201d Dickie said.</p> <p>He said the discovery and the alleged involvement of the Camorra reflected the opportunistic nature of the Neapolitan syndicate. Its members spend a lot of time in prison and are part of a vast underworld network in which illegal goods are sold and traded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to conclude that it\u2019s the Camorra boss who is putting this art on his mantelpiece. A lot of times these people don\u2019t have a lot of class [and] they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be impressed by having this,\u201d Dickie said.</p> <p></p> <p>Federico Varese, an expert in criminology from Oxford University, said it was unsurprising that the discovery exposed a link between Amsterdam and the Camorra, given the Dutch city\u2019s reputation as a major drug hub. Cross-border investigations dating back to the 1980s had found the presence of the Camorra in Amsterdam.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I know for sure is that a lot of <em>camorristi</em> are in Amsterdam, not because they want to be rooted there or deal in racketeering of shops or that kind of thing, but because they are there to buy drugs. Amsterdam is a hub for the buying and selling of illegal goods,\u201d Varese said.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, informed his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, about the police operation before the funeral in Jerusalem of the former Israeli leader Shimon Peres.

  "<p>Theresa May is facing pressure from European leaders to use her party conference speech this weekend to name the month she will trigger article 50, beginning the two-year countdown to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. </p> <p>Senior EU figures have been told in private the prime minister wants to trigger the formal start of the talks early in the new year, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/brexit-weekly-briefing-theresa-may-3-three-brexiteers-0\">so far she has refused to say so in public</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/brexit-weekly-briefing-theresa-may-3-three-brexiteers-0\">Brexit weekly briefing: Theresa May 3, Three Brexiteers 0</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure not to name a date is intense due to the government\u2019s acknowledgement that the UK negotiating position would have to be outlined in the formal letter issued to trigger article 50. As a result, by naming the date she plans to send a letter to Brussels, the prime minister would set herself on an irreversible course before the cabinet has agreed its negotiating objectives.</p> <p>May is speaking to the Conservative party conference on Sunday, as well as making the closing address on Wednesday, and could use the occasion to signal a timetable. Both Eurosceptics such as Iain Duncan Smith and pro-Europeans such as Nicky Morgan have urged her to provide clarity on the start of negotiations.</p> <p>The prime minister is also eager that Brexit does not dominate her first conference, or her administration, and yet the issue dwarfs all else in the political landscape.</p> <p>European leaders ranging from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, have drawn a blank in private discussions with her on the shape of her UK exit plans. Most are content with article 50 being triggered in early 2017 since this gives time for the UK to leave before the next round of elections to the European parliament in 2019.</p> <p>The key trade-off remains whether access to the single market will include free movement for European migrant workers, some form of judicial oversight from EU courts, and contributions \u2013 voluntary or otherwise \u2013 to Brussels\u2019 budget. </p> <p>Some European capitals committed to making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/uk-heading-for-hard-brexit-say-european-diplomats\">Britain\u2019s exit as \u201csoft\u201d as possible</a> have been warning that May\u2019s silence on the issue is leaving the ground vacant for hardline Brexiters such as Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, to dominate the British debate. </p> <p>In private, European leaders suggest compromises on a limited form of an emergency brake to curtail migration from the EU, pointing out that such measures exist inside the Schengen area, but little detail can be discussed until the formal negotiations start. </p> <p>But May has told European leaders the government does not want to trigger article 50 until she has an agreed cabinet strategy for the talks and an agreed objective. She is also trying to incorporate a \u201clessons learned\u201d exercise in Whitehall that has looked at why David Cameron failed to win more in his talks with the EU in February. Some advisers believe Cameron should have taken longer and \u201crushed his fences\u201d.</p> <p>However, EU leaders say they need a timetable for Brexit soon, partly to assuage the markets but also to allow the EU to work out its own future institutional structures, including tighter cooperation on defence. </p> <p>Diplomats now sense after a period of confusion that the Department for Exiting the European Union run by David Davis is clearly the dominant voice in Whitehall on Brexit. They have noticed desks are being set up in the department to liaise with specific EU countries, a role that would previously be the preserve of the Foreign Office. </p> <p>The aim is to track political thinking in the main capitals by staying in touch with key influencers such as Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s minister for European affairs and a member of the SPD, the junior partner in the ruling grand coalition. In a negotiation, intelligence on the thinking of EU countries will be critical, even if the European commission will try to lead the talks.</p> <p>Some diplomats are disturbed by the Foreign Office being sidelined as they want Boris Johnson\u2019s department to remain a strong voice in multilateral institutions. A weakening of the Foreign Office in the Brexit discussions would weaken the UK voice more widely on the international stage, it is argued.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/uk-heading-for-hard-brexit-say-european-diplomats\">UK heading for hard Brexit, say European diplomats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure to name the date is also coming from the European commission, now that it has set up a detailed team with which to negotiate with the UK. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/uk-heading-for-hard-brexit-say-european-diplomats\">Michel Barnier, appointed to be the EU commission\u2019s chief negotiator, formally starts on Saturday </a>and has Sabine Weyand, the commission\u2019s deputy director general for trade, to be his deputy. He has also selected Stephanie Riso, an economist in the European commission, to be his principal adviser and Georg Emil Riekeles to be adviser on inter-institutional issues. A Norwegian, Riekeles has worked with Barnier in the past in France when he was minister for foreign affairs. He will be able to advise on the so-called Norway option of being a member of the European economic area (EEA-EFTA).</p> <p>Significantly, they are all experts in the operation of the EU single market, likely to be the meat and bones of the UK-EU discussion.</p> <p>The European council, which represents the EU member states, has its own negotiators as has the European parliament, adding further confusion to the complex agreements to be considered. </p> <p>An argument for delay is that Europe itself is in political flux due to elections on the continent. All three main European political leaders \u2013 Renzi, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Merkel could be deposed, and replaced by leaders with different approaches to Brexit.</p> <p>But Renzi has called a referendum on constitutional reform for 4 December and at one point said he would resign if he lost, a move that risked turning the referendum into a plebiscite on his leadership and another gathering point for the anti-politics vote. More recently, as his popularity has faded, he has pulled back from that and his coalition partners have said they would not allow him to resign.</p> <p>In France, the presidential elections look like a fight between rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains candidates Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the mercurial former president. Sarkozy has suggested he would persuade the UK to stay in the EU in a second referendum offering a reformed EU. The candidate of the right is to be chosen in an all-France primary in November, so the UK will have clarity about the intentions of the likely governing party in May.</p>",
  "<h2>Dandelyan, Blackfriars</h2> <p>Dandelyan is one of <a href=\"http://www.worlds50bestbars.com/fifty-best-bars-list/dandelyan/?pid=ranking-2015-1-50\">the world\u2019s 50 best bars</a> and one of my personal favourites. With a menu that explores modern botany, this could easily be a pretentious place of moody mixologists. It is not \u2013 these are bartenders, skilled in the art of hospitality, as well as drinks creation. This place has thought about all aspects of the bar experience. The decor is plush but not to the point you look yourself up and down before entering. Being part of the boutique hotel Mondrian London means there is sense of charm and elegance rather than overbearing luxury. The cocktail classes flock to see the concoctions of famed drinksmiths Ryan Chetiyawardana and Iain Griffiths, but thanks to its location, inside one of London\u2019s coolest hotels, and on the South Bank, it attracts a wide range of customers. The modern-botany focus narrowed this January to \u201cthe effect botany has had on historical civilisations\u201d. If you\u2019re of a curious disposition, you\u2019ll be drawn to the cocktails with esoteric descriptions. The Pinnacle Point Fizz stands out: tequila, mixtamalised blue corn, sloe, ginger bitters, sour pineapple and soda. Too safe? How about Heirloom, with whisky, Kamm &amp; Sons, plant haemoglobin and exploded raspberry cordial. Up a notch? The 13<sup>th</sup> Century Boy has gin, palm and pine embalming cordial and mummified citrus.

This is the kind of place you can come to have a sensible chat with a colleague over a Black Cow vodka and tonic at the gold bar; for a sexy date with someone new or someone you love (most couples seem to end up snogging on the sofas); for an experimental whisky cocktail; or to get sloshed on a round of signature Hix Fixes with some pals. Come on a Thursday after 10pm for the regular Mark\u2019s Lates party and you\u2019ll end up dancing until 3am (and watching bartenders dancing on the bar).

There\u2019s just this kebab shop upstairs then, next to it, there is this well-presented guy on the door \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else to look at. To go for the first time, especially if you\u2019re taking someone who\u2019s never been, is special \u2013 but you really should book in advance. Walking down the stairs through a long thin corridor and into that bar for the first time is amazing. It\u2019s a dark space, with candles everywhere. It has this beautiful tin ceiling that reflects light beautifully. Waiters will greet you, and they know the menu inside out. The menu changes regularly and the drinks are bespoke, but you can\u2019t really go wrong: the waiters push you in the direction of how you\u2019re feeling. The Nightjar changed the game a bit, with that seated cocktail dining experience with live jazz and swing in the background. The atmosphere when the music is peaking is dark and sexy and I can\u2019t think of another bar that goes to so much effort in the presentation of every single drink in its list.

It\u2019s that moment that takes you from being a stranger in a strange place to a welcomed guest, waiting for a drink. Even when it\u2019s three deep at 69, there will always be someone who works there whose eyes go directly to the door when it opens. 69 is a tiny, tucked-away bar lifted out of a Fellini film. Inside, there\u2019s black wood, white-jacketed staff \u2013 and a relaxed elegance. If I pop in on the early side I\u2019m sure to run into a mix of artists and writers, some of the designer friends of Tony Conigliaro \u2013 its owner \u2013 as well as high-end bartenders from around the world who make pilgrimages to the bar to experience Tony\u2019s drinks. 69 has been influential on the cocktail bar scene. It was one of the earlier bars to take a chance on stepping up into higher-end cocktailswhen there was this change from people looking for the place that gave you the biggest drink to the place that gave you the best drink. I loved the Lipstick Cocktail and the Fig leaf Martini, where Tony distils fig leaf into the spirit. The Caper leaf Martini is also gorgeous.

Trailer Happiness attracts an excellent crowd and does the best rum cocktails in London. It\u2019s a great bar to visit with a group of friends or even when travelling solo. It\u2019s been an institution for many years and is known for its adoration for my favourite spirit: rum. That\u2019s not to say itdoesn\u2019t do a killer G&amp;T or vodka Martini, but the highlights and more innovative cocktails on the menu are usually rum-based. During Notting Hill Carnival, the team can be found cooking up jerk chicken and serving it alongside delicious rum punches. Trailer Carnival Lockdown is my favourite party, and where I can be found with a punch cocktail in hand. My favourite night at Trailer had to be after Imbibe Live 2013 (an annual drinks trade show). I had just found out that I had been offered the job at OXO Bar and Restaurantand I remember it was an extremely hot day. Many faces from the bar trade were at Trailer after the Imbibe show and we had an amazing night. The atmosphere, the drinks and the people absolutely made the evening. I felt like I was on a Caribbean Island with all of my best mates \u2013 and it\u2019s where I met my boyfriend.

As soon as you go in, you find yourself buying into the whole thing and that\u2019s what great bars do. It\u2019s themed around blitz-chic and is designed with a high level of authenticity: down to the staff talking in received pronunciation. It\u2019s all been thought through so wonderfully; the way the staff dress, talk, the theatre of the entrance \u2013 as if being ushered into a bomb shelter. Part of the bar is in what used to be the Kingly Court tube station, so I think that\u2019s where it got some of its theme from. The drink menus come on a kind-of 1940s-style newspaper, but it has serious people in charge of its bar programme; there\u2019s been an effort to hire people who see making drinks as an artform. Products are chosen carefully, there a lot of homemade ingredients and the owners spend time and effort on the presentation and garnishing. But really it\u2019s just a lot of fun.

  "<p>Around 12,000 years ago Britain was still connected to the mainland of Europe. Glaciers covered much of the north while the south was an arid wind-blasted tundra with grasses, mosses and low shrubs. Around 9700 BC, it became a little warmer, and that\u2019s where Nicholas Crane\u2019s story begins. As he argues in this ambitious, magnificent book, Britain\u2019s destiny was shaped to a surprising degree by the sun and by southerners. It\u2019s a tale of stops and starts \u2013 devastating at times, uplifting at others.</p> <p>As temperatures rose, the ice melted, greenhouse gases surged and Britain became greener. Crane, an explorer and geographer, writes evocatively about this changing landscape. \u201cRelieved of its burden, the Earth\u2019s crust sprang slowly upward in the far north,\u201d while the coastline of the south was reconfigured by rising sea levels. River courses altered, trees grew taller and animals such as deer and boars arrived.</p> <p>With them came the woodland people who, unlike the early hunters, lived in large groups and stayed for a while in one place. They brought tools and made flames with wooden fire drills. Britain\u2019s geology provided them with a vast array of stones, which in turn produced a new sound: \u201ca rhythmic knocking accompanied by high-pitched tinkling\u201d \u2013 the sound of the woodland people fashioning them into tools and objects. Meanwhile Doggerland, the area that connected Britain to the continent, was facing the onslaught of rising seas; its inhabitants marched west to escape. Britain has always been a land of migrants.</p> <p>The first \u201clittle ice age\u201d hit around 6700BC. About 500 years later, a huge North American lake broke through its dam and dumped such a huge amount of fresh water into the Atlantic that the Gulf Stream shut down. Temperatures plummeted, trees died, sea water pushed into rivers and Britain\u2019s landscape changed again. Only 200 years later \u2013 a geological blink \u2013 a tsunami crashed over Doggerland. Britain became an island and isolated. Two thousand years later it was nearly inhabited, and then the climate changed again. The next wave of immigrants arrived \u2013 the \u201chouse people\u201d, who crossed the channel in their boats and built the first rectangular houses.</p> <p>They bred animals, grew grains, cleared forests and sculpted the land, leaving traces of human activity on the landscape. Crane describes growing populations, Stonehenge and new materials \u2013 copper, iron, bronze. \u201cTechnology ages landscapes,\u201d he writes, as ore was hacked out of the land and enormous numbers of trees were used for smelting. By 1000 BC, more of the south of Britain was patterned by rectangular fields \u2013 in Dartmeet, for example, a grid covered 3,000 hectares. Then another little ice age hit. Then it got warmer again. And so it goes, up and down. Forts were built, and later lowland settlements, goods arrived by ship, and raw materials left the island.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the Roman emperor Claudius invaded Britain in AD 43, he came with an army of psychopathic builders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the Roman emperor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_conquest_of_Britain\">Claudius invaded Britain in AD43</a>, he came, Crane says, with \u201can army of psychopathic builders\u201d and the British landscape was soon altered beyond recognition. Camps and towns were built along gridded streets. Trees were felled, turf was cut, ditches dug and streams diverted to lace the island with roads. Within four generations, Britain had 24 major cities, palaces, amphitheatres, mosaic flooring and hot baths. It was warm and the soil produced food. And then the climate changed once more.</p> <p>Crane is excellent at describing climate, geology and shifting shorelines, but is at his best when plaiting together earth-shaping events with humankind and civilisation. The end of the Romans in Britain, for example, was linked to a 40-year drought in inner Asia, which started in 338 and pushed the nomadic Huns westwards, who in turn drove the Goths into the Roman empire. With their hands full on the continent, the Romans had problems defending Britain and trade routes were affected. Britain was attacked, looted and robbed. Taxes were raised, which meant people couldn\u2019t afford goods any more, and production slowed: \u201clife leeched from British towns\u201d. By 407, the Romans had left and an air of disrepair veiled the south.</p> <p>Crane takes his readers from the farmed countryside and the urban boom of the Norman conquest to the freeze in the early 1300s, which was rapidly followed by rains and famines \u2013 and then the first wave of the Black Death in 1348 (after which came several more). As the population fell from 6 million in 1300 to 2.4 million in the 1440s, the landscape changed again: villages were abandoned and fields left unploughed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Railway fever moved more earth than any previous construction scheme: hills were cut, tunnels dug, embankments built</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On behalf of Henry VIII, the marvellous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leland_(antiquary)\">John Leland</a> surveyed the treasures in monastic libraries but did much more. As he zigzagged the island, he read the \u201clandscapes as stories\u201d, stumbling over Roman ruins and ancient earthworks. We also meet the Dutch engineer who drained British wetlands, and Daniel Defoe complaining about the terrible state of roads and the weather: \u201cHannibal himself,\u201d he said, \u201cwould have found it impossible to have marched his army.\u201d Bridges, docks, canals, enclosures, fertilisers and steam all take the stage in later chapters. Railway fever, Crane writes, moved more earth than any previous construction scheme: hills were cut, tunnels dug, embankments and bridges built \u2013 all to overcome the \u201cunhelpful undulations\u201d of Britain\u2019s landscape.</p> <p>This book is in part about urbanisation, from the first communal settlements to industrial cities of the 19th century. In the last decade of the 16th century, a young Scottish cartographer marked on his map the most north-westerly part of mainland Britain an area of \u201cExtreem Wilderness\u201d: it was the last wilderness left on an increasingly populated island. Crane writes: \u201cto care about a place, you must know its story\u201d.

My children were terrified and started to cry and shout. There was some damage to the doors and windows of our apartment from the blast, but I managed to calm them down then I made some coffee to drink with my husband and calm myself down.</p> <p>The boys were hungry, but we had no bread, just some pasta and an onion, which I cooked up for them. They begged me, \u201cPlease mum, stay with us, don\u2019t go out in case the plane comes again.\u201d</p> <p>There is a hospital near our home and when they heard the ambulances arriving they started crying again, and asking if there were children or old people or women injured. They can see the casualties from our window.</p> <p>I was working as a teacher in intermediate school before the war. We were a normal family, we would go around the city, to parks, to restaurants to relax. But I was arrested after the revolution, and my family had to pay a lot of money to get me out of jail and so I haven\u2019t gone back to the regime side for five years.</p> <p>I run a school, so before this siege I would go there every day with my sons, who are 10 and 12, they would study and play with the other students, then we would come home, make dinner, watch TV together.</p> <p>But the bombing is intense now, targeting everything: schools, hospitals, mosques. Two of the teachers, my friends, were killed and another injured in his leg and hands when they were walking to school.</p> <p>So for now the school is shut, a few teachers go there to prepare things, in case the atmosphere improves and we can open again.</p> <p>In the morning when the planes come we all go to the shelters, we spend most of our time there and it is so boring, there is nothing to do, no electricity, no fuel for the generator.</p> <p>There are so many difficulties. I can\u2019t tell you what its like when my son says \u201cI am hungry\u201d and I don\u2019t know what I can prepare for him. Last week was his birthday and he cried all night because we couldn\u2019t make him a cake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9050c4370f2f407809a0106557ae8d3e4b2c17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9050c4370f2f407809a0106557ae8d3e4b2c17/0_358_675_405/500.jpg\" alt=\"Afraa\u2019s son\u2019s birthday party\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afraa\u2019s son\u2019s birthday party, without cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afraa Hashem</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children remember their friends who have left or died, their relatives who are abroad, they make models of them from paper and talk to them as if they are still here. I listen to my boys telling them stories about their lives.</p> <p>Sometimes they come to school with me, see it is empty and say: \u201cWhen will classes start?\u201d I\u2019m thinking if the atmosphere gets better, we will take them out to paint murals on some of the cars and buses damaged by the bombing.</p> <p>Even though we are suffering a lot, and alone, we are happy, because we are fighting to get our freedom. I hope even if I die, my children will grow up in a free and safe country. I want you to ask the world, don\u2019t send food to us, but prevent the regime from killing us.</p> <p>Most of my family are in Turkey, but one brother is here and I work with him. We set up the school together, and I work with psychological support for the children, and for the women who need support, who lost their husband, or sons by the war.</p> <p>Our school is in an underground shelter now, but I can still see when the children arrive with their school bags, there is happiness in their eyes, they are excited to study.</p> <h2><strong>The taxi driver: Abo Awad</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a7945d124d49e479eb22f93915ae6ec59ae819a/0_356_581_349/500.jpg\" alt=\"Abo Awad a taxi driver in eastern Aleppo\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abo Awad: \u2018All the news I hear is that someone else has been killed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We don\u2019t sleep well as the jets are always overhead, they wake me up early although I try to ignore the sound.</p> <p>If we have water, I perform an ablution before my morning prayer, and if not I go to the nearby mosque with a bowl to get some water. There are usually a handful of people there doing the same.</p> <p>There is no electricity, so it\u2019s dark inside the apartment, but my wife is usually up when I get back and we take the chance to talk before the children are awake.</p> <p>One of the best sounds of the morning is my neighbour turning on his generator, although its just for two hours to save fuel. We all meet to charge batteries and phones, and talk about events in Aleppo and the bombings overnight with a cup of tea.</p> <p>When I come home, my children are getting up. The first thing one of them said to me yesterday was: \u201cThank God we are still alive.\u201d</p> <p>I go out for bread, and just get one bag with eight pieces, which is only enough for a single meal. We are a large family: me, my wife and 11 children. It\u2019s a poor and unhealthy breakfast, bread with maybe some tomato paste, olives and tea, but we finish it all.</p> <p>I have diabetes and kidney problems, and my wife has rheumatism and back problems, but we cannot get the medicines we need, not even painkillers. The supplies I collected when the siege was broken last month have run out.</p> <p>We are from a village near al-Bab which is under Isis control now. I used to be an accountant for the Syrian army, but I left the job in 2011 and went to work as a taxi driver in Aleppo. We have no income now. My taxi was smashed in an airstrike and there is no fuel here these days anyway.</p> <p>If it\u2019s a quiet morning, I go out to walk, but Aleppo is a deserted city now. There are no people or cars on the streets, all I see is the wreckage and debris and all the news I hear is that someone else has been killed, or there is a massacre in the next neighbourhood.</p> <p>When jets are overhead we go down to basement in our building, where children and women begin to scream and cry and men are also afraid, especially after the use of bunker-buster bombs. We feel we are waiting for death.</p> <p>Every day, we receive text message from the Syrian army saying things like: \u201cThe ceasefire deal didn\u2019t last, Americans and Turks didn\u2019t abide by terms of the agreement\u201d and \u201cIf you want the reconciliation and peace then you must raise the flag of the Syrian Arab Republic.\u201d</p> <p>We skip lunch to save food, and in the evening use old furniture and other wood for cooking rice or bulgar wheat. There is no power or internet connection, it is strangely quiet under the LED bulbs of our battery torches.<br></p> <p>It feels like we are in a prison, a really big but claustrophobic prison. And we stay in this mood until we go to bed around 10 or 11 and try to sleep. It\u2019s an unbearable situation.</p> <h2><strong>The aid worker: Zein al-Sham</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee4fb4b4b0589aecb02493d1385224c1cb0be8fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee4fb4b4b0589aecb02493d1385224c1cb0be8fe/68_263_814_1017/800.jpg\" alt=\"Zein al-Sham.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zein al-Sham: \u2018I try to comfort them, although inside I am also afraid.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wake up early. Normally my first priority in the morning would be to have a cup of coffee but unfortunately, there is no coffee left in my neighbourhood because of the siege.</p> <p>I have a hectic schedule because I volunteer in two hospitals, work part time for an American aid organisation, and teach history and geography at the Pioneers of Aleppo underground school.</p> <p>It\u2019s in a basement to protect the children, but they are still scared, especially now. One of my students asked me the other day: \u201cWhy is our school underground? I don\u2019t want to suffocate under rubble if we are hit.\u201d</p> <p>I try to comfort them, although inside I am also afraid. Some kids don\u2019t come to school any more because their mothers keep them at home, they want to stay close to their loved ones now.</p> <p>I am 26 years old and originally from Aleppo. I got involved in anti-regime activism in 2012 when I was doing my undergraduate degree in education at the university here.</p> <p>First peaceful protests, then I started volunteering in a field hospital in eastern neighbourhoods, moving between there and the government-held areas so I could carry on with my education, until I was arrested in 2013 because of that work.</p> <p>I was tortured and had a lot of psychological problems when they finally released me more than a year later. Everything had changed and my parents had left Aleppo, but I went to stay with my brother and my old friends encouraged me to start work again.</p> <p>Now I teach in the mornings, and then two days a week I go to the charity offices, where I am a team leader overseeing distribution of aid to vulnerable people in three districts.</p> <p>The other days I volunteer at hospitals, particularly during critical times like now. I\u2019ve witnessed four amputations in four days, and we don\u2019t even have any specialists.</p> <p>I just have one meal a day now, either at the hospital or at home where I cook for myself. I am lucky to still have gas because I bought a cylinder for $150 a few days ago. It\u2019s expensive, but I can make it last a long time.</p> <p>We are also short of some things that only women use. Supplies have been cut because of the siege and the men don\u2019t think of that.</p> <p>In the evening, I take advantage of the generator, which is only on for two hours, to charge my phone and my computer, and the battery for the internet router. I prepare for classes the next day, and do reports for the aid group. Then I browse the internet, chat with my brother and sister in Turkey or my friends, and go to sleep around 2am.</p> <p>I visited the USA and UK last year for a workshop and to attend a film about me and four other women working here. I did think about staying on to finish my education, but I decided to come back because my country needs me now.</p> <p>I am ambitious and conscientious, and I will complete my studies one day regardless of my age or if I have got married.

One was bombed on Wednesday, so now I have to try to make bread for the same number of families from just one.</p> <p>Normally I would get up early for the pre-dawn prayer, then have coffee with biscuits if we have any, before going to inspect the bakeries and help deliver loaves.</p> <p>But on Wednesday I was woken around 3am by someone banging on our door. I ran to open it and outside was a colleague, breathless, gasping: \u201cThe bakery has been hit.\u201d I threw on my clothes and jumped in the car.</p> <p>We got to the site of the attack around an hour after the bomb hit. It was a terrible scene, with the White Helmets and paramedics trying to find survivors among the rubble. They had hit the middle of the bakery on purpose, we are sure, and eight people, including one of the owners, were killed.</p> <p>Only his business partner and the head baker survived, and one of them has lost an eye. There was a terrible mess, and the van they use for bread deliveries was smashed as well, so I had to use my own car for getting out what bread we could save.</p> <p>The bakery served two large neighbourhoods, feeding nearly 6,000 families. Now I am going to have to see if the smaller bakery, already feeding 4,000 families, can stretch to making bread for more than twice that number.</p> <p>On a normal afternoon I dedicate myself to local council business. We try to do what we can for people, try to fix damaged electricity or water networks, distribute aid to vulnerable people and other things. We do our best these days even with the siege and continuous bombing and shelling.</p> <p>Then I get home some time between five and seven for dinner with my wife and children. They wait for me to eat. At the moment we are surviving on lentils, bulgur wheat, rice, and a little aubergine, from small fields nearby where you can only find aubergine, mint and parsley.</p> <p>We use a paraffin stove and sometimes wood for cooking. Gas costs a fortune, if you can even find a cylinder for sale these days. We aren\u2019t really heating up anything already cooked to save fuel, because we don\u2019t know when the siege will be broken.</p> <p>I like to spend a few hours talking with my family in the evening, although we don\u2019t have so much power these days for lights. My children are a little bored right now, as they have to stay at home all day. There are no schools open, because of the bombing.</p> <p>When they have gone to bed, I sometimes make deliveries of fuel and flour to the bakeries before coming home to sleep. Sometimes another person does this so I can rest. We are very short of key supplies.</p> <h2><strong>The White Helmet rescue worker: Ismail al-Abdullah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e95b7632f5ad46a496d36fafc5f8e1db910a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e95b7632f5ad46a496d36fafc5f8e1db910a7e/0_68_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ismail al-Abdullah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah: \u2018These bombs are meant to be used against military bases, so why are they dropping them here?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are divided in two teams at each centre. Most of us work 24-hour shifts, then go home and rest. But I don\u2019t have a family in Aleppo any more so I just stay at the headquarters, sleeping and eating there.</p> <p>Yesterday was a busy night. We were called out after a bombing at around 4am, by staff at one of the hospitals. We heard a big explosion, then one of the doctors radioed us to help get the injured people to another hospital, because we can\u2019t treat them all.</p> <p>The casualties were all just lying on the floor, because there was no room for anyone on the beds and they didn\u2019t have enough staff to treat them all.</p> <p>So we raced out to help. I was out for over an hour, came back and went back to bed, then another bombing woke me up around 9am. They were calling for us from a site near the old city, where they said there was a family stuck under the rubble.</p> <p>It turned out that this wasn\u2019t a rescue mission though; they were all dead before we arrived. We brought out the bodies of three children and their father and mother.</p> <p>These bunker busters are unbelievable. I recently learned that these bombs are meant to be used against military bases, so why are they dropping them here? Maybe because they are not satisfied with the numbers of their victims from other bombs. When I hear a war plane overhead it makes my blood run cold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f09cf5232ed791934b393b4bf8a3c699f48c519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f09cf5232ed791934b393b4bf8a3c699f48c519/165_532_4331_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah rescuing a child from the rubble.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah rescues a child: \u2018We are fed up of everything \u2013 bombing, killing, pulling people from under the rubble.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sceengrab/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We took the family to the morgue. Workers there take photos of all the victims, and if no one collects the body, then they bury them too. But neighbours and relatives came for these people, and so we drove back to headquarters.</p> <p>We still have some fuel and the cars are working as usual, but in the coming days we will run out. Food supplies are low as well \u2013 we are just living off lentils, beans and bulgar wheat, and soon we will have to start looking for wood to cook them because gas supplies are nearly out.</p> <p>All day, between rescue missions, I\u2019ve also been worrying about my family. My parents and brothers and sisters left Aleppo because of the bombing and are staying in the countryside near the Turkish border, but I lost contact with them on Tuesday.</p> <p>My mother is very sick and doesn\u2019t really have good medical care where she is living, or the medicines she needs. I\u2019m really waiting for my brother to call and tell me they are OK.</p> <p>We had dinner, we talked about what happened, and then we slept. Usually at night I stay up and play cards before bed, but we are really tired, exhausted. We are fed up of everything \u2013 bombing, killing, pulling people from under the rubble.</p> <h2><strong>The orphanage manager: Asmar Halabi</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e564110fca49f3c885cf77f454df1b7b5985dd86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e564110fca49f3c885cf77f454df1b7b5985dd86/26_126_1212_727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asmar, an orphanage director.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asmar Halabi: \u2018We are afraid of bombing day and night.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hussein Akoush/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have four more children in the orphanage now, because an airstrike killed one of our staff members and her husband this week. She was called Alia Nasser, she was 32 and worked as a maid.</p> <p>Everything is getting worse, with the aerial attacks and shortages from the siege. One bomb hit only 50 metres away, the dust filled the air so you couldn\u2019t see anything. It\u2019s the worst ever attack, completely unprecedented. I saw one crater that was five metres deep.</p> <p>We are afraid of bombing day and night. When the planes come, I tell the babysitters and supervisors to take the children down to the bunker, but they can still hear the bombs landing. Some of them have got used to these sounds, but many cry, and a few of them are so frightened they wet themselves.</p> <p>We are just eating the same type of food at every meal \u2013 lentil soup and a kind of cracked bulgar wheat \u2013 and our stocks are running out.</p> <p>My biggest fear is that the siege will continue for a long time, because we have to feed 50 children and over 20 staff, and I always keep worrying about what tomorrow will bring, thinking about the shortages. I always inspect everything myself, to make sure nothing is missing.</p> <p>Because of the incessant aerial bombardment, artillery shelling and mortar shelling, I just stay inside at the orphanage or at home. I only really go out when I need to get something for myself, or when I need to pick up an orphan at the court or hand them over to a guardian.</p> <p>I often don\u2019t leave the orphanage until around 10pm. Before the siege, when there was a real market, I used to go shopping with my wife, but these days I just have dinner then sit and talk under LED lights for a bit.</p> <p>I get up again around nine or 10, drink a cup of coffee and then go back to the orphanage again, to discuss the daily situation with staff, maybe talk through some sensitive issues with the teenagers or play with the smaller children.</p> <p>Actually, because of the siege and the bombing, the orphanage takes up all my time. I feel guilty about my wife but she appreciates that I am working for vulnerable children, and supports that my job is my priority.</p> <p>Sometimes she comes with me to the orphanage, to help me and play with the children. We don\u2019t want them to get bored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/aleppo_control-zip/giv-1406V37baXN4d5y3/\" data-alt=\"Aleppo city and governorate: the current areas of control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/aleppo_control-zip/giv-1406V37baXN4d5y3/\">Aleppo city and governorate: the current areas of control</a> </figure>  <ul> <li>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

We need to recognise that the diplomacy has never faced up to the need for an initial partition or zones of influence involving neighbouring states on the path to an eventual unified settlement in Syria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/west-aleppo-syrians-bombardment-assad\">The west has to look beyond Aleppo\u2019s agony | Adrian Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Between 2012 and 2014, Turkey was ready to create a protected area in Syria for refugees, but for various reasons this was never supported by Nato. Turkey was understandably very reluctant to move militarily across the border into Syria on its own. When Russia extended an airfield close to Latakia, not far from the naval port <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_naval_facility_in_Tartus\" title=\"\">it has had in Syria</a> since 1971, and put sophisticated aeroplanes in to protect Assad\u2019s forces, everything changed. Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria\" title=\"\">shot down a Russian plane</a> and felt threatened by Kurdish forces pushing along its border with Syria. Turkish relations also became very strained within Nato, particularly with the US over strategies for dealing with Islamic State and the EU over refugee policies and human rights. Turkey responded perfectly reasonably by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/27/kremlin-says-erdogan-apologises-russian-jet-turkish\" title=\"\">defusing tensions with Russia</a>.</p> <p>In this period the Russians militarily achieved their objective, reinforced by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon and Iranian forces, of winning back control of the key roads linking Damascus to the Mediterranean Sea for Assad. These forces, as a consequence, are back in control of this area, including Hama, which has become a Russian zone of influence.</p> <p>Only Turkey is in a political and military position to intervene on the ground over Aleppo and it is demonstrating this at present by attacking Isis. Turkey can now, because of changed circumstances, create a crucial balancing factor in Syria by taking urgent humanitarian action with its troops and air power in relieving the siege of Aleppo. Under the UN charter, even if the security council is blocked by a Russian veto, Turkey has a regional locus and a measure of legitimacy, having taken large numbers of Syrian refugees.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/27/drone-footage-shows-scale-of-destruction-in-eastern-aleppo-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/55xv4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2756353\"            data-video-name=\"Drone footage shows scale of destruction in eastern Aleppo \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57eaaa50e4b091b7fa2b5b19\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160927AleppoDrone2_KP-29409722_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/27/drone-footage-shows-scale-of-destruction-in-eastern-aleppo-video\">Drone footage shows scale of destruction in eastern Aleppo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is potentially the necessary support within Nato for such an intervention by Turkey. Already special forces from a number of countries, particularly the US and UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/pictures-appear-to-show-british-special-forces-on-syrian-front-line\" title=\"\">are operating in Syria</a> on the ground and they have the skills in helping to target artillery, missiles and in the last analysis aircraft. Intelligence is already fully shared with Turkey but a greater effort would have to be put in by other Nato countries. Naturally there are some in Turkey who would prefer to have Nato ground troops, but there are others who wisely see the dangers of this. It would be far preferable for Turkey to act as a regional power supported by Nato, and by keeping ground troops out it avoids the whole initiative being seen as an American-Russian confrontation.</p> <p>What provides a new basis for Turkish intervention is that on 23 September Bekir Bozda\u011f, Turkey\u2019s justice minister, announced in Istanbul that the US vice-president, Joe Biden, had accepted that there is <a href=\"http://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2016/09/24/us-vp-admits-concrete-evidence-on-gulen-involvement-submitted-by-turkey\" title=\"\">\u201cconcrete evidence\u201d</a> that Fethullah G\u00fclen, a Turkish exile living in the US, was behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\" title=\"\">July\u2019s failed coup</a>. Assuming there is substantive evidence in relation to G\u00fclen, the political path is therefore open for early and decisive action over Syria.</p> <p>G\u00fclen left Turkey for Pennsylvania in 1999. The G\u00fclen movement, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BClen_movement\" title=\"\">Cemaat</a>, which he inspires, is an Islamic community in Turkey and overseas. It operates both openly and underground in Turkey and while once the movement favoured President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan it is now deeply opposed to him. Erdo\u011fan has alleged that G\u00fclen was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/17/fethullah-gulen-alleged-coup-mastermind-and-friendly-neighbour\" title=\"\">mastermind behind the coup</a> and Turkey asked for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/28/turkey-fethullah-gulen-extradition-coup-attempt\" title=\"\">extradition</a> from the US. It now looks almost certain that the US justice system will return him for trial in Turkey. This means that a very damaging source of strain between Washington and Ankara is closer to being resolved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/how-putins-high-risk-syria-gamble-is-paying-off\">How Putin's high-risk Syria gamble is paying off | Oleg Kashin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turkish military action should and could be mounted within hours of a decision by Erdo\u011fan. It would have the power to implement a no-fly zone (NFZ), with protected land corridors for humanitarian aid and the flow of people both ways into and out of Aleppo. This should be accompanied by a demand for the withdrawal of Assad forces to a line between Hama and Aleppo.</p> <p>Of course so recently after a failed military coup there is little appetite from some military leaders to undertake such a high-profile operation. But there is a counter-argument to this, for it could successfully restore the reputation of the armed forces in Turkey and demonstrate their loyalty.</p> <p>Nato forces would guard Turkey from the air as it conducted this humanitarian operation. Air activity outside the NFZ would continue against Isis in Syria and Iraq by Russia, Nato and Assad forces. A Kurdish area of influence in Syria in relation to Isis would continue de facto, but there would be no de jure implications, for that would be both unacceptable to Turkey and pre-empt a much more difficult medium-term settlement of issues that involve Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>Areas of influence would apply in other parts of Syria, if its neighbours Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are prepared to underpin them predominantly for dealing effectively with Isis. This whole initiative should be discussed at the highest military level, first in the Nato-Russian Council, before going to the security council. It is probable that Russia would veto it in the council, but we should not assume that, and on a military-to-military basis it might be possible to set the initiative in a context where Russia would see that its own sphere of influence was not being challenged.</p> <p>The humanitarian imperative is for the region to act and the world to help.</p>",

In that time, the scientists believe that they have understood for the first time the way in which comets are formed more than 4 billion years ago, at the same time that our own planet was forming.</p> <p> Key to their new understanding are features on the comet called \u2018positive relief features\u2019. These are lumps of about a metre across. The scientists refer to them as goose bumps; I\u2019ve even heard them called dragon\u2019s eggs.</p> <p> Today\u2019s descent is designed to get the best images possible of these goose bumps. Rosetta is heading towards a pit in the Ma\u2019at region of the comet. Inside the pit, it will be trying to see more goosebumps. </p> <p>These are thought to be the original icy boulders that formed in the solar system more than four billion years ago and then came together to form this comet. In short, the goose bumps are some of the most ancient unaltered objects from the beginning of the solar system. They contain all the ingredients that were available to form life on Earth.</p> <p> The descent today is designed to see these natural treasures in as much detail as possible \u2013 and the only way to do it is to sacrifice the spacecraft. </p> <p> But what a way to go \u2013 cutting edge science to the very end.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T11:38:02.499Z\">at 12.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ee28d3e4b0c38a12e7154b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:57:47.464Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First you see it, then you don\u2019t.

Since August 2014, Rosetta has been studying comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in order to better understand how the Earth formed, where the water in Earth\u2019s oceans came from, and how the chemical building blocks of life were delivered to this planet. </p> <p>Rosetta is the most ambitious space mission ever launched by Europe. Indeed, it is one of the most ambitious space missions any space agency has ever launched, and it has been full of drama.</p> <p>The highpoint of the mission came in November 2014, when the Philae lander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">detached from the Rosetta mothership and made its descent onto the comet</a>. A global audience watch as the lander tumbled across the surface before finally coming to rest in a crevice. Robbed of sunlight, scientists worked feverishly to complete its science mission before the batteries ran down and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/14/rosetta-mission-philaes-third-day-on-comet-as-it-happens\">Philae \u2018went to sleep\u2019 three days later</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the main Rosetta spacecraft has been working, orbiting the comet and watching the way it is evaporated by the Sun. It has been making a chemical inventory that shows what molecules were delivered to the early Earth, and from which life formed. </p> <p>Today the mission comes to an end with the main spacecraft itself touching down on the comet. Rosetta will not survive the landing but will gather even more data on the way down.</p> <p>I\u2019m here in ESA\u2019s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Rosetta is controlled from here, and it is the natural place to draw a line under the operational phase of this mission. I was here for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/jan/20/rosetta-comet-chasing-spacecraft-wakes-up-esa-live-blog\">the wake-up</a> of the mission in 2014, and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2014/nov/12/rosetta-comet-landing-live-blog\">Philae landing</a>. Now, it is the end.</p> <p>Overnight the spacecraft executed a final manoeuvre that robbed it of orbital energy. It is now falling gently to its inevitable fate upon the dusty surface of the comet.</p> <p>Touchdown is expected at around 12:20 BST. <br></p> <p>During the course of today, I\u2019ll be looking back at the mission and bringing you the details of what is going on. Plus, I\u2019ll be talking to as many people as possible to bring you their reactions. To many here, the Rosetta mission has been a way of life. Today that way of life is ending.</p> <p>Stay tuned.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-30T08:23:59.689Z\">at 9.23am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The urgent need for a strategic approach to eradicate racism is nothing new to the black community, but what support and help can we expect from the rejuvenated labour movement?</p> <p>Over the past six years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/austerity\" title=\"\">austerity</a>, we have seen amplified racism and deepening poverty for BAME communities.

The TUC failed to oppose the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968 and the Immigration Act in 1971, which further restricted immigration from Commonwealth countries. Black organisations, including the Indian Workers Association (IWA), led the campaign against the growing imposition of immigration controls, in particular the 1962 commonwealth immigrants bill, which sought to restrict the entry into Britain of black migrants from Commonwealth countries. The IWA, in conjunction with other bodies such as the <a href=\"http://www.wisc.btck.co.uk/\" title=\"\">West Indian Standing Conference</a> and the Standing Conference of Pakistan, joined to fight this legislation.</p> <p>And then there was the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23795655\" title=\"\">colour bar imposed in 1963 by the Bristol Omnibus Company</a>, endorsed by the then TGWU union. In 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that \u201ccoloured\u201d workers should not be employed on the buses. The TGWU said that \u201cif one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop\u201d. Community activists, part of the West Indian Development Council, came together with civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson and led the Bristol bus boycott, inspired by Rosa Parks and the successful bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. They were subsequently supported by students and the local MP, Tony Benn. The boycott is considered to have greatly influenced the introduction of the first race relations legislation in the UK.</p> <p>More than 50 years after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/10/race.immigrationpolicy\" title=\"\">Race Relations Act</a> was passed, we are now in danger of passing on a worse future to the next generation of young BAME people than that inherited by their parents.</p> <p>Historically, grassroots black campaigners have had to organise outside the labour movement to challenge racism. This only changed following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2010/jan/20/grunwick-strike-women\" title=\"\">Grunwick strike</a>, when in 1976 a group of Asian and Caribbean women walked out to protest against their working conditions. The year-long strike was historically significant as the first dispute of black workers that attracted mass support from the trade union movement. This eventually led to the establishment of black sections and structures within several trade unions, and in the Labour party, which were seen as highly controversial. Despite opposition from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, the black sections motion was passed by the 1983 Labour party conference and the party, alongside several public sector unions, established black caucuses or sections as part of their internal structures. However, black activists had to fight for self-organised structures in unions, with the initial response being to form race equality advisory committees. Those black structures, together with the TUC race relations committee and via the annual TUC Black Workers Conference, have done a lot to keep race on the trade union agenda.</p> <p>Since then trade unions and communities have not naturally come together to campaign against racism. However, the economic crisis and the establishment of anti-austerity coalitions concerned with the combined impact of cuts on workers, service users and communities, has seen more cooperation between equality organisations seeking to have a voice in broader movements. An example was the successful campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/rubbishing-mary-seacole-hide-black-contributions-britain\" title=\"\">keep Mary Seacole</a> and other black historical figures on the national curriculum in 2013, led by a small group of grassroots and trade union activists, supported by many Labour MPs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553fe\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758226\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour conference speech - video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebee65e4b01b56deffc4f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928corbyncongress_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour conference speech</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, who has a track record of supporting campaigns against racism and race injustice over decades, we have a real chance of strengthening the links between the black grassroots movements and the wider labour movement.</p> <p>Barac has produced a strategy document proposing how this could work which was launched at the Labour party fringe conference The World Transformed.</p> <p>It calls on signatories to declare their commitment to equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of race, religion and ethnicity, and for all citizens to be able live without fear.

You couldn\u2019t make it up,\u201d the writer pompously cried, noting that having a judge that was simultaneously a woman, a poet and of Caribbean parentage was an \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cunwise\u201d choice. It was snidely suggested that because the three winners were women, and two were from the Caribbean, that their success was \u201cnot entirely a surprise, though still rather gobsmacking\u201d, because of gendered and racial nepotism on Booker\u2019s part. That Yanique and Booker share a publisher \u2013 Peepal Tree Press, publisher of trailblazers such as <a href=\"http://kwamedawes.com/\">Kwame Dawes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/dorothea-smartt\">Dorothea Smartt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chrisabani.com/\">Chris Abani</a> \u2013 was another reason to doubt the panel\u2019s choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonCG/status/781118447799468033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Private Eye apparently gobsmacked that prize winners can be women... <a href=\"https://t.co/Jp5Y3IxvAR\">pic.twitter.com/Jp5Y3IxvAR</a></p>&mdash; J Courtenay Grimwood (@JonCG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonCG/status/781118447799468033\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s be perfectly clear: what Private Eye argues is that people of colour don\u2019t get to win by sheer hard work and talent. That POC should be grateful for the revolving door of tokenism \u2013 one in, one out \u2013 and when multiple POC are on the same award list at the same time, it is the product of a positive action conspiracy. This isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve voiced this idea; when Sarah Howe won the TS Eliot prize this year, Private Eye leapt on that achievement too, musing that she won because she was young and attractive (or \u201cextra-poetic reasons \u2026 as a successful and very \u2018presentable\u2019 young woman\u201d).<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/23/deranged-poetess-sarah-howe-ts-eliot-prize-media\">TS Eliot prize row: is winner too young, beautiful - and Chinese?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It worries me that in this post-EU referendum climate, when hate crime is rising and newspapers are filled with intolerance and fear-mongering, a writer among us found time and energy to see a conspiracy in there being more than one POC in a room of poets and artists. Why did yet another piss-weak jibe at the success of black people go to print? </p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/28/claudia-rankine-citizen-wins-forward-poetry-prize\">Claudia Rankine won the Forward prize</a>.

So with Capildeo, that is three POC winners in a row. Should there have been a white winner in between somewhere? Without new faces, new stories and new blood in poetry, we\u2019re lost, holding to dog-eared copies of Birthday Letters<em> </em>like rafts adrift at sea, clinging on to ideas of what poetry once was instead of celebrating what it is now.</p> <p>As a poet and a woman of colour, it seems that even by writing this, I could be accused of nepotism like Booker. I don\u2019t know any of the winning poets and I\u2019ve never been published by Peepal Tree. But I celebrate when I see the likes of Booker on judging panels and I felt proud of all three winners. Why? Because maybe every time a new poet breaks through, a crack of light shines on the rest of our efforts. But think about this: would anyone ever make note of three white winners in a row? Would we grumble at a white judge awarding a prize to a white author?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/22/good-immigrant-review-nikesh-shukla-britain-racist\">The Good Immigrant review \u2013 an unflinching dialogue about race and racism in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a positive and much brighter note, just last week we saw the publication of The Good Immigrant, edited by Nikesh Shukla. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/03/jk-rowling-david-nicholls-among-sponsors-crowdfunding-book-on-uk-race-and-immigration\">Crowdfunded in record time</a>, the book is a collection of 21 essays by BAME writers and artists on what it means to \u201ctick other\u201d in 21st-century Britain.

You will score points by passing through doorways to collect fish, and with the penguin models weighted to allow for dramatic curves and rolls, it\u2019s possible to pull off some impressive trick shots, even launching your<strong> </strong>figure into the air to leap over walls or rival penguins that get in your way.<br></p> <p>Each round also sees one player take on the role of the \u201ccatcher\u201d, attempting to score points by colliding with other penguins. The end result feels like a blend of a furious race, a frantic game of tag and a tipsy night around the pool table at the student union. Yes, it\u2019s a bit gimmicky, but if you\u2019re after something quick and silly with huge toy appeal,<strong> </strong>then Ice Cool is great fun for kids, or for unashamedly immature grown-ups.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0QpJk3Yew\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQ0QpJk3Yew?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice Cool in action.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Ticket to Ride: Rails and Sails</h2> <p><strong>2-5 players, 90-120 minutes<br>RRP: \u00a359.99</strong></p> <p>Family-friendly train game Ticket to Ride is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/oct/27/all-aboard-how-ticket-to-ride-helped-save-table-top-gaming\">one of board gaming\u2019s great success stories</a>. Since its release in 2004, it\u2019s sold more than 3m copies, and over the years it\u2019s spawned a series of spin-offs allowing players to build rail empires in different locations around the world. <a href=\"https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/rails-and-sails/\">Rails and Sails</a> is designer Alan R Moon\u2019s latest take on the game\u2019s popular card-based formula, and it takes things to a new and much grander scale, with players competing on a global map to build worldwide networks of railways and shipping lanes.<br></p> <p>If you have played previous games in the series, you will find the core of the game largely unchanged. Players collect cards to claim routes on the board, secretly aiming to connect certain locations on the map to score bonus points. You\u2019ll attempt to find the most efficient routes between cities and to block off the connections your opponents desperately need. The biggest change, though, is that you will need different types of cards to claim land- or sea-based routes. In effect, you\u2019re building two separate networks, and it feels a lot like playing two games of Ticket to Ride simultaneously.</p> <p>It\u2019s a more mentally taxing take on the original game\u2019s premise, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t take long for this edition to come off the rails. The requirement to collect different cards means that you can spend several turns fishing for the ones you need before you\u2019re actually able to do anything, and it soon becomes frustrating. Rails and Sails adds length and complexity, but it offers little new in terms of gameplay.</p> <p>If you\u2019re new to Ticket to Ride, this isn\u2019t the place to jump aboard; you\u2019ll have much more fun with the original game. If you\u2019re already a fan, the existing map pack expansions bring more variety and better value for money. My recommendation: the excellent <a href=\"https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/united-kingdom/\">UK and Ireland</a> expansion.</p> <h2>Mystic Vale</h2> <p><strong>2-4 players, 30 - 45 minutes<br>RRP: \u00a338.99</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44df5f6c6f8cd3f00ab463a578b18f10f60afc71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44df5f6c6f8cd3f00ab463a578b18f10f60afc71/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mystic Vale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystic Vale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strategy card games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/magic-the-gathering-pop-culture-hit-where-next\">Magic: The Gathering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/netrunner-took-over-my-life-and-why-it-should-take-over-yours-too\">Android: Netrunner</a> are a cornerstone of gamer culture.

But the game\u2019s major innovation is its \u201ccard-crafting\u201d system, which lets players build entirely new cards as they play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/01/twister-sex-box-pokemon-go-new-reality-how-games-define-the-times\">From Twister\u2019s \u2018sex in a box\u2019 to Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s new reality \u2013 how games define the times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You will start the game with a set of basic cards housed in see-through plastic sleeves.

There\u2019s little in the way of actual interaction between players, meaning that it can feel as though everyone at the table is immersed in their own individual game. While there are multiple deck-building strategies to choose from, it won\u2019t take long to discover them all.

The result is an ever-growing chain of players, some of whom will have been drawn into the game completely unsuspectingly.<br></p> <p>You will register your deck on the publisher\u2019s web site before you play, allowing you to track individual cards as they pass from person to person, and while some \u2013 probably the majority \u2013 will disappear without a trace, others will run on and on, injecting humour and spontaneity into people\u2019s lives as they go.

The difference is that, previously, we were uplifted from the comfort of our sofas.

While Grylls will mention the army pretty freely, it doesn\u2019t come across as the thing he\u2019s most proud of. He\u2019s most proud of the times he nearly died. Take the parachute that, in 1996, ripped when he was 5km up, and only partially opened, leaving him with three smashed vertebrae and near-paralysed. Today he is no different, steering the conversation towards the damage the show has inflicted on him. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely physical,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always pretty fit for my job, but then you get here and start hanging out with the young aerial acrobats who are training me. And you suddenly realise how good they are, how strong they are. I\u2019ve hurt myself so many times.\u201d</p> <p>I find myself wanting to help, but all I can think to say is: \u201cStop jumping off things!\u201d So I don\u2019t. \u201cI came home the other day,\u201d he continues, \u201cand I\u2019d really hurt myself \u2013 I\u2019d fallen over so many times, really smacked my head. Jesse, my 13-year-old, said, \u2018Maybe over 40 is not the age to be doing this.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s stinking thinking. But probably true.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This is a peculiarity of the climbing/adventuring/survivalist tendency: these people absolutely love scars and bruises, but even a reasonable amount of scepticism about the limits of human ability is met with a doughty phrase that normally rhymes (\u201cstinking thinking\u201d; \u201cno pain no gain\u201d), as if the serendipity of the rhyme were proof that the universe wants you to get to the top of the frozen waterfall, whatever human intelligence says to the contrary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd8eb7e46443f161fd8ec929b3fbb63441d26c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd8eb7e46443f161fd8ec929b3fbb63441d26c9/0_37_2192_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grylls going wild with Barack Obama in Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grylls going wild with Barack Obama in Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I actually really like climbing, but came to it late, so can only critique \u2013 and never internalise \u2013 its mindset. Anyway, here we are, at the wall, a vast slope of plywood with rudimentary chunks of two-by-four where, on the night, proper climbing holds will be. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be much bigger,\u201d Grylls says, and tries to explain the virtual element again. He gestures towards the expanse: \u201cSo that will suddenly become an ice wall. The ice will be falling off, hurtling towards you \u2013 or it could be covered in jungle vines. I\u2019ll go to grab one, it won\u2019t be there.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s right to think I haven\u2019t entirely got it, though wrong to think that every time he mentions being chased by a bear, he has to add \u201cnot a real bear\u201d. The more he talks about Endeavour, the more I believe in it, but I\u2019m on my guard, because I know this is what motivational speakers do.</p> <p>And motivational speakers who climb do one other thing: get you into a position where you don\u2019t realise you want to go back until going back is actually more difficult than carrying on. I have very little natural aptitude for climbing, but I do have preternaturally strong fingers \u2013 everyone says so \u2013 and can usually get to the top of things. On Grylls\u2019 practice wall, these are no good to me at all. Nobody can hold on to a block of wood. There\u2019s no friction on the surface, and being harnessed to a wire offers no greater reassurance than the sense that, when I fall off, I will injure my body parts in a weird order.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As his book covers show, he has about 17 expressions for 'determined', never slipping into 'puzzled' or 'constipated'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our wires cross and I can hear one of the aerial acrobats below saying \u201cMind those wires\u201d in that tone of studied mildness that climbing people use to convey wildly imminent danger.

The cover is usually a picture of his face, but his facial range is incredible, with about 17 different versions of \u201cdetermined\u201d, none of them slipping into \u201cpuzzled\u201d or \u201cconstipated\u201d. Probably every house has one Bear Grylls book, but if you had them all, that would signal a problem.</p> <p>True Grit constitutes the spine of the show and he plays all the big parts, with two male acrobats in supporting roles, and one woman, because \u201csome of the stories are incredible, but they are with women \u2013 and that would be weird, me playing that\u201d.

  "<p>Soon after the Carrier Corporation announced in February that it planned to close its 1,400-employee plant here and move operations to Mexico, Donald Trump lashed out at the company for betraying the US and its workers.<br></p> <p>On Monday, he was at it again. Only five minutes into his first debate with rival Hillary Clinton, Trump had cited Carrier as an example of the \u201cjobs fleeing this country\u201d. \u201cSo many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this,\u201d he said in his latest attempt to blame trade deals for the US\u2019s industrial decline.<br></p> <p>Carrier, whose founder, Willis Carrier, invented the modern air conditioner, has been in Indiana since the 1950s. The job losses, which will come over the next three years, are expected to <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2016/06/17/carrier-closing-cost-indiana-economy-108m-year/85930170/\">cost the state $108m</a> a year and lead to many more job losses in related businesses. But they will save the company a fortune. Most of its Indianapolis workers make about $26 an hour. Their Mexican replacements make $3 an hour.</p> <p> Unfortunately for Trump, notwithstanding his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-fec-financial-disclosure\">repeated attacks against Carrier</a> and the fact that his running mate Mike Pence is the state\u2019s governor, workers at the company\u2019s sprawling Indianapolis factory voice little support for the Republican nominee. That should be scant solace for Clinton, however, because Carrier workers also voice little enthusiasm for her \u2013 largely because she backed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) when her husband, while president, persuaded the Senate to approve it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9249dfc9d148b882afea86f279aecf8c5fa15002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9249dfc9d148b882afea86f279aecf8c5fa15002/0_137_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"United steel workers from Local 1999 rally to protest the closure of their factory in Indianapolis.

Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, is <a href=\"http://wane.com/2016/02/10/utec-leaving-huntington-for-mexico-at-cost-of-700-jobs/\">cutting 700 jobs</a> at another of its company\u2019s plants in the state and, again, moving the operation to Mexico.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/indiana-manufacturing/\" data-alt=\"Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/09/indiana-manufacturing/\">Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them</a> <figcaption>Indiana lost many manufacturing jobs in the recession but has been recovering them</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a top Carrier official, Chris Nelson, announced the closing in February, he said Carrier would not begin laying off workers until 2017 and would not entirely close the operation until 2019.</p> <p> Nelson said the company was moving the operation to Mexico to \u201cremain competitive and protect the business for the long term\u201d. \u201cRelocating our operations to Monterrey,\u201d he said, \u201cwill allow us to maintain high levels of quality, competitive prices and serve the extremely price-sensitive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>Even with all this lead time before getting laid off, Staples, the father of two boys, 11 and seven years old, worries that he won\u2019t find a job that pays nearly as well as his current $24.03-an-hour Carrier job. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into several other manufacturing jobs \u2013 they all want to pay $13, $14, $15 an hour. That\u2019s about half what I make now,\u201d he said. Staples has been hoping to buy a new house in a neighborhood with better schools, but the pending layoff could sabotage that plan. </p> <p> Chuck Jones, president of the steelworkers local here, was enraged by Carrier\u2019s decision, noting that Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies, had record profits of $7.6bn last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we produced a bad product or the company wasn\u2019t profitable,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re greedy sons of bitches who want to make more money. They don\u2019t care a rat\u2019s ass about the 1,400 people they employ and don\u2019t care how their lives turn out.\u201d</p> <p> Jones said Local 1999\u2019s members weren\u2019t excited about the presidential candidates. \u201cSome people are going to support Trump because they want something different,\u201d he said. To many Carrier workers, Jones said, Trump\u2019s choice of Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, as his running mate was a strike against him. \u201cPence did nothing as governor to help the Carrier workers,\u201d Jones said. He noted that many workers further soured on Trump when his financial disclosure forms noted that he owned United Technologies stock.</p> <p> Inside Sully\u2019s, a popular bar across from the Carrier plant, David Parliament, a Carrier worker for three decades, said he favored Trump over Clinton because \u201che\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman\u201d. He called Clinton \u201ca complete politician\u201d. Parliament added, however, that it was hardly worth voting because it\u2019s so clear that Indiana will go Republican this year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f59b560fbdfe1e3d10c7bffdcba82a8e62e21374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f59b560fbdfe1e3d10c7bffdcba82a8e62e21374/0_303_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carrier workers are worried by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former support for trade agreements\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrier workers are worried by Hillary Clinton\u2019s former support for trade agreements including Nafta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> His drinking buddy, Conrad, a retired supervisor who declined to give his last name, enthusiastically backed Trump. \u201cI think he\u2019ll bring jobs back.

  "<p><strong>I was born in Chicago. It\u2019s an amazing city.</strong> It feels alive, it has an identity, and I feel connected here. I started playing blues professionally in 1974, with an old boogie-woogie piano player, Jimmy Walker. By the following year I was in the band of the great Willie Dixon, who wrote classics such as Hoochie Coochie Man, I Just Want to Make Love to You and Little Red Rooster. He was an important mentor for me. As a city, Chicago is probably unique for musicians in that you could just work within it and make a living playing blues.</p> <p><strong>Blues is on the tourist trail now, but that doesn\u2019t mean the money always trickles down to the musicians</strong>. For a taste of the old South Side, check out the Odyssey Lounge East at 99th Street and Torrence Avenue. It used to belong to the husband of the \u201cqueen of the blues\u201d, Koko Taylor. It has a jam session on Sundays with a house band, a group who play solid Chicago R&amp;B, including Sidney Joe Qualls, a great singer in the Al Green mould.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b876a5ad2436b53bc733b871a5395277b6c5a908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b876a5ad2436b53bc733b871a5395277b6c5a908/0_0_4757_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blues musicians Eddie Shaw and Bob Stroger on stage at Rosa\u2019s Lounge, Chicago, Illinois, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blues musicians Eddie Shaw and Bob Stroger on stage at Rosa\u2019s Lounge, Chicago</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>On the road with Willie Dixon, it didn\u2019t matter how late it was</strong>, what you were up to, or who you were with, he\u2019d call up and tell you to come on over.

A regime of three training sessions a day, the first of them at 5.30am, whatever the weather, produced 40 Olympians who between them won 13 gold medals, six silver and four bronze, starting with Mae Faggs and Barbara Jones, who won gold with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQf_u4mHyGU\" title=\"\">the US 4x100 team in Helsinki in 1952</a>.

That sprinter was the 20-year-old Wilma Rudolph, the greatest of his athletes and, in his view, the greatest female athlete of all time.</p> <p>The 20th of the 22 children born to her parents, a railway porter and a maid, in the small community of St Bethlehem just outside Clarksville, Tennessee, the new-born Wilma Glodean Rudolph weighed in at four and a half pounds. She suffered a variety of ailments in infancy \u2013 measles, mumps, scarlet fever, chicken pox and double pneumonia \u2013 before contracting polio at the age of six.</p> <p>Treatment was hard to come by for a black child in the segregated American south. The local hospital was for whites only and Clarksville had only one black doctor. When polio was diagnosed, her parents were told she would never walk again. But twice a week for two years her mother took her on a 100-mile round trip to a black medical college in Nashville, where the child was fitted with a brace on her left leg and given physical exercises. With the help of her siblings, who administered daily leg rubs, by the age of 12 she was walking without the brace or crutches and was making up her mind to become an athlete.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/50-stunning-olympic-moments-wilma-rudolph\">50 stunning Olympic moments No35: Wilma Rudolph's triple gold in 1960 | Rob Bagchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She had grown tall and captained her school basketball team to a state championship. Then she came to the attention of Temple, who invited her to his summer coaching sessions for high school students at Tennessee State, a historically black university. At the age of 16 she was heading for Melbourne and her first Olympic Games, where she and the Tigerbelles, wearing US colours, won a bronze medal in the 4x100.</p> <p>When she arrived in Rome four years later it was as the mother of a two\u2011year\u2011old daughter. In the Stadio Olimpico <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPVdpJZJi-o\" title=\"\">she became the first US woman to win three gold medals</a>, in the 100m, 200m and sprint relay. Sharing the podium with Rudolph in both the individual events was Dorothy Hyman, the 19\u2011year\u2011old daughter of a Barnsley coalminer, who took silver in the 100m and bronze in the 200m but lost the chance of a third medal when Britain\u2019s relay quartet failed to get the baton round.</p> <p>The young Cassius Clay \u2013 a native of Louisville, Kentucky, less than 200 miles from Clarksville \u2013 was winning a gold medal in Rome but Rudolph outshone him. On her return home to Tennessee she was welcomed with a parade and accompanied by a military band in what was said to be the town\u2019s first integrated public event. She retired from the track in 1962, married twice and had three more children. Having studied elementary education at college, she worked as a teacher while coaching athletes at her old high school. In later years she lived in Indianapolis, where she presented a local TV show until her death from cancer in 1994, aged 54.

Edith McGuire, her fellow Tigerbelle, also aged 20, took the silver behind her in the final and then the gold in the 200m.

  "<p>For Afghan refugees such as me, we are now entering a perfect storm. Europe wants to make aid to our country contingent on its acceptance of at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/28/eu-secret-ultimatum-afghanistan-accept-80000-deportees-lose-aid-brussels-summit-migration-sensitive\" title=\"\">80,000 deported asylum seekers</a> who arrived on the continent last year. Simultaneously, Pakistan \u2013 the country that houses more expatriate Afghans than any other \u2013 plans to repatriate the 3 million Afghans who have sought refuge there since 1978. The former face reprisals from the extremists from whom they fled. The latter must head for a country where most of them have never even set foot.</p> <p>All this will create or worsen three separate crises. The European asylum system might have to bend its own rules to send people back to a war zone, which would set a bad example to other countries \u2013 not least Pakistan. It will also greatly affect refugees already in Europe \u2013 people in similar situations to me.</p> <p>I am an Afghan refugee living in the UK. Thankfully I am now a legal resident here \u2013 but if I were sent back to Afghanistan, I would risk being killed by the militias that forced me to flee in the first place. And then there are the Afghans currently in Pakistan. Tens of thousands of these people are second- or third-generation immigrants who were born and raised in Pakistan. These refugees made Pakistan their home, started businesses, went to college. For most of them, Afghanistan is a foreign country.</p> <p>It could also spark crisis in Afghanistan itself. The return of more than 3 million people would cause mayhem in an already fragile country. It would stretch limited resources, increase ethnic and religious tensions and exacerbate the violence that is already forcing many people from their homes. <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/the-problem-with-afghanistans-counterinsurgency/\" title=\"\">According to a recent report by the Afghan government\u2019s Independent Directorate of Local Governance</a>, over 50% of the country\u2019s 384 districts face some threat of violence.</p> <p>The return of millions more people can only make this situation worse \u2013 and cause yet another wave of refugees to flee their homes. In trying to contain one refugee crisis, Europe and Pakistan are about to create another. There are no quick fixes, and it is foolish to think otherwise.</p> <p>A bit of context: in historic terms, Afghanistan is the world\u2019s top exporter of refugees. Together, the communist revolution in 1978 and the Soviet invasion in 1979 sent 5 million refugees to Pakistan and 3 million to Iran. More followed during the civil wars between the extremist factions who defeated the Soviets. Then more fled the Taliban. And while the western invasion in 2001 may have ousted the Taliban from power, the conflict \u2013 and the migration \u2013 continues to this day. The US and UK armies gave Afghans little reason to stay, and neither has the new Kabul government.</p> <p>Many Afghans living in major cities would rather take a risky route to reach Europe than live with the economic uncertainty and the security threats. And if you live in a rural area \u2013 like nearly 70% of the Afghan population \u2013 you might prefer to leave than be recruited into the ranks of the Taliban, al-Qaida, or Islamic State.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many believe the 2014 presidential election was rigged and that the government is incapable of responding to their basic needs. The rivalry between the president, Ashraf Ghani, and his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, has made things harder \u2013 the two have been squabbling since beginning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/14/ashraf-ghani-visit-pakistan-afghanistan\" title=\"\">a power-sharing exercise</a> in November 2014. All the while, political polarisation is on the rise due to ethnocentric agendas within the Afghan government.</p> <p>The west\u2019s response has been to throw aid money at the government. The UK remains one of the largest aid donors, giving \u00a3178m per year. But this is wasted money. As David Cameron himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/10/david-cameron-afghanistan-nigeria-possibly-most-corrupt-countries\" title=\"\">said during an anti-corruption summit</a>, the Kabul administration is \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d. It so far has no proper strategy for re-assimilating such a large number of refugees, nor the funding to make it possible. This makes it very hard for any repatriation plan to be successful.</p> <p>There is little hope that the government in Kabul can care for the existing residents of Afghanistan \u2013 let alone another 3 million with no shelter and food. The plan to return 80,000 Afghans from Europe \u2013 as well as millions from Pakistan \u2013 is dangerous and misguided.</p>",

Going to Mars is part of one of most historical events in human history. It is the next step in human civilization.

Of the 50, 49 students said a city that was within a couple hours\u2019 drive of Decatur; one student said Paris, and he passed away the following summer. This is a phenomenon that needed to change. I want to see that same question asked in 10 years and see answers that not only leave the state of Illinois or the United States, but to see answers that show students believe it is possible to leave the planet would show a level of adventure and desire that an educator could only dream of for each student they encounter.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f16d48c74b7ef6340a5d24e502d18182f700f507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16d48c74b7ef6340a5d24e502d18182f700f507/0_193_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A test firing of SpaceX\u2019s engine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A test firing of SpaceX\u2019s engine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Matthew Hawkins, 19, a student from Indiana:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because Mars is the best chance for the future of humanity.

Even if you\u2019re never directly attributed to anything, even if you live a quiet life. The way you lived, your attitudes, the culture you helped create, your political leanings, all of that will contribute to an ingrained memory in this new society.

Greater Vancouver\u2019s Real Estate Board prefers to use measures that suggest the city\u2019s market has only dipped mildly.</p> <p>And earlier this month Jing Li, a 29-year-old Chinese student living in the adjoining city of Burnaby, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/class-action-lawsuit-launched-against-b-c-foreign-buyers-property-tax-1.3769751\">began a class-action lawsuit</a> against the new tax. Li had put a 10% deposit down on a half-million dollar Vancouver townhouse in July, only for the tax to be imposed 12 days later.</p> <p>According to CBC News, this added C$84,000 to the price of Li\u2019s house, meaning she was suddenly at risk of losing her C$56,000 deposit. \u201cI can\u2019t go forward and I can\u2019t go back,\u201d she told CBC. </p> <h2>\u2018The only solution\u2019</h2> <p>Ron Jordens, a 72-year-old retired engineer, lives in a rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant: once a gritty working-class Vancouver neighbourhood, now hipster central.</p> <p>The block\u2019s landlords have served an eviction notice. According to Jordens, they are hoping to cash in on the boom by renovating the flats \u2013 and raising rents by 50%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/12/tenants-question-bc-rent-laws.html\">He says the \u201crenovation\u201d is unnecessary</a>, claiming it is simply a device to circumvent rules protecting tenants. But amid spiralling rents elsewhere in the city, he says some of his neighbours have had no choice but to accept the landlords\u2019 demands. One single mother with an 11-year-old child was temporarily evicted, he says, and has had to take on three jobs to afford the new rent.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have a good, decent-paying job can\u2019t afford to buy in Vancouver, and they can barely afford to rent,\u201d Jordens says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5363f7216714b1d3300d442a8bcb9251f6f2271d/0_102_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Jordens is facing eviction from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/12/tenants-question-bc-rent-laws.html\">Ron Jordens is facing eviction</a> from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/Metro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new tax, he adds, is just \u201cputting a Band-Aid\u201d on the problem, predicting that \u201cthere will be ways around it with side-contracts. It has got to the point where the only solution has to be a \u2018no foreign ownership\u2019 deal on the table.\u201d<br></p> <p>But isn\u2019t Canada a country built on immigration? Jordens points to the thousands of unoccupied flats across the city, built for investors who often never reside there. \u201cIf you are coming to live here, get a job and pay taxes, that\u2019s great. The trouble is they don\u2019t live here, and they don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d</p> <p>There are an estimated 10,000-plus empty apartments in Vancouver, of which a significant number are owned by foreign investors. In mid-September, 200 protestors from a new campaign group, <a href=\"https://haltvancouver.org/\">HALT</a> \u2013 Housing Action for Local Taxpayers \u2013 took to Vancouver\u2019s streets demanding action to control the market. Among the speakers were <a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/mpp/pdfs/Vancouver%27s%20Housing%20Affordability%20Crisis%202016%20Executive%20Summary.pdf\">academics who argue that the Canadian home-owning dream is being crushed</a> because they can\u2019t compete with foreign investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T16:01:06/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Vancouver tops UBS's Global Real Estate Bubble Index\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T16:01:06/embed.html\">Vancouver tops UBS's Global Real Estate Bubble Index</a> </figure>  <p>The protests appear to be working: an empty homes tax last week won the approval of city councillors and is set to be implemented next year. Even owners of empty Airbnb flats could be fined $10,000 for failing to comply. Vancouver is fast turning into a test-bed of initiatives to cool outrageous property prices and rents.</p> <p>But over on West Vancouver\u2019s Marine Drive, home to plush waterfront estates (one sold for $50m last year), the city\u2019s biggest realtor to Chinese investors, Clarence Debelle, says the new taxes are \u201cdriven by jealousy and envy\u201d.</p> <p>He says the Vancouver market was slowing in any case, and that the 15% tax on overseas buyers will do nothing to help priced-out 25- to 35-year-olds buying entry-level apartments. But it could, he warns, destroy the local economy. </p> <p>\u201cVirtually everything being built in West Vancouver is being built for a Chinese buyer. Vancouver has no industry apart from tourism and construction. So what do we do? Decide to insult the Chinese. You may not just blight the property market, but bankrupt the construction industry, too.\u201d </p> <p>Debelle predicts stalemate in Vancouver\u2019s market as sellers refuse to drop prices. And he fears for Canada\u2019s global reputation: \u201cIn my view, the Chinese see this as a racist-motivated tax. It\u2019s a dark moment in Canadian political history.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong tax too,\u201d he adds, \u201cas it won\u2019t help the people at the bottom wanting to get into the market. It has not changed the pricing of their homes one bit. There are better ways to help, such as increasing supply.\u201d</p> <p>Debelle\u2019s own father emigrated from Europe after the second world war. \u201cVancouver is now an international destination. You can\u2019t have it both ways: benefit from trade and tourism, <em>and</em> have the tax.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018The market has been distorted\u2019<br></h2> <p>Vancouver\u2019s experiment is being closely watched in London. According to London Assembly member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sianberry\">Sian Berry</a>, who stood as the Green party\u2019s candidate for mayor: \u201cVancouver shows that the very rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is not just a London problem \u2013 it\u2019s a growing problem all over the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vancouver shows that the rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is a growing problem worldwide</p> <footer> <cite>Sian Berry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLondon needs more devolution so we can take similar steps,\u201d Berry says, \u201ccontrolling stamp duty and council tax, and closing the loopholes that allow people to buy property through offshore companies \u2013 so that the people who actually live in London can stand a chance.</p> <p> \u201cA huge amount of housing in London is being bought up by offshore companies to avoid paying tax,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn my area in north London, overseas companies bought up \u00a32.5bn of property in just four years and avoided hundreds of millions in stamp duty.\u201d</p> <p>Berry\u2019s concerns are shared not only by the left. The Bow Group, a conservative thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/nov/21/foreign-buyers-british-property\">issued a paper last year</a> in which it talked of a global super-rich elite, some of them criminal, snapping up property in London, pushing up costs for existing residents and throwing the poor to the edges of the city. </p> <p>The report\u2019s author, Daniel Valentine, traces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification\">phenomenal increase in London house prices</a> to the mid 1990s, when three factors came together: a sudden surge in population, the explosion in buy-to-let lending, and the entry of China and Russia into the global economy, producing a global elite seeking a safe home for their cash.</p> <p>These factors have, he says, corrupted the market, creating an insatiable \u201cinvestment demand\u201d divorced from the underlying needs of British society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27041d975afe488d8c15479ab29412945488c4ff/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the Pacific to Vancouver, the same arguments are rehearsed in Australia and New Zealand, although not just about the global elite. One <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3752283/Young-Chinese-buyers-dominating-Sydney-property-market.html\">recent report </a>followed a day of family home auctions in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs; all but one property were said to have been bought by Chinese buyers, with even modest homes fetching A$1.8m (\u00a31.05m). <br></p> <p>Two decades ago, buying a house in a major Australian city cost around five times the income of the average young Australian. Now, after the country\u2019s economic boom, it is about 15 times.</p> <p>Pete Wargent is a leading property buying agent in Sydney and Brisbane. \u201cThe phenomenon of the Chinese buyer has been a huge story here for years now. But you just have to look where Australia is; there are a lot of pathways for Chinese money.\u201d</p> <p>He says the flood of Chinese cash has sparked an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/strength-or-a-sign-of-weakness-to-come-this-index-of-cranes-across-australian-capital-cities-is-up-20-2016-4\">extraordinary building boom</a>. \u201cThere are more high-rise apartments under construction than ever \u2013 with 150,000 going up across the country.\u201d </p> <p>Given that Australia bans foreign buyers of existing homes, nearly all the Chinese money is pouring into new-build towers. The 4% stamp duty surcharge means a non-resident buyer pays about A$30,000 more than an Australian resident for a A$750,000 apartment in Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/gentrification-global-problem-better-solution-oliver-wainwright\">Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s difficult to assess the impact of the surcharge yet, says Wargent, although he notes a gathering panic in some Australian banks, which are now far less keen to lend to non-residents. From 2017 a second new surcharge will hit non-residents: a 0.75% land tax, which has to be paid each year. Some fear that apartments bought off-plan will be dumped back on the market en masse.</p> <p>Will that help to moderate prices for local buyers? \u201cEventually it could help,\u201d says Wargent. \u201cThe problem in Sydney and Melbourne is that the market has been heavily distorted in favour of investors. In Sydney more than half the market is investors, which is a crazy imbalance.\u201d.</p> <p>Critics say that a flood of apartment purchases through domestic pension \u201csuper-funds\u201d is more to blame for the spiralling prices than Chinese buyers. Wargent also throws into the mix \u201clandbanking\u201d by major developers \u2013 drip-feeding sites into the market to ensure prices keep soaring \u2013 plus loose lending criteria from the major banks.</p> <p>\u201cIn truth, it has been tough for first-time buyers for nearly a generation now,\u201d he says. He advocates a broad-based land value tax (LVT) as about the only measure \u201cto cool the sheer demand for housing here\u201d.</p> <p>The bad news for young Australians wanting a foothold on the fabled property ladder is that the latest house price figures are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sydney-housing-market-fourth-on-global-bubble-index/7883816\">just out</a>.

  "<p>\u201cFor some people, it\u2019ll always be Straddie,\u201d a thick Australian accent remarks on the radio. \u201cStraddie\u201d is an abbreviation for Stradbroke Island, in that sanguine way that Aussies abbreviate all serious things from politicians (pollies) to documentaries (docos).</p> <p>That cheerful abbreviation hides something darker. Many Australian place names were given by people branded as British \u201cexplorers\u201d. Some claim that as a misnomer and euphemism: they were actually British invaders. The <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/stradbroke-island-traditional-owners-quandamooka-minjerriba/7807822\">campaign this month to rename Stradbroke Island</a> (named by British naval \u201cexplorer\u201d Captain Henry Rous in 1827, after his father, the Earl of Stradbroke) to its Indigenous Australian name of Minjerribah (meaning \u201cIsland in the Sun\u201d in the local Jandai language) reflects 20,000 years of connection to this land by the Quandamooka people, the traditional indigenous owners. </p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story to the journey that saw Ayers Rock (named after the South Australian premier Sir Henry Ayers by European \u201cexplorer\u201d William Gosse in 1873) re-named Uluru/Ayers Rock in 1993 to reflect the handback of the land to the Anangu people that occurred in 1985.</p> <p>There are few identity crises as dramatic as a country, island or city re-branding. Geographical nomenclature is steeped in political, cultural, racial and linguistic tensions. That\u2019s why a small, sunny island off the Queensland coast changing its name from one of white privilege and entitlement to the evocative imagery captured by the English translation of a beautifully mellifluous, almost onomatopoeic Indigenous Australian word (say it slowly, Minjerribah, and you can almost taste the sun) is so heartening.</p> <p>Place name changes can be serious, pedantic, justice-restoring \u2013 and even comical.</p> <p><strong>Burma or Myanmar?</strong><br>This linguistic debate is confined to English \u2013 both words mean the same thing in Burmese, where one is derived from the other. Myanmar is the literary, formal name; Burma the spoken, colloquial variant.</p> <p>It was more than a linguistic debate for many; which term you used depended on your political bias towards the country\u2019s struggle for democracy. Some claim the formal re-name, Myanmar, was used by those soft on the unelected military regime and was a form of government censorship from the original people\u2019s term, Burma. Others said adopting the formal re-name was an attempt by the junta to break from the British colonial past.</p> <p>The UN, France and Japan used Myanmar but the US and UK used Burma because they refused to accept the legitimacy of an unelected military regime to change the country\u2019s official name in 1989. Barack Obama has since used both out of diplomatic courtesy. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-burma-myanmar-and-faltering-steps-toward-democracy\">until a change in policy last year</a>, the Guardian itself advised its writers to refer to the country as Burma.<br></p> <p>Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the Burmese pro-democracy movement, said this year that whether you use the old or new name no longer matters: \u201cI use Burma very often because I\u2019m used to it. But it doesn\u2019t mean I require others to do that. And I\u2019ll make an effort to say Myanmar from time to time so you all feel comfortable. This is what diplomacy, I think, is all about. We have to learn to accommodate each other.\u201d</p> <p>Other countries that have changed names include Southern and Northern Rhodesia (British protectorates that respectively became Zimbabwe and Zambia), Persia (now Iran), Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and New Spain (Mexico). <br></p> <p>This year, leaders in the Czech Republic, fed up with their country\u2019s complicated full name, made a bid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2016/apr/14/czech-republic-czechia-new-name\">to change it to one three-syllable word in time for the Olympics</a>. It\u2019s a country in constant metamorphosis \u2013 from Bohemia to Czechoslovakia to Czech Republic and now: Czechia.</p> <p><strong>The portmanteau city </strong><br>Budapest is a portmanteau because it used to be two cities \u2013 Buda and Pest, either side of the Danube river. Or, more precisely, three \u2013 Buda, Pest, and \u00d3buda. They united to form the geographical portmanteau in 1873.</p> <p>Other cities that have changed their official names include Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), Leningrad (back to St Petersburg), Bombay (now Mumbai), New Amsterdam (New York), Edo (Tokyo) and Christiania (Oslo).</p> <p><strong>Scholars\u2019 Walk or Scholars Walk?</strong><br>A Cambridge council spokesperson rued the day the authority followed a \u201cbureaucratic guideline\u201d to cut apostrophes from place names for \u201cclarity\u201d. It led to the prospect of the city\u2019s Scholars\u2019 Walk becoming grammatically incorrect \u2013 although literally quite apt. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/06/council-reverses-ban-on-apostrophes\">The council later revoked the decision</a> and apostrophes were restored. Phew.</p> <p><strong>Titswobble Road and Curly Dick Road </strong><br>Both descriptive cheeky road names <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/20/offensive-road-names\">came under threat</a> from the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, Australia, for their \u201clikelihood to offend\u201d. The attempted change was called out as fun-spoiling officiousness.</p> <p><strong>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch </strong><br>Originally named Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, the Welsh town changed its name in the 19th century to encourage tourism, becoming the longest place name in Europe. It translates as: \u201cSt Mary\u2019s Church in the hollow of the white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St Tysilio of the red cave.\u201d It\u2019s still shorter than the average German noun.</p> <p><strong>Harrodsville </strong><br>It sounds like a name-change of Knightsbridge lobbied for by Mohamed Al Fayed. But the reverse is true: it was the brief re-naming of New Zealand town Otorohanga in 1986 in support of local restaurateur Henry Harrod, after London\u2019s Harrods \u2013 then owned by Al Fayed \u2013 threatened to sue him over the name of his small business on the other side of the world.</p> <p>So what place names are likely to be the source of strife in the future? If Scotland secedes, the UK itself could be the next to change what it calls itself.

  "<p>Given the difficulties inherent in reproducing some of the world\u2019s best cocktails \u2013 a properly-made punch \u00e0 la Romaine requires an ice cream maker and mastery of the Italian meringue technique \u2013 it\u2019s little wonder that we often outsource anything more complicated than a G&amp;T to the professionals. <br></p> <p>But if you\u2019re having people over and want to impress, these five drinks are surprisingly easy to make \u2013 and will win you more than a few accolades.</p> <h2><strong>1. Prescription julep</strong></h2> <p> This 19th-century predecessor to the mint julep requires a <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/tools-drinks/article/ice-bag\">lewis bag</a> and a mallet \u2013 or a nice clean tea-towel, a rolling pin, and a bit of patience. Make sure you have lots of ice on hand, then \u2013 when you\u2019re ready to impress \u2013 pop the ice in your lewis bag (wrap it in your tea towel) and whack it to a fine powder with your mallet (rolling pin). Transfer this powdery crushed ice to a bowl.</p> <p> For the drink, put the sugar and water in each glass (if you have some metal julep cups kicking around, by all means bust them out). Stir until the sugar is dissolved, then add the mint leaves. Lightly muddle these leaves to release their oils \u2013 just a gentle press, don\u2019t bash them. Then fill each glass with your finely crushed ice and follow it with the cognac and rye whiskey. </p> <p>Stir until a frost forms on the outside, then top the glass up with more crushed ice. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2QeH0h7GuQ\">Lightly spank three or four sprigs of mint</a> per serve, and place these in the ice. Tuck some fresh berries in amongst the herbiage if you like, and dust the lot with some icing sugar. Insert a short straw near the mint, so your guests smell the lovely aroma as they sip.</p> <p><strong>Make it at home: Prescription julep (adapted from </strong><em><strong>Harper\u2019s Monthly</strong></em><strong>, 1857, via </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Imbibe-Updated-Revised-Absinthe-Professor/dp/0399172610/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475120578&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=wondrich+imbibe\"><strong>David Wondrich</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p><strong> 45ml cognac (VSOP or thereabouts)<br>15ml rye whiskey<br>Six or so mint leaves, stems removed<br>Two teaspoons sugar<br>10ml or so water</strong></p> <p> Build sugar and water in glass. Stir until dissolved. Add mint leaves and muddle lightly. Top with crushed ice, then cognac and rye. Stir to incorporate, then top again with crushed ice. Garnish liberally with mint (and berries, if you\u2019re so inclined).</p> <p> <strong>Pair with a movie: </strong><em>Goldfinger</em>, if only so you can favourably compare your julep to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOL7hF-YDU\">sorry excuse for a julep</a> that James Bond is served at Auric Goldfinger\u2019s Kentucky horse stud.</p> <h2><strong>2. Dry martini</strong></h2> <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: isn\u2019t the point of the martini that it\u2019s a difficult drink to master? The kind you need to stir a precise number of times, or lightly mist with vermouth from an atomiser, or make with liquid nitrogen? </p> <p>Well, to purloin a phrase from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian: the mystery of the martini is that there is no mystery. It\u2019s actually a very simple stirred drink, and easy to nail if you take a little care when putting it together.</p> <p>The first and most important step is to make sure you\u2019ve got good, fresh dry vermouth on hand \u2013 nothing kills a martini\u2019s chances like bad vermouth, even in tiny quantities. That bottle of Martini &amp; Rossi that\u2019s been mouldering on your sideboard since your last cocktail party in 2005? It\u2019s not going to cut it. (Remember, <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/cocktails/article/vermouth-drinking-guide\">vermouth is wine</a> \u2013 and you wouldn\u2019t drink a Marlborough sauvignon blanc that was opened back when savvy b was cool, would you?) </p> <p>Noilly Prat or Dolin are both excellent choices.</p> <p>Next, the gin. You don\u2019t have to go all-out when buying a gin for your martinis \u2013 a solid mid-shelf choice, such as Beefeater or Tanqueray, can be as impressive in a martini as any high-end import or microdistiller\u2019s locavore option. Just avoid the really cheap stuff, and aim for something with a bit of juniper bite to it \u2013 a too-soft gin will make a limp martini.</p> <p>Finally, the technique. Place your cocktail glasses in the freezer five minutes before you plan to serve the drink. Then, when you\u2019re ready, pop the gin and your nice, fresh vermouth in a mixing vessel of some kind \u2013 it could be a small water jug, the bottom half of a shaker set, or a proper fancy mixing glass. If you have some on hand, throw in two dashes of orange bitters per person.

Pink Martini.</p> <h2><strong>3. Earl grey marTEAni</strong></h2> <p> You\u2019ll need a shaker to make this contemporary classic cocktail from Pegu Club\u2019s Audrey Saunders; you\u2019ll also need non-vegan guests, because it contains egg white, which gives it its silky texture. </p> <p>The trick to master for a truly impressive earl grey marTEAni is the \u201cdry shake\u201d \u2013 so called because you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcjBDxzfF9s\">shake the drink once without ice, to froth up the egg white, then again with ice, to chill and dilute</a>. You\u2019ll also need to plan a little in advance \u2013 the earl grey gin needs two hours to infuse before it\u2019s ready.</p> <p> Start by infusing some gin with loose leaf earl grey tea \u2013 use four tablespoons for a 700ml bottle. (You can scale this down if you don\u2019t want to commit a whole bottle of gin to the endeavour.) Cap and shake the bottle, then leave at room temperature for two hours to infuse. Strain the gin through a tea strainer and into a clean bottle. This infusion will keep indefinitely if refrigerated. </p> <p> As with the dry martini, place your cocktail glasses in the freezer five minutes or so before you\u2019re ready to serve. Unless you have an exceptionally large shaker and strong arms, you\u2019ll probably want to make each drink separately. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9667fe778d20f3d585b1758f89681c43b8658558\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9667fe778d20f3d585b1758f89681c43b8658558/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Saunders leads the cocktail demonstration at the 2016 New York Culinary Experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pegu Club\u2019s Audrey Saunders leads the cocktail demonstration at the 2016 New York Culinary Experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for the New York Cu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Make it at home: earl grey marTEAni (adapted from Audrey Saunders, </strong><a href=\"http://www.peguclub.com/flash/\"><strong>Pegu Club</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <p><strong> 45ml earl grey infused gin<br>30ml freshly-squeezed lemon juice<br>22.5ml <a href=\"http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/03/cocktail-101-how-to-make-simple-syrup-technique-rich-syrup-recipe.html\">simple syrup</a><br>One egg white</strong></p> <p> Build ingredients in cocktail shaker.

  "<p>On really bad days, Lutfi Bin Ali retrieves his Guant\u00e1namo Bay suit from under a pile of clothes and pulls it on. The outfit, which by this point has faded from its infamous orange colour to more of a salmony pink, reminds him he was once worse off than he is now, and helps him to calm down.<br></p> <p>Sometimes, though, he wonders if his current predicament might actually be even worse than the 13 years he spent in the notorious prison. Lonely and isolated in the Kazakh steppe, the 51-year-old Tunisian has found life since his release from Guant\u00e1namo no easier than life inside.</p> <p>\u201cAt least in Gu\u00e1ntanamo there were people to talk to. Here I have nobody,\u201d Bin Ali said during the Guardian\u2019s two-day visit to his new home, a dusty town in northern Kazakhstan famed for being a Soviet nuclear testing site. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-15T12:01:10.html\" data-alt=\"Semey, Kazakhstan\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-15T12:01:10.html\">Semey, Kazakhstan</a> </figure>  <p>Bin Ali was captured on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in late 2001, and claims to have spent time in CIA black sites before being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo several months later. US intelligence accused him of associating with known al-Qaida members in Afghanistan and of being part of a Tunisian jihadi cell. He denied all the claims, insisting he went to Pakistan and Afghanistan to find a wife and escape minor problems with the law in Italy, where he had lived for more than a decade previously.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/894-lotfi-bin-ali\">leaked Guant\u00e1namo internal assessment</a>, Bin Ali was recommended for release or transfer to another country for continued detention in June 2004. Based on his \u201chealth status, intelligence value and risk level\u201d the US defence department judged Bin Ali to pose a \u201clow risk\u201d. It was more than a decade before he would finally be freed.</p> <p>As the Obama administration has attempted to shut down Guant\u00e1namo, increased efforts have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/31/five-guantanamo-prisoners-flown-to-kazakhstan-for-resettlement\">made to transfer the detainees to their home nations, or third countries</a>. Bin Ali said he could not go back to Tunisia after being branded a terrorist by the Americans \u2013 he risked jail there.</p> <p>Many former prisoners, Yemenis, Tunisians and Libyans, have been transferred to third countries where they are placed in rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>Usually they are funded by the host country, but the Kazakhstan programme is financed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The two-year programme was meant to see the former prisoners slowly integrate into Kazakh society. The reality has been rather different.</p> <p>Bin Ali has a serious heart condition that required an operation to install an artificial valve in 1999, and his US lawyer, Mark Denbeaux, said he had persuaded Bin Ali to accept the transfer to Kazakhstan based on what US authorities told him. </p> <p>\u201cThey explained to me that Kazakhstan was a Muslim country, it had an excellent healthcare system, and they had a programme to take care of him. After two years he would be free to leave. None of what I was told turned out to be true,\u201d Denbeaux said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I arrived, it was -30 outside and I was still in Guantanamo flip-flops</p> <footer> <cite>Lutfi Bin Ali</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"622e875b697dff3bdfb0a1a462bc921febfe46b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/622e875b697dff3bdfb0a1a462bc921febfe46b7/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lutfi Bin Ali at his home in Semey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lutfi Bin Ali at his home in Semey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of 2014, Bin Ali, along with another Tunisian detainee and three Yemenis, were transferred to Kazakhstan. The five were flown out on a military aircraft, hands and feet cuffed, and two days and several changes of transport later, Bin Ali and one of the Yemenis arrived in Semey, a town near Kazakhstan\u2019s border with Russia. The other three were sent to Kyzylorda, hundreds of miles away in southern Kazakhstan.</p> <p>After the long journey, Bin Ali was taken to a temporary apartment in Semey late on New Year\u2019s Eve. Outside there were fireworks and drunken celebrations. Inside, it was freezing.</p> <p>\u201cIt was minus 30 outside and I was still in Guant\u00e1namo flip-flops, because none of the shoes they had were big enough. I was expecting a Muslim country and it wasn\u2019t what I expected,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Semey, called Semipalatinsk until 2007, is a sleepy town of dilapidated Soviet-era apartment blocks home to around 300,000 people, more than 500 miles from Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Almaty. It is mainly known for its location next to the \u201cpoligon\u201d, an area of steppe where the Soviets carried out nuclear tests. Radiation levels are still well above average in the area, and many believe the tests have led to all manner of health problems. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ended_up-zip/giv-22601ARu8DeHVt3aD/\" data-alt=\"Where have other Guant\u200b\u200b\u00e1namo releasees been sent?\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ended_up-zip/giv-22601ARu8DeHVt3aD/\">Where have other Guant\u200b\u200b\u00e1namo releasees been sent?</a> </figure>  <p>The town\u2019s isolation and its climate of hot, dusty summers and punishingly cold winters drove Fyodor Dostoevsky to distraction during the five years he spent in exile in the town, where he had seizures and sank into depression. \u201cI live in Semipalatinsk, which bores me to death. Life has become intolerable for me,\u201d the novelist wrote in a letter in 1858.</p> <p>More than 150 years later, Bin Ali has similar feelings about the town. Few people speak English and he has found only one person, the imam of the mosque, who speaks any Arabic. At 6ft 6in (198cm), he is a foot taller than most of the town\u2019s residents, and cannot find shoes or clothes to fit.</p> <p>After their arrival, the Guant\u00e1namo five were told they would not be able to leave the confines of their host cities, and Bin Ali was not given proper care for his heart condition. </p> <p>Four months after the men were transferred, one of the Yemenis in Kyzylorda, Asim al-Khalaqi, became ill. \u201cHe was more and more ill but they didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Adel Hkimi, another Yemeni transferred to Kyzylorda, by telephone. \u201cHe was weak. He couldn\u2019t go out, so I did shopping for him. I asked to stay overnight to look after him but they wouldn\u2019t let me. He became sadder and angrier. He was unable to walk, or to go to the toilet.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, when it became clear just how serious the condition was, Khalaqi was taken to hospital. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/22/guantanamo-detainee-asim-thabit-abdullah-al-khalaqi-dies-kazakhstan\">He died the next day</a>. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3839cc24aa1e295bc0effaf3a1d150139eb7bd92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3839cc24aa1e295bc0effaf3a1d150139eb7bd92/0_552_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The town of Semey, close to the Russian border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The town of Semey, close to the Russian border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suffering from worsening heart palpitations that kept him awake at night, Bin Ali feared the same fate. Eventually, earlier this year, he was given an operation to install another artificial valve in Astana, Kazakhstan\u2019s capital. The whole week he was there he was guarded by police. </p> <p>\u201cThey picked him up, broke him, and threw him away,\u201d said Denbeaux of the US treatment of Bin Ali. He said while the conditions in Kazakhstan might be intolerable, the Kazakhs had been \u201cdoing the Americans a favour\u201d by agreeing to take the detainees, and it was the US who must bear responsibility for the situation. \u201cIn their race to empty out Guant\u00e1namo, they are leaving people who are released in unsustainable circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Some Kazakh officials resent the complaints. After all, Bin Ali could well be a dangerous terrorist as far as they know, and he has been given an allowance, access to medicines and a spacious flat that is luxurious by local standards, with green faux-leather sofas and imitation malachite columns.</p> <p>But it is little more than a gilded cell. His only document is a flimsy, handwritten Kazakh docket saying he is \u201ca person seeking refugee status\u201d, and he is explicitly banned from leaving the confines of the town, let alone the country. When the Guardian visited, the police arrived within half an hour, ostensibly to \u201csay hello\u201d. They demanded information on the visitor and took down passport and accreditation details.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/releases-zip/giv-22601EPyUwJXdz35Z/\" data-alt=\"Only 55 of the 174 prisoners released from Guant\u00e1namo since 2008 have been returned to their country of origin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/releases-zip/giv-22601EPyUwJXdz35Z/\">Only 55 of the 174 prisoners released from Guant\u00e1namo since 2008 have been returned to their country of origin</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think they have good conditions in their daily life. The problem is they have no future there, and that has to do with the restrictions of the Kazakh government,\u201d said Jens-Martin Mehler of the ICRC\u2019s regional delegation in central Asia.</p> <p>It is understandable that the Kazakhs are suspicious. A report issued last week <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-militants-guantanamo-idUKKCN11K2X9?utm_campaign=crowdfire&amp;utm_content=crowdfire&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">suggested nine Guant\u00e1namo detainees have rejoined militant groups since 2009</a>, and the lack of any trials means it is hard to officials to distinguish between real terrorist masterminds and those arrested in error.</p> <p>Bin Ali insists there is no truth to allegations that he had links to al-Qaida. He readily admits he got into scrapes with the law before his arrest, but says they were all about petty crime rather than extremism. Born in 1965 in Tunis, he left school at 12 and worked as a furniture maker. As he turned 20 he moved to Italy on the suggestion of friends and relatives and began a 14-year period moving around the country from Milan to Brindisi. </p> <p>In 1998 he decided to move to Pakistan. In his telling, he was motivated by cash, not Islam. \u201cI did business with a lot of Pakistan people, I heard there was lots of good business there.\u201d When he got there, he had problems with the police and fled to Afghanistan. He said he spent only a month in Afghanistan, during which time he had no contact with any terrorists and never handled a weapon. He had decided the whole venture was pointless and wanted to return to Italy, via Pakistan. He was arrested by Pakistani forces in a town just across the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9fd3b03aab7efaf4a91d94eb72f1c35653a69b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9fd3b03aab7efaf4a91d94eb72f1c35653a69b5/0_260_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bin Ali wants to open a small restaurant selling Italian food some day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lufti bin Ali wants to open a small restaurant selling Italian food some day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Walker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that Bin Ali\u2019s portrayal of himself as a wheeler dealer and occasional petty criminal could be a cover, but little in the leaked Guant\u00e1namo documents seems to suggest any hard evidence against him, and he has never been brought before any kind of court to answer any charges. <br></p> <p>In his new life in Semey, he has almost no company except Sabri al-Qurashi, the Yemeni Guant\u00e1namo detainee. He has learned basic Russian but locals are afraid of talking to him. </p> <p>When he is in a good mood, he enjoys cooking, although he wishes he had more people to cook for. For a visiting Guardian journalist he cooked numerous imitations of Italian dishes, which were impressive given the limitations of locally available ingredients. </p> <p>\u201cCooking is my passion. I dream of cooking for 10 or 20 people. I want to open a small restaurant here, it would be wonderful. I\u2019d do Italian food, and Sabri could do the desserts, the cakes. But the local authorities said no. They don\u2019t want us to be visible.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he has busied himself with painting. He also wants to write a Guant\u00e1namo memoir, but he struggles to concentrate and has trouble using a computer due his poor vision, damaged during his stay in Gu\u00e1ntanamo. \u201cIt feels like there is a football match going on inside my head,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Often, he sits at home in the dark. His toes are mangled from years of walking barefoot on prison floors and being held in stress positions, and he walks with a pronounced limp. He cuts a forlorn, incongruous figure as he shuffles through the streets of Semey.</p> <p>Sometimes he thinks about putting on his orange suit, sealing his mouth with tape, and going into the main square to announce he is on hunger strike, until he receives a transfer somewhere else. He has decided against it though, on the basis that it would probably land him in a Kazakh jail, and he is not sure anyone would notice anyway.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I just wish I would be left alone.

  "<p>It is less than 18 months since Ed Balls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/ed-balls-labour-minister-memoir\">was one of the big beasts</a> of British politics. Yet how long ago that era seems when one reads his agonised account of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/08/election-2015-panel\">the May 2015 election </a>in his memoir, Speaking Out. As a Financial Times reviewer <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3241b5a4-800b-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4.html#axzz4LexXidV3\">pungently put it</a>, the Balls generation already \u201creeks of yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Labour lost last year, Balls writes, because it was not sufficiently trusted on the economy, and because Ed Miliband was not credible enough as a potential prime minister. This is what most politicians, as well as most political scientists, election analysts and commentators, myself included, believed at the time and believe now.</p> <p>Yet Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">spoke to the Labour party conference this week</a> as if such things simply did not matter to Labour any more. Buoyed by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/24/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-wins-landslide-victory-party\">emphatic re-election</a> and by the surge of activism in his party, he produced a 21st-century socialist wishlist of policies that flew in the face of the collective common sense of modern politics. Credible economic management? That\u2019s old thinking now. People want hope of change. Competent leadership? It\u2019s the message not the messenger that matters.</p> <p>Although Corbyn talked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyns-labour-conference-speech-video-highlights\">about the importance of elections</a>, it is abundantly clear that he wants nothing to do with winning on the centre ground in ways that earlier generations on left and right regarded as inescapable. Economic management and competent leadership were always the lodestars of that approach, though not the only tests of centre ground appeal. By these yardsticks, Labour lost in 2015 because the Tories were preferred as best party for the economy by an 18-point margin and because David Cameron was preferred to Miliband as prime minister by 17 points.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Corbyn does not want to be judged in the same way. How could he, when his ratings are so poor? The Tories remain 17 points ahead of Labour on the economy. Meanwhile Corbyn trails Theresa May by a<a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/88/Political-Monitor-Satisfaction-Ratings-1997Present.aspx\">n eye-watering 58 points</a> on net satisfaction. Labour may not be living in la-la land, as the Daily Mail claimed this week, but it is certainly engaged in an attempt to substitute a new political reality for the old one.</p> <p>The problem for Labour is that the centre ground hasn\u2019t gone away. When offered a choice of left, centre-left, centre, centre-right or right, 45% of all British voters in <a href=\"http://opinium.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dead-Centre-British-politics4_lr.pdf\">an Opinium survey</a> still regard themselves as being in the very centre of the political spectrum. A huge 77% of the British public see themselves either as centrists or centre-left or centre-right. Only 19% see Corbyn as being in the same territory, compared with 46% for Balls and 49% for Tony Blair.</p> <p>By contrast, May is seen as on or close to the centre ground by 44% of all voters. This is one reason why it might be unwise to fall into the fashionable trap of claiming that the centre-focused politics that stretched from the John Major era to that of Cameron is either phoney or finished.</p> <p>Labour has undoubtedly moved on. But those who think that May represents something equivalent on the Tory side of the aisle misread what is happening. The change in the Tory party since the summer is not a retreat from centrism. It may be better understood simply as a recasting, a less metropolitan liberal and more hard-edged version of centrism.</p> <p>May exhibits no sign whatever of being willing to leave the centre untended, as Corbyn does. Just because she has put some very rightwing people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/who-theresa-may-cabinet-boris-hammond-rudd\">in her cabinet</a>, or because she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-mays-schools-speech-a-divisive-blueprint\">reopened the question of selection in schools</a>, or because she is tasked with implementing Brexit, it does not follow that May is the mirror image of Corbyn.</p> <p>Next week\u2019s Conservative conference will be a test for her. She is adamant she is not abandoning the centre ground. But she does think that she is fashioning a more modern, more post-liberal, more Brexit-aware version of it.</p> <p>The centre is always mobile. Today we live in more economically fragile times than in the Blair years. Those who are \u201cjust managing\u201d, and who May has pledged to support, have a tougher time and fewer expectations than their equivalents a generation ago. Politics is viewed with more mistrust, seen as having failed to control widening inequality and unfairness. And immigration, real and imagined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/immigration-england-ons-migration-london-eu-referendum\">has hardened attitudes</a>.</p> <p>In any case, centrist politics was never as technocratic as its enemies pretend. In the 1960s, Harold Wilson did not just promote economic stewardship and effective leadership. He invoked flag and family, and cultivated an image of domestic, pipe-smoking ordinariness that was at odds with his well-hidden taste for cigars and brandy. In the present day, what is the SNP in Scotland but centrist government wrapped in a mastery of the symbolic and the rhetorical?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/jeremy-corbyn-critics-must-decide-unity-or-terminal-decline\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics must decide: unity or terminal decline | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Blair-Balls-Cameron generations were much less good at this. Blair in particular had a blind spot, which became a hostility, to the public\u2019s attachments and in particular to the public\u2019s fear of change. Though the public admired his competence as a domestic leader, they never bought into his embrace of change for change\u2019s sake, his love of the new and disruptive, his indifference to tradition.</p> <p>Though much has changed in the world, good management of the economy and competent leadership remain the essentials of any election-winning strategy. But a really smart centrist has to master the cultural as well as the technocratic, especially in tough economic times. Corbyn has some grasp of the former but possesses little or none of the latter. May, in her centre-right way, seems to have a much firmer sense of both \u2013 which is probably why she is winning.</p>",

were not benefiting from recent economic growth in Australia, with stagnating wages and fewer hours at work.</p> <p>The way to fix that, said Morrison, was to pursue a program for investment, trade

level of Chinese investment.</p> <p>\u201cThe agricultural land register firstly shows that 86.4% of all agricultural land in Australia is owned by Australians, and that of the 13.6% agricultural land owned by foreign interests, 84% of this interest is leasehold,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cChina accounts for just 3% of all foreign-owned agricultural land, while the Americans, British and Dutch

fees for foreign investors buying real estate, lowering the screening threshold for agricultural foreign investments from $252m to $15m, and putting a $55m threshold on investments in agribusiness.</p> <p>He also said Australians could not afford to turn their backs on world trade, and it was in Australia\u2019s interest to keep arguing for continued trade liberalisation to keep our markets open.</p> <p>He said Australia must keep accepting immigrants, too, because the immigration program had been the \u201cprime driver of population growth that has supported our economic

  "<p>Once upon a time politics was about pitching to the sensible centre, not preaching to the converted. Increasingly, it isn\u2019t. Increasingly, political conversation is conducted inside bubbles, and the bubbles don\u2019t intersect.<br></p> <p>The bubbles \u2013 little self-contained universes where protagonists feel their own feelings and choose their own facts \u2013 float rancorously past one another, never the twain. </p> <p>I was struck by the pervasiveness of bubble politics this week while watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\">the first head-to-head debate in the United States between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump</a>.

I kept listening in the hope I\u2019d hear it, that she would reach out and hook me and reel me in through the simple articulation of her moment in history. But there was no clear pitch \u2013 apart from I\u2019m not the lunatic.</p> <p>I get why the primary season in the US is about conversations in-house \u2013 obviously candidates are seeking the endorsement of their tribe \u2013 but once that\u2019s done I expected a kind of broadening. I\u2019d expected some kind of inclusive appeal to Trump supporters, given the white working-class vote should not be an entirely lost cause for the Democratic party, at least not post-global financial crisis.</p> <p>I\u2019d expected she would talk to them about the faux everyman they were thinking of backing for the White House, and she did, a little bit, but mainly she spoke to her supporters in staccato winks. The critique of Trump was genial and roundabout, as if we all got the joke, as if the target audience was the editorial board of the New York Times, not the people casting their votes in November who would never even think to buy a copy.</p> <p>She was passive in her orderliness. Clinton presented to the voting public with a modest kind of righteousness, as if that was the required benchmark, rather than brute, cut-through persuasiveness \u2013 a sanguine disposition which seemed premature, given the gruelling contest is only now entering the decisive phase.</p> <p>As for Trump, it was more of his shtick: he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">defiantly post-fact, post-ideology, post-coherence</a> \u2013 stroking his angry, alienated tribe, the people he has spent months courting and comforting with his authoritarian tendencies, framing himself as the last living saviour of the white working man of a certain age oppressed by globalisation, by mouthy women, by the \u201cother\u201d of the moment \u2013 Mexicans \u2013 by the Chinese.</p> <p>Trump has reeled his tribe in by pretending to understand them, by pretending to stand with them against the establishment cliche that is Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s his brand of self-satisfied righteousness, the cynically constructed comic strip that is \u201cDonald, professional underdog\u201d, a nonsense he delivers with brittle conviction, aided and abetted by the echo chamber on Fox News, a rolling cacophony of bobble heads high on imagined liberal conspiracy.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s central pitch was easier to identify, but he made absolutely no effort to engineer some kind of crossover conversation. There was no broadening his appeal, no toning it down, no presidential affect, no pitch to the swinging centre.</p> <p>An audience of millions erupted on social media in howls of acclamation and derision, like there was nothing more at stake than a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji. Feelings were brittle. Commentary was scornful and punishing, a mass study in confirmation bias.</p> <p>Increasingly, this is politics. Spectacle and sideshow, followed by a lurch into hell.</p> <p>Back at home, things are also grim. We seemed to have maxed out on exciting times. Our bubbles are floating, disconnected, across our political landscape. Post-election, you can feel the national discourse fracturing.</p> <p>There are eddies of culture war swirling.

There\u2019s a round of vigorous bubble bumping, amplified by the echo chamber of the 24/7 news cycle, and the starkly polarised commentariat, protagonists hector and declaim, no one explains and reasons. Meanwhile, the social fabric frays.</p> <p>It could be abstractly interesting if it wasn\u2019t dangerous, if manufactured polarisation for glib political gratification and clicks and eyeballs didn\u2019t have obvious human consequences.</p> <p>The antidote is humanism and generosity.

Tribalism, in his universe, was considered coarse. But bubble politics is grossly intolerant of protagonists who look to form durable connections outside the tribe. Empathy is somehow suspect. In bubble politics, totemic statements of reassurance to fellow travellers seem to be more highly prized than workaday pragmatism. There\u2019s a strange nihilism about the whole enterprise.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s trajectory has seen him placate his fellow bubble dwellers after he took the leadership as a gesture of good will \u2013 to send a message of inclusion. The early concessions damaged him. Now he\u2019s locked into a cycle of concessions to stay alive.

To be clear, I\u2019m not a bubble dweller. I find the hothouse conditions stifling. I don\u2019t require the prime minister to agree with me on any particular policy proposition. I harbour a modest hope that, periodically at least, he will agree with himself.</p> <p>I understand there is a more complex dynamic in play presently than a weakened prime minister performing a grim liturgical dance for the gratification of people with the power to move against him. At the broader strategic level, there is clearly an element of circling the wagons going on. Turnbull is trying to keep his fractious troops together when in practice the Coalition in 2016 is a conservative party with Hansonesque leanings and a centrist liberal party.</p> <p>Most days, in abundant ways, we see how hard it is to synthesise those differences. In attempting to rally and bind his troops, perhaps our individualist prime minister has become a tribalist, after all.</p> <p>Bubbles really can\u2019t be avoided in modern politics. Depressingly, it is the way of things. The prime minister has to develop the trick of subsistence in the bubble, but he also has to puncture it, forcefully when necessary, both to avoid slow suffocation and as a gesture of recognition \u2013 because outside the cloisters the Australian people are watching and hoping that someone in major party politics can rise above the aggressive insularity and the brinkmanship, give them the courtesy of a genuine conversation, and face up to the challenges of the moment.</p>",

But it is also a failure that goes back a quarter-century.

  "<p>The Australian habit of year-in-advance theatre programming may make it difficult for local playhouses to be politically responsive, but it sure is good for publicity schedules. </p> <p>When it comes to the major Australian stages, the launch season is half done \u2013 meaning those already planning what they\u2019ll see at a theatre next December have half their menu of options to choose from. </p> <p>This far out from actual performance dates, it\u2019s near-impossible to predict just what will turn out to be the unexpected masterpiece local audiences throng to see.

The play riffs on Irish playwright Dion Boucicault\u2019s 19th-century melodrama set in the antebellum Deep South, and follows the illicit love of a white man for a girl whose one-eighth African-American heritage is enough to ostracise her.</p> <p>Enormously popular in its day, Boucicault\u2019s text has been rewritten by Jacobs-Jenkins both as a comedy and a radical reappraisal of race representation in America. Black performers take to white roles with the assistance of \u201cwhiteface\u201d; a parade of racial stereotypes collapses in on itself \u2013 and at one point the playwright emerges from the darkness screaming. </p> <p>At only 31, Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019 ambition as a writer has been rewarded with an Obie, a Windham-Campbell award and a MacArthur Foundation Genius grant \u2013 he is one to watch now, if not to stare after into the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/australia-culture-blog/2014/jun/12/is-australian-theatre-racist\">Is Australian theatre racist?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Queensland Theatre production will star Miranda Tapsell and be directed by Nakkiah Lui \u2013 one of the brains and performers behind the ABC\u2019s cult sketch show Black Comedy.

It is a desperately shocking meditation on loneliness and the search for human connection, performed and narrated by Noble himself. Ostensibly a comedian, Noble won the coveted Perrier award for best newcomer at Edinburgh as one half of writing and performing duo Noble and Silver in 2000. His work has since outgrown the confines of comedy, while somehow remaining hilarious.</p> <p>In this production, Noble presents video, audio, photography and even internet screenshots that record his experimental encounters with strangers \u2013 including trying to seduce truck drivers with his fake internet persona \u201cSarah\u201d, recording his neighbours having sex, pretending to work at a hardware store, and stalking a man called Keith who works at the local grocer. Some of these are dangerously unethical engagements, and the show is confronting not only for what it exposes about Noble\u2019s lack of restraint, but how his own fierce loneliness pervades the communities he visits and inhabits. As tender as his consideration turns out to be, this is not a show for the easily troubled; if footage of a man shitting on a church floor upsets you, do not go.</p> <p><strong>Also worth watching: </strong>A new Declan Greene play <a href=\"http://malthousetheatre.com.au/whats-on/the-homosexuals-or-faggots\">The Homosexuals, or Faggots</a>; the second instalment of Tom Waits\u2019s Black Rider cycle, <a href=\"http://malthousetheatre.com.au/whats-on/the-black-rider-the-casting-of-the-magic-bullets\">The Casting of the Magic Bullets</a>, boasting a cast including Meow Meow and Paul Capsis; and <a href=\"http://malthousetheatre.com.au/whats-on/wild-bore\">Wild Bore</a>, a dissection of bad art, created and performed by the extraordinary comic trio of Adrienne Truscott, Ursula Martinez and Barry-winning Zoe Coombs Marr.</p> <h2>Melbourne Theatre Company \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/season-2017/minnie-and-liraz/\">Minnie and Liraz</a> by Lally Katz, director Anne-Louise Sarks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e99c0f66af43378abc105ac80f5beecf477a2ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e99c0f66af43378abc105ac80f5beecf477a2ae/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Minnie and Liraz, a new play from Australian playwright Lally Katz which premieres at MTC in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Minnie and Liraz, a new play from Australian playwright Lally Katz, premiering at Melbourne Theatre Company in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melbourne Theatre Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No all-caps in Melbourne Theatre Company\u2019s program; the pick of the season is a new play by local playwright Lally Katz, Minnie and Liraz. The dark quirkiness of Katz\u2019s earlier works created for Melbourne\u2019s fringe has bloomed through her years on the mainstage. She is a bright comic talent, no less affecting for being very funny, as plays such as the much-praised Neighbourhood Watch and Stories I\u2019d Like to Tell You in Person have shown.</p> <p>Her 2017 offering is a story about two competitive bridge-playing grandmothers. There\u2019s a story going round that the playwright was swamped in the MTC foyer after an early reading of the play by a small horde of the company\u2019s older patrons, keen to pitch in their bridge insights. Whatever their input, it has a cracker of a cast: comic talents Virginia Gay and John Leary play foils to the legendary Sue Jones and Nancye Hayes. As a new play, it\u2019s a ticket purchased on trust, but this is Katz in her element, writing for a home crowd. It\u2019s hard not to believe that the audience who applauded the playwright for waltzing with a bear at the Malthouse in 2013 will be anything less than engaged with her new material.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/03/i-was-commissioned-to-write-a-play-about-finance-then-i-met-cookie-the-psychic\">I was commissioned to write a play about finance.

He encountered stories he found both uplifting and heartbreaking, and these stories permeate a show that is laugh-out-loud funny and enraging at the same time. </p> <p>Ballard developed Boundless Plains to Share under the guidance and direction of Scott Edgar \u2013 more commonly known as Scod from Tripod \u2013 who had been helping the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre for many years. It\u2019s a good theatrical match, avoiding both mawkishness and over-earnestness in its presentation of the kinds of stories often emotively retold by the well meaning \u2013 and sometimes compromised as a result. </p> <p>Ballard\u2019s show was made possible by <a href=\"http://www.mooseheadawards.com.au/cms-about\">a Moosehead award</a> \u2013 it allowed him to pursue something close to his heart without anxiety about commercial returns.

Set in a 1980s Wollongong reeling from industrial devastation, the story follows the aspirational Barbara, colour-matching herself into an imagined future as she seeks a job at one of the city\u2019s new resorts, and her partner Den, who has just lost his blue-collar job and doesn\u2019t know what to do with himself. </p> <p>This play often finds its way onto high-school reading lists, but hasn\u2019t been given a serious revival in over a decade. Griffin\u2019s decision to restage it now is a shrewd one, given that its themes of unemployment and uncertain futures in regional Australia have re-emerged in the public political conversation. Ursula Yovich will play Barbara, with Darren Yap directing.</p> <p><strong>Also worth watching:</strong> Ross Mueller\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.griffintheatre.com.au/whats-on/a-strategic-plan/\">A Strategic Plan</a> takes on the language of workplace relations; and Morgan Rose\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.griffintheatre.com.au/whats-on/virgins-cowboys/\">Virgins and Cowboys</a>, from Griffin\u2019s independent season, is vulgar and funny.</p> <h2>State Theatre Company of South Australia \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.statetheatrecompany.com.au/home/whatson/shows2017/mrburns/\">Mr Burns (A Post-Electric Play)</a> by Anne Washburn, director Imara Savage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7622cddf140ff881ad763b91e301c8ebc4637f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7622cddf140ff881ad763b91e301c8ebc4637f5c/0_1209_3840_4170/921.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell Butel will star in STCSA\u2019s 2017 production of Anne Washburn\u2019s Mr Burns (A Post-Electric Play)\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Butel will star in STCSA\u2019s 2017 production of Anne Washburn\u2019s Mr Burns (A Post-Electric Play).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most intriguing proposition of the STCSA season is Mr Burns (A Post-Electric Play) \u2013 a 2012 work by American Anne Washburn that imagines a post-apocalyptic future in which plotlines from the Simpsons are retold as folk tales over generations of a struggling new society.</p> <p>Washburn\u2019s fascination with pop culture narratives becoming oral artefacts was the reason she gathered a group of actors in a disused bank vault under New York\u2019s Wall Street back in 2008 and asked them to see how much of any episode of The Simpsons they could remember. Washburn made recordings of these sessions, which informed the initial drafts of the play.</p> <p>A powerful anticapitalist message emerged through this process \u2013 a message that may have been very different if the playwright had chosen to instead pursue her other ideas for narrative exploration: episodes of Friends, M*A*S*H or Cheers. Whether the controversial text divides audiences in Australia as much as it did in America will be interesting to see (it is a coproduction with Belvoir and will travel to Sydney after its Adelaide season). That its promotional image is this year\u2019s creepiest, however, is undeniable.</p> <p><strong>Also worth watching:</strong> The extraordinary Sandy Gore plays shadowy novelist Patricia Highsmith in Joanna Murray-Smith\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.statetheatrecompany.com.au/home/whatson/shows2017/switzerland/\">Switzerland</a>; and local playwright Nicki Bloom has fun with New Year\u2019s Eve in <a href=\"http://www.statetheatrecompany.com.au/home/whatson/shows2017/vale/\">Vale</a>.</p> <h2>Sydney Theatre Company \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2017/away\">Away</a> by Michael Gow, director Matthew Lutton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e628fcc0e600af42b00d2729f827b6b9b5834ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e628fcc0e600af42b00d2729f827b6b9b5834ed/0_0_3543_3614/980.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Mitchell in Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s 2017 production of Away\" width=\"980\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heather Mitchell will perform in Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s 2017 production of Away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another revival piques the interest at STC, as the company restages Michael Gow\u2019s 1986 play Away \u2013 another stock selection for syllabi, one which makes frequent appearances on the mainstages, and is similarly beloved of the amateur circuit. </p> <p>It\u2019s endured because it\u2019s good: three Australian families of different classes and experiences find themselves grappling with change as Australia grasps at mature nationhood amid the social upheavals of the 60s and the shadow of the Vietnam war. What distinguishes this STC production from the many others that have taken place since the play\u2019s debut is its director, Matthew Lutton, also the artistic director of Malthouse Theatre, whose Picnic at Hanging Rock was one of the best productions of 2016. </p> <p>This is a rare chance for an Australian audience to see a familiar local play exposed to the rigours of a radical reinterpretation. How will Lutton\u2019s gothic sensibilities and directorial palette of darkness treat a text accustomed to more summery interpretations? Among seasons heavy with diverse stories, performance styles, origins and interpretations, allowing someone like Lutton to get his hands on Away may just be the symbolic gesture history requires to acknowledge Australian theatre is all grown-up.</p> <p><strong>Also worth watching: </strong>Nakkiah Lui has her own show, <a href=\"https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2017/black-is-the-new-white\">Black is the New White</a>; Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2017/the-testament-of-mary\">The Testament of Mary</a> is worth seeing for its star, the ever-electric Alison Whyte; and <a href=\"https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2017/australian-graffiti\">Australian Graffiti</a>, which considers the contemporary migrant experience, by Disapol Savetsila \u2013 still merely an undergraduate at the University of Wollongong.
