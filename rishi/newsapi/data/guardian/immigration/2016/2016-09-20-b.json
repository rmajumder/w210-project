  "<p>Social services for older and disabled people face crisis because post-Brexit migration restrictions could cause a massive shortage of care workers, leading care organisations have said.</p> <p>The 1.4-million-strong UK care sector\u2019s reliance on European migrant workers means it is vital they are given the right to remain in any future migration arrangements, the charities <a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/\">Independent Age</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ilcuk.org.uk/\">International Longevity Centre UK</a> (ILC-UK) said.</p> <p>Currently about 84,000 care workers \u2013 equivalent to one in 20 of England\u2019s growing care workforce \u2013 are from European Economic Area countries. About 90% do not have British citizenship and their future immigration status remains uncertain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/leaving-eu-autistic-son-brexit-britain-european-union\">Leaving the EU would be disastrous for my autistic son and thousands like him | Virginia Bovell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charities said failure to tackle workforce shortages would mean thousands of older people would lose out on support, meaning they could be left housebound, struggle to recover properly from a stroke or fall, or fail to get assistance in getting up and dressed in the morning.</p> <p>Simon Bottery, the director of policy at Independent Age, said: \u201cCare services for elderly and disabled people have come to rely on migrant workers, especially from the European Union, so the consequences could be severe if they are unable to work here in future.\u201d </p> <p>The UK has become increasingly dependent on a European migrant workforce to provide services for its ageing population since 2012, when the coalition government changed immigration rules, making it more difficult for non-EEA people to enter the UK to work in social care.</p> <p>According to modelling by the charities, a scenario which closed off all migration would leave Britain with a social care workforce shortfall of more than a million by 2037. In a low-migration scenario this would still mean a 750,000 shortfall. Even under a high-migration scenario, the care sector would still face a workforce shortage of 350,000 because of the likely dramatic increase in the population needing care, the charities said.</p> <p>London and the south-east would be worst hit by a post-Brexit shortage of care workers, with one in nine of the capital\u2019s care workers at risk of losing their right to work in the UK.</p> <p>Staff turnover and vacancy rates have risen sharply in the last decade, triggering fears that the safety and quality of social care would be affected. Ben Franklin, ILC-UK\u2019s head of economics of ageing, said that as Britain\u2019s population grew older, thousands more care workers were needed. \u201cA continual failure to support and enhance the care workforce could result in thousands of frail and older people losing out on the proper care and support that they need.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://www.adass.org.uk/home/\">Association of Directors of Adult Social Services</a> said: \u201cEvery minute of every day, millions of people are receiving a service from adult social care thanks to the contribution of staff from all over the world \u2013 from the UK, the EU and further afield. The loss of any of this valuable workforce, in a sector already under pressure from increased demand and staffing challenges, would have a profound effect, and we will seek to take part in any relevant discussions to convey our support for EU workers currently working in our adult social care system.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s important to remind any non-British EU workers, and those whose care is provided by them, that nothing will change for some time: until new laws are passed by the government, the rights of all EU citizens to live and work in the UK will not change. Until then, we will be working to improve recruitment, training and staff retention in the social care sector to make sure it\u2019s ready for any challenges that come in the future.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been clear that she wants to protect the status of EU nationals already living here, and the only circumstances in which that wouldn\u2019t be possible is if British citizens\u2019 rights in European member states were not protected in return.\u201d</p>",

According to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, of those we recognised, registered or resettled \u2013 considered the truest way of determining generosity to refugees \u2013 Australia was ranked 25th overall, 32nd per capita and 47th<sup> </sup>compared to our GDP. Those we take compared to the total refuges under the UNHCR mandate puts us 81st in the world on a GDP basis \u2013 hardly something of which we can be proud.\u201d</p> <p>Minns said for Australia to boast of its performance in the face of an unprecedented global refugee crisis was embarrassing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/20/peter-dutton-says-getting-women-and-children-off-nauru-is-first-priority\">Peter Dutton says getting women and children off Nauru is 'first priority'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAustralia took fewer than 12,000 in 2015 while a much poorer country such as Turkey has over two and a half million, Pakistan has around one and a half million and Lebanon and Iran have around one million each.\u201d</p> <p>Save the Children\u2019s chief executive, Paul Ronalds, welcomed Turnbull\u2019s announcement of a funding boost in Australia\u2019s assistance for refugees in other countries but said the prime minister had failed to back this up with a meaningful increase in the refugee resettlement intake.</p> <p>\u201cClaiming that the maintenance of Australia\u2019s already stated humanitarian intake for 2018-19 of 18,750 places into future years is some kind of significant pledge to help the international community deal with the global refugee crisis is disingenuous,\u201d Ronalds said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we welcome any additional financial contribution by Australia towards helping children and adults forced to flee their homes from conflict and persecution, the $130m announced by the prime minister pales in comparison to the $9.6bn the Australian government has spent since 2013 maintaining its damaging and isolationist \u2018deterrence-based\u2019 asylum seeker policy.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>A coalition of more than 30 countries has unveiled a series of concrete responses to the refugee crisis, giving a glimmer of hope during a week in which world leaders gathered at the UN summit in New York have otherwise failed to offer direct action on refugee issues.</p> <p>Barack Obama announced that the US-led coalition had collectively agreed to roughly double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children, and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults.</p> <p>Full details were not disclosed, but the move constituted the most concrete set of refugee measures at the UN general assembly. On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\">a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 existing responsibilities for refugees</a>, but offered little in terms of direct commitments.</p> <p>But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access for refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/it-took-on-a-life-of-its-own-how-rogue-tweet-led-syrians-to-germany\">'It took on a life of its own': how one rogue tweet led Syrians to Germany</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, that are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. </p> <p>Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d </p> <p>But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations praised the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out. Most pledges made at a similar summit in London in February have not been fulfilled.</p> <p>\u201cThe refugee crisis requires not just [pledged] commitment but follow-through,\u201d said King Abdullah of Jordan, a country that hosts more Syrian refugees than all the countries in the EU, whose population is 50 times bigger.</p> <p>The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include measures announced earlier this year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. </p> <p>\u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, a US assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme. It could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d</p> <p>The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work. </p> <p>According to US officials, other labour-related policies included those that simply allow refugees to live outside camps, or give them access to agricultural land.</p> <p>Refugee specialists who had criticised the vague UN-led declaration on Monday were cautiously optimistic about Tuesday\u2019s US-led announcements.</p> <p>David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, a major refugee agency, said: \u201cThe political inertia has finally been broken and now it needs to be turned into genuine momentum through effective implementation of each pledge.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander Betts, head of Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre, said: \u201cFor people who are thinking that the achievement of [the UN-led declaration on Monday] was a fairly abstract declaration, [Obama\u2019s summit on Tuesday] is about something more specific. It\u2019s about pledges, it\u2019s about real commitment, it\u2019s about money and resettlement. But the question that remains is about what kinds of pledges will be made and followed through on.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Implementation is also a concern for the US, Richard admitted. \u201cFor me the much harder piece is follow-up,\u201d said Richard. \u201cThe countries that make commitments \u2013 do they mean it, and will they follow through? Usually an administration would spend the next year making sure these countries follow up \u2013 but the Obama administration is going to leave office at the end of January.\u201d</p> <p>More generally, Betts, the Oxford professor, questioned whether even the US-led initiative had gone far enough. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/obama-refugees-un-general-assembly\">'We have a moral obligation': advocates look to Obama as refugee crisis wears on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a time of profound need, world leaders had squandered a chance to radically rethink the treaties and organisations that govern the world\u2019s handling of refugees, Betts said, arguing that the refugee system needed to be rethought in the same way that the international monetary system was reworked in the 1970s. </p> <p>\u201cThe refugee regime was created in the 1950s for Europe and the early cold war era,\u201d said Betts. \u201cYes, it\u2019s been adapted incrementally, but we\u2019ve never had a moment of systematic reflection.\u201d </p> <p>Betts added: \u201cIn other areas, like the international monetary system, when there was a big crisis as we saw in 1971, reform took place. 2016 should be the refugee system\u2019s 1971. It should involve reflection on our legal model, our organisational model, and our operational model \u2013 and that\u2019s what the political capital that we\u2019ve invested in these two days should have gone towards. But as it is, I think there are achievements, but I\u2019m not sure these achievements reach the level of ambition that the international community should have had in response to the refugee crisis.\u201d</p>",

The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. </p> <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:45:31.822Z\">at 10.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a41fe4b05714d0da2cba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-kingsley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:27:07.903Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More from Patrick Kingsley from the leaders\u2019 summit on refugees:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include any policy announced since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, the US\u2019s assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work.

On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments.</p> <p>But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work.</p> <p>The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations hailed the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out. Most pledges made at a similar summit in London in February have not been fulfilled.</p> <p>\u201cThe refugee crisis requires not just [pledged] commitment but follow-through,\u201d said King Abdullah of Jordan, a country that hosts more Syrian refugees than all the countries in the EU, which has a population that is 50 times bigger.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a179e4b02abd56c3f80d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T20:58:26.377Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Miliband is at the refugees\u2019 summit:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DMiliband/status/778318518232158208\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Refugees are....Olympians.

Then they have a base from which to go. They have a welcome, rather than having refugees come in uninvited or illegally or alone.\u201d</p> <p>Australia launched a pilot of the program in 2013 and a similar initiative is being planned in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Germany and Switzerland have both experimented with the idea while Spain and Japan are among the countries who have expressed interest in the program.</p> <p>Canada will now work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations to create training modules based on an analysis of the Canadian model as well as provide technical assistance to countries interested in adopting the program, said McCallum. </p> <p>Private sponsorship was launched in Canada after the Vietnam war and has since brought in more than 275,000 refugees, including nearly 9,000 Syrian refugees, in addition to those brought in by government programs. Studies suggest the support of private citizens facilitates the settlement process, with privately-sponsored refugees reporting more success and integration than their government-sponsored counterparts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16d41e4b05714d0da2b89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:13:39.006Z\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting spot on Twitter by the New York Times\u2019 UN correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SominiSengupta\">Somini Sengupta</a>: the Russian foreign ministry tweeted that, held up by US president Obama\u2019s motorcade, <strong>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov got out and walked the rest of the way to the General Assembly</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Manhattan traffic was blocked because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> motorcade. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lavrov?src=hash\">#Lavrov</a> decided not to wait in traffic jam &amp; headed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN\">@UN</a> by walking <a href=\"https://t.co/L4XVBsvU1d\">pic.twitter.com/L4XVBsvU1d</a></p>&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16a5ae4b05714d0da2b7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:02:11.067Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hollande continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No county can say that it is immune to the threat of Islamic terrorism, which has claimed lost individuals within our countries and radicalised them. </p> <p>No wall can stop ... this scourge.

  "<p>I am a Syrian refugee who was forced to leave my country. It was discovered that I had created an underground network to provide medical aid and supplies to the sick and wounded. The regime had ruled that what I was doing was against the law, so I fled. I took whatever I could fit in a rolling suitcase and nothing more. I now live in the greatest country in the world, and have just become a US citizen.<br></p> <p>In the past year, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/syrian-refugees-admitted-united-states\">10,000 Syrian refugees</a>, like me, found refuge in the US. However, there are those who are portraying this great humanitarian deed as a bad thing. They are calling for the United States to shut its doors to Syrians, who are fleeing unspeakable horrors of war and acts of daily terror. Those who would turn their backs on these innocent, desperate victims use scare tactics to gain support. </p> <p>The latest one was an ad by the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">comparing Syrian refugees</a> to poisonous candy, Skittles, in this case, but it\u2019s not the first time the analogy has been used. Last year, another reference was made to poisonous peanuts. Of course, the aim is to spread fear, with the ultimate goal of shutting our doors to those who need us most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/obama-refugees-increase-proposal-us-capable-resettling\">Ignore the naysayers. America can handle 110,000 more refugees | Aryeh Neier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turning away those fleeing war would mean disregarding the very values that made America the richest, most powerful nation in the world. We should be more afraid of losing our honor and virtue, than of helping these refugees, 80% of whom are women and children. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\">Alan Kurdi</a>, who washed up on the shores of Turkey trying to make it to safety? He was a toddler; someone\u2019s beloved child. Not a Skittle.</p> <p>While scare tactics can be effective, the greater good always is served by the facts. Of the more than 750,000 refugees that have been admitted to the US since 9/11, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">just three</a> have been arrested in relation to planning terrorist activities. None have been Syrian. </p> <p>According to the latest Cato Institute study, the chance of an American being killed by a refugee is 1 in 3.6 billion. The likelihood of being murdered by a non-terrorist was 1 in 14,275. Should we suspect our neighbors since they are in the \u201cmore likely\u201d group?</p> <p>I should be angry and outraged by the hateful things that are said about Syrians, but since coming to the US, I began educating myself about the immigrants and refugees who have found safety in this great land. I realize that our welcome of the weak and vulnerable has not come without name-calling and labels.</p> <p>One of my learning experiences took me to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, where I discovered the WWII story of the St Louis, the ship carrying German Jews who were permitted to leave Germany and denied entry to, among other countries, the US. It was feared they might be \u201cGerman spies\u201d or \u201ccommunists\u201d. They ultimately had to return to Europe where many of them perished in the Holocaust. </p> <p>The stains on our history don\u2019t end there, unfortunately. Most of the immigrant groups who resettled in the US experienced xenophobia as a result of their ethnicity. And that says nothing about our treatment of African Americans and the Native Americans who inhabited this country before we all arrived. </p> <p>It is critical to remember that in this Great Melting Pot of America \u2013 so called because we are a nation of immigrants \u2013 the chances are that when your family members arrived, they were targeted in the same way that Syrian refugees are today. </p> <p>It may help to be reminded that the Syrians who have lived among you for generations are famous actors, innovators, business leaders, army personnel and veterans. There are thousands of physicians living and working here, saving hundreds of lives every day. They are ordinary hard-working men and women who make important contributions to our economy and our culture.</p> <p>Let us not fear the stranger because of where they came from or what their religion is, but be brave and courageous and honorable to accept the weak to our shores. We are the land of the free and the home of the brave. We stand up to evil. We do not stay silent.</p>",
  "<p>More than \u00a3100m of the UK aid budget will be spent on returning Somali refugees to the country they fled and encouraging people escaping war zones not to cross the Mediterranean under plans outlined by Theresa May in New York.</p> <p>The prime minister used her maiden speech at the United Nations to expand on proposals aimed at stopping \u201cmass uncontrolled population movement\u201d, which has seen refugees travelling long distances in search of better lives. Her plans attracted criticism earlier in the summit over the suggestion that those fleeing war zones should stay and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than seeking sanctuary in European nations such as Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/20/one-in-every-113-people-uprooted-war-persecution-says-un-refugee-agency\">One in every 113 people forced to flee, says UN refugee agency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, May pressed on with the argument on Tuesday in an address to the general assembly, as she focused on actions in north Africa to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean.</p> <p>In her speech, May said Britain would send more troops to Somalia to help train local troops to combat the al-Shabaab militant group, including up to 30 teams of between five and 30 personnel with no more than 70 in the country at any one time.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>While acknowledging Somalia is facing serious security problems, the government is also contributing \u00a320m from the aid budget to encourage refugees who fled the country to return home from the Dadaab camp in Kenya.</p> <p>\u201cWe will invest \u00a316m in Somalia to help do things around food, education, shelter and sustainable livelihoods and then \u00a34m to Kenya to help support the process of returning these people,\u201d a UK official said.</p> <p>The process has recently been criticised by the Human Rights Watch group, which said the return of the refugees from Kenya to Somalia cannot be considered voluntary as the Dadaab camp is at risk of being shut down. The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by the US president, Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/19/raped-imprisoned-beaten-migrants-reveal-perilous-journeys-europe-united-nations-general-assembly\">Raped, imprisoned, beaten: migrants reveal their perilous journeys to Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try to encourage refugees to settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between January and September this year, 12% were Eritrean \u2013 second only to Nigerians who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need, which is an increase of 10% on the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking before the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK.<br><br></p>",

  "<p>The UK\u2019s new anti-slavery commissioner has warned that the slow pace of Britain\u2019s efforts to give sanctuary to unaccompanied child refugees in Calais is exposing them to the risk of modern slavery and exploitation only 24 hours after the prime minister launched her international campaign to tackle the menace.</p> <p>Kevin Hyland, who was appointed by Theresa May to the \u201ccritical role\u201d, wrote this week to Amber Rudd, after visiting Calais this summer. He highlighted May\u2019s personal commitment to tackling modern slavery and said not enough was being done to protect vulnerable young children living in \u201cunsuitable and unsafe\u201d conditions in the camp.</p> <p>He said that young women, particularly from the Horn of Africa, are being forced into prostitution in the Calais camp\u2019s \u201cnightclubs\u201d to pay people smugglers for the next leg of their journey. Other young women have testified that they have also had to perform sexual services to pay the traffickers.</p> <p>Hyland also cited evidence that boys from Afghanistan are made by older men in the camp to perform \u201cbacha bazi\u201d, which involves dancing and sexual exploitation, and warned that young people generally are being forced into criminal activity in Calais.</p> <p>The lack of urgency in the UK response to the crisis meant that even those children with a legal right to be reunited with family in Britain no longer had any confidence in the system, and were choosing instead to risk their lives trying to smuggle themselves on trucks to get to the UK.<br></p> <p>The resulting frustration meant \u201cunfortunately migrants had more trust in smugglers than in state-led procedures that exist to ensure their protection\u201d leading to \u201crisk-taking behaviour, which leads to higher exposure to modern slavery and exploitation\u201d and other multiple dangers, he wrote. <br></p> <p>The warning from Hyland, who has been described by the prime minister as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/30/we-will-lead-the-way-in-defeating-modern-slavery/\">critical in our fight to stop criminal gangs exploiting innocent men, women and children</a>\u201d, that children are at risk comes just 24 hours after May appealed to world leaders at the United Nations on Monday night to join her crusade against modern slavery.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/afghan-boy-killed-in-calais-in-attempt-to-climb-on-to-lorry-to-uk\">a 14-year-old boy from Afghanistan who died</a> near the port last week after falling from a truck was named on Tuesday as Raheemullah Oryakhel. He was the third \u00adrefugee child to die in the Calais area this year.<br></p> <p>A spokeswoman for Unicef UK said: \u201cIf our government had acted more quickly, Raheemullah Oryakhel could be alive and with his family today. He had a legal right to be in the UK and his brother had a bedroom here waiting for him. </p> <p>\u201cThis tragedy must now lead to action. The UK must work with the French authorities to get children into appropriate accommodation, where they can have access to care and legal support so they can reach their families safely.\u201d</p> <p>Hyland, who was appointed as an independent anti-slavery commissioner after the Modern Slavery Act was passed last year, expressed concern that UK officials were not effectively identifying or registering vulnerable children in Calais. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that these children are left in the camp at the disposal of the criminal networks and they continue risking their lives daily to reach the shores of the UK,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot enough is being done to address the vulnerabilities of migrants, in particular unaccompanied children.\u201d</p> <p>A census carried out by the charity <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\">Help Refugees</a> estimated this week that the camp population has increased to over 10,000 for the first time, a 12% increase on last month, with 1,179 minors, of whom 87% are travelling alone.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister has described modern slavery as the great human rights issue of our time,\u201d Hyland wrote. \u201cA more proactive and urgent response is needed to ensure criminal networks are disrupted and vulnerable migrants, in particular unaccompanied children, are better protected.\u201d<br></p> <p>He criticised worsening conditions in the camp, which he described as \u201cunsuitable and unsafe, particularly for women and children\u201d, with hundreds of unaccompanied children sleeping in overcrowded tents, which puts them at \u201cvery high risk of abuse, violence and exploitation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese children have fled violence, poverty and conflict. To reach Calais they have had to travel on long and perilous journeys only to find that their suffering is not yet over. They are faced with the severe and dangerous realities of living in Calais and try every single night to cross the English Channel, even though the risk of being caught and returned to the camp, or even the risk of serious injury or death, is very high.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was vital to \u201cproactively identify unaccompanied children and safeguard them from existing risks\u201d to ensure they are \u201cprotected from any further abuse and exploitation\u201d. </p> <p>The French government has made a commitment to close the camp before the end of the year, but Hyland warned that a rapid eviction \u201cwill result in many more children being pushed into the hands of traffickers and smugglers as a result of desperation and a sense of urgency to leave the camp\u201d.</p> <p>If the eviction is to go ahead it it crucial that safe accommodation for unaccompanied children should be provided first, he wrote. </p> <p>He called on the government to provide more funding, and staff to travel to Calais to \u201cquickly identify eligible children\u201d who had a right to come to the UK legally under family reunification rules or under the so-called Dubs amendment of the Immigration Act, under which the UK government committed to give homes to some vulnerable unaccompanied refugee children. </p> <p>\u201cChildren are not waiting. Every night they go to their smugglers who have promised to get them across the Channel ... However, every night each of these children are at risk of exploitation and sadly even dying as they take huge risks to reach the UK,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>He was also critical of a French charity, France Terre d\u2019Asile, which received over \u00a3500,000 from the UK government to identify victims of trafficking in the area, pointing out that they had failed to recruit enough interpreters, which \u201cresulted in failure to establish a direct rapport and trust with the migrant community\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is very little confidence in asylum-seeking procedures in France,\u201d he said, which was also pushing children to risk their lives to get to the UK.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said the department would respond to the commissioner\u2019s recommendations in full in due course but stressed the government\u2019s priority was to offer humanitarian support to those most in need and to work closely with the French government to protect those vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are dedicated to ensuring that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay. Over 120 cases of unaccompanied children in Europe have been accepted for transfer to the UK under the Dublin regulation since the start of the year and we want to build on this progress,\u201d they added.</p>",

Tory liberals will not defy their new leader on EU matters before suspicion that she despises them is confirmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4641aaa596bd3504f4c7a8190aa857cd5a314303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4641aaa596bd3504f4c7a8190aa857cd5a314303/0_265_5492_3296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Farron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Farron\u2019s uncomplicated position is a poll-rating defibrillator, an emergency device to restore a pulse, not a long-term remedy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all remain voters are rigid with terror at the prospect of Brexit, desperate for politicians to stand up and scream \u201cno\u201d, but that constituency has the numbers to lift the Lib Dems back into third-party contention, back into the game. Farron\u2019s uncomplicated position \u2013 against leaving the EU, for returning if we leave \u2013 is a poll-rating defibrillator, an emergency device to restore a pulse, not a long-term remedy.</p> <p>Farron also has to listen to his members. Thousands joined after the referendum, and not because they were relaxed about the outcome. This is a party whose activists drape a giant blue and gold EU flag across the dancefloor at their conference disco. Debate on a second plebscite aired doubts, but defiance was the theme. Didn\u2019t Nigel Farage say that if the result were close, there should be a rerun? Wasn\u2019t the leave proposition criminally mis-sold \u2013 fictional millions for the NHS; imminent Turkish invasion? Don\u2019t lies invalidate the mandate?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To Europe\u2019s radical right, 23 June was an inspiration \u2013 an incitement to slash harder at the ties of solidarity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If remain had won, the leavers would indeed have cried establishment stitch-up and demanded a rematch, cribbing their strategy from Scottish nationalists who wasted no time moulding their defeat on independence into new grievance, stretching a 45% minority into a moral majority. Many Brexiters were hoping for an electoral martyrdom along those lines. They pace nervily around their unexpected trophy, which turns out to be tarnished with a duty to deliver the impossible.But in Scotland, it was the status quo (or a close variant) that won. It was easy to present the result as a stage in the spread of nationalist consciousness, with contagion to the rest of the country just a matter of time. In the vote on Britain\u2019s EU membership, the status quo was sentenced to death. Even if it could be shown that millions of leave voters were wracked with buyers\u2019 remorse (it can\u2019t), the union they might rejoin will never be the one they asked to quit.</p> <p>The referendum is already altering Europe\u2019s political geometry. The shock of British rejection is changing debates around integration and immigration. Next spring, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nation-state-marine-le-pen-global-mood-france-brexit-trump-front-national\">almost certainly make it into the final round</a> of a French presidential election.

Nationalist and populist movements are thriving across Europe. Governments in Poland and Hungary are developing anti-liberal doctrines on a model borrowed from Vladimir Putin. To Europe\u2019s radical right, 23 June was a provocation and an inspiration \u2013 an incitement to slash harder at the ties of continental solidarity. The idea that moderate leaders in Paris or Berlin will sit with their engines idling while Britain ponders whether to join the convoy and at what speed is delusional.</p> <p>No one is more in denial about this than the Tory Brexiteers who skim over the detail of their mission as if leafing through the brochure for a pleasure cruise around the Commonwealthtoasting free trade deals on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-buckle-up-a-nasty-divorce-looks-inevitable\">recommissioned Britannia</a>. They treat practical questions about their agenda and concern that their campaign fuelled xenophobic fires as the sore losers\u2019 whinge.</p> <p>In truth, they are sore winners. Many resent the burden of political maturity that comes with getting their way. They keep in their pockets the card showing May\u2019s quiet support for remain, ready to play it with a flourish when her first compromise with reality can be cast as betrayal. But it is hard for pro-Europeans to denounce that game while drenched in nostalgia, when the argument sounds like a plan to build a time-machine and return to the late 90s, back to the days when Brussels-phobia was but a yolk-stain on the tie of unelectable Tory reaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/20/brexit-weekly-briefing-buckle-up-a-nasty-divorce-looks-inevitable\">Brexit weekly briefing: buckle up \u2013 a nasty divorce looks inevitable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lib Dems insist that their position is more nuanced than that, but nuance hasn\u2019t exactly been flying off the shelves in the retail end of British politics recently. A position that lends itself to caricature as contempt for the will of the people will be cast that way.</p> <p>Britain needs a liberal promise of engagement with Europe that absorbs the result of the referendum, and European liberals need British partners who will engage with their dilemmas on post-referendum terms. I understand why Farron is not ready to plunge his party into that mission without first underlining its anti-Brexit credentials. The Lib Dems are enfeebled, trying to build polling bulk. Undiluted remania is the only available political protein. Building a platform from which pro-Europeans can launch a bid to shape the future \u2013one to rival the flimsy, retrograde prospectus of the militant sceptics is not a task that a shrunken liberal party can easily undertake alone. Sadly, as things stand, they have no choice but to try.</p>",
  "<p>Warm weather and Team GB\u2019s success at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016\">Olympics and Paralympics</a> boosted supermarket sales over the past three months, as Britons in celebratory mood splashed out on alcohol. </p> <p>Supermarket sales rose 0.3% over the 12 weeks to 11 September, with a particular lift from alcohol sales over the final month of the period, up 8.5% according to Kantar Worldpanel. </p> <p>Prosecco and Champagne were the most popular tipples, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 36% over the shorter four-week period.</p> <p>But Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at the market analysis firm, said strong drinks sales masked a weaker picture overall. </p> <p>\u201cWhile overall sales growth has been slow, consumers have been keen to celebrate Britain\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic golden summer ... as promotional events across a number of retailers successfully tapped into the nation\u2019s celebratory mood.\u201d</p> <p>A breakdown of figures for the major supermarkets showed that Aldi and Lidl continued to outperform their peers. Sales rose 11.6% and 9.5% respectively at the two discount chains over the three months, compared with the same period a year earlier.</p> <p>\u201cAldi and Lidl continue to grow \u2013 not only are both continuing to expand their store estates but existing customers are visiting more frequently and upping their basket size,\u201d McKevitt said.</p> <p>\u201cThe discounters are helping drive the industry-wide growth in premium own-label lines, with marketing campaigns moving away from showcasing only price to a focus on quality.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> sales fell 0.2%, but it was the retailer\u2019s best 12-week performance in two years, again boosted by alcohol sales. Its share of the market edged down 0.1 percentage points to 28.1%, but it remained considerably ahead of its next biggest rival, Sainsbury\u2019s, which had a 15.9% share.</p> <p>Tesco was the best performer among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets, which includes Sainsburys, Asda and Morrisons.</p> <p>At Waitrose, a 3.4% increase in sales over the three months boosted its share of the grocery market to a record high of 5.3%, following a promotional push.</p> <p>McKevitt said: \u201cIt\u2019s half-price event boosted performance across much of the store \u2013 particularly in household and alcohol. However, the increase in sales has come at a cost, with Waitrose\u2019s proportion of promotional sales reaching a higher level than some of the traditionally more promotion-focused big four retailers.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/financials/weekly-figures/latest.html\">Weekly sales figures published separately by Waitrose\u2019s parent group, John Lewis Partnership,</a> showed sales at the supermarket were 3.7% higher in the week ending 17 September, compared with a year earlier, hitting \u00a3125m.</p> <p>The increase was driven by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/13/uks-hottest-september-day-since-1949-32c-heathrow\">unusually warm September weather</a>, which caused sales of ice-cream and barbecue food to spike.</p> <p>Ben Stimson, the retail director at Waitrose, said: \u201cThe weather during a week in which the UK\u2019s warmest September day since 1911 was recorded helped drive a good performance last week before the sunshine turned to downpours.</p> <p>\u201cIce-cream sales were up almost 43%, barbecue sales were up by 100% and service counter meat sales up by 32%.\u201d</p> <p>Salads and sushi were also popular last week.</p> <p>Sales at John Lewis over the week grew by 0.9% to \u00a379m. Sales of electricals and home technology increased by 9.9% compared with a year earlier, boosted by the release of the iPhone 7 and wireless headphones.</p> <p>Clothing was a weak spot for the department store chain, with fashion down 8% over the week.

Fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/06/better-things-atlanta-fx-comedy-donald-glover-pamela-adlon\">Atlanta</a> \u2013 Donald Glover\u2019s auteur drama on FX, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/fx-atlanta-premiere-ratings-strong.html\">which drew three million viewers with its season premiere</a> \u2013 will recognise him as Alfred Miles aka Paper Boi, the laconic would-be rapper around whom much of the action revolves. But there\u2019s nothing laconic about Henry, who seems determined to put the world to rights \u2013 one genetically modified piece of fruit at a time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can put Trump in the White House, but you need to prepare for a revolt because I\u2019m going nuts,\u201d says Henry, as he waits for his English breakfast \u2013 a deconstructed version including black pudding \u2013 to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/08/escapefromnewyork.kurtrussell\"> Escape From New York</a> in here and you might as well call me Kurt Russell because I\u2019m going to be fucking people up. It\u2019s going to be Mad Max.\u201d</p> <p>From the coldly seething anger to the apocalyptic references, Henry\u2019s takedown of the Republican presidential candidate and his possibly cataclysmic consequences could come straight from the script of Atlanta. It has been the most popular of FX\u2019s offerings this autumn and one of the most critically lauded of the TV fall debutants. It\u2019s been called genre defying, earned comparisons to fellow FX show Louie and The Wire, and was dubbed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/the-slo-mo-specificity-of-atlanta\">shrewd, emotional, and impolite</a>\u201d by the New Yorker\u2019s Emily Nussbaum.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s also black. Brazenly so \u2013 from its cast and crew to its subject matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/25/the-new-south-atlanta-georgia-city-of-black-power\">to the city in which it\u2019s set</a>. Atlanta has managed to stand out during a season that\u2019s been heralded for embracing diversity. But where other shows such as Luke Cage, Pitch or Queen Sugar may exist in alternate universes or times, Atlanta is set in the here and now, in contemporary America. And that setting, slap bang in the middle of the most divisive election race in recent history, feels apt.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be over this by now but we\u2019re not,\u201d says Henry of race relations in the US. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing our show because we\u2019re going to be telling you exactly how we feel and exactly where we\u2019re coming from, and exactly how it feels to be a black American in this country right now.\u201d</p> <p>Variations on that line have been used by a lot of the cast while promoting the show \u2013 Donald Glover said he \u201cwanted to show white people, you don\u2019t know everything about black culture\u201d. During the show\u2019s first episode, which focuses around a shooting in a car park, the standout moment is when a white friend casually throws around the N-word. It\u2019s a scene which finishes on Glover and Henry staring down the camera at their acquaintance, and it feels like they\u2019re also looking at the viewer and America at large. It\u2019s as if those scenes are supposed to elicit a knowing nod from African Americans and a wince from white America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac0cba26db1ea7df483e93ca404fe679dab3ef4/199_126_2603_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping the couch: Keith Standfield as Darius, Donald Glover as Earnest Marks and Brian Tyree Henry as Alfred Miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo one seems give a shit about what they say about any race in this country,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhich is funny because the last time I checked isn\u2019t this the land of immigration?

It\u2019s like, yeah, but only if we say so, though.\u201d</p> <p>His words are shrewd, emotional and a little impolite, at least by conservative America\u2019s standards, but his tell-it-how-you-see-it approach began early. Henry was the youngest in a house with four older sisters in Washington DC. Acting was a survival mechanism as much as a hobby. \u201cMy sisters were teenagers when I was born so the last thing they wanted was a little nappy-headed boy running around,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI would imitate them or copy things off TV. I would leave the house and be these people.\u201d </p> <p>That early play turned into something more when Henry started acting at Morehouse College, the most famous of the historically black colleges and the same place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/30/amuel--ackson--was-a-drug-addict-out-of-my-mind-but-showed-up-on-time-and-hit-my-marks\">Samuel L Jackson caught the acting bug</a>.

He\u2019s in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals, but Atlanta is where Henry looks most at home, which isn\u2019t surprising considering it\u2019s where (at Morehouse) he matured. </p> <p>But the city itself is important to Henry for another reason: \u201cWe went there, we created it, we made it a metropolitan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the place where a lot of black history happened: Martin Luther King was there, Jim Crow was there, even the Olympics were there.</p> <p>\u201cAtlanta has become and has always been a place where you create your own universe. That\u2019s what our show is trying to do; create our own universe with these two young men trying to make it in this universe which is still part of this bigger picture. It\u2019s still part of America, it\u2019s still part of Georgia, it\u2019s still part of the south, but it\u2019s created it\u2019s own entity and I love that.\u201d</p> <p>Talking to Henry, that idea of identity and defining yourself comes up frequently. Whether it\u2019s talking about his favourite book as a kid, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/antoine-de-saint-exupery\">Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry</a>\u2019s The Little Prince (\u201c[it\u2019s about] opening your mind and not letting people limit you\u201d), his dress sense (\u201cI love wearing a fitted hat because as soon as I put it on people go \u2018oh wait, he went to Yale?\u2019\u201d) or his love of rap (\u201cIt\u2019s the place I feel like black artists have the most room to be who they want to be\u201d), it\u2019s there in the background.</p> <p>Questioning, teasing and often provoking, there\u2019s an obvious link between the world Henry and Glover have created and the real one they inhabit. So what about the world of Atlanta hip-hop? It\u2019s often presented as an out of control, drug-laced trap house where debauchery is next to godliness. For Henry it\u2019s much more complicated than that.</p> <p>\u201cIn hip-hop you can be anything. What you look like is the least of it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap</a> has one eye. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/28/gucci-mane-everybody-looking-review-trap-stars-quickfire-post-prison-set\">Gucci Mane</a> has an ice cream cone tattooed on his face, and they\u2019re both still great,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about hip-hop: it challenges the norms of what we, especially as black men should be and look like. It welcomes the freaks and the ones who haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Is that what Atlanta is doing? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s necessary, but it is absolutely necessary,\u201d he says.

Many fear an increase in the already soaring number of hate crimes against Muslims, as well as more anti-Muslim sentiment from the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>According to Abdellah, Elizabeth has been largely immune to the hate crimes experienced by Muslims across the country. They did not experience an uptick following the World Trade Center attacks of 1993 or 2001, he said. </p> <p>Sheikh and Abdellah attribute this to the diversity in Elizabeth, where black and Hispanic people <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3421000/accessible\">make up 80% of the population</a>. Abdellah said there is a large Muslim community among them. But neither cite a sizable Afghan community in Elizabeth .

It adds more complexity to our situation.\u201d</p> <p>Awad said it can be exhausting to have to condemn actions that in no way represent the community, but he stressed it\u2019s better to have Muslim voices then to cede that space to people such as Trump. </p> <p>\u201cYou see people being quoted on news outlets as experts in Islamic affairs, and these people were never elected from the Muslim community to speak on their behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very exhausting to be constantly in that position to try to say that, \u2018Yes we condemn these factions,\u2019 but I think as institutions we have to, until we have a better apparatus to speak about it.\u201d </p> <p>On Monday, Awad had a discussion with the director of homeland security for the state of New Jersey and the US attorney general to discuss ways to safeguard the community against the potential consequences of the weekend\u2019s events. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3110202-SPECIAL-STATUS-REPORT-v5-9-16-16.html\">A study</a> by California State University San Bernardino found hate crimes against Muslims in 2015 were the highest they have been since 9/11, increasing by 78%. </p> <p>Based on available data for 2016, the study found that hate crimes against Muslims in New York City have doubled since last year. The city has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/new-york-muslim-woman-set-on-fire-eid-al-adha\">an uptick in attacks against Muslims</a> in recent weeks, which was most starkly felt in August, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/new-york-queens-imam-hate-crime-muslim-activists\">an imam and his friend</a> were both shot in the back of the head in Queens, while walking home from midday prayers. </p> <p>Researchers at California State University found that negative statements about Muslims by politicians following terrorist attacks was one of the driving factors for increased hate crimes. They compared former president George W Bush\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liudIJFg8UQ\">visit to a mosque</a> following 9/11 to proclaim \u201cIslam is peace\u201d, with Trump\u2019s speech to ban all Muslims from entering the US following attacks in San Bernardino. The former was followed by a range of 46% to 66% decline in hate crimes against Muslims, while the latter was followed by an increase of 87.5%.</p> <p>Muslims in New Jersey came into the spotlight when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/donald-trump-accused-of-hate-campaign-after-claiming-thousands-cheered-on-911\">Trump claimed</a> last year that Muslims in Jersey City celebrated when the Twin Towers fell on 9/11.

How can you see anybody from over there?</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what anybody says.

This one was certainly well written, and the delivery had its moments, but very few party conference speeches get remembered much after October and this one may sink from the memory even more quickly.</p> <p>Lib Dem leaders always find themselves giving speeches in which they have to differentiate themselves from both the Tories and Labour and Farron had strong passages on both. He attacked the Tories, with more than a little justification, by saying they had forfeited the right to be seen as the party of business because of Brexit. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live?page=with:block-57e1339fe4b0603ea33c444d#block-57e1339fe4b0603ea33c444d\"> 2.59am</a>.) And he attacked Jeremy Corbyn and Labour for failing to provide serious opposition. More interestingly, he heaped praise on Tony Blair. Given that saying anything positive about Blair is tantamount to thought crime in Corbynworld, Farron is probably the only party leader who will pay tribute to Labour\u2019s three-times election winner this autumn and the pitch for the Labour, centrist vote was obvious.</p> <p>Farron\u2019s jokes weren\u2019t great, but there was a lot of personal content in the speech which came over as natural and uncontrived. And his passage about refugees, where he cleverly linked moral outrage with patriotism, was superb.</p> <p>Blair famously spoke about the \u201chand of history\u201d at one point and there was an echo of this when Farron said he wanted the Lib Dems \u201cto be audacious, ambitious and accept the call of history\u201d. Farron even set out plans for how his party might march back towards success although, having sketched out the Canadian route map to general election victory, he swiftly followed it up with a much more modest ambition that involved just depriving the Tories of a majority at the next election.</p> <p>But, with the polls as they are (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live?page=with:block-57e0fa3be4b0ef60eaef1193#block-57e0fa3be4b0ef60eaef1193\"> 10.08am</a>), even this felt quite a big ask. A great speech is one that can make its audience believe in its message.

I\u2019ll leave the details to Oliver Letwin, but in her speech opening the debate on the changes,<strong> Sal Brinton</strong>, the Lib Dem president, explained the changes were necessary because the current structure was incomprehensible.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The starting point, just over a year ago, for the review was a very strong message from the party that nobody understood how the federal committees worked, many of which were invisible and unaccountable ... When I became president I think the politest way of putting it is that our committee structure was dysfunctional. </p> </blockquote> <p>As an example of the problem, she said the party had a federal communications and elections committee. It was responsible for all major election campaigns, she said. But, under the current structure, it did not report to conference and had no oversight of election candidates.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T12:25:18.030Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e108bde4b0aa4fe87f7583\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T10:13:15.996Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ivan Massow explains why he has defected to Lib Dems</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The businessman <strong>Ivan Massow</strong> is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/farron-invites-labour-and-tory-members-to-join-lib-dems\">one of several high-profile new recruits who have joined the Lib Dems this autumn</a>.

The Lib Dems\u2019 problem, by contrast, is that of all centrist remainers, which is that they abruptly find themselves cast as the defenders of yesterday\u2019s status quo. The Lib Dem position on Brexit is in fact fairly nuanced, accepting departure from the EU, at least for now, and fighting for a future in the single market. Or at least, it\u2019s more nuanced than that of Owen Smith, who simply wants to turn the clock back. Speaking from the stage in Brighton, though, Farron\u2019s default mode was a lament for the recent past. As a result, he sounds like he belongs in it.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s worse than that. Quite suddenly, on both sides of our politics, it is liberalism itself that has become the enemy. For the right, it smacks of multiculturalism and aloofness; stick the word \u2018elite\u2019 on the end and you\u2019ve really got something to rail against. For the Corbynite left, meanwhile, it smacks of Blairism, globalisation, cowardice and treachery.</p> <p>With Labour moderates in despair and Tory moderates in hiding, the Liberal Democrats now look an awful lot like everything that the rest of our politics defines itself against. Tragic, really. Destined for extinction when they weren\u2019t needed and somehow, still destined for it when they are.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a48944e4-7e79-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4\">Henry Mance and George Parker in the Financial Times (subscription) say the Lib Dems are struggling to get a hearing.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mr Farron is getting a hearing from voters. His team admit that he needs a byelection victory to raise his profile, although the party\u2019s old hands say that two of his predecessors, Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, did not become widely known to voters until they fought a general election.</p> <p>One byelection prospect is the former Lib Dem seat of Richmond Park, now held by the Tory Zac Goldsmith. Mr Goldsmith has said he will resign if the government approves a third runway at Heathrow. Alternatively, if a snap general election takes place, Mr Cable and other former Lib Dem MPs will stand, guaranteeing news coverage.</p> <p>A high-profile defection from Labour would also help Mr Farron but none seems forthcoming. Talks of some kind of Lib-Lab realignment have not progressed, with moderate Labour MPs determined to stay and fight against Jeremy Corbyn.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T12:29:39.064Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e10364e4b0aa4fe87f7576\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T09:42:02.830Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The more I hear about Glee Club, the more it sounds like a Momentum rally.

Jeremy Corbyn has proposed an alternative that would involve party members elected some shadow cabinet members, MPs electing others, and the party leader choosing some too. Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m taking both options to our NEC today. Jeremy wants a debate at the NEC to discuss that. I\u2019m open minded on both options.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Watson said the NEC would also be debating plans to change the way the party leader is elected, but that the proposed changes would not affect whoever is elected leader on Saturday. </strong>He said he wanted to scrap the system that allows registered supporters to vote in leadership contests.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last set of reforms we had was some very rushed reforms and we created a new category of member, a registered supporter, which is pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that, and we also want to enfranchise more ordinary trade unionists in the new process ...</p> <p>Let me just specify \u2013 this would be after the current leader, whoever wins on Saturday, leaves their post. This won\u2019t be a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over whoever is elected on Saturday.</p> <p>Watson said he hoped the NEC would agree changes to the leadership election rules today, to enable them to be debated at Labour\u2019s conference next week.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about some MPs facing the threat of deselection.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m very concerned about that because I do think if energy is expended trying to undermine political opponents in your own party then obviously that\u2019s time not spent characterising and attacking our opponents.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3908ce4d95325386958684821f08d91136ec1d26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3908ce4d95325386958684821f08d91136ec1d26/0_115_3696_2219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T13:19:35.722Z\">at 2.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e0f1ade4b02fcdee725e4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T08:33:53.155Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Brighton Lib Dem members have just started debating an emergency motion saying Britain should take \u201cits fair share\u201d of refugees, including unaccompanied children, and that refugees contribute \u201ca huge amount to local communities throughout the UK\u201d. </p> <p>Perhaps many Lib Dems are still sleeping off the effects of Glee Club, the satirical singalong extravaganza that activists indulge in on the final night of their conference.

  "<p>Tony Blair should be admired for his government\u2019s achievements on workers\u2019 rights and the health service, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, has said in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-speech-lib-dem-conferenence-says-lib-dems-would-be-willing-to-raise-taxes-to-find-a-lot-more-money-for-nhs-politics-live\">conference speech</a> pitched squarely at moderate Labour voters.</p> <p>He told the party\u2019s conference in Brighton he was amazed Labour party members were \u201cthrowing around the word Blairite as if it\u2019s the world\u2019s most offensive insult\u201d. </p> <p>Farron said he was not a Blairite, citing his opposition to the Iraq war, compulsory ID cards, 90-day detention, and deregulation of the banks. \u201cThere is more to Tony Blair\u2019s legacy than that,\u201d he went on. \u201cI kind of see Tony Blair the way I see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stone-roses\">Stone Roses</a>: I preferred the early work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/15/corbyn-could-land-us-with-tory-government-for-25-years-says-farron\">I admire Tony Blair for beating Tories, says Tim Farron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farron said Blair\u2019s legacy was also the minimum wage, working tax credits, NHS investment and school-building. \u201cI disagree with him a lot, but I will not criticise him for those things. I admire him for those things,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cI respect him for believing that the point of being in politics is to get stuff done, and you can only get stuff done if you win. Otherwise you\u2019re letting your opponent get stuff done instead.\u201d</p> <p>Farron has previously expressed admiration for the former Labour prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/15/corbyn-could-land-us-with-tory-government-for-25-years-says-farron\">telling the Guardian last week</a> he believed \u201ca person who thinks winning elections so you can do good is honourable\u201d.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have made no secret during their Brighton conference of their desire to seize the support of voters on the centre-left and right concerned about the swerve of both main parties away from the middle ground.</p> <p>However, there is little evidence thus far that those voters have been convinced that the Lib Dems are the answer. New polling released on Tuesday shows their ratings have barely changed from a year ago, despite heightened attention following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">Brexit vote</a>.</p> <p>When asked to compare Farron with the Liberal Democrat party, just 23% stated that they liked Farron but slightly more \u2013 28% \u2013 said they liked the Lib Dems, with no change from last year\u2019s conference. Almost half of those surveyed said \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d, an indication that the leader has barely raised his public profile since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/16/tim-farron-named-liberal-democrat-party-leader\">taking over from Nick Clegg</a>. </p> <p>It also remains to be seen how Farron\u2019s praise of Blair will be received by his party. On Monday night at the Lib Dems\u2019 annual unofficial glee club, members lustily sang: \u201cTony Blair can fuck off and die\u201d to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s American Pie.</p> <p>In the hall, the response was certainly muted, but Lib Dem sources say that was not the target audience for the comments. They say their leader will push on with his appeal to New Labour\u2019s early voters, ramping up his praise of some achievements of the Blair government. </p> <p>Farron said he wanted to convince voters his party was the only one that could deny a pro-Brexit Conservative government a majority. He said: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to work with people of all parties and none if it will make people\u2019s lives better. But I couldn\u2019t work with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, because Jeremy Corbyn would never work with me.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-says-conservatives-can-no-longer-say-they-are-the-party-of-business-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53qb8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2735513\"            data-video-name=\"Tim Farron says Conservatives can no longer say they are 'the party of business' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e17360e4b02abd56c3f70e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/20/160920Farron_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/20/160920Farron.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/20/160920Farron_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/20/tim-farron-says-conservatives-can-no-longer-say-they-are-the-party-of-business-video\">Tim Farron says Conservatives can no longer say they are \u2018the party of business\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>He had kinder words for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\">Owen Smith</a>, Corbyn\u2019s leadership rival. \u201cUnlike Corbyn, he is certainly on our side of the European debate,\u201d Farron said. \u201cSo if Owen Smith wins, I want to make clear that I am open to working together. And there are others I could work with too.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech Farron cited the former Labour frontbenchers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/labour-big-guns-chuka-umunna-caroline-flint-yvette-cooper-line-up-replace-keith-vaz\">Yvette Cooper, Chuka Umunna and Caroline Flint</a>, all currently competing to chair the home affairs select committee, which the Lib Dem leader called \u201ca retirement position\u201d. He said: \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be their leadership contest? What are these people doing, jostling for position in a sideshow? They should be centre-stage.\u201d</p> <p> Labour MPs Liz Kendall and Lisa Nandy have appeared at Lib Dem fringe events, voicing their support for cross-party collaboration. Nandy, who appeared with Green MP Caroline Lucas, told the fringe meetings her party spent too much time fighting over \u201csmall differences\u201d.</p> <p>Farron had far fewer conciliatory words for the Conservative party, the Lib Dems\u2019 former coalition partners. Earlier in the speech he said the party had \u201clost the right to call itself the party of business\u201d. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIt no longer supports business, no longer understands the need for calm economic pragmatism \u2013 but instead pursues the nationalist protectionist fantasies of the Brexit fundamentalists who have won the day. Indeed, my message to any business in this country \u2013 large or small \u2013 is if you are backing today\u2019s Conservative party, you are funding your own funeral. We are the free-market, free-trade pro-business party now.\u201d</p> <p>Farron said he was confident the party could make inroads in Conservative seats, starting with local government. Party sources said they were closely studying the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>\u2019s Liberal party in Canada, which won a surprise but emphatic victory over the Conservative government after the collapse of the leftwing New Democratic party, which had been the official opposition.</p> <p>Farron was unapologetic that he wanted to model himself on Trudeau, though admitted the Canadian was \u201cbetter looking than me and he\u2019s got a tattoo\u201d. He said: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s Liberals leapt over an inadequate official opposition to defeat a rightwing Conservative government. Do you fancy doing that? \u2019Cause I do.\u201d</p> <p>Opportunities for the party existed in Tory seats after boundary changes, Farron said. \u201cNo one believes, whether boundary changes happen or not, that Labour will gain a single seat from the Tories. The SNP could only possibly take one seat off the Conservatives. But there are dozens of Tory seats in our reach. Which means that the only thing standing between the Conservatives and a majority at the next election is the revival of the Liberal Democrats.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"575948a72cd97c8f10654a62eb8d485638efdeae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/575948a72cd97c8f10654a62eb8d485638efdeae/0_0_5581_3694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An \u201cOi Farron\u201d badge at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An \u2018Oi Farron\u2019 badge at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as reiterating his promise to fight for a second referendum on any Brexit deal, Farron\u2019s speech also pledged a fully taxpayer-funded care service, rebranding the NHS as the National Health and Care Service, even if it would mean tax rises. The Lib Dems would also campaign against the reintroduction of grammar schools and would scrap Sats for younger children.</p> <p>Farron said beyond his party and the UK he believed there was a wider battle emerging between \u201cthe forces of tolerant liberalism and intolerant, closed-minded nationalism\u201d.</p> <p>With genuine emotion, Farron spoke of his experience volunteering during the refugee crisis in Lesbos, where he was confronted by an aid worker from New Zealand, who knew he was a British politician. \u201cShe looked at me and shouted: \u2018Stop handing out bottles of water and take some effing refugees.\u2019 Because that is how Britain is seen. Mean, and not pulling its weight. And maybe that doesn\u2019t bother some people, but it bothers me.\u201d </p> <p>The appeal not to abandon refugees, as more news came in that the UN would halt aid convoys into Syria after one was shelled, drew a standing ovation and raised fists in the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI am proud of who we are \u2013 always a sanctuary for the desperate, the abused and the persecuted,\u201d Farron said. \u201cAnd I will not stand by and watch my country become smaller, meaner and more selfish.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cPlaya dust?\u201d</p> <p>A woman was holding a jar of dust from the Black Rock Desert where Burning Man was taking place at that moment, and offering to sprinkle a pinch of it on my head. My hair was still damp from my first proper shower in a week and I was sure that some of that insidious dust was still clinging under my toenails and in the folds of my ears. I declined, but the man next to me bent his head reverently to receive the unusual sacrament.</p> <p>We were in the courtyard of the <a href=\"http://morrisburnerhostel.com\">Morris Burner Hostel</a> in Reno, Nevada, watching a live feed of a wooden man incandescing 120 miles away. The Morris is a Burning Man-inspired facility, and on the biggest night of the 2015 festival it was holding a parallel celebration. A DJ played while two effigies flamed: a 60-foot one on the screen and a six-foot one in the courtyard. Half the crowd was in costume. In front of the stage someone was teaching people how to hula hoop; in a tent nearby people were taking turns pole dancing. I had left the playa, Burning Man\u2019s festival grounds, six hours earlier but it felt like I hadn\u2019t gone very far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b17a269b485dd6c1eb58e5c7f224e8ef5435536f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b17a269b485dd6c1eb58e5c7f224e8ef5435536f/0_0_1800_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The exterior of the hostel in Reno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The exterior of the hostel in Reno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VJC/Vincent Cascio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Morris has no official link to the Burning Man festival or organization. But it\u2019s owned and run by self-identifying burners and operates according to <a href=\"http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles\">Burning Man\u2019s 10 principles</a>. It\u2019s the brainchild of former tech executive <a href=\"https://wandering-through-time-and-place.me/tag/jim-gibson/\">Jim Gibson</a>, who is known on the playa as Jungle Jim. When Gibson bought the neglected motel building in 2013, he had no idea how well the burner population would respond to his vision of \u201cbuilding community, fostering the arts, and educating people in the Burning Man ethos\u201d. People rallied around the project. Two hundred volunteers were involved in the multi-year renovation of what had formerly been a flophouse.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we first got here the building was absolutely derelict. There were holes in the structure and a quarter-inch of nicotine on every surface,\u201d says customer service manager Andy DelliColli, who goes by his playa name, Ice. \u201cNow the crime rate in the neighborhood is around 30% lower, and almost all the empty buildings around us have been purchased by businesses which we helped court. The neighborhood is experiencing quite a renaissance because of us being here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4f89a7a2fc0a801b8ae3176b487e06c6843aefd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4f89a7a2fc0a801b8ae3176b487e06c6843aefd/0_0_2699_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All aboard the Jungle bus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All aboard the Jungle bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VJC/Vincent Cascio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The improvement isn\u2019t purely by osmosis. Communal effort and civic responsibility are among Burning Man\u2019s 10 principles. In that spirit, the Morris runs a weekly clothing and blanket drive over the winter. And after Burning Man, festival-goers can deposit excess food and clothing there to be donated to charity. The hostel itself runs on volunteerism. Most of the staff are unpaid residents who live on the premises, as DelliColli has done for the past year.</p> <p>The Morris Burner hostel has three levels. The top floor belongs to members of the residential program, who number between 10 and 20 at any given time. These rent-paying tenants manage all day-to-day operations, usually while holding down paid jobs elsewhere. DelliColli entered the program in 2015 after relocating from Syracuse, New York. \u201cI visited for four days after I got off the playa last year. Then I went home, immediately packed up all my stuff and moved west,\u201d he recalls. There is no limit to how long a resident can stay. One member helped launch the hostel in 2013 and has lived there ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c257c6be7c0de30066c176cde6d510a4d68d92c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c257c6be7c0de30066c176cde6d510a4d68d92c/0_0_2997_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the bar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the bar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Cascio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the second floor of the Morris, there are 13 artist-designed rooms available for short-term guests. The accommodations range from four-bunk dorms ($15-$20 per night) to deluxe suites ($95-$105 per night), and they have themes such as Sparkle Pony and Enchanted Forest. The Reno Music Room is strewn with playable instruments and decorated with flyers of local gigs. The walls of the Temple suite depict dark towers silhouetted against a technicolor sky \u2013 a reference to the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/28860525\">Temple of Transition</a>, a 2011 Burning Man art installation that Jungle Jim Gibson worked on. The public can tour vacant rooms at any time but staying in one requires membership. Joining the Morris costs $20 for a month or $50 for a year, and discounts apply if you can recite the 10 principles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/28860525\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/28860525\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Workshops, shows and other events \u2013 such as drum circles and Star Wars-inspired lightsaber fitness classes \u2013 are held on the ground floor. In June, chef <a href=\"http://clintjolly.com/\">Clint Jolly</a> of the Food Network held a themed dinner that cost $75 per head. The Morris has even been used as a wedding venue. \u201cWe try to say yes to as many people as we can, so that we can get as much of the community involved as possible,\u201d says DelliColli. Even when there are no scheduled events, people can play a round of pool in the Steampunk Saloon or hang out in the open-air courtyard. Gifting is one of Burning Man\u2019s 10 principles, so there\u2019s often a plate of homemade muffins or a pot of soup on offer in the shared kitchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a73d34d54cb8133cbe2d3c6eb0329e0d563f50a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73d34d54cb8133cbe2d3c6eb0329e0d563f50a4/0_0_7357_4907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The yard at night, including a neon head artwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The yard at night, including a neon head artwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VJC/Vincent Cascio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hostel shifts gears with the approach of Burning Man in August. The schedule ramps up with daily workshops covering costume making, bike maintenance and other festival preparation. The rooms book out as burners assemble in Reno; the city is a popular staging ground due to its proximity to the playa. Local volunteers are called in to cover for festival-bound staff. But for those who stay behind there is Home Burn, the Morris\u2019 corresponding celebration where a mini effigy is torched in salute. \u201cIt\u2019s for people who maybe couldn\u2019t find a ticket but still want to experience a flavor of the burn,\u201d says DelliColli. \u201cUnfortunately there isn\u2019t space for everyone on the playa, so we give them a little bit of the playa right here in Reno.\u201d</p> <p>I met some of those people at Home Burn last year, but I also met people for whom the Morris is an alternative to Burning Man rather than a replacement. One long-time burner told me he\u2019s disillusioned with what he sees as a dilution of Burning Man culture on the playa, and no longer wants to attend. A young woman said she wasn\u2019t sure if she considered herself a burner, since she\u2019s very drawn to the artistic community surrounding the Morris, but isn\u2019t all that interested in the festival it\u2019s inspired by. Toward the end of the night, I had whiskey in one of the hostel rooms with three non-burners who had driven over from California because it sounded like a good party. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b2be259b78fe068c86399bf31d3cae4d1b3a75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b2be259b78fe068c86399bf31d3cae4d1b3a75/0_0_1249_833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No-frills bunk beds in the dorm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No-frills bunk beds in the dorm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Cascio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those road trippers had no way of knowing what an authentic burner experience they were having that night. But I, fresh off the playa, was in a better position to appreciate it. That event was Burning Man distilled into a house party. It had many of the same intangible qualities, including an elasticity around what is normal and what is possible. It also had that sense of belonging that makes \u201cwelcome home\u201d an appropriate greeting when you arrive at the Burning Man gate. I had already had a great burn but the Morris provided me with one final highlight: the discovery that there\u2019s a real-world location where Burning Man never ends.<br></p>",

  "<p>The independent presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/evan-mcmullin-republican-donald-trump-utah\">Evan McMullin</a> has linked Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, saying such events are a \u201creflection of a nativist movement across Europe and in the United States\u201d that is \u201cdestructive to [the] economy here and in the world and to peace and security\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/donald-trumps-police-officers-backing-republican-have-murky-legal-histories\">Donald Trump's police: officers backing Republican have murky legal histories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 40-year-old former CIA agent and Capitol Hill policy adviser accused Russia of fueling such sentiments \u2013 a phenomenon he said he understood because when working for the US intelligence service he \u201creceived the same training that Vladimir Putin did\u201d while in the KGB.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey do it through supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Donald Trump poses a true threat to our national security by carrying Putin\u2019s water in the United States,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin is running as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">an independent conservative alternative to Trump</a>, backed by some of the Republican nominee\u2019s most determined rightwing opponents. Speaking to the Guardian, he discussed his longshot bid for the White House and his disdain for those on the right who have failed to stand up to Trump, who is now closing in on Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">in presidential polling</a>.</p> <p>In McMullin\u2019s view, the forces that drove the British vote to leave the European Union and have aided the rise of Trump are part of the \u201csame movement, fueled largely by the Russians who seek to destabilize eastern and western Europe as well as North America through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin, who spent a decade at the CIA, will make a foreign policy speech in Washington on Tuesday focusing on the global threats to US national security. </p> <p>He said he felt comfortable viewing Trump from Putin\u2019s perspective. \u201cI received the same training that Vladimir Putin did. He received it from KGB. I received it from the CIA. Vladimir Putin trained to identify weaknesses in people and exploit them for intelligence purposes.\u201d<br></p> <p>McMullin said Putin saw weaknesses in Trump \u2013 \u201cego, financial vulnerabilities\u201d \u2013 and also \u201cin a different sort of a way an alignment ideologically, at least as it pertains to leadership\u201d.</p> <p>As a political rookie and rank outsider, McMullin freely admits his own weakness. Aside from the benefits of understanding the Russian president, he says, there may not be \u201ca lot of parallels frankly, between what I am doing now and what I did in the CIA\u201d. He takes pains to note his experience working on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs, however, and as policy director for the House Republican Conference on Capitol Hill.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53bhd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2724745\"            data-video-name=\"A short history of Donald Trump's 'birther' conspiracy \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC/The View, NBC/Today show, PBS Newshour, Donald Trump/YouTube, MSNBC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dc5c11e4b0df02df202fd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916birther_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916birther.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916birther_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/16/donald-trump-barack-obama-birther-theory-video\">Donald Trump\u2019s birther comments: a short history</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>McMullin has barely made a ripple since he declared his candidacy in August, motivated he said because he felt there had to be some alternative to the choices being offered. </p> <p>\u201cI firmly believe,\u201d he said, \u201cthat someone needed to step up and stand in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-bigotry\">Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted rhetoric</a> and his allegiance to Vladimir Putin and at the same time to Hillary Clinton\u2019s promotion of large centralized government that is unaccountable to American people.\u201d </p> <p>He was dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/gary-johnson-and-jill-stein-not-allowed-in-first-televised-debate\">the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson</a>, whom he described as not \u201csuitable to be a leader of the free world\u201d. Johnson, a two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, has polled at around 8% nationally \u2013 not enough to qualify for the first presidential debate on 26 September. In contrast, McMullin has struggled to gain any traction at all. </p> <p>In one sense, that is part of his plan. As he is not on the ballot in enough states to get 270 electoral votes, it is impossible for him to win the White House outright. Therefore, his goal is to force and exploit electoral deadlock. The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th amendment</a> says that if no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses, with one vote for each state, from among the top three candidates who received electoral votes. McMullin is hoping to win such votes from at least one state in the Mountain West. In Utah, strongly conservative but also strongly anti-Trump, he is polling at 9%.</p> <p>Should deadlock be reached, McMullin imagines a whole new campaign in which he, Trump and Clinton would compete in the Republican-dominated House, a chamber where, he thinks, Clinton would never stand a chance. At that point, he thinks Republicans in the House would realize \u201cI am more aligned with them on issues than Trump\u201d and Democrats would support him too. </p> <p>\u201cI am not a racist and most Democrats aren\u2019t racists either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, McMullin acknowledges that such goals will be very difficult to achieve, depending as they do \u201con variables that we don\u2019t control and very few that we do\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are realistic about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s about trust more than issues\u2019</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign\">Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While his ambition relies on draining votes from Democrats as well as Republicans, McMullin did not have an immediate answer for why Democrats unhappy with Hillary Clinton, especially those who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, should support him. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question and I don\u2019t exactly know the answer to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a theory based on some comments because we do have Bernie Sanders people coming to us saying we\u2019re going to support you and people who have supported Hillary Clinton but have grown concerned about the stories that have come out about Clinton Foundation and other things.\u201d </p> <p>Such people, he said, knew they didn\u2019t agree with him on many issues, particularly social concerns, but viewed him as trustworthy in a way Clinton is not. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust more than issues,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McMullin has taken some stances that do not accord with mainstream conservative thought. He believes human activity contributes to climate change and sees the environment and racism as two issues \u201cwhere the Republican party is stuck in the past \u2026 making it unable to lead the country forward.\u201d </p> <p>However, he is staunchly conservative on a number of other issues. He is pro-life and would hope to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. His campaign is planning to follow Trump in releasing a list of judges who would be appointed if he were elected. It will include some names on the list <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">the Republican nominee released</a> in May.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe Donald Trump poses a true threat to our constitution and those who support him are sustaining that threat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McMullin seems most concerned with saving the Republican party from itself. \u201cAnyone who supports Donald Trump is someone who I think is not too committed to the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe Donald Trump poses a true threat to our constitution and those who support him are sustaining that threat.\u201d </p> <p>He was disappointed that Republican elected officials are still supporting Trump, for what he said were selfish reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI have conversations with Republicans on the Hill about this very issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tell me about Donald Trump, they know his allegiance to Vladimir Putin is very dangerous to this country, they tell me that they know his racist rhetoric and racist nature of his support is damaging and dangerous to his country. </p> <p>\u201cBut they also say they are afraid to speak out against him and remove their either silent support for him or vocal support for him \u2026 because they fear doing so would cause them to lose their seat in Congress.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/evan-mcmullin-hurting-trumps-chances-or-improving\">Evan McWho isn't the guy to save us from Trump's evil grip | Jimmy Camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other than Utah, the other poll number touted by the McMullin campaign is 3% in Virginia.

If the GOP sticks with Trump, he worries, \u201cas his bigotry becomes more front and center, even as the alt-right becomes more vocal and it\u2019s more and more clear that they contribute heavily to the empowerment of his campaign\u201d, the party will sign its own death warrant. </p> <p>He doubts whether the Republican party \u201cwill be able to make the kinds of reforms they need to make to be a competitive party on a national level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He hopes to build something for the conservative movement, \u201csomething that will be a place for [conservatives] \u2026 something that has real traction and real influence and it will be either to influence the Republican party or potentially start our own\u201d.</p>",

Here we look at the critical work the organisation\u2019s volunteers do every single day.</em></p> <p>Aleppo and its surrounding area has seen much of the fighting in Syria over the past five years. For the Aleppo branch of SARC, run mostly by young volunteers who have given up other careers to do this work, the demands have grown from health and food parcels to pest control, mending water pumps, and running projects for street children. SARC is non political and is one of the only agencies able to cross the conflict\u2019s front lines.</p> <h2>\u2018Never have I seen children so motivated to learn\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d7754c7fe30b1f6a283a56903aed7f293ac6b9f/0_145_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Around 60 children live in shelters with their families in the rural area of Al-Majbal after fleeing Aleppo. In a makeshift tent, volunteers from SARC\u2019s psychosocial support team provide activities for the children. Most have not been able to go to school in some time, if at all. \u201cNever ever I have seen children so motivated to learn as these,\u201d says Qamar, a volunteer who is teaching basic numeracy and literacy. </p> <h2>Alone, homeless and begging to survive </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57287908a4dfc64b150da53cc150ad29ac0c177d/0_29_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer helps a child write her name\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the most devastating impacts of the conflict has been on children who have been left homeless, alone and begging on the street in order to survive.

Abed, the SARC volunteer says: \u201cThis project has made a great impression on Mirna and other children, as they have been able to integrate well into their communities.

The drive to find safety comes first, and medical needs are often neglected by parents desperate to settle their children in a new location. A mobile health team from SARC has been able to provide Mrs Amina with the necessary medications at her new shelter in a public park.

She didn\u2019t need to. The theme of new arrivals and borders emerges strongly throughout. For Bergvall, who often focuses on language politics, these themes have only taken on greater relevance since the Brexit vote. She is scared by what she has seen: \u201cAn outpouring of xenophobic language and isolationist pride, things that I haven\u2019t witnessed in England for quite a long time. Not in a weird generalised way, but real insults thrown around in the local cafe or dry cleaners. The mentality that\u2019s coming out of it is very scary and disappointing.\u201d</p> <p>Bergvall\u2019s thoughts on these issues are set out in a thought-provoking 2010 essay, Middling English, in which she attempts to break down the development of modern English into four elements: midden, middle, middling and meddle. As she puts it, the \u201cmidden\u201d is the soils of the English language, originated in multiple cultures. The \u201cmiddle\u201d is the historical Middle English period where the language settled into the one we recognise today. \u201cMiddling\u201d is any attempt to standardise English, too often in prejudicial ways. This is something we see playing out in current political and social debate. Should new immigrants learn English as standard? And if so, what English do we mean? As Bergvall says, every new generation brings their own words to the mix: \u201cPop music and rap and even slam poetry all disturb the language.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5cf30484e0949f6e16d4822c8c4894b9cf1af2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cf30484e0949f6e16d4822c8c4894b9cf1af2b/0_0_2953_2005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raga Dawn by Caroline Bergvall being performed at Estuary festival, with singer Peyee Chen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raga Dawn by Caroline Bergvall being performed at Estuary festival, with singer Peyee Chen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benedict Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what about the \u201cmeddle\u201d? \u201cThe meddle is the artist or writer who messes things up and shows up the language\u2019s complexity and richness,\u201d says Bergvall. \u201cThe meddle is wanting to tackle issues, to bring other areas of awareness to the work you make.\u201d Audiences can meddle, too, she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re simply jumping in and activating it.\u201d</p> <p>Which is why Tilbury is just the beginning for Raga Dawn. Next year, Bergvall and her team of academics and artistic collaborators plan to follow the old troubadour route from Morocco up through Europe, interviewing 12 minority-language groups and incorporating their words into the performance until the work is a huge patchwork, like any contemporary language. \u201cWe can think about other historical issues and geographical differences to do with sunrise greeting, especially in summer, from the very short dawn in southern Spain to the longer ones in Scandinavia and even in the Isle of Skye. I\u2019m talking to arts organisations there who are saying, \u2018Can you come in August please?

  "<p>Little Sister, a story set in Amsterdam and the nearby seaside resort of Volendam, grew out of some very old memories, rather too close to the place that was once my home.</p> <p> Forty-six years ago, I abandoned school at the age of 17 to take up a five-pound-a-week cub reporter\u2019s job on the smallest evening newspaper in Britain. It was in the seaside town of Scarborough, then in its heyday as a brassy English bucket-and-spade resort. </p> <p> This was just before the masses decamped to Torremolinos. Scarborough was fashionable. The Beatles had played the Futurist theatre six years before \u2013 I got taken to see them as a treat for passing my 11-plus. The massive Victorian hulk of the Grand Hotel, once the biggest in Europe, loomed from the cliffs over the seafront, as much of a draw as it had been in Edwardian times when Scarborough touted itself as a Yorkshire version of Nice. In the busy theatres, the biggest TV acts in the country played summer shows alongside the Black and White Minstrels \u2013 a production few people remember these days, though back then Welshmen in blackface singing \u201cnegro spirituals\u201d was primetime TV.</p> <p> And the place was rotten, top to toe. In a spacious flat just across the Spa Bridge from the Grand lived Jimmy Savile with his mother, \u201cthe Duchess\u201d. Down below on the seafront, the \u201cice cream king\u201d Peter Jaconelli, a prominent local businessman newly elevated to town mayor, was a big mate of Savile\u2019s, someone with the same taste for sexual abuse. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\">Jimmy Savile: timeline of his sexual abuse and its uncovering</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The squalid details of Savile and Jaconelli\u2019s predatory habits are now public knowledge. In 2014, North Yorkshire police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/18/jimmy-savile-victims-apology-police-north-yorkshire\">publicly apologised</a> to 35 victims of the pair, after admitting both men should have been liable to prosecution over charges of indecent assault, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, gross indecency and rape.</p> <p>I read that story while I was in Amsterdam thinking about the background to the book I was about to write. That moment I had it. Because to pretty much anyone living in Scarborough back in the 1970s, the police\u2019s belated apology was old hat. I\u2019d met Jaconelli and Savile many times as a local reporter and heard all the rumours and the warnings to steer clear of any invitations they offered. We knew exactly what they were already. We just did nothing about it. </p> <p> The police were aware of what was going on from the very outset. Intelligence files that have come to light since Savile\u2019s death, <a href=\"http://nyenquirer.uk/savile-jaconelli-they-knew-in-72/\">mostly through the efforts of a brave campaigning website</a>, reveal that in 1972 Jaconelli was accused of indecent assault, only for the case to be dropped. All in secret of course. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Savile appeared a complex and frightening individual, charmless and vaguely threatening beneath the perma-smile</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> But it\u2019s not enough to lay the blame at the door of the police alone. It was an open secret in the town at the time that Jaconelli assaulted boys in his ice-cream parlour when he had the opportunity, and that Savile, sometimes with Jaconelli alongside, liked to cruise around in his Rolls-Royce looking to pick up any gullible kids willing to ride with them. If they got awkward they were threatened or paid off. Scarborough, like most seaside resorts, had a ready underclass of youth looking for money. Most of the jobs were seasonal and tied to the holiday trade. Winter was long and cash was always scarce. They had plenty of places to hunt. </p> <p> Jaconelli, it seemed to me, was little more than a devious opportunist determined to work a system that gave him free rein to pursue his victims. Savile appeared an altogether more complex and frightening individual, charmless and vaguely threatening beneath the perma-smile, gold jewellery and stinking cigar. He was oddly obsessed with his mother, and a Catholic too, given a papal knighthood in 1990, even attending daily mass later in life. One can only wonder what the confessions were like. Did Savile see his devotion to his mother and his work for charity \u2013 which was very real \u2013 as ways of offsetting the evil? Or did he do good as a way to find new victims? We\u2019ll never know, and I wonder if the man understood himself.</p> <p> The crime in crime fiction is often banal and uninteresting \u2013 squalid, tawdry acts by squalid, tawdry people. \u201cWhy?\u201d is often a more intriguing question in fiction than \u201cwhat?\u201d The question that arose when I started writing Little Sister was the one that had puzzled me whenever I thought back to Scarborough: why did decent people stand back and do nothing?</p> <p> On one level we had no choice. I was 17, working for a newspaper that was part of the collective blindness. The title was then under private ownership, run by a terrifying individual who, among other things, chaired the local magistrates\u2019 court. I learned early on that, whatever its skills at reporting flower shows and those unfortunate enough to come before our owner in the courts, Watergate would never have been broken by the Scarborough Evening News. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/20/jimmy-savile-controlling-people-and-his-myth-dan-davies-biography\">'Jimmy Savile was supremely controlling \u2013 of people and his myth'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p> That was Scarborough back then. Today, the Futurist is a miserable closed wreck and the Grand Hotel, which once wouldn\u2019t let you through the door if you were wearing jeans, is a rather shabby \u00a329-a-night stop for budget coach parties. Like seaside resorts everywhere, Scarborough is struggling to survive in changed times, though it\u2019s still blessed with a gorgeous physical location, a handful of decent hotels, and <a href=\"http://lanterna-ristorante.co.uk/\">one of the best Italian restaurants in the land</a>.</p> <p>I love going back even if there are dark memories in those streets. We turned a blind eye, all of us. Out of fear, out of acceptance of our place, and probably out of some misguided belief that, however awful the gossip about this unsavoury pair might have been, surely it couldn\u2019t have been that bad. In truth it was all much worse than any of us might have imagined.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> There are victims of Savile and Jaconelli still alive too, still angry, still in pain. Still, in some cases, blaming themselves, because victims of crimes like these are so often convinced that they brought their trauma on themselves. It\u2019s a cruel fact that shame and guilt haunt the innocent much more than they dog the guilty. All that talk about \u201cclosure\u201d is just that: talk. Damage and hurt last a lifetime and can, on occasion, mutate into evil itself.</p> <p> These were the ideas I wanted to explore in Little Sister, the story of two young sisters who might be victims or perpetrators, perhaps even both, and are unsure of which themselves. </p> <p> It\u2019s all fiction, though it happens in another brassy seaside town, just 13 miles outside Amsterdam. But its roots lie on the Yorkshire coast 40 years ago and still resonate there to this day.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People on the island village understood there was some kind of psychiatric institution on their doorstep.

On the other the larger Markermeer, part of a vast expanse of inland water that ran all the way out to the North Sea.</p> <p> Nothing but a grassy dyke joined Marken to the outside world, a narrow lane above it. Any inmate who escaped would have to make their way along that. None had tried in the 18 years of its existence. Nor did many visitors come the other way.

  "<h2><strong>The fraught future of Europe</strong><br></h2> <p>Your headline coverage of the hardening of attitudes to refugees and the corresponding rise of the far right in Europe made gloomy reading for me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\" title=\"\">(9 September)</a>. All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia.</p> <p>On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia. They were in a state of anxious anticipation at the prospect of new life down under. But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland.</p> <p>I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means.</p> <p>They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope we can buck our own version of the far-rightist trend you identify for Europe. At present it could go either way.<br><strong>Terry Hewton</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de comments on the future of Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/angela-merkel-marine-le-pen-europe-destiny\" title=\"\">(9 September)</a>, with her opinion that behind all evil in the world is Russia. I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d. Germany, for all its talk of upholding the rules, breaks year after year the rules on trade surpluses. It is projected to reach this year alone up to 8.9% of GDP. Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules.</p> <p>Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies? Is it a wonder that the French voters turn to the Front National if, on their backs, Germany exports its unemployment?

Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth.</p> <p>The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees.</p> <p>That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America. It is ironic that the success of this attempt to create unity from recent disharmony now rests on whether Germany, under Angela Merkel, maintains effective leadership, or whether the various rightwing groups typified by Marine Le Pen gain effective control.</p> <p>Should the rightwing movements gain power, the future for a united Europe looks bleak indeed. If this, the worst possible outcome eventuates, Britain may well enjoy a short period of self-congratulation for seeing the writing on the wall.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Censorship by Facebook</strong><br></h2> <p>I read with interest the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, commenting on the recent furore over Facebook\u2019s censoring of the iconic image taken during the American war in Vietnam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\" title=\"\">(16 September)</a>.

War is not only cruel because of the people that perpetrate violence. It is also cruel because of the people who fuel it. When I see this picture I see napalm. When I think napalm, I think of the Norwegian government permitting Norway to be one of the biggest suppliers of magnesium to the US production of napalm in the 50s.</p> <p>Cut to the present day. Norway is still a major-league global supplier of weapons (per capita).

  "<p>When primary schoolteachers Katie McDonald and Vicky Manning arrived to teach in the Faneromeni refugee camp in Greece, they knew they were in for a challenge. </p> <p>What they were not expecting was that there would be no actual school at all. \u201cI thought there would at least be tents or something,\u201d says Katie, \u201cbut there weren\u2019t.\u201d </p> <p>The site had only been set up in May and there was little by way of infrastructure.

So, lacking a building, they spread tarpaulins on the rocky ground.</p> <p>\u201cWe propped a whiteboard up against a pole while the children sat around on the floor,\u201d says Manning. <br></p> <p>\u201cOne of the first things the refugees asked for was education,\u201d says CalAid\u2019s programme manager Becky Chapple.

I am grateful for the quick action of law enforcement in capturing the terrorist responsible for Saturday\u2019s bombings, and the off-duty police officer for stopping the terrorist in Minnesota. This weekend\u2019s attacks, from Minnesota to Manhattan, are just the latest to be carried out on US soil under President Obama. These should be a wake-up call for every American.</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything - and blame anyone - to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State. The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking Isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.</p> <p>While our President has referred to them as the \u2018J.V. Team\u2019 and Hillary Clinton calls them our \u2018determined enemies,\u2019 I have been willing to call them exactly what they are: radical Islamist terrorists.</p> <p>I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we\u2019re in a fight about \u2018narratives.\u2019 These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.</p> <p>When I am President, terrorists like today\u2019s suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, and yesterday\u2019s knife-wielding ISIS sympathizer in Minnesota, Dahir Adan, will be stopped. We will not look the other way. We will not allow political correctness and soft-on-terror, soft-on-crime policies to threaten our security and our lives.</p> <p>Revelations that the Obama Administration wrongly granted citizenship to over 800 immigrants awaiting deportation from countries of concern to national security or high rates of immigration fraud puts this weekend\u2019s attacks in a broader perspective. The safety and security of the homeland must be the overriding objective of our leaders when it comes to our immigration policy.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed extreme vetting for immigrants from troubled parts of the world where terrorists live and train, and oppose Hillary Clinton\u2019s 550% increase in the number of refugees from the conflict in Syria. These are tough problems that require tough leadership. We need to get smart and get tough fast so that this weekend\u2019s attacks do not become the new normal here as it has in Europe and other parts of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03907e4b051672d9f7e2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T19:14:52.227Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News Channel host and future press secretary Sean Hannity will host a town-hall meeting with Donald Trump in Ohio on Wednesday, according to Politico:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hannity will do a Town Hall with Trump this Wednesday in Ohio</p>&mdash; Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hadas_Gold/status/777948042859257856\">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e03541e4b0ef60eaef0f33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-19T18:58:18.398Z\">7.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bernie Sanders is feeling the...

  "<p>A UN aid convoy delivering food relief to a rebel-held area near Aleppo was targeted in an airstrike, as a week-old ceasefire brokered by Russia and the US collapsed with a new surge of Syrian government bombing. </p> <p>The US said it blamed Russia for the attack on the convoy, whether or not Russian planes were involved, arguing Moscow was responsible under the ceasefire agreement for reining in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government forces. </p> <p>The attack on the convoy, made up of Syrian Red Crescent trucks carrying UN-supplied food, was reported to have killed at least 12 people and destroyed 18 trucks laden with food intended for tens of thousands of people cut off by the war in a rural area west of Aleppo city. </p> <p>Aid officials said it was hit from the air while unloading food at a warehouse in opposition controlled Urem al-Kubra. Early reports suggested most of the dead were Syrian Red Crescent drivers.</p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN\u2019s emergency relief coordinator, said that the convoy had been clearly marked and its route had been provided to all parties to the conflict. </p> <p>\u201cLet me be clear: if this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/syria-unsarc-convoy-hit-urum-al-kubra-northwest-aleppo-city\">O\u2019Brien said</a>. \u201cI call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident.

But later on Monday, with the ceasefire just short of a week old, the Syrian army issued a statement blaming \u201cterrorist groups\u201d for hundreds of alleged violations and saying it would no longer observe the truce. The US-Russian ceasefire \u201cwas supposed to be a real chance to stop the bloodshed, but the armed terrorist groups flouted this agreement,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>However both Kerry and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said Russia and its Syrian government allies had been responsible for the most serious violations.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality, according to the information we are getting from the ground, is that violations of the ceasefire are acts of the regime,\u201d Ayrault told reporters at the sidelines of a UN general assembly meeting in New York. </p> <p>The Syrian army declaration followed the bombing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/week-old-syrian-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance\">Syrian army positions</a> around Deir ez-Zour by western coalition forces including the US, Britain, Denmark and Australia. The countries involved have said the strikes were aimed at Islamic State frontline positions and unintentionally hit Syrian troops as they fought to take those positions on Tharda mountain.</p> <p>Russia has said the strikes killed 62 Syrian soldiers and injured about 100 others, and the Syrian government has described the bombing as \u201con purpose and planned in advance\u201d.</p> <p>The collapse of the ceasefire came just as humanitarian convoys had restarted to some of the 18 civilian enclaves cut off by the war, 15 of which are besieged by Syrian government forces and their allies, according to the UN. Aid officials had been optimistic than two convoys of 20 trucks each might finally reach 250,000 besieged in rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo. </p> <p>Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the humanitarian advisor to the UN special envoy for Syria, said the Aleppo convoys had been set to depart early on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>But Egeland told the Guardian: \u201cIt hinges on so little now.

The call he\u2019s made is one of those that will get a bit of criticism to begin with, but will be vindicated over time.</p> <p>\u201cThe cul-de-sac this government finds itself in is so much worse than I think people appreciate, and things are going to get a whole lot worse before they get better, and I think the public appetite will grow, in terms of what it means for themselves and their families at the end of the process.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg refused to back the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/labour-urged-to-make-immigration-controls-a-key-brexit-demand\">calls by several centrist Labour MPs</a>, including Rachel Reeves and Stephen Kinnock, for the government to insist on controls on freedom of movement as a key part of any Brexit deal. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful if you\u2019re Labour. You\u2019re not going to win a Dutch auction with the Conservatives or Ukip over immigration,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>In his conference speech on Tuesday, Farron will blame the outcome of the referendum vote on \u201cthe calculating forces of darkness who care nothing for the working people of this country, nothing for our NHS, nothing for those who struggle to get by and who exploited that anger to win an exit from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> that will hurt the poorest the hardest\u201d.</p> <p>He will say: \u201cWhen Theresa May does agree a deal with the EU, we want the people to decide.

Just 22% of those polled by Ipsos Mori said Farron was doing his job well as leader of the party while one in three said they were dissatisfied.</p> <p>Almost half of those surveyed said \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d, when asked how well Farron was doing, an indication that the leader has barely raised his public profile since last year. When asked to compare Farron with the Liberal Democrat party, just 23% stated that they like the leader but slightly more \u2013 28% \u2013 said that they liked the party, with no change from last year\u2019s conference. </p>",

He is being held on $5.2m bail.</p> <p>A businessman in Linden, New Jersey, found and reported Rahami asleep in the doorway of his bar, the town\u2019s mayor, Derek Armstead, said on Monday morning. When police arrived, Rahami pulled a gun and shot an officer, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, in the torso. Officers then joined in a running gun battle down the street and brought down Rahami, police captain James Sarnicki said.</p> <p>Another officer was grazed on the hand by a bullet, officials said, and both were expected to recover. Rahami was shot in the leg and underwent surgery, FBI agent Bill Sweeney said. He would not answer questions about any possible links to other people or groups, but said, \u201cI have no indication that there\u2019s a cell operating in the area or in the city,\u201d with the caveat that \u201cthe investigation is ongoing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/19/us-authorities-investigating-new-jersey-explosive-devices-live-updates\">New York bombings: Ahmad Khan Rahami in custody after shootout \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Fears of an active terror cell grew earlier on Monday morning when five other suspicious devices were found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and one exploded as the bomb squad attempted to disarm it with a robot.

When Rahami returned, he \u201cgot more religious\u201d and dressed differently than before, Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was more quiet and more mature,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, where have you been?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, vacation.\u2019 But I knew he went to Afghanistan because his little brother said it.\u201d</p> <p>A Democratic New Jersey congressman, Albio Sires, said Rahami contacted his office from Pakistan in 2014 seeking help because his wife had an expired Pakistani passport. Sires said his office wrote a letter to the US embassy in Pakistan to check on the status of the case and the woman eventually received a visa. He said he didn\u2019t know if she ever came to the country, and the FBI didn\u2019t answer when asked on Monday.</p> <p>Speaking in a televised address to the country, Barack Obama stressed that the three east coast incidents were not thought to be directly linked to a separate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-stabbing-somali-americans-suspect-name\">stabbing incident at a shopping mall in Minnesota</a>, but this too was being investigated as a separate possible act of terrorism.</p> <p>The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the stabbing rampage, in which a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people before being shot dead by an off-duty police officer on Saturday. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.</p> <p>Amid mounting concern that the series of apparent terrorism incidents could provide political ammunition for Donald Trump, Obama called on Americans to show the world that \u201cwe do not give into fear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt moments like this it is important to remember what terrorist and violent extremists are trying to do,\u201d the president said in a televised statement in New York. \u201cThey are trying to hurt innocent people but they also want to inspire fear in all of us and disrupt the way we live and undermine our values.

  "<p>Inspired by the example set by the European Union, support for free trade and movement is growing in Africa. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/2016/08/30/visa-free-entry-for-africans-benin-follows-rwanda-s-lead/\">Rwanda and Benin</a> have announced plans to allow visa-free entry, while Zimbabwe has lifted visa restrictions for citizens travelling <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201603070815.html\">from within the South Africa Development Community</a>, which includes 15 countries in the region<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In July, the African Union also announced it had finally agreed on an all-Africa passport to finally do away with visa restrictions.

He stressed that while international media has focused on mass migration from Africa to Europe, 80% of Africans who migrate do so within the continent, with less than 20% travelling to Europe.</p> <p>This has brought serious problems, most recently with a spate of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, which has the second biggest migrant population on the continent after Ivory Coast. About 300 businesses run by migrants were destroyed, and workers from countries such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique were attacked.</p> <h2>Real unity?</h2> <p>So amid optimistic talk of a \u201cUnited States of Africa\u201d, critics have been quick to point out that the union has been catastrophically weak in dealing with continental crises and supporting populations under attack.</p> <p>Though it has deployed peacekeeping forces to Somalia and Darfur, and has recently agreed <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/19/486592426/african-union-approves-plan-to-put-peacekeeping-force-in-south-sudan\">to send troops to South Sudan</a>, it has been accused of largely ignoring the brutal <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mali-rebels-africa-idUKBRE90Q06Z20130127\">jihadi occupation in northern Mali</a>, <a href=\"http://newafricanmagazine.com/ebola-au-done-enough/\">the deadly Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, and failing to hold \u201cpresidents for life\u201d to account.</p> <p>This ambiguous approach to democratic principles has led to a situation in which Chad\u2019s president, Idriss D\u00e9by, who recently extended his 26-year rule amid accusations of vote rigging, intimidation and holding \u201cthe whole country hostage\u201d, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/chads-president-set-to-mediate-in-disputed-gabon-election\">mediating</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/gabon-election-results-disputed-incumbent-ali-bongo-victor-jean-ping\">an election crisis in Gabon</a>. </p> <p>Dapo Oyewole, director of the Policy Development Network, said the AU needs to change its image if it is to truly bring about continental unity. </p> <p> \u201cThe African Union needs to become much more active and meaningfully relevant in the day-to-day life of average Africans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to become an accessible and responsive platform for actualising collective aspirations and not just like a club of African leaders.\u201d<br></p> <p>But the new project shows promise says Imad Mesdoua, an Algerian political analyst based in London. \u201cThe new inter-African passport is proof that member states are genuine about making integration a reality,\u201d he said, but added \u201cmore needs to be done and at a much faster pace.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ever since the European court ordered Google to delist a 16-year-old article about a bankruptcy, web watchers have wondered how the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 would evolve.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/spain-everyman-google-mario-costeja-gonzalez\">Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez</a>\u2019s \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/may/14/mario-costeja-gonzalez-fight-right-forgotten\">Data and Goliath\u2019 victory in 2014</a> in Spain has meant that human concepts of fairness are now applied to Google Search, which is subject to European data protection laws.</p> <p>But there are now worrying new signs from Europe that the right is being applied directly against news websites and not just search engines.</p> <p>The highest court in Italy recently upheld a ruling that, after a period of two years, an article in an online news archive had expired, \u201cjust like milk, yoghurt or a pint of ice-cream\u201d.</p> <p>This is a significant departure from previous applications of the right, which have always distinguished between delisting Google search results and removing content at source. Unlike previous courts, the Roman court has blamed the source, not the messenger.</p> <p>The news website in question, <a href=\"http://www.primadanoi.it/\">\u2018Primadanoi\u2019</a> (\u2018The First Among Us\u2019), a small website in Abruzzo, is outraged and has re-christened the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 (\u2018il diritto d\u2019oblio\u2019 in Italian), \u2018the crime of oblivion\u2019 (\u2018il delitto d\u2019oblio\u2019). Having had a sell-by date applied to its journalism, Primadanoi, is indeed now \u2018The First Among Us\u2019, but not in the way it would like.</p> <p>This latest story begins on 23 March 2006 when Primadanoi published an article about a criminal case involving a restaurant owner. That is all we know about the article because the court has both redacted the names of the parties and omitted any reference to why the article was, in its view, \u2018particularly sensitive\u2019.</p> <p>The owner didn\u2019t like it, or more specifically, didn\u2019t like it when, if people googled him or his restaurant, Google helpfully served up Primadanoi\u2019s article along with adverts for his business. He demanded Primadanoi remove it.</p> <p>When it refused, he issued legal proceedings, claiming reputational damage, privacy infringement and violation of his \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 \u2013 even though the latter had never been applied against a news website.</p> <p>Primadanoi relented and, six months after the request, removed the article. But the owner was not at all <em tabindex=\"-1\">felice</em> with the six-month delay (a long time in pasta sales?) and pursued the website to court in Ortona, demanding compensation.</p> <p>The judge ordered Primadanoi to pay him and the restaurant \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,300) each, even confiscating the editor\u2019s car as security. When Primadanoi appealed, the second court, at Chieti agreed that the newspaper\u2019s right to freedom of expression had expired after two years, and punishment was apt for the six-month delay.</p> <p>The website appealed to the supreme court of cassation in Rome, which said the complaint was \u2018well-founded\u2019 and the punishment fair.</p> <p>In their ruling \u2013 which will cast a chill among journalists everywhere \u2013 the judges in Rome attached great importance to the availability of the archived article via Google Search, stressing that online material needs treating differently because, even if archived, it is \u201cconsultable simply by typing the name of the claimant and the name of the restaurant into the Google search engine\u201d.</p> <p>But, unlike their previous European counterparts, they failed to consider the alternative, as explained in the original Google Spain ruling, that: \u201cpublishers of websites have the option of indicating to operators of search engines, by means of particular exclusion protocols, such as \u2018robot.txt\u2019 or codes such as \u2018noindex\u2019 or \u2018noarchive\u2019, that they wish specific information published on their site to be wholly or partially excluded from search engines\u2019 automatic indexes\u201d.</p> <p>This failure to distinguish between source and search engine caused Primadanoi to thunder that \u2018Italian law does not understand technology or the internet\u2019.</p> <p>And indeed, the judgment does read like a proper legal mix-up, blending different areas of law (libel, privacy and data protection) into a novelty soup where separate causes of action with distinct defences and protections float about indistinguishably.</p> <p>Consequently, in Italy at least, \u2018the right to be forgotten\u2019 now has a new meaning: the right to remove inconvenient journalism from archives after two years<em>.</em></p> <p>This surely cannot be right. If it was, everyone would demand deletions from news websites and online journalism would be decimated.</p> <p>The law provides journalists with exemptions that are not available to other processors of data, such as robotic search engines. Otherwise newspapers would be empty and society starved of information.</p> <p>In Italian law, this allows for the use of data \u201cin the exercise of the profession of journalism and for the exclusive pursuit of the relevant goals\u201d.</p> <p>Primadanoi repeatedly argued this exemption in court. And given that the exemption applies to processing legal data and processing of sensitive data, you would have thought they had a point.</p> <p>Not according to the supreme court, which basically ignored it. The reason they could do so, it seems, is a flaw in the protection offered to journalists by Italian law, once articles are no longer current.</p> <p>As with English law, the Italian code dictates that \u2018data must be kept in a form which allows identification for a period of time not beyond that which is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected.\u2019</p> <p>However, unlike in England, journalism is not exempted from this \u2018time limit\u2019, placing Italian journalists at a significant disadvantage to their English counterparts, who can, under the Data Protection Act, keep using and publishing the data if they have a reasonable belief that publication is in the public interest.</p> <p>This leaves Italian editors vulnerable to arguments that their product has \u2018now been published for long enough\u2019 and must be taken down.</p> <p>Indeed, the supreme court followed precisely this reasoning in concluding: \u201cThe time passed between the date it [the article] was first published and the date when its removal was requested, sufficed to satisfy the public interest as far as its right to be informed was concerned, and that therefore, at least from the date when the formal notice was received, that data could no longer be disclosed.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the \u2018out of date\u2019 stamp issued to a two-year-old article will now be applied elsewhere remains to be seen.</p> <p>It will be a case of watch this URL \u2013 but if you\u2019re reading from Italy, you\u2019d better be quick, before it goes off.</p> <p><em>Athalie Matthews is an in-house lawyer at Guardian News and Media</em></p>",

Schools ultimately deliver academic success, the Finns would agree - and there has been intense worldwide interest in how they manage it (see below) \u2013 but they would also argue that groundwork for good school performance begins earlier, long before children enter formal school, and arguably while their future pupils are still in nappies.</p> <p>Central to early years education in Finland is a \u201clate\u201d start to schooling. At Franzenia, as in all Finnish daycare centres, the emphasis is not on maths, reading or writing (children receive no formal instruction in these until they are seven and in primary school) but creative play. This may surprise UK parents, assailed as they are by the notion of education as a competitive race. In Finland, they are more relaxed: \u201cWe believe children under seven are not ready to start school,\u201d says Tiina Marjoniemi, the head of the centre. \u201cThey need time to play and be physically active. It\u2019s a time for creativity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8994e410b1742fc0111c64d8d98caff9595c959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8994e410b1742fc0111c64d8d98caff9595c959/0_54_2448_3060/800.jpg\" alt=\"Staff and children\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franzenia daycare centre, Helsinki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karin Hannukainen/University of Helsinki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed the main aim of early years education is not explicitly \u201ceducation\u201d in the formal sense but the promotion of the health and wellbeing of every child. Daycare is to help them develop good social habits: to learn how to make friends and respect others, for example, or to dress themselves competently. Official guidance also emphasises the importance in pre-school of the \u201cjoy of learning\u201d, language enrichment and communication. There is an emphasis on physical activity (at least 90 minutes outdoor play a day). \u201cKindergarten in Finland doesn\u2019t focus on preparing children for school academically,\u201d writes the Finnish educational expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pasi-sahlberg\">Pasi Sahlberg</a>. \u201cInstead the main goal is to make sure that the children are happy and responsible individuals.\u201d</p> <p>Play, nonetheless, is a serious business, at least for the teachers, because it gives children vital skills in how to learn. Franzenia has 44 staff working with children, of whom 16 are kindergarten teachers (who have each completed a three-year specialist degree), and 28 nursery nurses (who have a two-year vocational qualification). The staff-child ratio is 1:4 for under-threes and 1:7 for the older children. Great care is taken to plan not just what kind of play takes place \u2013 there is a mix of \u201cfree play\u201d and teacher-directed play - but to assess how children play. The children\u2019s development is constantly evaluated. \u201cIt\u2019s not just random play, it\u2019s learning through play,\u201d says Marjoniemi.</p> <p>Play at this stage of child development can successfully engage them in the process of learning, says <a href=\"http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/whitebread/\">David Whitebread</a>, director of the Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development &amp; Learning at the University of Cambridge. Once engaged in a task they enjoy, whether acting out a story or constructing a building, children become motivated to constantly refine and improve on their task and to increase the challenge. \u201cFrom a psychological point of view you can see how play can help children become powerful learners,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Carefully organised play helps develop qualities such as attention span, perseverance, concentration and problem solving, which at the age of four are stronger predictors of academic success than the age at which a child learns to read, says Whitebread. There is evidence that high-quality early years play-based learning not only enriches educational development but boosts attainment in children from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not possess the cultural capital enjoyed by their wealthier peers. Says Whitebread: \u201cThe better the quality of pre-school, the better the outcomes, both emotionally and socially and in terms of academic achievement.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/27/britain-borrowing-education-ideas-finland\">Britain should be wary of borrowing education ideas from abroad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Importantly, early years care in Finland is designed and funded to ensure high take-up: every child has a legal right to high-quality pre-school care. In Franzenia, as in all daycare centres, there are children from a mix of backgrounds. Fees, subsidised by the state, are capped at a maximum of \u20ac290 (\u00a3250) a month (free for those on low incomes) for five-day, 40 hours a week care. About 40% of 1-3-year-olds are in daycare and 75% of 3-5-year-olds. Optional pre-school at the age of six has a 98% take-up. Initially envisaged in the 70s as a way of getting mothers back into the workplace, daycare has also become, Marjoniemi says, about \u201clifelong learning and how we prepare young children\u201d.</p> <p>The time children spend in pre-school, with its emphasis on play and socialisation, are \u201cthe most important years\u201d, says Jaakko Salo, special adviser to the OAJ, the Finnish teachers\u2019 union. Finnish education is undergoing the biggest financial cuts in its history, with the latest round lopping \u20ac2bn, or 8%, off the budget, but early years and primary schools \u2013 the bedrock of the system and the point where learning skills can be most successfully embedded \u2013 have been relatively protected, according to the OAJ.</p> <p>Daycare is not the only factor underpinning academic success. Hard-wired into Finland\u2019s educational mission is the idea that equality is vital to economic success and societal wellbeing, as well as the belief that a small nation, reliant on creativity, ingenuity and solidarity to compete in the global economy, cannot afford inequality or segregation in schooling or health. Behind its stellar education ranking is a comprehensive social security and public health system that ensures one of the lowest child poverty rates in Europe, and some of the highest levels of wellbeing. Gunilla Holm, professor of education at the University of Helsinki, says: \u201cThe goal is that we should all progress together.\u201d</p> <h2>How it works<br></h2> <p>The success of Finland\u2019s comprehensive school system is a story now well-told. At the turn of the century, much to the surprise of the Finns, let alone the rest of the world, it emerged as a global leader in education. Pisa tests revealed Finnish pupils produced some of the world\u2019s highest scores in maths, science and reading. In the three subsequent reports, the <a href=\"http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=FIN&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=PI\">last in 2012</a>, the country\u2019s performance dropped slightly but it remains the highest-ranked in Europe.</p> <p>Its success came under a system built resolutely against the grain of prevailing education fashions adopted by developed countries, including the UK, in the 1980s and 90s. In Finland, children do not start formal academic learning until seven. Driven by a commitment to equality (on both moral and economic grounds), it outlaws school selection, formal examinations (until the age of 18) and streaming by ability. Competition, choice, privatisation and league tables do not exist. \u201cTeaching to the test\u201d is an alien concept. Grammar schools, the UK government\u2019s current obsession, were abolished decades ago. Free school meals, tentatively endorsed for younger pupils only in the UK, are universally provided.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53xqx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2717686\"            data-video-name=\"Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools? \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d93571e4b05caf65ecd196\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/14/160914grammarsfinal.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2016/sep/14/why-does-theresa-may-want-to-bring-back-grammar-schools-video-explainer\">Why does Theresa May want to bring back grammar schools?</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/15/children-learn-play-age-eight-lego\">Children should learn mainly through play until age of eight, says Lego</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those elements of British schooling that cause most parental anxiety \u2013 will my child get into a \u201cgood school\u201d, will they get into a top set, will they get a good Sats score \u2013 are largely absent in Finland. Differences in educational outcomes between individual schools in most areas are relatively trivial, meaning parents rarely send their children farther afield than the local comprehensive. Pupils are generally more content too: a quality-not-quantity approach means school hours are shorter and homework duties are light. After-school tutoring is rare. Finnish children are happier and less stressed than their British contemporaries.</p> <p>As UK educational policy becomes more narrow and centrally prescribed, Finland devolves more power to teachers and pupils to design and direct learning. Teachers are well paid, well-trained (they must complete a five-year specialist degree), respected by parents and valued and trusted by politicians. There is no Ofsted-style inspection of schools and teachers, but a system of self-assessment. Educational policy and teaching is heavily research-based.</p> <p>Worried that its sliding Pisa scores reflected a complacency in its schools, national curriculum changes were introduced this year: these now devote more time to art and crafts. Creativity is the watchword. Core competences include \u201clearning-to learn\u201d, multiliteracy, digital skills and entrepreneurship. At the heart of the new curriculum, the National Board of Education says unashamedly, is the \u201cjoy of learning.\u201d</p>",

There is fragmentation out there that is leaving scope for galloping populism. The people of Europe don\u2019t want this petty envy between the various institutions.

  "<h2>Up on the roof in Stockholm<br></h2> <p>\u201cAre you scared of heights?\u201d my guide Veerle, a Belgian transplant who has been running tours in Stockholm since 2007, asks as she double-checks my safety harness. I meet her eyes with a smile and before I answer, she responds: \u201cI can tell you\u2019re not\u201d.</p> <p>Helmets fastened, we climb out of an attic-like hatch onto narrow mesh metal rails. We clip on our carabiners which are roped to a 250-metre metal wire track running along the base of those rails. We drag our ropes alongside us as we begin our 43-metre high walk across the 19th century rooftops of the Old Parliament House (Gamla riksdagshuset) on Riddarholmen island in Stockholm.</p> <p>The Old Parliament opened in 1833 and served as the seat of Sweden\u2019s government until 1905. Its iconic national romantic style waterfront facade of burnt orange and pale green towers was added in 1911. Today, it serves as a courthouse.</p> <p>Stockholm is spread across 14 islands interlinked by 57 bridges, waterways, and pedestrian paths, and seeing it from the vantage of a rooftop gives a real sense of its maritime geography. From my starting spot high above Riddarholmen, I watch Baltic cruise ships sail into the harbour next to Gamla stan (Stockholm\u2019s medieval old town) to my left, and docked boat hotels bob gently along Lake M\u00e4laren to my right. Mustard yellow and pale ochre buildings with charcoal-coloured roofs dot the islands like toy houses.</p> <p>We start with what I consider the easiest stretch of the walk \u2013 short climbs up and down two metal ladders with south side views towards Stockholm\u2019s hipster island, S\u00f6dermalm.</p> <p>Seven storeys up, exposed to the elements with chilly gusts of wind whipping around us, I begin to question my comfort with heights. At which point I have to tackle the most hair-raising walkway, testing my nonexistent tightrope walking skills. Veerle offers up some navigational advice. \u201cTry going sideways, it\u2019s easier that way.\u201d I shuffle along the narrowest edge of the parliament building, side-stepping like a crab, not daring to look down.</p> <p>Once across, I check my nerves and am instantly rewarded with views of Kungsholmen island and Stadshuset (city hall), another iconic building marked by a 106-metre tower where the Nobel Prize banquet takes place each year.</p> <p>A few short steps up and I am now on the final stretch of the circuit, back towards our opening hatch, balancing with no hand support, walking down rails across the roof which now slopes sharply down on both sides, and picture-perfect views of Gamla stan ahead.</p> <p>Exhilaration courses through me and I turn to Veerle with a cheesy grin across my face.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she smiles back before I utter a word. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get off the roof.\u201d<br>\u2022 <em>The tour runs twice daily in July and August (rest of the year weekends only), 10am and 4pm.

If you compare the city to 15 years ago, people are wearing less fragrance, cars have become much cleaner and there are fewer large trucks. Many buses are now electric.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not the world\u2019s first smells tour, however; the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/19/victoria-henshaw\">urban planner and academic Victoria Henshaw</a> led similar expeditions around cities such as Edinburgh, Seattle and Barcelona.</p> <p>\u201cWhen does a smell belong to a city?\u201d Quinn asks the group on our first stop, a Turkish bakery. \u201cMigration changes the way a city smells. Some people might not think a Turkish bakery is a Viennese smell, but I think it is. All products are new at first, and then become normal. Coffee was originally a Turkish import but we couldn\u2019t imagine Vienna without it now.\u201d</p> <p>Vienna is more multicultural than many may think. Around 50% of residents have a migrant background, says Quinn, originally from Britain.</p> <p>The tour also takes in two of Vienna\u2019s famous institutions: the Ottakringer brewery and the Manner chocolate wafer factory. While discussing the significance of the smells, Quinn interjects with personal stories, including one about a friend who loved the smell of chocolate so much she moved, to live closer to the factory.</p> <p>Later on, the group pauses for breath at a public toilet in Yppenplatz, the square near the popular Brunnenmarkt. This is one of Vienna\u2019s \u201cfancy\u201d toilets, kitted out with bird sounds and forest wallpaper. As Quinn explains, Vienna \u2013 which has the most public toilets of all metropolitan cities in Europe \u2013 has a special fondness for its waste management department, which \u201cbrings charisma to neighbourhoods.\u201d</p> <p>The monthly walking tour lasts about four hours, ending at Kaffee Alt Wien in the city centre. Not just for tourists, it\u2019s for the Viennese as well. \u201cThe tour is a complete exploration of Vienna for visitors and locals,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cBecause if you spend too long in a place, you don\u2019t notice the smells any more.\u201d<br>\u2022 <em>The tour costs \u20ac5pp and next take place on 7 October and 4 November, </em><a href=\"http://spaceandplace.at/SmellslikeWienSpirit\"><em>spaceandplace.at</em></a><br><strong>Maddy French</strong></p> <h2>A drag queen\u2019s tour of Hamburg</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bf0fc3a9381e06196abfbc3fd1cc5f0d58975df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf0fc3a9381e06196abfbc3fd1cc5f0d58975df/0_0_1800_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Jones bar, Hamburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Looking for an induction into Hamburg\u2019s adult night life?

  "<p>First, the myths. There are no \u201csuper rats\u201d. Apart from a specific subtropical breed, they do not get much bigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/11/fake-giant-rat-picture-internet\">than 20 inches long, including the tail</a>. They are not blind, nor are they afraid of cats. They do not carry rabies. They do not, as was reported in 1969 regarding an island in Indonesia, fall from the sky. Their communities are not led by elusive, giant \u201cking rats\u201d. Rat skeletons cannot liquefy and reconstitute at will. (For some otherwise rational people, this is a genuine concern.) They are not indestructible, and there are not as many of them as we think. The one-rat-per-human in New York City estimate is pure fiction. Consider this the good news.</p> <p>In most other respects, \u201cthe rat problem\u201d, as it has come to be known, is a perfect nightmare. Wherever humans go, rats follow, forming shadow cities under our metropolises and hollows beneath our farmlands. They thrive in our squalor, making homes of our sewers, abandoned alleys, and neglected parks. They poison food, bite babies, undermine buildings, spread disease, decimate crop yields, and <em>very</em> occasionally eat people alive.<strong> </strong>A male and female left to their own devices for one year \u2013 the average lifespan of a city rat \u2013 can beget 15,000 descendants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"A new way of controlling rat numbers.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F565004370353997%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400\" style=\"max-width:400px;max-height:400px\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There may be no \u201cking rat\u201d, but there are \u201crat kings\u201d, groups of up to 30 rats whose tails have knotted together to form one giant, swirling mass. Rats may be unable to liquefy their bones to slide under doors, but they don\u2019t need to: their skeletons are so flexible that they can squeeze their way through any hole or crack wider than half an inch. They are cannibals, and they sometimes laugh <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rats-laugh-but-not-like-human/\">(sort of)</a> \u2013 especially when tickled. They can appear en masse, as if from nowhere, moving as fast as seven feet per second. They do not carry rabies, but a 2014 study from Columbia University found that the average New York City subway rat carried 18 viruses previously unknown to science, along with dozens of familiar, dangerous pathogens, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/11/health.medicineandhealth1\">C difficile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/hepatitis-c\">hepatitis C</a>. As recently as 1994 there was a major recurrence of bubonic plague in India, an unpleasant flashback to the 14th century, when that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook\">rat-borne illness</a> killed 25 million people in five years. Collectively, rats are responsible for more human death than any other mammal on earth.</p> <p>Humans have a peculiar talent for exterminating other species. In the case of rats, we have been pursuing their total demise for centuries. We have invented elaborate, gruesome traps. We have trained dogs, ferrets, and cats to kill them. We have invented ultrasonic machines to drive them away with high-pitched noise. (Those machines, still popular, do not work.) We have poisoned them in their millions. In 1930, faced with a rat infestation on Rikers Island, New York City officials flushed the area with mustard gas. In the late 1940s, scientists developed anticoagulants to treat thrombosis in humans, and some years later supertoxic versions of the drugs were developed in order to kill rats by making them bleed to death from the inside after a single dose. Cityscapes and farmlands were drenched with thousands of tons of these chemicals. During the 1970s, we used DDT. These days, rat poison is not just sown in the earth by the truckload, it is rained from helicopters that track the rats with radar \u2013 in 2011 80 metric tonnes of poison-laced bait were dumped on to Henderson Island, home to one of the last untouched coral reefs in the South Pacific. In 2010, Chicago officials went \u201cnatural\u201d: figuring a natural predator might track and kill rats, they released 60 coyotes wearing radio collars on to the city streets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is it that we can send robots to Mars and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, here they are. According to Bobby Corrigan, the world\u2019s leading expert on rodent control, many of the world\u2019s great cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/dec/01/homes\">remain totally overcome</a>. \u201cIn New York \u2013 we\u2019re losing that war in a big way,\u201d he told me. Combat metaphors have become a central feature of rat conversation among pest control professionals. In Robert Sullivan\u2019s 2014 book Rats, he described humanity\u2019s relationship with the species as an \u201cunending and brutish war\u201d, a battle we seem always, always to lose.</p> <p>Why? How is it that we can send robots to Mars, build the internet, keep alive infants born so early that their skin isn\u2019t even fully made \u2013 and yet remain unable to keep rats from threatening our food supplies, biting our babies, and appearing in our toilet bowls?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cFrankly, rodents are the most successful species,\u201d Loretta Mayer told me recently. \u201cAfter the next holocaust, rats and Twinkies will be the only things left.\u201d Mayer is a biologist, and she contends that the rat problem is actually a human problem, a result of our foolish choices and failures of imagination. In 2007, she co-founded <a href=\"http://senestech.com/\">SenesTech</a>, a biotech startup that offers the promise of an armistice in a conflict that has lasted thousands of years. The concept is simple: rat birth control</p> <p>The rat\u2019s primary survival skill, as a species, is its unnerving rate of reproduction. Female rats ovulate every four days, copulate dozens of times a day and remain fertile until they die. (Like humans, they have sex for pleasure as well as for procreation.) This is how you go from two to 15,000 in a single year. When poison or traps thin out a population, they mate faster until their numbers regenerate. Conversely, if you can keep them from mating, colonies collapse in weeks and do not rebound.</p> <p>Solving the rat problem by putting them on the pill sounds ridiculous. Until recently no pharmaceutical product existed that could make rats infertile, and even if it had, there was still the question of how it could be administered. But if such a thing were to work, the impact could be historic. Rats would die off without the need for poison, radar or coyotes.</p> <p>SenesTech, which is based in Flagstaff, Arizona, claims to have created a liquid that will do exactly that. In tests conducted in Indonesian rice fields, South Carolina pig farms, the suburbs of Boston and the New York City subway, the product, called ContraPest, caused a drop in rat populations of roughly 40% in 12 weeks. This autumn, for the first time, the company is making ContraPest available to commercial markets in the US and Europe. The team at SenesTech believes it could be the first meaningful advance in the fight against rats in a hundred years, and the first viable alternative to poison. Mayer was blunt about the implications: \u201cThis will <em>change the world</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer is a tall, vigorous woman in her mid-60s with bright eyes, spiky grey hair and a toothy grin. Her ideologies of choice are Buddhism and the Girl Scouts. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my core,\u201d she said of the latter, \u201cto do for others.\u201d In conversation, her manner is so upbeat that she seems to be holding forth radiantly before an audience or on the verge of bursting into song. When asked how she is doing, she frequently responds in a near-rapture: \u201cIf I was any better, I\u2019d be a twin!\u201d \u2013 she also appears to enjoy watching people wonder whether this is an expression they should know.</p> <p>When I took a seat in her office earlier this year, she clapped her hands triumphantly and said \u201cOoh! You\u2019re sitting in history and strength!\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI had a feng shui person come and do my office,\u201d she explained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b798d3f033b23f8db96dce47e9731cf2550c1f63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b798d3f033b23f8db96dce47e9731cf2550c1f63/0_40_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loretta Mayer, CEO of SensTech, holds up a test cup of the company\u2019s rat contraceptive formula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loretta Mayer, CEO of SensTech, holds up a test cup of the company\u2019s rat contraceptive formula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taylor Mahoney/SenesTech</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mayer came to science later than usual, in her mid-40s, after a career in real estate development and a stint as the international vice president of Soroptimist, a global volunteer organisation dedicated to improving the lives of women. The career change was unexpected, even to her. After a close friend died suddenly of a heart attack, Mayer called up a biologist she knew and asked how something like this could have happened. The biologist had no satisfying answer; she explained that while heart disease in men had been thoroughly studied, little attention had been devoted to post-menopausal heart disease in women. \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to change it,\u201d Mayer replied, outraged. The biologist was otherwise occupied, so Mayer decided to do it herself. At 46, she entered a PhD programme in biology at Northern Arizona University.</p> <p>After graduate school, her initial research as a professor of biology at Northern Arizona focused on artificially inducing menopause in lab mice so that she could study changes in the postmenopausal heart. Three years into her efforts, Mayer was contacted by Patricia Hoyer, a colleague in Phoenix, who said that she had stumbled across a chemical that seemed to make mice infertile, without having any other effects. Together, Mayer and Hoyer synthesised a new compound, which they called Mouseopause.</p> <p>Shortly after Mayer and Hoyer published their work on Mouseopause in 2005, Mayer received a telephone call from a veterinarian in Gallup, New Mexico, who had read about her research. The Navajo reservation where he worked was overrun by wild dogs. There were too many to spay and neuter, so he was euthanising almost 500 a month. \u201cIf you could do for a dog what you can do for a mouse, I could stop killing dogs out here,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Mayer describes herself as \u201cextremely connected to animals, dogs in particular\u201d. When she arrived in Gallup and saw the piled corpses, she agreed to test Mouseopause on an initial group of 18 reservation dogs. \u201cI held up that first puppy, who I called Patient Zero,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this is gonna do to you, but you will live on a satin pillow the rest of your days.\u201d The injection made the dogs infertile, but left them otherwise happy and healthy. (Mayer brought home all 18 dogs and built a kennel in her yard to house them until she could find homes for them with families she knew personally. Patient Zero, renamed Cheetah, lived with her until she died of old age \u2013 though the pillow was fleece.)</p> <p>The next call came from Australia in 2006. Biologists there wanted an adaptation of Mouseopause for rats. Rats, they told her, were eating 30% of the rice crop in Australia and Indonesia. If she could reduce the rat population by even half, they claimed, the crops that would be saved could feed millions of people.</p> <p>Mayer was moved by the idea of finding a solution to rat overpopulation that was neither lethal nor toxic. Since its invention, rat poison has been our primary method of curbing rat populations, but it is dangerous. Ingested in high doses, it\u2019s fatal to humans, and it poses a particular to children because it is sweet and brightly coloured. In the US alone, more than 12,000 children per year, most of whom live below the poverty line, are accidentally poisoned by pesticide meant for rats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/14/man-v-rat-could-the-long-war-soon-be-over-podcast\">Man v rat: could the long war soon be over? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The collateral damage inflicted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/trouble-in-paradise-lord-howe-island-divided-over-plan-to-exterminate-rats\">rat poison also extends to the environment</a>, leaching into the soil and poisoning house pets, farm animals, and wildlife that feed on rats. Worst of all, rat poison is not very effective at eliminating large infestations. As long as there is still a food source, colonies bounce back, and, especially in Europe, rats have grown resistant to the toxins. As Mayer often says, \u201cDoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results: isn\u2019t that the definition of insanity?\u201d</p> <p>Persuaded by the research, and by her wife, fellow biologist Cheryl Dyer, Mayer decided to devote her career to developing a new, smarter way to control the rat population. In 2007, they founded SenesTech. \u201cPeople say never to invest with a husband and wife team,\u201d Mayer joked to me. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh absolutely not! Then you have dominance.\u2019 But wife and wife? Works great!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For Dyer and Mayer, the immediate problem was obvious: while the lab mice and feral dogs had received injections in controlled studies, wild rats would have to eat the formula of their own volition. Rats are neophobic \u2013 they avoid what they don\u2019t know. What\u2019s more, city rats are already well fed. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/new-york-city-rats-evicted\">New York City</a>, for example, they have fresh bagels, pizza, melted ice cream and fried chicken in unending supply. To succeed, Dyer and Mayer had to make the compound not just edible but delicious.</p> <p>After a series of tests, they quickly settled on a liquid, rather than solid, formulation. Rats have to drink 10% of their body weight every day to survive, and so are always looking out for something potable. \u201cWe compared the [two] and they peed on the solid and drank the liquid,\u201d Dyer told me. \u201cRats are pretty straightforward.\u201d</p> <p>Where Mayer is tall and voluble, Dyer is short and broad-shouldered, quiet and succinct. She seems most comfortable behind the scenes, if only because it is easier to get away with wearing Hawaiian-print shirts and no shoes. At SenesTech\u2019s headquarters, Dyer\u2019s windowless office is right next to Mayer\u2019s, and if Mayer\u2019s office evokes Zen, Dyer\u2019s evokes an island paradise. Scenes from Hawaii cover her walls, hula (and rat) figurines line the shelves, and on her desk sits a small wooden sign, which says, \u201cWELCOME TO THE TIKI BAR.\u201d There is also a widescreen TV, on which Dyer likes to watch old movies on mute all day.</p> <p>It was Dyer\u2019s job to make Mouseopause palatable for rats \u2013 a tricky proposition because its active ingredient, 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), is bitter and caustic. Rats have the same taste preferences as humans \u2013 they love fat and sugar \u2013 though Dyer\u2019s experiments with various flavour profiles indicated that their appetite for both exceeds ours.</p> <p>She was also tasked with the greater challenge of adapting Mouseopause to work on rats, which are much hardier than mice. While VCD caused the eggs in mouse ovaries to degenerate rapidly, female rats were far less susceptible. Hoping for a compound effect, Dyer added a second active ingredient: triptolide, which stunted any growing eggs. The results were better, but still not good enough. \u201cThey just had smaller litters, goddammit,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eventually, out of a mix of curiosity and desperation, she fed it to both males and females. The result was dramatic. It turns out that the triptolide destroyed sperm \u2013 the males became sterile almost immediately after ingesting the formula. This was a total surprise: no one had ever tested triptolide on male rats before. It was \u201cstunning\u201d, Dyer told me. \u201cTotally unpredictable.\u201d Test after test: no pups. She sighed. \u201cMan, you should have seen the No Pup party.\u201d After three years of research and development, they had a product that worked and did not harm other animals. (The active ingredients are metabolised by the rat\u2019s body in 10 minutes, which means that any predator that eats it is not affected, and the compound quickly breaks down into inactive ingredients when it hits soil or water.)</p> <p>ContraPest, the finished product, is viscous and sweet. Electric pink and opaque, it tastes like nine packets of saccharine blended into two tablespoons of kitchen oil. \u201cRats love it,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cLove it.\u201d Mayer, who taste-tested every version during the development process, could not say the same for herself.</p> <p>In 2013, New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) reached out to Mayer after hearing about SenesTech\u2019s early trials to ask whether the company would test ContraPest in New York\u2019s subways as part of a citywide effort to find new, more successful alternatives to poison. Many cities devote manpower and money to keeping the rats under control, but New York, which is more or less the rat capital of the western world, is the epicentre of anti-rat efforts. Every incoming mayor of New York declares his intentions for a vast rodenticide \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/01/michaelellison\">Giuliani even appointed a \u201crat czar\u201d</a> to oversee the carnage \u2013 only to leave the next guy even more to deal with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e032e663657a79a5b1a8811742b57d2844ee105f/40_0_3241_4052/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) rearing up.

(Norway rats, the species infesting New York, are not in fact the largest rat type.) They asked Mayer whether they should send a few New York rats on a plane to Arizona so that SenesTech could experiment with them before coming to New York. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d replied Mayer, amused. \u201cI never met a rat I couldn\u2019t sterilise.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer dispatched two of SenesTech\u2019s youngest scientists, women in their 20s, to New York in order to test whether the formula was appealing enough. Would New York rats prefer ContraPest to water or pizza? Wearing their best approximation of hazmat suits to protect themselves from the filth, the scientists patrolled the subway\u2019s trash storage rooms under Grand Central Station. They planted bait boxes filled with feed stations of ContraPest and then stood nearby, counting the rats that came in and out with clickers in order to track how many rats were taking the bait. For six months, they baited and counted, washing their suits at the end of each day in bleach.</p> <p>The two young women went home to Arizona with good news: not only did the New York rats drink ContraPest, the drink actually worked on them. The test confirmed the highest hopes of the company \u2013 there was an alternative to poison that would work, even in New York City, and they had found it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When humans and animals come together, there are choices. Mayer believes that if you understand the ecology of the animal and you understand your own ecology, then you and the animal will be able to coexist peacefully. After centuries of misperception and squeamishness, we finally have a good grasp of rat ecology. Now the problem may be our reluctance to look too carefully at ourselves.</p> <p>In his 1983 book More Cunning than Man, writer Robert Hendrickson lists \u201cthe obvious ways in which rats so well resemble humans: ferocity, omnivorousness, adaptability to all climes, migration from east to west in the life journey of their species, irresponsible fecundity in all seasons, with a seeming need to make genocidal war on their own kind.\u201d He describes rats and men alike as \u201cutterly destructive, both taking all other living things for their purposes.\u201d</p> <p>Humanity\u2019s long struggle with rats mostly signals the worst traits we share with them: our inability to live responsibly within our environment; our tendencies toward hedonism and greed; and our failures to look after the weakest among us. Getting rid of them means correcting ourselves first.</p> <p>SenesTech is not alone in its attempts to devise a more sustainable, responsible method of ending the rat problem. Its work is heir to an existing method: integrated pest management, or IPM, which holds that if humans \u2013 particularly city-dwellers \u2013 took more care with their environment, rats wouldn\u2019t thrive.</p> <p>IPM\u2019s most vocal advocate is Bobby Corrigan, who has brought its principles to farmlands and cities all over the world, most notably New York, which recently revised its rat control programme on his advice. Twice a year, he teaches the New York health department\u2019s \u201cRat Academy\u201d, a three-day training for industry professionals. This April, there were maybe 100 attendees wedged into wooden theatre seats in a downtown auditorium, holding weak coffee and spongy muffins.</p> <p>Corrigan is a thinnish, pale man, bald except for a low, wispy crown framing his ears. He spends his nights on the streets or in basement corners studying rats. Once, he lay in an alley with peanut butter spread around him all night so he could get good photographs. (\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t safe. Yes, they were urinating on me. In grad school, you do crazy things.\u201d) He regards his work with utmost seriousness.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s what health professionals do,\u201d he said to his audience by way of introduction. He pointed at a slide behind him and read aloud.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>We protect the roof over people\u2019s heads.</em><br><em> We protect the food they eat.</em><br><em> We protect their health, comfort and safety.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to pat us on the back. This is real. This is our job. [Rats] get on airplanes. They gnaw on wires. They cause diseases. To me, this is the shot heard round the world.\u201d Then he spent 20 minutes explaining how to divine information from rat droppings based on their moisture.</p> <p>As the day wore on, Corrigan\u2019s core message for his audience emerged: fighting rats means committing to holistic efforts, not looking for a quick, flashy fix. \u201cWe love to spritz problems away,\u201d Corrigan told me later. \u201cA chemical or a trap, it\u2019s a Band Aid, and they\u2019re Band Aids that come off very quickly.\u201d Instead, Corrigan argues that you first need to remove the rat\u2019s food, then remove the rat\u2019s shelter, and only then take lethal measures if you have to.</p> <p>In theory, this solution is simple. It does not involve radar or guns. Instead, it demands lids for the trash can, and caulking for the cracks in foundations, or \u201ckeeping our own little nests clean\u201d, as Corrigan says. It is the obvious answer, the one that has been sitting under our noses for centuries: stop feeding them, stop housing them, and they will go away on their own.</p> <p>The problem is that people, as a rule, prefer the quick fix. Setting out poison is easier; the ultrasonic machine looks cool. The sensible, labour-intensive option meets with resistance. Often, when Corrigan is called out to consult with a property owner, the owner rejects his advice, simply because following it would require too much thought, effort or expense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats. Rats are everybody\u2019s issue</p> <footer> <cite>Bobby Corrigan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And sometimes, even those who are willing to try his methods do not have the resources. Ricky Simeone, the director of pest control for New York\u2019s health department, explained to me that the neighbourhoods that struggle with the worst rat infestations are not the ones who file the most reports to his office. The poorest neighbourhoods are too overwhelmed with other social or economic problems to file complaints \u2013 or, worse, they accept rat infestation as one of the conditions of living in poverty.</p> <p>Corrigan confirmed that rats, especially in cities, affect the poor more than the rich, because effective pest control services are expensive. But he pointed out that no one totally escapes the rat problem, no matter how rich. Cities such as New York make evident a universal truth. \u201cWe\u2019re all holding hands whether we know it or like it. Your rats are my rats. If the city blows it off, the sewer rats become everybody\u2019s rats. Rats are everybody\u2019s issue.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone thinks, \u2018It\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d Corrigan continued. \u201cThey think, \u2018Oh I live in New York, no one can get rid of the rats in New York!\u2019\u201d He gave a short sigh. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we can do it alone, so we don\u2019t do anything as a group.\u201d As with all conditions that threaten everyone but torment the disadvantaged above all, the situation is not better because we are not better.</p> <p>\u201cHomo sapiens,\u201d Corrigan said to his audience at the Rat Academy. \u201cDoes anyone know what this means?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled a grim little smile. \u201cWise man.\u201d</p> <p>Improving society is a collective project, but as Corrigan attests, it happens because individual people make it their business to incite change. Mayer and Dyer, too, see this as their mission. \u201cWe have to be better stewards than this,\u201d Dyer told me fiercely. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this.\u201d If SenesTech looks quirky in the attempt, its founders do not seem to mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc24d57fdceeb4b973e14de5cf688dd168e29513/0_197_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem seems like a fantasy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On a Tuesday night in August, Mayer and Dyer held a celebration in their backyard for staff and investors. The company had just received US Environmental Protection Agency registration, a process that usually takes years and often costs more than companies of SenesTech\u2019s size can afford. (The EPA is making an active effort to get rat poison off the markets in the US, and received news of SenesTech\u2019s science with enthusiasm.) Now, with the EPA\u2019s blessing, the company could take ContraPest to commercial markets. Immediately, more than 100 calls and 200 emails came in with order requests. </p> <p>Mayer and Dyer live in a one-level wood cabin a few miles north of downtown Flagstaff, in a wooded area near a field of wildflowers. For the occasion, they had cleared the back patio, where Mayer does her morning meditation and yoga, and filled it with deck furniture and folding tables. The sun was coming down the San Francisco Peaks.</p> <p>It was not a typical investors dinner, but then, SenesTech\u2019s nearly 700 stakeholders are mostly firemen. While most biotech startups are funded by investment bankers and venture capitalists, Mayer chose to pursue funding from grant-giving bodies and a horde of private donors, all of whom made small investments, and each of whom Mayer knows by name. It was a pure accident of networking that so many of them turned out to be firemen, but she is thrilled with the situation. \u201cFirefighters really believe in doing good,\u201d Mayer explained to me. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like teenage girls. Once one of them invested, they all wanted in.\u201d</p> <p>There were perhaps 25 people \u2013 investors, board members and SenesTech staff \u2013 gathered on the back patio, eating tacos and drinking from Mayer and Dyer\u2019s impressive liquor collection, but they made noise for 50. They were boisterous and loving, hugging each other, teasing each other, shouting old stories to roars of laughter, and clinking glasses. About half the room seemed to be wearing Hawaiian patterned shirts.</p> <p>When the time came for Mayer to give a speech, she demurred for a moment before standing. Her toast turned briefly into an anecdote about flattening mouse skeletons in lasagna tins. \u201cBut seriously,\u201d she said, returning to her theme, \u201cWe knew [this day] would come. It\u2019s great to be riding this wave with you. It\u2019s just so sweet.\u201d Glasses heaved into the air.</p> <p>There was considerable work left to do: now that SenesTech had its national registration, it would have to file for registration in every state. (Since then, the company has registered in 11 US states, and begun registration in the EU.) The manufacturing team was hurrying to make enough ContraPest to accommodate the requests coming in.<strong> </strong>Dyer was working hard on adaptations that would make the formula work in a variety of different environments, and planning variations for different species. Mayer was preparing for a torrent of meetings. While ContraPest has been effective in every test SenesTech has run so far, there is a lot still to learn about how rats in different parts of the world will respond to it in the wild.</p> <p>It sounds crazy: a band of animal lovers<strong> </strong>and firemen in the mountains of Arizona, led by a Buddhist girl scout, making a pink milkshake for rats that may eventually improve the lives of millions of people. They are unruffled by scepticism: In the middle of one interview, Mayer forgot a detail and yelled towards the door, \u201cCheryl, who said to you, \u2018That\u2019s just not how we do it?\u2019\u201d Dyer hollered back from the other room. \u201cWhich time?\u201d In response, they point to hard science, solicitations from governments and companies around the world, and an endorsement from Stephen Hawking, who featured them on his documentary mini-series Brave New World.</p> <p>Rats are so longstanding a threat to humanity that contemplating an end to the rat problem \u2013 and one that does not require us to kill them \u2013 seems like a fantasy. They are, as Mayer herself put it, a more successful species than us. Long after we\u2019re gone, they will still be here. But the possibility of a truce seems closer than ever before. \u201cThe answer in the future may lie completely within biotechnology,\u201d said Corrigan when I asked for his impressions. (He and Mayer consider themselves allies in the campaign to create sustainable solutions to the rat problem. Mayer fondly recalls a nighttime \u201crat safari\u201d she once took with Corrigan in New York.) \u201cThe SenesTech product is a breakthrough, but it is still at the very infancy stages of biotechnology for this species,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cThis is going to be maybe years of refinements and changing and experiments. We\u2019re not walking yet. And we\u2019re certainly not running.\u201d</p> <p>Mayer, Dyer and their team seem cheerful at the prospect, and confident that they are doing the work of the future. \u201cDo you see this?\u201d asked Ali Applin, a senior member of SenesTech\u2019s staff. We were sitting in Mayer\u2019s office, and Applin pointed to a little sign on the coffee table that read \u201cMake it so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is what she tells us,\u201d Applin said.</p> <p>Mayer nodded, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to do. I mean, why squabble over something and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do that\u2019. Make it so. Find a way. There\u2019s always a way.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment, she had another thought. \u201cYou\u2019re really gonna have to do that, Ali, when you take this to Argentina soon. If we thought Laos was hard \u2013 I mean, my God.\u201d She grinned mischievously and folded her hands together and pressed them to her forehead and said a mantra. \u201cI wish you ease on the path to peace.
