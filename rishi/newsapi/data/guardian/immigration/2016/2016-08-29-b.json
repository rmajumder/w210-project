  "<p>The Obama administration could end its use of private immigration detention centres, the US homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said on Monday.</p> <p>The announcement follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">a landmark decision by the US Department of Justice </a>to phase out private prisons, after a stinging independent review found they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">drastically less safe</a> than publicly operated centres. The move, made earlier in August, led to intense pressure on the homeland security department to conduct a similar review, as it relies more heavily on the use of privatised facilities. </p> <p>Johnson said his department\u2019s advisory council has been tasked to examine whether \u201cimmigration detention operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should move in the same direction\u201d as the justice department. The panel will have until the end of November to make recommendations, and will consider \u201call factors \u2026 including fiscal considerations\u201d related to ICE\u2019s use of private centres. </p> <p>The agency\u2019s use of private detention centres has long been criticised by human rights advocates. An investigation published by Human Rights Watch in July <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/us-deaths-immigration-detention\">found evidence of substandard medical care</a> at a number of facilities, while protests at privately operated family detention centres in Texas <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Hundreds-protest-Obama-s-immigration-policy-in-6238231.php\">have become commonplace</a>. </p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detains a total of 33,676 people, as of the beginning of August, with an overwhelming 24,567 (or 72%) of these held in the country\u2019s 46 private detention facilities. Conversely, the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Prisons operates only 13 private prisons, which hold around <a href=\"https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp\">11% of the federal prison population</a>. The federal prison population has also declined in recent years, while the numbers of those detained in ICE facilities <a href=\"http://grassrootsleadership.org/reports/payoff-how-congress-ensures-private-prison-profit-immigrant-detention-quota#1\">has increased</a>. </p> <p>Grace Meng, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, argued the DHS review should occur in a \u201cdifferent context\u201d from the DoJ decision. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a civil detention system, people who are not being held under a criminal charge, asylum seekers living with children, many people who are not public safety threats,\u201d Meng said. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that this system grew so much and became so reliant on private prison companies, means we should look at it even more skeptically than we looked at the federal prison system. </p> <p>\u201cI think the real question is, are they [DHS] prepared to really reduce the population to the point that they can hold facilities accountable when they fail to meet their standards?\u201d </p> <p>The announcement was met with volatility on the stock market as shares in some of America\u2019s largest private prison companies slumped. </p> <p>Stock in Corrections Corp of America, which operates a family detention centre in Texas, slid 9.4% following Monday\u2019s announcement. The company has earned $689m from ICE contracts since 2008, according to Reuters. </p> <p>Shares in GEO Group, another of the country\u2019s largest security companies, fell by 6%. The company has earned $1.18bn from ICE contracts in the same period, according to Reuters, about 60% of its total revenue from federal contracts. </p> <p>Despite the bad reaction on the markets, the company said in a statement that it welcomed the DHS review. </p> <p>\u201cGEO\u2019s facilities under contract with ICE are highly rated and provide high-quality, cost-effective services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to strict contractual requirements and the federal government\u2019s national standards.\u201d</p>",

  "<p> Santos, one of the companies driving Queensland\u2019s liquefied natural gas export boom, is relying on price projections so optimistic that they inflate the value of the company\u2019s assets by billions of dollars, according to a leading analyst.</p> <p>This month Santos announced a write-down of the value of its Gladstone gas export project, GLNG, of US$1.5bn. The value of the project dropped because the price it gets for the exported gas is tied to the price of crude oil, which has dropped.</p> <p>But according to an analysis by the pro-renewables financial activist group Market Forces, that write-down of its assets relied on an optimistic prediction for how the oil price will change, with Santos\u2019s projections significantly higher than those of competitors Woodside and Beach Energy, brokers such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as analysts at the World Bank.</p> <p>According to Santos\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.santos.com/media/3400/160819_half-year_report_incorporating_appendix_4d.pdf\">explanation of how</a> its asset\u2019s value is tied to oil prices, if it had used Goldman Sachs\u2019 projected oil prices rather than its own optimistic ones, the value of its assets would be US$3.5bn less in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/australian-gas-40-cheaper-japan-than-australia-despite-export-costs\">Australian gas 40% cheaper in Japan than in Australia despite export costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alternatively, if it followed the World Bank\u2019s forecast to 2020, its assets would take more than a US$2bn hit that year.</p> <p>Even its peers in the market, Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy, projected oil prices to 2021 that would result in Santos\u2019s assets taking more than a US$1bn write-down most years.</p> <p>Santos\u2019s write-downs have led some <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/energy/oil/santos-takes-us15b-writedown-on-value-of-glng-project-20160814-gqsg6g\">analysts to speculate</a> that parts of the brand-new facility would be mothballed within a year or two.</p> <p>The latest company update from Goldman Sachs on Santos recommended investors sell their stock in the company, noting long-term expectations for the price of oil.</p> <p>Santos declined Guardian Australia\u2019s request to comment on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems fanciful,\u201d said Daniel Gocher from Market Forces, who prepared the analysis. \u201cThey\u2019re a good $5 to $15 above the median forecast price per barrel. </p> <p>\u201cThe comparison is pretty representative \u2013 we\u2019ve got the brokers in there, and the World Bank, who you\u2019d think would be rather conservative. And we\u2019ve also got their peers.</p> <p>\u201cThere is plenty of opinion out there that says that they\u2019re on thin ice already,\u201d Gocher said, adding that Santos had more debt than similar companies in the market. \u201cIf they\u2019re not getting the prices for gas that they were expecting, then they\u2019re going to find it harder to meet their debt obligations.\u201d</p> <p>Santos now has the lowest investment-grade credit rating of BBB-. When the company declared its recent write-down, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said if oil prices stayed low, Santos could start selling its assets to meet its debt obligations.</p> <p>Bruce Robertson from the pro-renewables financial analysis group, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said if Santos did declare a multibillion-dollar write-down, it \u201cwould be in all sorts of trouble\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn my opinion it would make financing of the business very problematic,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/if-energy-ministers-bow-to-gas-industry-theyll-be-deciding-in-the-dark\">If energy ministers bow to gas industry they'll be deciding in the dark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the large discrepancy in forecasts showed Australia needed consistent reporting of the value of gas reserves and resources, as in the US.</p> <p>The inconsistent reporting made it hard for investors to judge the value of a company, he said, but it also made it hard for policymakers to judge how large the country\u2019s available reserves were. \u201cThere\u2019s no transparency or consistency. Each company is calculating reserves and resources using a different set of assumptions.\u201d</p> <p>Gocher said Santos\u2019s \u201cfanciful\u201d projections pointed to the over-investment in the LNG sector in Australia. \u201cA lot of those investments will be in jeopardy and wouldn\u2019t get the go-ahead today if they were making the same decision now,\u201d he said.</p>",

In the fast-moving and insular bubble of campaign travel, Abedin can be seen constantly by Clinton\u2019s side \u2013 she is often the last person Clinton talks to before going onstage and the first to congratulate the presidential nominee on the way back in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/huma-abedin-politics-hillary-clinton-anthony-weiner\">An idiot husband, a footballing felon: but Huma Abedin rises above it all | Peter Bradshaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The close ties to such a controversial figure have made her a lightning rod for political attacks.

  "<p>If Michail Antonio feels a little nervous in the company of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/28/england-squad-announcement-allardyce-antonio-barkley\">his England team-mates</a>, he should treat Wayne Rooney and friends to a wonderful ice-breaking anecdote.</p> <p>It dates back to November last year when, hoping to do a good deed, West Ham United\u2019s joint chairman, David Gold, retweeted an \u201cappeal\u201d posted by one of the club\u2019s fans asking that awareness be spread about a \u201cmissing\u201d man.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/29/wayne-rooney-play-no10-england-captain-sam-allardyce-marcus-rashford\">Wayne Rooney to play in No10 role as England captain for Sam Allardyce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accompanying the tweet was a picture of Antonio, the right-winger who had apparently morphed into an \u201cinvisible\u201d man, remaining virtually unseen by the Hammers supporters following his \u00a37m signing from Nottingham Forest that summer.</p> <p>Indeed, until late November the 26-year-old \u2013 who was playing non-league football for Tooting and Mitcham seven years ago \u2013 made only one appearance for Slaven Bilic\u2019s side. During 2016 everything changed, with Antonio becoming central to Bilic\u2019s blueprint. Despite sometimes being deployed at right-back he ended last season having scored nine goals for West Ham, eight with his head.</p> <p>If that is a compelling statistic for a midfielder \u2013 and as England manager Sam Allardyce seems set to adopt a meritocratic, data-driven approach to selection \u2013 it was also no fluke. At his previous club, Nottingham Forest, Antonio attached end product to extraordinary pace and incisive crossing ability by scoring 15 times in 49 appearances.</p> <p>With his powerful athlete\u2019s physique leavened by a surprisingly delicate touch, it is no surprise Bilic was so keen to persuade Gold to recruit a winger who had joined Forest a year earlier for \u00a31.5m following two quietly impressive seasons at Sheffield Wednesday. That breakthrough period at Hillsborough came after four frequently frustrating years with Reading where his penchant for constantly drifting infield, neglecting to take on his marker and frequently wayward finishing irked fans.</p> <p>\u201cMichail\u2019s game really matured during his first season at Wednesday,\u201d says David Prutton, a former Hillsborough midfield team-mate. \u201cHe really grew up \u2013 and really endeared himself to the lads. He has plenty of time for people.

  "<p> \u201cThis is like black Coachella,\u201d someone said to me, while we waited in the long, slow-moving line to get into Afropunk. On Saturday, the line nearly encircled Commodore Barry Park, with some people stuck in it for almost two hours. </p> <p> The line did end somewhere, and as snippets of Saul Williams and a Thundercat\u2019s bass solo wafted over the fence, I felt no rush to get in \u2013 I\u2019d seen Thundercat many times before, including at last year\u2019s festival. Soon after his performance, George Clinton was scheduled to go; but I left to retrieve a friend from the gate, only making it back to catch a little of Flashlight and (Not Just) Knee Deep. But I\u2019d just seen him in Brooklyn, too.</p> <p> Perhaps I have finally become the jaded New Yorker I was always meant to be, or, maybe this year\u2019s line-up was a little ho-hum. Either way, after a certain number of Afropunks \u2013 this was my sixth \u2013 you have to find a new way of interacting with the festival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/aug/29/new-yorks-afropunk-music-festival-2016-in-pictures\">New York's Afropunk music festival 2016 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> That\u2019s what someone had encouraged me to do before I attended \u2013 try something new. <em>Meet </em>someone new. So on Sunday, my friends and I went to hear The Suffers, for no other reason than we thought the lead singer, Kam Franklin, looked cool. She was one Afroed black woman among an ensemble of mostly white men, singing her heart out. The jumbotron showed us what our mere eyes could not: she and all her bandmates wore T-shirts that read Eleanor &amp; Tarika &amp; Aiyana &amp; Rekia &amp; Miriam &amp; Renisha\u2026 all names of black <em tabindex=\"-1\">women</em> killed by the police, women whose stories, and sometimes whose names, we don\u2019t know. It was a small, powerful gesture, as was what she asked us to do before she performed their hit Make Some Room \u2013 hug the person we came with, and tell them <em tabindex=\"-1\">thank you</em>. And if we came by ourselves, find another solo person and hug and thank them. With just these two small moves, Franklin nicked open what is possible at Afropunk \u2013 the opportunity to connect with and influence people with your words and presence.</p> <p> In addition to The Suffers\u2019 T-shirts, I found myself inspired by all the things festivalgoers wore. I thought I was cool, but I had no idea where people had gotten T-shirts that said \u201cBlack Girls Got the Juice\u201d and \u201cBlack Girls + Magic = Very Real\u201d and the Afropunk sign with its rules of acceptance (No Sexism. No Racism. No Ableism., etc) to include No Donald Trump.</p> <p> The festival organizers did their part by making it clear that there were no male- or female-designated bathrooms. Above the rows of port-a-potties read this sign: \u201cThis bathroom has been liberated from the gender binary.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/25/afropunk-2016-family-reunion\">Afropunk 2016: 'It always felt like a family reunion to me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> If you live in New York, Brooklyn in particular, you can find a way to always be immersed in a forward-thinking, cultural experience; you can see bathrooms, or any number of things, that have been liberated from all the binaries on Earth. But many people who attend the festival come from elsewhere; and this sign, unromantic as it was hanging above plastic toilet stalls, was another one of those small gestures to welcome the many individuals who don\u2019t fit in to just one stall, or just one life.</p> <p> Or, as Janelle Mon\u00e1e called from the stage Sunday night, this was for the \u201coutcasts, the misfits, the weirdos\u201d. After her set, during which she performed her own hits, as well as Prince\u2019s Let\u2019s Go Crazy, I wound up talking to a friend from college who, despite having gone to our historically black institution and living in nearby Jersey City, still needed all-black spaces like this one in order to just <em>be</em>. To be weird and different, whatever that might mean, inside or outside of the park gates.</p> <p> Across the wide swath of performers, one common element was the influence of original black American music. Both Mon\u00e1e and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Roman GianArthur performed James Brown songs, complete with the simple, clean choreography that\u2019s so ingrained into black showmanship. At the Bad Brains-Living Color-Fishbone \u201cPowerjam\u201d on Sunday night, George Clinton, perhaps the godfather of weird, and the natural link between Brown\u2019s funk and Bad Brains\u2019s and co\u2019s punk, performed again \u2013 age 75, and about to release a new album on fellow festival performer Flying Lotus\u2019s Brainfeeder label.</p> <p> Closing out the festival was none other than Ice Cube, perhaps the least punk headliner in recent memory. \u201cI\u2019m a b-boy,\u201d he said. \u201cAin\u2019t no band up here.\u201d Just him, a DJ, and soon after, NWA members DJ Yella and MC Ren. That was Cube being <em>his</em> weird and different self, in a space where drums and guitar were the law of the land. He assured us he wasn\u2019t just a dude in kids movies, and that he\u2019d never left hip-hop. And then he crip-walked.</p>",

  "<p>Prolific TV showrunner Ryan Murphy recently compared American Horror Story <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-connected-seasons\">to The Twilight Zone</a>. What seems like a ridiculous juxtaposition is actually one of the more reasonable things the Nip/Tuck creator has said recently: the shows are more similar than they appear. American Horror Story is, perhaps, the most visible show in the genre that The Twilight Zone has exemplified for decades: the anthology.</p> <p>TV\u2019s early anthology shows (in addition to The Twilight Zone, there\u2019s Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales From the Crypt, and The Outer Limits) produced distinct, standalone episodes almost totally unrelated in plot and character, connected by an overarching sensibility and creative team. These stories are more like different songs on an album than the way current TV shows conceive of the episode \u2013 as a partly functional building block in a longer story.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to imagine a real, dramatic anthology show taking off today. (Two forthcoming comedies \u2013 High Maintenance, poised to make the leap from web series to HBO, and Joe Swanberg\u2019s upcoming Netflix show Easy \u2013 are full-on comedic anthologies.) Viewers demand some level of narrative cohesion and payoffs for their years of investment in a series, even if it\u2019s a comedy (think of Arrested Development\u2019s dense, long-running jokes). And few, if any, writers and directors could accomplish the older anthology task of introducing a whole set of characters and situations, resolving them within the span of an episode, and keeping the whole thing visually and dramatically appealing.</p> <p>This is where the seasonal anthology comes into play: these shows tell a contained story like an episode of The Twilight Zone, but it lasts for 10 to 13 episodes rather than one, and resets at the beginning of the next run. Consider the first seasonal anthology: American Horror Story, which retains its creative team (Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk) and some of its cast (Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson) while telling a different grim story each year with names like Murder House, Asylum, Coven, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/02/american-horror-story-season-four-freak-show-review\">Freak Show</a>. The seasonal anthology, then, appears to split the difference between over-serialized, blurred binges like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards\">House of Cards</a> and the breezy, forgettable quality of an episodic procedural like NCIS.</p> <p>Development executives certainly see the potential \u2013 seasonal anthologies are all the rage. Starz\u2019s The Girlfriend Experience has been <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-girlfriend-experience-renewed-season-two-starz-steven-soderbergh-1201827545/\">renewed as an anthology series</a>, while executive producer Steven Soderbergh\u2019s other TV show may return as a sort of <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-knick-season-three-steven-soderbergh-1201675175/\">two-season anthology</a>. Fargo has elements of this structure, too, with its clockwork seasons and shifting focus, though it isn\u2019t quite a seasonal anthology \u2013 while each season tells a different story with similar thematic concerns, they share characters, but not full casts. Murphy has also been gifted with two more anthology shows: American Crime Story and the upcoming <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://jezebel.com/and-now-sarah-paulson-has-signed-on-to-ryan-murphys-feu-1785661399\">Feud</a>. (Not for nothing are most of these shows on FX, a network that attracts prestige series and talent but often positions itself explicitly in opposition to the deluge of sameness that is Netflix.)</p> <p>Still, there\u2019s a reason that American Horror Story will probably never quite take the place of something like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a> \u2013 anthologies are hard. The format is difficult to fine tune, mostly because it requires, essentially, a totally new show each year, and though the stories might be tighter, they\u2019re likely to be incapable of drawing the same long-term interest. (In this respect, they\u2019re perfect for Murphy, who has never met an idea he didn\u2019t lose interest in by the time he finished writing it down.) Effective anthology storytelling requires clarity and consistency of vision, and even the successful seasonal anthologies have struggled to find it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/the-people-v-oj-simpson-episode-by-episode\">The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story</a> epitomizes all of the best things about seasonal anthologies \u2013 it tells a single story with a closed narrative arc and payoffs, casts an appropriately broad thematic net, and, above all, has distinct episodes that add up to a bigger whole. But it\u2019s a little early to say whether American Crime Story will maintain its current promise. Murphy is returning, but writers Scott Alexander and Larry Krajewski, who were invested in the OJ trial and in depicted legal proceedings more broadly, are not \u2013 nor is most of the stellar cast. And the next season is, apparently, about Hurricane Katrina, a topic decidedly unsuited to Murphy\u2019s campy sensibility. American Crime Story might eventually become something engaging (and good), but the only thing that will save the season anthology is also the same thing that makes TV worth watching: time.</p>",

Silence is breaking 12 Irish hearts a day. Silence is trapping migrant women in desperate situations, silence has the blood of Savita on its hands, silence is the shape of Miss Y\u2019s devastation. Silence has devastated the women and girls of Ireland, but now it\u2019s time to talk, and get real.\u201d</p> <p>They certainly got real. The pictures they shared were striking in their ordinariness: boarding a plane in the cold grey of dawn; views from taxi windows; waiting rooms with magazines; a basic hotel. They tagged Kenny in each. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwoWomenTravel/status/767296252207857665\" title=\"\">most controversial image is a lightly bloodstained sheet</a>, which they felt was important to show: they were certainly not the first women to face a long trek home, bleeding and sore.</p> <p>\u201cThe anti-choice brigade have been all over that photo,\u201d the friend tells me. \u201cThe realities of women\u2019s bodies have been glossed over for too long. We bleed, and we birth, and it\u2019s not pretty, but that\u2019s life, and that reality needs to be brought to the fore. There\u2019s no realism in the philosophical focus of the anti-choice side. They can speculate until the cows come home about when life begins. In fact, they have speculated so loudly and for so long that real lives of women and girls have ended unnecessarily.\u201d</p> <p>When #twowomentravel returned, 48 hours later, they had tens of thousands of Twitter followers and were making international headlines. \u201cWe could never have expected the response we received. It was surreal. Where do you even begin thanking people for standing with you in that situation?\u201d</p> <p>They believe that Kenny saw their tweets: \u201cHe stopped posting updates on the Olympics, which he had been doing regularly,\u201d she says. In her view, Kenny going offline speaks volumes. In any case, they are not surprised by his silence.</p> <p>\u201cHe has no compassion, no interest in the lives of women. There are more than 100,000 women who went before us. He could have listened to any number of them, and he didn\u2019t. He owes over 3,000 women a year a whole lot of money and remorse.\u201d</p> <p>The #twowomentravel hashtag was brimming with gratitude and solidarity. But there were also, inevitably, anti-choice pundits aggressively shaming the women. \u201cWe were showing photos of waiting rooms, taxis, flights. In response we got bombarded by violent rhetoric accusing both of us of murder, bombarded with pictures of mutilated foetuses.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the strangest criticism came from detractors who refused to believe that the anonymous women existed. Seemingly, even though a dozen women a day make this journey, the notion that one of them would refuse to be shamed into silence defies logic.</p> <p>The friend I interview is scathing of such critiques: \u201cNobody has to believe us. Our dignity does not rely on that. But I will say this: if you are sceptical of an eloquent, salient, honest and cutting telling of the travesty that faces so many Irish women, you are a sexist. If you doubt the ability of women to tell their stories with ferocity and confidence, even in crisis, you are a sexist. If you doubt us because we have succeeded in defying you, you are a sexist. We are not meek, and we owe no explanations.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, the friends are processing everything that has happened \u2013 one healing and taking time out following her abortion, the other dealing with media. They intend to keep fighting. \u201cWe have to break the hold of silence. We can no longer whisper. We have been failed for too long. Now is the time to be loud.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Given its UK premiere by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/7Nv1HtgNHYrDs6SP6KVmZL/about-the-bbc-symphony-orchestra\">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/16/semyon-bychkov-beating-time\">Semyon Bychkov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thomaslarcher.com/en/\">Thomas Larcher</a>\u2019s Second Symphony, starkly entitled Cenotaph, is dedicated to the thousands who have drowned in the Mediterranean during the refugee crisis, and voices Larcher\u2019s outrage at the \u201cmisanthropy\u201d (his word) of the response in his native Austria and elsewhere.</p> <p>It\u2019s a formidable score, angry yet lyrical, and rooted in the mainstream symphonic tradition, though it also pushes at the boundaries of conventional structure. Larcher argues that his music is not programmatic \u2013 that it does not \u201cconvey messages, but asks questions\u201d. But it\u2019s difficult not to hear the heaving of a treacherous sea beneath the formal crisis of the opening movement, or the intimation of dangerously becalmed waters in the grieving adagio. The sonorities are by turns lucid and brutal, and the climax comes with a battering scherzo that furiously demands answers, only to be greeted with a banal <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler\">l\u00e4ndler</a></em> that reeks of indifference and contempt. It\u2019s a moment of tremendous irony and power. You couldn\u2019t fault the performance.</p> <p>Bychkov chose Wagner\u2019s Wesendonck-Lieder and Strauss\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK7z2NhUrsQ\">Alpine Symphony</a> as its companion pieces. The Wagner, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1rhtS62Exw\">Elisabeth Kulman</a> the immaculate soloist and Bychkov keenly alert to the music\u2019s refined sensuality, was utterly beguiling. The BBCSO sounded glorious in the Alpine Symphony: Bychkov\u2019s urgent conducting was particularly strong in the second half, when Strauss\u2019s climbers get caught in a storm as nature turns against the human beings that seek to conquer it.</p>",

After Britain\u2019s mad summer, the May administration will convene in Buckinghamshire finally to face the chill autumn reality: Britain voted for Brexit without a plan and the Europeans intend to shaft us.</p> <p>They may not have actually used the word \u201cshaft\u201d when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/ventotene-summit-france-italy-germany-eu-brexit-vote\">they met on the Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi last week</a>, but German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi know they hold all the strongest cards. French civil servants are trained at the <em>grandes \u00e9coles</em>, like diplomatic special forces, to spot and ruthlessly attack the weakness of negotiating partners. And May\u2019s administration goes into this critical negotiating process with an obvious weakness. It does not know whether it wants to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to want \u201cpartial\u201d single market access, to keep the City\u2019s passporting arrangements into the eurozone. If, in order to get it, Britain has to soft-pedal on immigration controls, that would be no disaster for the Treasury, whose growth projections in this year\u2019s budget relied on the impact of a million EU migrants over the next five years.</p> <p>Brexit minister David Davis and international trade secretary Liam Fox are champing at the bit to begin the article 50 process \u2013 naturally they have drawn up rival timelines \u2013 but have so far failed to produce any kind of blueprint for their preferred outcome, which is to quit the single market and end free movement. This leaves May struggling to assert control over the process of even coming to a negotiating strategy \u2013 hence Wednesday\u2019s away day \u2013 and in severe danger of floundering once she has to deliver her Brexit plan to the other EU heads of government.</p> <p>It is a real, serious and material split in the government of a major country. And it is backed by rival forces in society. Those for whom Brexit became a religion in the spring of 2016 do not care about the niceties of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. They voted to leave all of it and to \u201ctake control\u201d of migration. But the economic elite of Britain, which has the strongest voice both in the Conservative high echelons and in the civil service, simply does not want Brexit. Above all it wants to maintain market access for the City, and for the major global service firms headquartered in London. For them, it is logical to hope that Europe stonewalls all May\u2019s requests for flexible market access, and that \u2013 by the end of the process, and with the economy suffering \u2013 the public will be ready to accept staying in the EU, with some minor variations on migration.</p> <p>Labour, too, is racked by the same dilemma. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/01/john-mcdonnell-brexit-will-end-free-movement-of-people\">John McDonnell\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on Europe</a> do not, and cannot, include keeping free movement, but do include keeping the City\u2019s financial passport and single market \u201caccess\u201d. For Jeremy Corbyn the additional problem is that the European left wants Britain out of the EU pronto, before it can negotiate any dilution of the social chapter.</p> <p>Both main parties, then, are trapped between what is possible and what the British people voted for. Owen Smith may be wowing his rallies with talk of a second referendum, but the party leaderships are beginning to realise this will only be sorted out in parliament. It will be complex, messy and reputations will be minced. The only democratic way of doing it is to say \u2013 if necessary with May, Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon standing shoulder to shoulder somewhere symbolic \u2013 that Britain\u2019s aim is to remain in the single market.</p> <p>Until the delusion of the giant flounce-out is killed off \u2013 and until Liam Fox and David Davies are told to stop dreaming about it \u2013 those negotiating with Britain from the other side will have a massive incentive to force us into it. If they think it is our secret desire, or our plan B, for Britain to quit the single market cleanly, Europe will not take seriously any UK government demands for variations to single market rules, designed to keep us on the inside the market, though outside the EU itself.</p> <p>May should seek cabinet agreement for a baseline request: to remain as part of the EEA, with a humane, time-limited restriction on free movement as Britain\u2019s one demand, and then get on with it. She should make a statement to the commons that rules out leaving the single market. Any confusion that is allowed to fester over this will corrode her own authority as the Europeans sensibly deploy every trick in the book \u2013 a book going back to the era when <a href=\"http://www.hyperhistory.com/online_n2/people_n2/persons6_n2/metternich.html\">Prince Metternich</a> ran rings round Britain in post-Napoleonic Europe \u2013 to make her squirm.</p> <p>There will be uproar in Ukipland \u2013 but there always is. Not only is there no clear mandate for leaving the single market, but the negotiating positions of our major partners are now clear. They have not said \u201cgo ahead, pick and mix\u201d from the EU goodie-bag: they have said the single market plus free movement or get lost. The British negotiators\u2019 job is to prise that position apart \u2013 not rubberstamp it, which is what Fox, Davies and other hardcore Brexiters want.</p> <p>May wants to serve a full term. But both logic and principle dictate that were she to give in to the \u201cclean break\u201d brigade within the cabinet, she would have to schedule an election and fight for a mandate to lead Britain into this particularly stupid form of economic suicide. If so, whoever leads Labour should be salivating at the prospect. The Brexit moment caused many in the City to question the long-term direction of centre-right politics. By finessing May into power without a vote, and surrounding her with the grey men and women of provincial Toryism, the grandees of the party restored the impression that they could \u2013 just about \u2013 hold the line for the City, the big law firms, the service giants and big pharma.</p> <p>But if Tories want to go into an election promising to destroy 30 years of European financial integration in order to assuage the xenophobes and climate deniers of Ukip, that would be a different prospect.</p> <p>For the opposition parties, if they can recover their nerve, any confusion coming out of Wednesday\u2019s cabinet \u2013 still better any open revolt \u2013 will be a big opportunity. They should state, simply, that they will seek a vote in parliament to veto any Brexit strategy that tries to remove Britain from the single market. That principle \u2013 which needs no further elaboration since these are opposition parties, not a parallel government \u2013 could become the rock upon which Theresa May\u2019s soaraway ratings are broken, and her majority ground down.</p>",
  "<p>Few lies can be told in one word, but \u201csuperfood\u201d manages it. It is such an appealing idea: that some foods are healthy, some unhealthy and some superhealthy.

Isn\u2019t it just one of the \u201cgreens\u201d people have been told to eat for about as long as they have had a choice? Certainly, you would struggle to find a less exotic vegetable. Kale has grown in northern Europe, and plenty of other places, for thousands of years. In wartime, it was one of the stolid, practical crops that people were advised to grow in their gardens. Along with cavolo nero and red Russian kale, it is one of many cultivars of the magnificent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea\">Brassica oleracea</a> species, which also gives us cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kohlrabi and brussels sprouts, and is closely related to turnips, bok choy and Chinese cabbage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"733f8faeecd7ee8e5c625043f401ccf73c8ff24d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/733f8faeecd7ee8e5c625043f401ccf73c8ff24d/0_189_4512_2707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jenifoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Health benefits </strong>Well, we know that it is healthy to eat a diet containing plenty of vegetables, so really the question ought to be: is kale significantly better than the rest of them? And that is easy. No, it isn\u2019t. Fans of superfoods like to list the things that kale contains a lot of (iron, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants) and point out what those things do (make red blood cells; miscellaneous; help you poo; \u201cmop up free radicals\u201d/don\u2019t know), but that doesn\u2019t mean your body gets superpowers if you eat more than you need, especially if you\u2019re already getting enough from other sources. It\u2019s like trying to make your car go faster by putting in more petrol. All vegetables contain different amounts of vitamins and minerals, which also vary depending on the soil they are grown in, so there is not much point making them compete in a nutrient competition. Sure, by weight, typical kale contains more calcium, vitamin B6 \u2013 and indeed calories \u2013 than typical cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, spinach or carrots, but eating more of them will get you to the same place. Typical kale also contains less vitamin A than carrots, less iron, magnesium or potassium than spinach and less fibre than brussels sprouts. Big deal. No good evidence shows that eating plenty of fruit and vegetables with kale is any better than eating plenty of them without.</p> <p><strong>Eco rating </strong>Close to perfect \u2013 you can grow it easily yourself (under a net to keep off the cabbage white butterflies).</p> <p><strong>Hipster rating </strong>Sky-high.</p> <p><strong>Stars in </strong>Crispy chips, colcannon, not-very-nice salads.</p> <h2>Avocado</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a7b33f18eaddf29f113a362017f398d835a2bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a7b33f18eaddf29f113a362017f398d835a2bb/0_269_5800_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avocado toast: an ecological disaster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avocado toast: an ecological disaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladislav Nosick/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A true delicacy, when just ripe, and now one of the most <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/the-selling-of-the-avocado/385047/\">popular fruits in the US</a>.

(Not that this matters. See kale.) Yet, like many vegetables, it is rich in nitrates, which somehow manage to make it a superfood, a sports supplement and a health scare, all at the same time. The good part is that beetroot juice <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/superfoods/Pages/is-beetroot-a-superfood.aspx\">does seem to lower blood pressure, a little</a>, probably because of the nitric oxides that your body converts nitrates into. In practice, this is is not much use, however. If your blood pressure needs to be lowered, you are <a href=\"https://www.sportsdietitians.com.au/factsheets/supplements/beetroot-juice-nitrate/\">much better off doing exercise</a>, eating less salt and taking the drugs your doctor gives you. Other research suggests that drinking beetroot juice before exercise improves the endurance of casual athletes by allowing more oxygen to be delivered around the body (but has little effect on serious ones). When added to red meat, however,<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691596000993\"> nitrates worry people, as they form nitrosamines</a>, and do lead to <a href=\"http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2015/10/26/processed-meat-and-cancer-what-you-need-to-know/\">an increased risk of bowel cancer</a> (from about a 5.6% lifetime risk in people who eat almost none, up to about 6.6% in people who eat lots). It is possible that the nitrates in beetroot could also form nitrosamines in your body, so Efsa recommends eating no more than about two beetroots a day.</p> <p><strong>Eco rating </strong>Excellent.

Thus, for this small group of people who choose to have a nutrient deficiency, but hate pills, seaweed is a kind of superfood. For everybody else, however, it is just tasty and healthy (as part of a balanced diet). Yes, seaweed generally contains a lot of calcium and iron, but you should be getting those from a variety of sources anyway. Plus \u2013 and this is a big problem with superfoods \u2013 eating more of one mineral than your body needs may stop it properly absorbing something else.

Besides, iodine is another thing you don\u2019t want to eat too much of. Iodine toxicity can cause thyroid problems and weight gain.

  "<p>On Christmas Eve 1968, the Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders took a photograph of the view outside the window as his spaceship orbited the moon. The now iconic Earthrise image shows our half-moon blue planet under a decoration of clouds rising from the blackness of space over the lunar surface.</p> <p>The picture encapsulated Earth\u2019s precariousness in the cosmos and, for many, contained a message of humility and stewardship for our home.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had Earthrise and images like it from the Apollo missions for half a century now. But suppose some aliens had been viewing our planet for its entire 4.5bn-year history. What would they have seen?</p> <p>Over nearly all that immense time, changes would have been very gradual: continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct during a succession of geological eras.</p> <p>But visible change has accelerated rapidly in the past few thousand years \u2013 a tiny sliver of the Earth\u2019s history. Now geologists have decided those changes have been so profound, so global and so permanent that our catalogue of the Earth\u2019s history needs to change accordingly. Since the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago, human civilisation has flourished in the climatically benign Holocene. Now they believe that epoch has come to an end and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">we have entered a new human-influenced age, the Anthropocene</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The changes that our aliens could observe from space are not hard to spot. In just the last few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. These human-induced changes signalled the start of agriculture. </p> <p>And human activity manifested itself in other ways that will leave traces in the geological record. Constructs of concrete and metal sprawled across the continents; domesticated vertebrates numerically overwhelmed wild ones; the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose anomalously fast; traces appeared of plutonium and other \u201cun-natural\u201d substances.</p> <p>The imaginary aliens watching our world would have noticed something else unprecedented in geological history. Rockets launched from the planet\u2019s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around the Earth; some journeyed to the moon and planets.</p> <p>What do these trends portend? Should we be optimistic or anxious? It\u2019s surprising how little we can confidently predict \u2013 indeed, we can\u2019t predict as far ahead as our forebears could. Our medieval ancestors thought the Earth was only a few thousand years old, and might only last another thousand. But they didn\u2019t expect their children\u2019s lives to be very different from theirs. They built cathedrals that wouldn\u2019t be finished in their lifetime.</p> <p>Our time horizons, both past and future, now stretch billions of years, not just thousands. The sun will keep shining for about another 6bn years. But ironically we can\u2019t forecast terrestrial trends with as much confidence as our ancestors could. Their lives and environment changed slowly from generation to generation. For us, technological change is so fast that scenarios quickly enter the realm of wild conjecture and science fiction.</p> <p>But some things we can predict, at least a few decades ahead. By mid-century, the world will be more crowded, and our collective footprint will be heavier. World population is now 7.2 billion and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/jun/28/over-populated-or-under-developed-real-story-population-growth\">forecast to rise to around 9 billion</a> by 2050. Experts predict continuing urbanisation \u2013 and huge growth of megacities such as Lagos, S\u00e3o Paulo and Delhi. Population trends later this century depend largely on what happens in Africa, where some UN predictions foresee a further doubling between 2050 and 2100.</p> <p>Moreover, if humanity\u2019s collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/johan_rockstrom_let_the_environment_guide_our_development?language=en\">Johan Rockstrom calls \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d</a>, the resultant \u201cecological shock\u201d could irreversibly degrade our biosphere. And if global warming reaches a tipping point that triggers melting of Greenland\u2019s ice, coastlines a millennium hence would be drastically different. Extinction rates are rising. We\u2019ve only identified about two million of the (estimated) 10 million living species: we\u2019re destroying the book of life before we\u2019ve read it. To quote the great ecologist EO Wilson, \u201cmass extinction is the sin that future generations will least forgive us for\u201d.</p> <p>The darkest prognosis for the next millennium is that bio, cyber or environmental catastrophes could foreclose humanity\u2019s immense potential, leaving a depleted biosphere. Darwinian selection would resume, perhaps leading, in some far-future geological era, to the re-emergence of intelligent beings. If this happens, or if there are aliens out there who actually visit and study the Earth, then, digging through the geological record (and applying archaeological techniques as well) they would uncover traces of a distinctive transient epoch, and ponder the all-too-brief flourishing of a species that failed in its stewardship of \u201cspaceship Earth\u201d.</p> <p>But there is an optimistic option.</p> <p>Human societies could navigate these threats, achieve a sustainable future, and inaugurate eras of post-human evolution even more marvellous than what\u2019s led to us. The dawn of the Anthropocene epoch would then mark a one-off transformation from a natural world to one where humans jumpstart the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that transcend our limitations and eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth.</p> <p>Even in a cosmic time-perspective, therefore, the 21st century is special. It marks our collective realisation that the Anthropocene has begun \u2013 and it\u2019s a century when human actions will determine how long that epoch lasts.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 30th August 2016. It originally stated there are an estimated 10 billion species. The correct figure is 10 million.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>Humanity\u2019s impact on the Earth is now so profound that a new geological epoch \u2013 the Anthropocene \u2013 needs to be declared, according to an official expert group who presented the recommendation to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town on Monday.</p> <p>The new epoch should begin about 1950, the experts said, and was likely to be defined by the radioactive elements dispersed across the planet by nuclear bomb tests, although an array of other signals, including plastic pollution, soot from power stations, concrete, and even the bones left by the global proliferation of the domestic chicken were now under consideration.</p> <p>The current epoch, the Holocene, is the 12,000 years of stable climate since the last ice age during which all human civilisation developed. But the striking acceleration since the mid-20th century of carbon dioxide emissions and sea level rise, the global mass extinction of species, and the transformation of land by deforestation and development mark the end of that slice of geological time, the experts argue. The Earth is so profoundly changed that the Holocene must give way to the Anthropocene.</p> <p>\u201cThe significance of the Anthropocene is that it sets a different trajectory for the Earth system, of which we of course are part,\u201d said Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester and chair of the <a href=\"http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/\">Working Group on the Anthropocene</a> (WGA), which started work in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cIf our recommendation is accepted, the Anthropocene will have started just a little before I was born,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lived most of our lives in something called the Anthropocene and are just realising the scale and permanence of the change.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and WGA secretary, said: \u201cBeing able to pinpoint an interval of time is saying something about how we have had an incredible impact on the environment of our planet.

There are so many signals.\u201d</p> <p>Other spikes being considered as evidence of the onset of the Anthropocene include the tough, unburned carbon spheres emitted by power stations. \u201cThe Earth has been smoked, with signals very clearly around the world in the mid-20th century,\u201d said Zalasiewicz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4b5cc0d83fe53da591103594caa09aeb773c2b7/0_107_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another candidate to be considered as evidence of the Anthropocene is plastic pollution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other candidates include plastic pollution, aluminium and concrete particles, and high levels of nitrogen and phosphate in soils, derived from artificial fertilisers. Although the world is currently seeing only the sixth mass extinction of species in the 700m-year history of complex life on Earth, this is unlikely to provide a useful golden spike as the animals are by definition very rare and rarely dispersed worldwide.</p> <p>In contrast, some species have with human help spread rapidly across the world. The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists. \u201cSince the mid-20th century, it has become the world\u2019s most common bird. It has been fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world,\u201d said Zalasiewicz. \u201cIt is is also a much bigger bird with a different skeleton than its prewar ancestor.\u201d </p> <p>The 35 scientists on the WGA \u2013 who voted 30 to three in favour of formally designating the Anthropocene, with two abstentions \u2013 will now spend the next two to three years determining which signals are the strongest and sharpest. Crucially, they must also decide a location which will define the start of the Anthropocene. Geological divisions are not defined by dates but by a specific boundary between layers of rock or, in the case of the Holocene, a boundary between two ice layers in a core taken from Greenland and now stored in Denmark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8fefb8d64ede01c7f9d65c77b2169c1fa34f535/0_96_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The domestic chicken is a serious contender to be a fossil that defines the Anthropocene for future geologists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scientists are focusing on sites where annual layers are formed and are investigating mud sediments off the coast of Santa Barbara in California and the Ernesto cave in northern Italy, where stalactites and stalagmites accrete annual rings.

To get me through the day I have about one coffee every hour \u2013 so about 12 to 18 a day. You might think this would inhibit my sleep, and I usually only get five to seven hours, but I never slept for very long even before I started to drink coffee.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have coffee for the first hour of the day as I\u2019m focused on<br>getting my son ready, but as soon as I start working it\u2019s the first<br>thing I need. I love Blue Mountain coffee from Jamaica, but usually I just have either Nescafe or Starbucks.</p> <p>At the beginning of August I tried to cut back, but started drinking more again about a week ago because I found not having it too hard. I had huge withdrawal symptoms, and hardly any energy. To keep my energy levels up I had to go to the gym loads and make sure I ate a lot.</p> <p>I would like to cut down on my coffee intake as it affects my energy levels (leaving me lethargic without it). I\u2019m thinking of new ways to change my caffeine habits, and would welcome suggestions.</p> <h2>Claire Ferguson, 53, London : \u2018After being a Mormon for years, I fell in love with coffee\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bbc262fe5e60104786f0ff40033fdbdb5498c39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc262fe5e60104786f0ff40033fdbdb5498c39f/0_24_206_206/206.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Ferguson\" width=\"206\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I tasted my first coffee 12 years ago, at the age of 41, and it was a heavenly experience. My best friend had taken me to a well-known coffee shop and I thought I heard angels sing while I was drinking it. </p> <p>I\u2019d spent my life before then avoiding the evils of coffee (and tea and cigarettes and alcohol \u2026 to name but a few restrictions) because of my belief in the Mormon church. </p> <p>In the years since that first cappuccino, and leaving the Mormon church, I have delighted in this new-found wonder. After 41 years of almost no caffeine (I\u2019d indulged in the occasional Diet Coke or Pepsi) the effects of coffee still feel fabulous.</p> <p>I have one coffee a day \u2013 a soya latte in the morning that jolts me awake. It is often the first thing I think of when I wake up and the thought of it makes me smile.</p> <p>One of the things I love about coffee is that it makes me feel better emotionally. If I\u2019m irritable or low, coffee changes that; it makes the world seem brighter. I can definitely say coffee is one of the loves of my life.</p> <h2>Tom Walters, 32, Chichester: \u2018The small things, such as the first sip of coffee, are what makes life beautiful\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"412f0cc42a4f02c24831a5c504e7ebcda2288621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/412f0cc42a4f02c24831a5c504e7ebcda2288621/0_0_720_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Walters\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a massive coffee drinker, but I need a strong one to wake me up \u2013 otherwise I can\u2019t shift that morning fog. However, I usually start off with a cup of tea, before moving on to two Nespresso pods (the stronger and more bitter the better) mixed with hot milk, all poured into a flask for my morning commute to Brighton.</p> <p>I may have another cup if I\u2019m feeling like a zombie (a byproduct of having a nine-month-old baby boy) but all caffeine-related activity must stop before 1pm. When I drink tea or coffee in the afternoon it seems to make me sluggish.</p> <p>I drink coffee for two reasons. Firstly, I adore the smell and taste of it. For some reason, it brings back nostalgic memories of travelling the world with my then fiance: I never started a day without a strong cup of local coffee. The other reason is its energy-providing properties (as I already mentioned). I\u2019ve had periods before when I\u2019ve stopped drinking it, but it\u2019s the small things \u2013 the first sip of coffee, or the smell of toast \u2013 that make life. The beautiful minutiae of existence.</p> <h2>Jasmin Bauer, 29, Hamburg: \u2018I hate coffee and have only met a handful of people who understand my plight\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a394298fd32bd050f9e309a9d1ca7641fdbaf72a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a394298fd32bd050f9e309a9d1ca7641fdbaf72a/83_0_637_800/398.jpg\" alt=\"Jasmin Bauer\" width=\"398\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I hate coffee. I don\u2019t even like anything with coffee flavouring. I do like the smell of roasted beans, but that\u2019s about it. And yes, I have tried all sorts of coffee: ones with lots of sugar or no sugar, milky ones and ones that are freshly-ground and so on. </p> <p>People always feel the need to convince me about how great coffee is and everyone looks startled when I say I don\u2019t drink it, asking how I can work and stay awake. I am the type of person who just gets up when the alarm rings. If I do feel the need for caffeine I drink Coke Zero and in extreme cases, such as when I go out at night, Red Bull.</p> <p>I have only met a handful of people who understand my plight. I don\u2019t even know how to make coffee, which has created some awkward situations in the past. For example, if I am expected to offer coffee to a client I panic and frantically try to find someone who can help. Then, when I am asked to make coffee again, I have already forgotten how to do it.</p> <h2>Paula Rose Toohey, 31, Tasmania: \u2018Coffee is the smell of my travels from Adelaide to Hobart with my brother\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c5b3a119fe3cdc41979ac5b4ab26eedc66ebb681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5b3a119fe3cdc41979ac5b4ab26eedc66ebb681/0_101_639_639/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Rose Toohey\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Coffee is the smell of childhood at my grandma\u2019s house, the scent of filter coffee permeating the house as she told me stories of being a migrant from Europe after the war \u2013 she always said she found not having real coffee harder than learning English. Coffee is working in a rainforest as part of John Howard\u2019s Green Corps programme, building walking tracks and eating chocolate-coated coffee beans. Coffee is my dad and mum watching the ABC news after dinner. </p> <p>It is travelling from Adelaide to Hobart with my brother in his car, camping as we were broke, and spending what money we had on a half-decent brew at the start of our trip. Coffee is me curled up in bed on a Sunday morning with my kitties reading the newspapers. And now it is me going to work and making people\u2019s days a bit better with my job as a barista. There is a saying: first coffee you are a customer, second cup you are a friend and third cup you are family.</p>",

In 2004, these supposedly white, male and mostly southern fans of the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/3/4/1495637/-NASCAR-has-a-political-problem-and-they-just-made-it-substantially-worse\">National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing</a> were targeted by Democrats in their battle with George W Bush. In 2016, after eight years of Barack Obama, they should be a bastion of enthusiasm for Trump.</p> <p>While other former swing demographics, such as \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the suburbs, look lost to Clinton for good, white men in America\u2019s red states are at the heart of Trump\u2019s support. Early on, the campaign heralded an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/704626119836901376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">endorsement by Nascar boss Brian France</a> and several drivers.</p> <p>Yet recently, outside the <a href=\"http://www.nascarhall.com/\">Nascar Hall of Fame</a> in Charlotte, the mood among visiting families who spoke to the Guardian before a recent Trump rally in the city seemed at best to have stalled.</p> <p>At first, Keith, a former military man from nearby Fayetteville, home to Fort Bragg, the world\u2019s largest military base, was supportive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely against Hillary and I voted for [Trump] for the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no filter.

In 2012, it was the only swing state that Obama lost to Mitt Romney. Since then it has swung further to the right, replacing one of its senators with a Republican in 2014 and sitting at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/north-carolina-judge-transgender-bathrooms-identity-choice\">a conservative backlash</a> against transgender rights.</p> <p>Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">five of the last presidential opinion polls here have show Clinton ahead</a>. If Trump cannot win North Carolina, something is going badly wrong.</p> <p>Keith, who like many Trump voters was reluctant to give his surname, echoed the very issue that the campaign is most worried could alienate voters in increasingly diverse states like this come November.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea</p> <footer> <cite>Mark, 35, from Connecticut</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way he deals with certain things worries me,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration is a big thing.

It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially as it\u2019s the land of the free.\u201d</p> <p>For core supporters, Trump\u2019s intolerant views and loud mouth matter less. For example, Keith\u2019s friend Kaycee, an accountant from Great Falls, Montana, was less worried: \u201cI would vote for Trump even though his social game isn\u2019t so hot. He is an incredible businessman and I really think that\u2019s what America needs right now. Sometimes he has no filter, but sometimes that\u2019s not a bad quality.\u201d</p> <p>But among floating voters, particularly in states without a tradition of voting Republican but where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/01/trump-clinton-kaine-rust-belt-pennsylvania-ohio\">Trump\u2019s economic message is resonating</a>, people are easily turned off by the billionaire\u2019s brash style.</p> <p>\u201cFrom where I come from, they call him a bullshit artist,\u201d said Neil, a 63-year-old self-employed heating and air-conditioning contractor from Providence, Rhode Island, who was also visiting the Nascar Hall of Fame on the day Trump landed in town.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a big fan. I just don\u2019t trust what he says. He\u2019s got that very pushy attitude. From a political standpoint, I don\u2019t think he is doing that well. He just squirts off what\u2019s off the top of his head. I don\u2019t think he spends a lot time thinking about what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p> <p>The younger voters get, the bluer the state they come from, the more Trump\u2019s style is a turn-off. Even, it turns out, for white dads at the Nascar shrine.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s thin on policy, big on broad-based authoritarian statements,\u201d said Mark, a 35-year-old engineer from Connecticut. \u201cSaying \u2018I am the only one who can fix everything you need\u2019 sounds a lot like a dictator in Latin America or North Korea or something.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is very popular in a very narrow strip of America. That works well in a Republican primary, but not in a general election.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to capture states like North Carolina would kill Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. Worse, for Republicans, the mood among potential voters here speaks to the party\u2019s concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/republican-donors-trump-congress-local-races-sheldon-adelson\">losing the control of the Senate</a> that was gained two years ago with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/north-carolina-midterm-elections-thom-tillis-obamacare\">victories like that of Thom Tillis</a>.</p> <p>Senate seats last for six years, so Tillis is safe for now, but his North Carolina colleague Richard Burr is up for re-election.

The Malawi-born artist and author has also been selected for an artist commission at the upcoming Frieze art fair this autumn.

If so, then Wifredo Lam is a startling subversive who turned this cultural arrogance upside down. This Cuban painter moved in avant-garde circles in pre-second world war Paris, joined the surrealist movement, then returned home to paint his masterpiece The Jungle (1943) in which masked dancers move in a dreamlike space. Lam is a truly powerful modern artist who deserves to be much more famous. This is a much-needed retrospective for the man who painted Cuba into the story of modern art.<strong><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong>\u2022 14 September to 8 January, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-wifredo-lam\">Tate Modern, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Richard Serra </strong></h2> <p>Old man Serra, he just keeps rolling out the steel. There are very few things in today\u2019s art that can hold a candle to the formidable and moving sculpture of this great American artist \u2013 except perhaps his drawings. The Gagosian Gallery is showing both, in a two-site stunner that combines Serra\u2019s latest colossal creation with his savagely bleak works on paper.

This promises to be a fascinating encounter between two great British artists who share a straight-talking beauty of voice and vision. Emin is the most creative and authentic of all the British artists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/12/tracey-emin-sarah-lucas-shop\">leapt to fame in the 1990s</a>. What she most shares with Blake, who created his radical art in the age of the French Revolution, is a desire to change how we see and how we live. <strong><br></strong>\u202216 September to 3 September 2017, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-liverpool/display/tracey-emin-and-william-blake-focus\">Tate Liverpool</a>.</p> <h2><strong>William Kentridge: Thick Time </strong></h2> <p>Growing from his excoriating hand-drawn animations about apartheid in his native South Africa, William Kentridge\u2019s art has developed and diversified into lecture/performances, full-blown installations and even opera direction. Kentridge\u2019s exhibition features works about Leon Trotsky, the inexplicable nature of time, and models for his forthcoming production of Alban Berg\u2019s Lulu (1935) for <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/lulu/\">English National Opera</a>. <strong><br></strong>\u2022 21 September to 15 January, <a href=\"http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/william-kentridge/\">Whitechapel Gallery, London</a>.</p> <h2>Lucia Nogueira</h2> <p>Brazilian-born sculptor Lucia Nogueira was a maker of delicate, violent, and psychologically intrusive and unstable objects. This rare UK exhibition, including work never shown before, is a reminder of just how inexplicably complex and rewarding her art was, and how her sculpture and drawing could both raise the hairs on the back of your neck and make you burst out laughing. <br>\u2022 22 September to 29 October, <a href=\"http://www.annelyjudafineart.co.uk/exhibitions/lucia-nogueira\">Annely Juda Fine Art, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Jannis Kounellis</strong><br></h2> <p>The man who made live parrots an art material reveals his latest work. At the age of 80, this Greek-born artist is very much of the moment, his installations with their often unpredictable elements and ecological sensibilities in tune with much younger artists. History will see him as the greatest artist of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/03/giuseppe-penone-arte-povera-whitechapel-gallery\">arte povera</a> movement that came together in 1960s Italy. It is not just that he is edgier than other arte povera artists: there is a profound sense of the history of things in his work, a gritty, poetic feel of the rural past and rage at the industrial present. There\u2019s so much more to him than an undead parrot.<strong> <br></strong>\u2022 23 September to 29 October, <a href=\"http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/jannis_kounellis_masons_yard_2016/\">White Cube, Mason\u2019s Yard</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a789687f05ee3251af5f2f29ee618dc72ed6ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a789687f05ee3251af5f2f29ee618dc72ed6ae/205_99_3045_2156/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senza Titolo by Jannis Kounellis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senza Titolo by Jannis Kounellis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Westoby/White Cube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mike Kelley: Framed and Frame</h2> <p>The uneven, sprawling work of troubled and talented LA artist Mike Kelley shows an endless curiosity and dark humour, and frequently had an autobiographical source.

Abstract expressionism is a mystery to this day \u2013 how did a nation that had seemed artistically provincial suddenly speak so powerfully and with such soul? Where did this grand and tragic sensibility come from \u2013 and where did it go? Today, a reality TV star spouts terrifying idiocy, and it is called politics.

The Image as Question: An Exploration of Evidential Photography</strong></h2> <p>Though photographers as diverse as Peter Beard and Weegee, Harold Edgerton and Simon Norfolk, this exhibition looks at how documentary photographs were used in the past to illustrate facts or provide evidence and how, over the years, those same images have accrued new meanings and become unmoored from their original contexts.

This dangerous artist \u2013 dangerous aesthetically in his destruction of any emotional screen between a painting and its beholder, dangerous in person if he had his sword with him \u2013 inspired a legion of followers with his dark charisma. These \u201cCaravaggisti\u201d spread his influence all over Europe. This exhibition starts with Caravaggio himself and goes on to reveal the power of such 17th-century disciples as Georges de la Tour and Jusepe de Ribera. It is a shadowy voyage through the afterlife of one of Europe\u2019s most unsettling and mesmerising artists.<strong><br></strong>\u2022 12 October to 15 January, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/beyond-caravaggio\">National Gallery, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The Vulgar: Fashion Redefined</strong></h2> <p>\u201cVulgarity,\u201d says the psychoanalyst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/adam-phillips-life-in-writing\">Adam Phillips</a>, \u201cexposes the scandal of good taste.\u201d Together with fashion curator Judith Clark, he is preparing to expose the great scandal in all its extravagant, ostentatious and downright crude glory.

It was made about 70,000 years ago (at a site in use 100,000 years ago), and people have been creating all kinds of art in South Africa ever since. In the 19th century, the San hunter-gatherers were still making rock art reminiscent of ice-age cave painting. This and other traditions suffered at the hands of colonialism and apartheid. But today\u2019s SA celebrates its complex cultural heritage, and this exhibition promises an epic survey from the first efforts of Homo sapiens to contemporary installations.

Ensor (1860-1949) was part-symbolist, part-expressionist and visionary, and his carnivalesque art, rooted as much in a sense of place as in his imagination, is a foil to Tuyman\u2019s own deadpan morbid humour.<strong><br></strong>\u2022 29 October to 29 January, <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/james-ensor-luc-tuymans\">Royal Academy, London</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection </strong></h2> <p>Masterpieces from Man Ray, Dorothea Lange, Brassa\u00ef, Rodchenko and Kert\u00e9sz feature in this intriguing show curated from the extensive collection of modernist photography amassed by Sir Elton John.

Research suggests that up to 60% of consumers would pay more for environmentally or socially responsible products. Interestingly, the proportion of people who actually pay more for these products is significantly lower than those who say they will. I know of a leading American company that bases their investments on 15% of their target market paying more for a product with a positive sustainability story. I\u2019m also aware that the so-called \u201cdiscount\u201d retailers have been aggressively recruiting CRS teams in recent years.

I think it\u2019s a naive view of how things work. While there are a small number of organisations that have been able to adapt their business models or products relatively quickly, for the vast majority it is inconceivable.</p> <p>Success is achieved less through big wins and enthusiastic approval, but via little nudges and passive acquiescence. \u201cDid they say yes?\u201d \u201cWell, they didn\u2019t say no.\u201d For all the time I\u2019ve worked in the industry, I can\u2019t remember a success that was achieved because anyone ever wanted to operate more responsibly or to be more sustainable. The victories have been about managing risk, protecting or enhancing brand reputation, saving money, competitive advantage, a created fear of inaction or, simply, grinding people down. It\u2019s nudges, pokes, prompts, subtleties \u2013 and more nudges.</p> <p>The cold hard truth is that businesses will invariably want to explore any potential commercial benefit of more ethical operations, looking at opportunities to \u201csell\u201d sustainability either by charging a slight premium (\u201crenewable only\u201d energy tariffs) or by outcompeting a rival (two bars of chocolate at the same price, but one is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/fair-trade\" title=\"\">Fairtrade</a>).

  "<p>The mother of slain British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung has said she has no desire to meet her alleged killer, while decrying the \u201cnonsense\u201d in public discussion linking the tragedy to Islamic fundamentalism.</p> <p>Rosie Ayliffe, writing for UK newspaper the Independent about her daughter\u2019s death at an Australian backpackers\u2019 hostel last week, said the alleged murderer, the French national Smail Ayad, had \u201cnever set foot in a mosque\u201d.</p> <p>Queensland police separately confirmed there was still no evidence that Ayad \u2013 who has also been charged with the attempted murder of Briton Tom Jackson in an alleged stabbing spree at the hostel in Home Hill, north Queensland \u2013 was even a practising Muslim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/28/father-of-british-sta-attack-victim-tom-jackson-says-he-is-immensely-proud\">Backpacker stabbing: father 'immensely proud' of critically injured Tom Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ayliffe said that \u201cmuch nonsense is being spoken in the press about [my daughter\u2019s] alleged killer\u201d, who was \u201cnot an Islamic fundamentalist, he has never set foot in a mosque\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe TV engineer who visited yesterday said, \u2018Well we know what that was about, it was that Moslemic terrorism!\u2019 Thanks for clarifying,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Supt Ray Rohweder, of Queensland police, said it was unlikely that investigators would ever be able to rule out Ayad having attended a mosque but \u201cwe certainly found nothing \u2013 no Koran, nothing of a religious nature \u2013 to suggest he was a practising Muslim\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou would think [if he were, there would be] a Koran or a prayer mat, or something like that, but there was nothing of that nature,\u201d Rohweder told the Guardian. \u201cWe are conducting inquiries overseas but there is nothing to suggest he\u2019s a practising Muslim.\u201d</p> <p>Despite police ruling out extremist motives for the killing, the case was cited by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/politicians-jostle-to-cry-lone-wolf-over-stabbing-of-british-backpacker-in-queensland\">some Australian politicians who called for restrictions on Muslim immigration</a>. Continued speculation on social media worldwide about the significance of Ayad\u2019s alleged cries of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d [God is greatest in Arabic], amid what French-speaking witnesses told investigators was incoherent speech, has been a source of ongoing frustration for police.</p> <p>Ayliffe, who is writing a daily blog for the Independent while preparing to travel to Australia to collect her daughter\u2019s ashes, noted that Ayad, who has also been charged with seriously assaulting 12 police officers after being taken into custody, had been prevented from appearing in Townsville magistrates court last Friday over public safety concerns.</p> <p>She said she was unlikely to meet Ayad and she did not want to.</p> <p>Ayliffe said there would be a place of remembrance in the UK for Mia, who was just days into an 88-day stint of casual farm labour \u2013 picking stones from between sugar cane rows \u2013 to extend her Australian working holiday visa.</p> <p>But she decided to have her daughter\u2019s body cremated in Australia and to give vials containing her ashes to her friends from around the world \u201cto scatter in places dear to her or to them. That way she can visit places she hasn\u2019t visited yet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fully aware that her body is on a slab somewhere in a cold dark place,\u201d Ayliffe said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t mind the dark but she\u2019s not good with the cold. I couldn\u2019t bear for her to be kept like that for weeks and decided she needed to be cremated sooner rather than later.\u201d</p> <p>An autopsy completed last Friday showed Ayliffe-Chung had died as a result of multiple stab wounds, police have said.</p> <p>Jackson, an aspiring journalist who police have said received stab wounds to the eye, face and torso after coming to Ayliffe-Chung\u2019s aid during the alleged attack, remains on life support in Townsville hospital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/politicians-jostle-to-cry-lone-wolf-over-stabbing-of-british-backpacker-in-queensland\">Politicians jostle to cry 'lone wolf' over stabbing of British backpacker in Queensland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His father, Les, who travelled to his bedside from the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/28/father-of-british-sta-attack-victim-tom-jackson-says-he-is-immensely-proud\">said in a statement:</a> \u201cThere are many and varied reasons why we are, and always will be, immensely proud of Tom.</p> <p>\u201cHis actions in response to this horrific attack only add to that sense of pride.\u201d</p> <p>Ayliffe wrote of the beginning of processing her grief at the death of her daughter, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in almost a year: \u201cIn my head she\u2019s still alive, well and living in Australia, cracking jokes about throwing stones and setting up a stall to sell the rocks she\u2019d picked up as part of her farm work. </p> <p>\u201cAt the moment the only way I can really cope with our loss is to think Mia\u2019s time had come and what happened in that hostel on Tuesday was her fate. It was always going to happen like that. </p> <p>\u201cShe was lent to us for a period of time and now, in Ben Jonson\u2019s words, she\u2019s been \u2018exacted by the Lord on the just day\u2019. (I always struggled to teach that poem without welling up!) </p> <p>\u201cBut I also think that wise little girl was here for a reason and part of my journey will be to find out what that reason was.\u201d</p> <p>The charges against Ayad are due to be heard in court again on 28 October.</p>"
