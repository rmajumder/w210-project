  "<p>In a few days, one of the world\u2019s largest cruise ships, the Crystal Serenity, will visit the tiny Inuit village of Ulukhaktok in northern Canada. Hundreds of passengers will be ferried to the little community, more than doubling its population of around 400. The Serenity will then raise anchor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises\" title=\"\">head through the Northwest Passage</a> to visit several more Inuit settlements before sailing to Greenland and finally New York.</p> <p>It will be a massive undertaking, representing an almost tenfold increase in passenger numbers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\" title=\"\"> taken through the Arctic on a single vessel </a>\u2013 and it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/my-arctic-journey-fragile-ecosystem-northwest-passage\" title=\"\">triggered considerable controversy</a> among Arctic experts. Inuit leaders fear that visits by giant cruise ships could overwhelm fragile communities, while others warn that the Arctic ecosystem, already suffering the effects of global warming, could be seriously damaged.</p> <p>\u201cThis is extinction tourism,\u201d said international law expert Professor Michael Byers, of the University of British Columbia. \u201cMaking this trip has only become possible because carbon emissions have so warmed the atmosphere that Arctic sea ice in summer is disappearing. The terrible irony is that this ship \u2013 which even has a helicopter for sightseeing and a huge staff-to-passenger ratio \u2013 has an enormous carbon footprint that is only going to make things even worse in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>The Serenity is by far the biggest cruise vessel to traverse the fabled Northwest Passage, whose exploration has claimed the lives of hundreds of seamen. The ship has a crew of 655 and carries 1,070 passengers, who have paid between \u00a319,000 and \u00a3120,000 for a voyage that Crystal Cruises says will take them on an \u201cintrepid adventure\u201d from Anchorage in Alaska to New York over 32 days.</p> <p>For its part, Crystal insists its clients will have to follow a strict code of conduct during shore visits, while the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges will be tightly controlled. Only low-sulphur fuel will be burned in the Serenity\u2019s engines, said a spokesman. The Serenity will be accompanied by the UK icebreaker the RSS Ernest Shackleton, he added.</p> <p>However, it is not the voyage that directly poses danger, Byers said. \u201cThis is a well-supported, carefully worked-out trip. I acknowledge that. The trouble is that it is going to open the door to mass tourism in the high Arctic and many other operators \u2013 who could easily turn out to be far less scrupulous or painstaking \u2013 will be eyeing it up for major operations. That could end in disaster. \u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams\">Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This point was backed by Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cFar too many people will be descending suddenly into these communities and bringing far too much garbage with them,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThese places lack the infrastructure and the training to deal with the incredible numbers of people that will start arriving on these boats.\u201d Apart from Ulukhaktok, the Serenity is also scheduled to visit the Inuit communities of Pond Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Sisimiut.</p> <p>Eegeesiak added that the Inuit were already experiencing problems thanks to global warming. As sea ice disappears, this removes a highway on which locals can ride their snowmobiles and dog sleds to hunt and visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of communities and limits the ability of people to hunt, a problem that is only likely to worsen as the region\u2019s shrinking ice-cap opens it up to mining, oil drilling, tourism and more shipping.</p> <p>In addition, there is the question of food. The Inuit have no farms and rely on what they can catch from the ice and water around them for sustenance. But this food chain is under threat. Algae grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals and finally polar bears. However, if the bottom rung of this food chain disappears because sea ice is melting, then all sorts of unintended consequences could soon be realised, marine biologists have warned. Mass tourism is only going to make this worse, they add.</p> <p>This point was stressed by Eegeesiak. \u201cIt is not just the communities we need to worry about when these great boats arrive but all the wildlife of the region,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Earlier this month Crystal announced that it was already taking bookings for a similar 32-day cruise through the Northwest Passage for 2017. In addition, it revealed it has ordered construction of \u201cthe world\u2019s first purpose-built polar class megayacht, the Crystal Endeavour\u201d. The ship \u2013 which will cruise exclusively in the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 will carry underwater scooters to allow passengers to experience their own subsea exploration and will be fitted with some of the largest bedroom suites ever put in a cruise ship. \u201cThis megayacht will change the game entirely \u2013 the possibilities for expedition travellers will be virtually limitless,\u201d said Crystal president Edie Rodriguez.</p> <p>But such an opening up of the Arctic to tourism dismays Byers. \u201cOne big ship is perhaps manageable but five or six is tempting disaster. Glaciers are crumbling more and more up there and we are getting more and more icebergs in the water.</p> <p>\u201cIf a ship carrying 3,000 passengers hits one of those you could be in real trouble. This is an incredibly remote region. It could take two days to get search-and-rescue helicopters up there. Yet an accident like that is almost inevitable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Fresh evidence is emerging that refugees stranded in camps across Greece are falling victim to rising levels of vice peddled by mafia gangs who see the entrapped migrants as perfect prey for prostitution, drug trafficking and human smuggling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/child-refugees-sexually-assaulted-at-official-greek-camps\">\u2018Sexual assaults on children\u2019 at Greek refugee camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Details of the alarming conditions present in many of the facilities comes as the Greek government \u2013 facing criticism after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/child-refugees-sexually-assaulted-at-official-greek-camps\"><em>Observer\u2019</em>s expos\u00e9 of sexual abuse in camps</a> last week \u2013 announced urgent measures to deal with the crisis. A further four refugee centres, it said, would be set up in a bid to improve severe overcrowding, a major source of tensions in the camps.</p> <p>Aid workers say an estimated 58,000 migrants and asylum seekers in Greece are increasingly being targeted by Greek and Albanian mafias. Tales of criminals infiltrating camps to recruit vulnerable women and men are legion.</p> <p>\u201cIf nothing is done to improve the lifestyle of these refugees and to use their time more productively, I see a major disaster,\u201d warned Nesrin Abaza, an American aid worker volunteering at the first privately funded camp known as Elpida (Greek for hope) outside Thessaloniki. \u201cThese camps are a fertile breeding ground for terrorism, gangs and violence. It seems like the world has forgotten about them. They are not headline news any more, so therefore they do not exist \u2026 but the neglect will show its ugly head.\u201d</p> <p>With an estimated 55 centres nationwide \u2013 including \u201chotspots\u201d on the Aegean islands within view of Turkey \u2013 Greece has effectively become a huge holding pen for refugees since EU and Balkan countries closed their borders to shut them out earlier this year.</p> <p>In private, many Greek officials express alarm that numbers are growing amid worrying signs that the five-month-old deal signed between Ankara and the EU to keep the flows in check is on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Although nowhere near the level of last summer \u2013 when at its height 10,000 people streamed into Lesbos in a day \u2013 arrivals have risen visibly since last month\u2019s failed coup in Turkey. In the 24-hour period between Thursday and Friday some 261 migrants and refugees \u2013 nearly double the normal number \u2013 were picked up on islands.</p> <p>Unable to move on, frustration has mounted among the thousands now stuck in limbo. On the back of uncertainty and anger over delayed asylum processes, marooned migrants say they have become sitting ducks for criminals as they move in. \u201cI never knew a thing about drugs and now I am doing drugs,\u201d said a 17-year-old Syrian youth detained in a camp that stands in a defunct Softex toilet-roll factory on the outskirts of Thessaloniki. \u201cThis camp is horrid. We live like animals in tents in burning heat.\u201d</p> <p>Drugs, he ventured, had become the central cause for violence, with brawls erupting frequently. \u201cThe Greek and Albanian mafia come here and push the drugs,\u201d he explained conceding that he financed his own habit by illicitly sneaking into Macedonia, where he bought cartons of cigarettes to sell in the camp. \u201cThe police are non-existent. They see drugs, stabbing, fighting and do nothing. They do not care. The world does not care.\u201d</p> <p>The testimony, which is backed up by human rights groups that have deplored the appalling conditions in Greek detention centres, comes after the EU released \u20ac83m (\u00a371.8m) in April to improve living conditions for refugees stranded in the country. The UN refugee agency, the International Federation of the Red Cross and six international NGOs were given the bulk of the funding. Greece by then had already received \u20ac181m to help deal with the crisis from Brussels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/turkey-announces-more-active-role-in-syria-conflict\">Turkey announces more active role in Syria conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Announcing the emergency support, the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/stylianides_en\">Christos Stylianides</a>, claimed the assistance was \u201ca concrete example of how the EU delivers on the challenges Europe faces\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to restore dignified living conditions for refugees and migrants in Europe as swiftly as possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But four months later, as allegations of sexual abuse and criminal activity envelop the camps, questions are mounting over whether the money was properly administered. In addition to bad sanitary conditions and lack of police protection, the latest revelations have shone a light on whether the humanitarian system is working at all.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no emphasis on humanity, it is all about numbers,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elpida-home-project-thessaloniki-greece-refugees-factory_us_57a3ab7fe4b03ba68011d08f\">Amed Khan</a>, a financier turned philanthropist who founded Elpida, told the <em>Observer</em>. Elpida, also established in a former factory near Thessaloniki, has a tea room and yoga centre and, seeing itself as a pioneering initiative, encourages refugees to regard it as a home.

  "<p>\u201cPhotography has allowed me to be visually impaired,\u201d says Tanvir Bush. \u201cYou can feel very looked at when you are out with your guide dog taking pictures and it is good to be able to direct that energy back just by returning that gaze with your camera. In a very real way, photography has freed me.\u201d</p> <p>Bush is one of several photographers from around the globe whose work features in an intriguing new book from Redstone Press entitled <em>The Blind Photographer</em>. Like many of the practitioners therein, whose work ranges from staged art photography to straight documentary and portraiture, she is not totally blind, but suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease that leads to loss of peripheral vision and eventual blindness. \u201cI had worked previously as a film producer and had always deferred to the director and cinematographer,\u201d she says, \u201cso it was very exciting for me to find my own unique voice though photography. It was a huge creative breakthrough for me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/aug/20/the-work-of-blind-photographers-in-pictures\">The work of blind photographers \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For sighted people, the idea of a blind photographer is a contradiction in terms, the medium being so purely visual in regard to subject, style, light and composition. The British photographer Martin Parr describes the book as \u201ca revelation\u201d and notes how blind photographers \u201ccapture a feeling about the world and their relationship to it through photography which is often as elegant and compelling as sighted photographers\u201d.</p> <p>That feeling about the world can be visually poetic, as in the Slovenian philosopher Evgen Bav\u010dar\u2019s extraordinary series of dreamscapes, or even observational, as in Ana Maria Fernandez\u2019s intimate glimpses of a young couple kissing in a park. But it can also be expressed conceptually, as with Gerardo Nigenda\u2019s erotic visual poem, in which braille text is punched into monochrome images of bodies and faces.</p> <p>How, though, does a blind photographer manage to somehow \u201csee\u201d, and transform, the world through a camera in images that, in the case of the totally blind, he or she will never actually see? On a purely practical level, many blind photographers work with assistants to advise them on camera positions and composition, while others employ cutting-edge digital technology. A recent smartphone camera app developed at the University of California Santa Cruz, for instance, allows photographers with impaired vision to dispense with the shutter button, which many find difficult to locate, in favour of an upward swiping gesture. The app also uses facial recognition technology; through the phone\u2019s inbuilt speaker it announces the number of faces in a frame and also helps the photographer using audio instructions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa97aa76a47b9670d89d9a4030eb79cee70bf84c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa97aa76a47b9670d89d9a4030eb79cee70bf84c/0_0_6869_4121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, by Evgen Bav\u010dar, a Slovenian philosopher who has taken up photography.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled, by Evgen Bav\u010dar, a Slovenian philosopher who has taken up photography.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evgen Bav\u010dar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If digital technology has made the hands-on process of photography altogether more accessible for blind and partially sighted people, as it has for all of us, they must also rely to a degree on ingenuity and instinct. \u201cI sometime give vocal cues to the people I am photographing,\u201d says Bush, \u201cand, if they are performing for my camera, I will use marks on the ground for them and for me much as I would if I was directing actors in a film. Out on the street, though, you also learn to trust the camera as an extension of yourself almost in a paparazzi way.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of seeing without sight is a crucial one for Gina Badenoch, a Mexican photographer, who collaborated on the production of the book and is the founder of the Mexican organisation <a href=\"http://www.ojosquesienten.org/en/index.php\">Ojos Que Sienten</a> (the group calls itself Sight of Emotion in English, but a more literal translation is \u201ceyes that feel\u201d), which \u201cencourages blind people to connect with the sighted world using the language of photography\u201d. She tells me that people thought she was crazy when she began the project. \u201cEven now, 10 years on, when people first hear about the project, they think it is an impossible idea,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is because they tend to focus on sight as the only way to produce and enjoy an image. But the process of creating a photograph also involves feeling, story, perception. When you listen to the radio or read a book, you still create images in your mind because we see with our brain. So it is with blind people \u2013 through perceiving their surroundings they create images.\u201d</p> <p>Badenoch cites the work of Aar\u00f3n Ramos, a hero in his native Mexico, who makes allegorical images \u2013 broken china plates whose intricate patterns have been fractured, insects and flowers whose fragile, miniature beauty is accentuated in vivid close-up \u2013 that are both acutely personal and universal. \u201cI use my senses \u2013 hearing, touch, taste and smell \u2013 when taking pictures,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I touch the camera lens I create an imaginary line from the lens to the object I am taking a picture of; I create the picture in my mind, I feel it and construct it to communicate feelings to the normal-visual world.\u201d</p> <p>Mickel Smithen, a British performance artist, dancer, cabaret performer and photographer, embraced photography seriously after an intensive immersive course organised by <a href=\"https://photovoice.org/\">PhotoVoice</a>, which uses digital visual storytelling to give a platform to the marginalised and disadvantaged. He describes sitting in the front row of a dance performance with his camera and listening to the \u201cbrush of bare feet on the dusty floor\u201d, becoming alert to where and how the dancers were moving. From the sound of their breathing he knew when they had their backs turned to him or were facing him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9f5ee3ad7ab35b4717f335af4693b28c5708e4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f5ee3ad7ab35b4717f335af4693b28c5708e4d/0_21_4961_2978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, Mexico, 2010-15, by Aar\u00f3n Ramos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled, Mexico, 2010-15, by Aar\u00f3n Ramos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aar\u00f3n Ramos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m a dancer myself so I was drawn to capturing shapes and movement,\u201d he says of his initial impulse to photograph his fellow dancers, \u201cbut the first thing I learned is that photography works at a different, slower pace. I had to slow right down, concentrate and take my time just to manage spatial awareness and composition.\u201d Smithen\u2019s painterly images of dancers utilise blur and grain, elements he was initially suspicious of because they \u201cmeant that maybe I was not so good technically\u201d. Two years down the line, he realises that they reflect his own experience \u2013 \u201cI often have these moments of blur myself\u201d \u2013 as a partially sighted person who can only see the results of his own efforts by utilising advanced magnification software on his computer.</p> <p>Like others in the book, both Smithen and Bush use photography as a liberating means of self-expression, even though it is not their primary medium. \u201cI\u2019m a novelist, first and foremost,\u201d says Bush, \u201cand interestingly, it would never enter my mind to consider myself a blind novelist. Because photography is not the thing I aspire to, I don\u2019t mind the description so much, but if it was my life the way writing is, I would not allow anyone to put me in that box.\u201d</p> <p>All of the photographers in the book make work against the odds in various ways and for different reasons. They subvert the idea of photography as an act of looking and are united by an often elaborate imaginative vision of the world, rather than an actual one \u2013 memory, emotions and experience all feed into an acute and heightened way of seeing. \u201cEven a blind person has visual equipment, optical needs, as someone who is longing for light in a dark room,\u201d writes Evgen Bav\u010dar, \u201cFrom this desire, I photograph.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Blind Photographer is published by Redstone Press (\u00a329.95) on 8 September.

  "<p>Enemies in politics and opposed on nearly all fronts, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have found themselves united together against Barack Obama and a tradition that has kept America in charge of the world economy\u2019s rules for more than 70 years. The next president of the United States is rethinking free trade.</p> <p>In Washington, that tradition was taken for granted for so long that it rarely attracted much attention even in the business press, let alone dominated the politics pages of an entire election season. But in 2016, America\u2019s faltering faith in free trade has become the most sensitive controversy in DC \u2013 never before have both main presidential candidates broken with the orthodoxy that globalisation is always good for Americans.</p> <p>The proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, suddenlyfaces a wall of political opposition among lawmakers who had, not long ago, nearly set the giant deal in stone. Parallel negotiations between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), are suddenly even more behind: hamstrung by similar opposition as well as complications created by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The White House has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/10/obama-defends-tpp-deal-dismisses-secrecy-concerns\">refused to give up</a>, however, as it weighs the stakes of a <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011916/brief-history-international-trade-agreements.asp\">system of multilateral deals largely invented by the US after the second world war</a>.

We\u2019re not reversing that,\u201d Obama said in a press conference earlier this month. When he returns to the White House on Sunday, salvaging TPP is near the top of his remaining agenda, with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/obama-trade-deal-tpp-227038#ixzz4HUxL57CU\">30 events planned</a> around the county to help persuade wavering lawmakers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged</p> <footer> <cite>Edward Alden, Council on Foreign Relations</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His would-be successor had a very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton-tpp-disapproval-critical-turning-point\">different message</a> at a manufacturing facility in suburban Detroit earlier this month. In a facility where work is being done on a rocket for <a href=\"http://futuramic.com/from-macomb-to-mars-county-firm-manufactures-hardware-of-dreams/\">a future Nasa mission to Mars</a>, Clinton rejected much of TPP\u2019s globalist philosophy.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that too often, past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out,\u201d Clinton told about 500 union workers and supporters. \u201cThose promises now ring hollow.</p> <p> \u201cI will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages \u2013 including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d she said. \u201cI oppose it now, I\u2019ll oppose it after the election, and I\u2019ll oppose it as president.\u201d</p> <p>The speech marked a dramatic shift for Clinton, who <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/15/politics/45-times-secretary-clinton-pushed-the-trade-bill-she-now-opposes/index.html\">long supported the agreement</a> and helped orchestrate negotiations as Obama\u2019s first secretary of state.

But for Alden it is more about the alternative challenge posed by China, which is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-ceo-trade-idUSKCN10Q1NS\">seeking its own deal</a> with the TPP participants if the US cannot fulfill its promise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/donald-trump-free-trade-foreign-policy-china-republicans\">How Donald Trump upended Republican orthodoxy on free trade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the architecture going forward,\u201d says Alden. \u201cChina would like to see a very different set of trade rules. If TPP fails, the rest of the countries in Asia will have no choice but to go in the direction that China wants to move. The irony of it all is that opposing TPP will probably help China most.\u201d</p> <p>For the White House, this is the biggest reason to keep battling for TPP. If China seizes control of the Asian trade agenda, then it could quickly assert political and security dominance over the region and leave Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d toward the region in tatters.</p> <p>But few insiders think Clinton or congressional Republicans, much less Trump, will drop their opposition. \u201cThe idea that we are going to sacrifice manufacturing jobs to suit some esoteric foreign policy goal is just really not going to fly,\u201d one senior DC lobbyist said.</p> <p>Even the fabled influence of corporate America may not be enough to swing the argument, as illustrated by the scene of Clinton\u2019s speech, Detroit.</p> <p>\u201cWe export $140bn of finished vehicles and parts. We have supported every trade agreement in history, but we remain sceptical of this one,\u201d said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council and a former governor of Missouri.</p> <p>Among the three big members, Ford openly opposes TPP because it fears the deal does nothing to stop Japan manipulating its currency at the expense of US rivals. But even General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have refused to come out swinging for a deal that would, in theory, open up important new markets in Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>For many US businessmen, the lack of political support for trade is perplexing, even in rust belt states where the most is at stake.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given that the economy is kind of coming back right now, I just didn\u2019t understand why trade was so prominent this race</p> <footer> <cite>David Lawrence, vice-president, AlphaUSA</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cGiven that the economy is kind of coming back right now, something that is so key to the economy [as trade], I just didn\u2019t understand why it was so prominent this race, and not some other issue,\u201d said David Lawrence, vice-president of AlphaUSA, a fastener manufacturer based in suburban Detroit.</p> <p>Alpha opened in Detroit nearly six decades ago, later moving to the suburbs.

There\u2019s no margins for anything, it\u2019s like \u2013 basically you\u2019re lucky to make 10% on stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The competitive nature of business under free trade still rattles his father and grandfather, who launched the company over five decades ago. \u201cThey still don\u2019t understand,\u201d Semple said. \u201cHow could they do this or this? We used to write on a bar napkin the price, and whoever the highest was, we\u2019d submit it and get the work.\u201d</p> <p>The trade debate has particularly resonated in Michigan\u2019s Macomb County, which produced the band of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d who helped propel the former Republican president to victory, and whom Trump has promised to reinvigorate. </p> <p>Kurt Larson, 66, a retired auto worker who lives in Macomb County\u2019s seat, Mount Clemens, recalled living in Arizona and how his father used to work for Motorola and witnessed first-hand the effect of jobs moving out of the US. \u201cHe would go to other countries,\u201d Larson said, \u201cthey would build factories and get people to assemble semiconductors for 30 cents an hour.\u201d And as trade deals came into place, the trend continued. </p> <p>\u201cI never want to see jobs that Americans do go overseas or abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s counterproductive to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Walking along the quiet streets of downtown Mount Clemens, Dwayne Johnson, a construction worker who lives in the city of Dearborn, said he believes re-negotiating new trade deals is a \u201cgreat idea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on whether we\u2019re making money or how good the trade [agreement] is for the United States,\u201d said the 57-year-old. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, they\u2019re taking all the jobs from over here and they\u2019re putting them in other countries,\u201d he added. \u201cIt don\u2019t seem like we\u2019re making money off it.\u201d </p> <p>Though Johnson said he supports Clinton over Trump \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t see myself voting for him\u201d \u2013 he said the Republican nominee\u2019s relentless anti-trade rhetoric, elevating it to a major issue in the race, is the \u201conly thing I see in him that makes any sense\u201d. \u201cIf he [does] lose the election, he did offer something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lawrence, the chief administrative officer at AlphaUSA, agreed there was some truth to the feeling that trade deals had contributed to the decline in the quality of life in the US, particularly for the middle class.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of these workers have seen jobs leave this country and go to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve certainly seen that in the automotive marketplace.\u201d</p> <p>But trade has its advantages, Lawrence said, and no deal should be viewed as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d alone.</p> <p>\u201cTrade agreements happen not just so we can find the lowest cost to produce our products,\u201d he said, noting that deals also create customers for American companies and open access to foreign resources.</p> <p>To Lawrence, deals are made in the details: \u201cIt\u2019s how we write them \u2013 and how do we come to the table with those other countries, take a leadership position, and make something that works for everyone. And that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians back in Washington, the trick will be to convince voters that deals can be in their interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged,\u201d Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \u201cOne of the mistakes is that corporate American has just said: \u2018If it\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for America,\u2019 and the approach needs to be more sophisticated than that. They need to show how it will help workers, too.\u201d</p>",

Bannon has no experience running a campaign, but a number of employees who left Breitbart under his stewardship had warnings for campaign staff: expect expletive-laced phone calls at all hours of the night.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be screaming matches between Steve and every other person in the office,\u201d said Ben Shapiro, a former editor at Breitbart News. </p> <p>\u201cBut there will be no screaming matches between Steve and Trump. Steve knows where his bread is buttered.\u201d</p> <p>A steady stream of emails leaked in the days following Trump\u2019s hiring of Bannon paint a picture of a shrewd businessman with a scorched-earth approach to the Republican establishment. Former Breitbart staffers interviewed by the Guardian recall a man driven less by an ideological crusade than the desire to emerge on top \u2013 not unlike the candidate who now employs him.</p> <p>To some, the Trump-Bannon partnership simply marks the consummation of a long, happy rapport. During his tenure as the executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon spent the greater part of the last year promoting Trump\u2019s candidacy: where others fled or scolded Trump\u2019s declaration that Mexican immigrants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">\u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d</a>, Breitbart News echoed the call.</p> <p>Bannon was a presence in the newsroom, often hopping on daily editorial calls and making his views clear. Staff present for the discussions, including Shapiro and Kurt Bardella, who previously served as a media consultant to Breitbart, said Bannon aggressively pushed stories against immigrants, and supported linking minorities to terrorism and crime. </p> <p>It was catnip for the site\u2019s growing audience of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d, a far-right group that merges race and nationalism and has largely embraced Trump. For all his antagonism toward the media, the Republican nominee has publicly lavished praise on Breitbart, even though his former campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/14/breitbart-writers-resign-trump-manager-assault-reporter-michelle-fields\">charged with battery</a> against one of the website\u2019s reporters, Michelle Fields, when she tried to ask Trump a question.</p> <p>Bannon, rather than defend Fields, used Breitbart as a vehicle to discredit her story and her character. Fields resigned, as did Shapiro and Bardella.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really a crystallization of how his pursuit of a relationship with Trump superseded the welfare of his reporters,\u201d Bardella said. \u201cIt was that moment of clarity where they\u2019re so in for Trump that they\u2019re willing to throw one of their own overboard even when that person is the victim of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro soon rebranded Breitbart as \u201cTrump Pravda\u201d, and said that many staffers were increasingly concerned about their future. The site was spinning away from its crusade to hold liberal media and establishment Republicans to account, they felt. They worried about instead turning into shills for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>It was not just the obvious support for Trump that troubled employees, but also the clear objective of Bannon to diminish the former reality TV star\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. The website ran overwhelmingly unfavorable coverage of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, both established Florida politicians, especially with articles about the bilingual candidates\u2019 support for immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole mindset in general was: \u2018We need to go after Rubio, we need to go after Bush,\u2019\u201d said Bardella.</p> <p>The focus on Rubio was particularly relentless, as the Florida senator emerged as one of the final candidates in the race. Stories ran near daily with headlines asserting that, if Rubio were elected president, immigrants and terrorists would stream across the US border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acac04ea7fb13264e590a102eda46c8812e3035f/0_0_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio: a friend to immigrants and terrorists, according to Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe hates Marco,\u201d said one former employee, who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cThere was definitely a decision to promote the work of writers with an extreme anti-Rubio bent.\u201d</p> <p>Similar treatment has been directed toward House speaker Paul Ryan in recent months, with Bannon working behind the scenes to push his long-shot primary challenger, Paul Nehlen. One story criticized Ryan for having a fence around his home in Wisconsin, with the implication that the speaker was willing to wall off his own house but not the US border. </p> <p>Bannon was \u201cabsolutely fuelling the energy\u201d behind Nehlen, a former staffer said. </p> <p>Spokespeople for Ryan and Rubio declined to comment.</p> <p>Even Ted Cruz, an ultraconservative senator once covered favorably by Breitbart, was not spared the site\u2019s acidic treatment of Trump\u2019s opponents. A report published by the Hill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/292028-how-breitbart-turned-on-ted-cruz\">detailed</a> how Bannon slowly turned against the Texas senator. In particular, Breitbart seized on Trump\u2019s attacks on Cruz\u2019s citizenship \u2013 the senator was born to an American mother in Canada \u2013 much in the way it spread false \u201cbirther\u201d ideas against Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was a remarkable turnaround, given that just under a year prior, Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle had been invited to observe Cruz\u2019s bedtime ritual with his children \u2013 and subsequently produced <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/23/exclusive-photos-potential-first-family-gets-ready-for-bed-before-sen-cruzs-presidential-campaign-announcement/\">a report</a> portraying the senator in a glowing light.</p> <p>Although they criticized his methods, those who worked under Bannon acknowledged a tireless devotion to creating an empire too influential to ignore, and his success so far.</p> <p>Given its popularity among grassroots conservatives and Bannon\u2019s \u201ctake-no prisoners\u201d approach, few Republican candidates or lawmakers are brazen enough to pick a fight with the website.</p> <p>Both Rubio and Bush continued to engage with Breitbart during the Republican primary, for example, even as they were targeted by much of its coverage. </p> <p>At the height of the primary, a visibly frustrated Rubio mocked Breitbart\u2019s credibility on Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/20/rubio-slams-breitbart-after-publishing-scathing-remarks-by-immigration-union-president-theyre-basically-conspiracy-theories/\">accusing them</a> of publishing \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d. He has nonetheless continued to provide at least some of their reporters with interviews dubbed exclusives.</p> <p>Bannon \u201chas taken where the Breitbart brand essentially was before the election \u2013 considered by many as outliers \u2013 and made it a sheer force of will\u201d, Bardella said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to advance an agenda.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s the right-hand person to a would-be president.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bannon has only had a few days in charge of Trump\u2019s campaign, his former employees said he would stand in stark contrast to former chairman Paul Manafort, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign\">who resigned on Friday</a>. While Manafort tried to steer Trump toward a more moderate general election strategy, little will be off limits for Bannon, they said.</p> <p>His motto, as Shapiro put it, will be simple: \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Per tradition, the men\u2019s marathon will help close out this year\u2019s Olympic Games.

But, ahead of Sunday\u2019s race, we\u2019ve excerpted some key passages from the interview below. </p> <p>The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p><strong>The Guardian: Let\u2019s start with this year\u2019s games. What are you and Meb [Keflezighi] looking forward to about Rio? What is Meb hoping to accomplish?</strong></p> <p>Bob Larsen: No American has ever made the Olympic marathon team at age 40, which Meb did in the trials. He\u2019s now 41. We have to be realistic that he can\u2019t do some of the things in a marathon that he could when he was younger. But his endurance is still quite high and he\u2019ll be ready to handle the heat, which he does quite well.<br></p> <p>At his age, he\u2019s had the experience, so the race won\u2019t overwhelm him. And he has a good backup crew \u2013 myself and others \u2013 that are there for him. We\u2019ll have him ready to do his best. In the race itself, he has to make good decisions, as he normally does, based on the weather, based on the surging that other guys do.<br></p> <p>Obviously you\u2019d love to see Meb in position to have another shot at a medal. Whether he can do that again? I would hope so. I know he\u2019s got the willpower, I know he\u2019s as tough as anybody, and we\u2019ll find out on the 21st of August.</p> <p><strong>What are some of the main challenges facing marathon runners in Rio? You mentioned weather \u2026</strong></p> <p>The challenge will be the really warm weather and fairly high humidity. It is their winter, but if it follows the normal pattern for weather for Rio that day, traditionally, on August 21 it\u2019ll be in the high 70s Fahrenheit, humidity in the 75-85% range.</p> <p>That\u2019s warm for a marathon. You have to be a little bit more cautious as to how difficult the pace is going to be, knowing that it\u2019s going to be a warm day. Ideally, you\u2019d want it a little bit under 50F. When it\u2019s cooler, you use less energy, but that won\u2019t be the case, certainly, in Rio.</p> <p>Otherwise, this marathon in Rio is relatively flat. There\u2019s a little bit of an incline in one area but essentially it\u2019s a pretty level, straightforward run. You do a 10,000m loop three times and then you run back to the start/finish line. [Editor\u2019s note: Check it out on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/rio-running-app-marathon-course-riorun\">RioRun</a>.]</p> <p><strong>And Meb\u2019s prepared for the heat?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019ve been through this many times, including in Athens in 2004, which was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102432.html\">extreme heat</a>, and Meb handled it as well or better than anyone else. So that\u2019ll give him some advantages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f91f0569150629ad5fa21caeec08fd52ca6941b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f91f0569150629ad5fa21caeec08fd52ca6941b2/0_0_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RioRun on a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian\u2019s RioRun interactive podcast let\u2019s you learn about Rio de Janeiro as you trace the Olympic marathon route from wherever you are. Go to <strong>riorun.theguardian.com</strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Diehm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the strategy for running a good race at this level of competition?</strong></p> <p>With elite runners I\u2019ve always recommended that at the beginning of the race they almost feel like they\u2019re just going on an easy, long road run with their buddies on the weekend. Not to psych up but psych down, for hopefully the first 20 miles, so that they\u2019re not using extra energy on what\u2019s going on but just relax.</p> <p>Now obviously, if a competitor goes out really hard at the beginning or they surge \u2013 and more and more we see this in elite races \u2013 then you\u2019ve got to respond and figure out whether you\u2019re gonna go with him or stay back. Those decisions are crucial too.</p> <p>The most important part of the race will be that last 10,000m (6.2miles). So you don\u2019t want to use up too much energy on your way to 20 miles. Once you get to 20, then you have to make even quicker decisions as to what you\u2019re going to do with surging or to cover surges or whether you want to push the pace yourself, especially if you don\u2019t think you have the speed to get in front of people or to beat them at the end of the race. So there\u2019s a lot that goes into this. Tactics are very important.</p> <p>If you make a major mistake and go too hard too early and overheat the body then you\u2019re pretty much cooked. You\u2019re maybe not going to be able to do much or be there at the end of the race.</p> <p>What you\u2019re trying to do is put yourself in position with 10,000m to go, if you feel you have a chance at the medal, to give yourself the best opportunity to get one of those three medals.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the difference between how a casual runner would approach a marathon versus an elite runner, like Meb?</strong></p> <p>A recreational runner is not so concerned with placement so he can be more aware of exactly what would work well for him to run his fastest race.</p> <p>One of the best ways of doing that is to start out the first five miles a little slower than what you think you can average all the way through the race. Because for your first five miles you tend to get a little excited, and go too fast, and also you\u2019re not as efficient as you are after you get a little bit more warmed up. So those first five miles, it\u2019s very critical that you hold back.</p> <p>Then in the middle, you\u2019re trying to run a little bit faster than what your average pace overall will be for the duration of the race.</p> <p>And then last five miles, or the last 10,000m, you\u2019re hopeful that you can run duplicating the first part of the race. And that\u2019s an efficient way to run it when you\u2019re not racing against other people. </p> <p>With elite athletes you don\u2019t have those choices. Because if you\u2019re going to stay with people, the race could suddenly change at any point and you\u2019ve got to be ready. So there isn\u2019t one set pattern that an athlete is going to have going into the race. He has to make decisions as he runs.<br></p> <p>Ideally you go out a little bit slow, like the recreational runner would do, run fast in the middle, and hope for the best the last few miles. Or certainly, in the Olympic games, you\u2019d love to get a medal, and the top athletes are all trying to do that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the runner\u2019s mental state during such a demanding race? I imagine elite athletes can\u2019t afford to daydream.</strong></p> <p>An elite runner is constantly monitoring what he\u2019s doing: what the splits are; is he doing the right pace; what other people are doing around him; and concentrating on perfecting the stride and upper body mechanics so he\u2019s as efficient as he possibly can be.</p> <p>The recreational runner can afford to think about a lot of different things \u2013 and that might be an advantage because you\u2019re out there for so long in a marathon that you really don\u2019t have to think about the mechanics. Just stay relaxed, make sure you\u2019re staying within the pace you should be on. Other than that, just enjoy running out there with your friends, and even chatting and stuff like that. I think that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the difference between that casual level of runner and that elite runner: the elite runner is almost like monitoring a race car, where you\u2019re constantly paying attention to what\u2019s going on and you\u2019re very alert and trying to stay on top of things.</p> <p><strong>What sets Meb apart?</strong></p> <p>One of Meb\u2019s assets is that he still thinks clearly at the end of a race. Your oxygen is going to your legs and your heart to keep the body moving forward, so people get to a point where they don\u2019t want to think or they\u2019re not making real good decisions many times.</p> <p>Meb, even late in the race when he\u2019s being pressured, he still makes good decisions. That really separates him from a lot of runners. He can push himself to keep going hard even when there\u2019s a lot of pain and discomfort at that point in the race. And he is monitoring other people and looking for signs that their technique is faltering or they are breathing harder. He\u2019s just looking for weaknesses in other people in that last 10,000m.</p> <p>When he won the Boston Marathon the year after the bombing, he was out by himself in front \u2026 and the two Kenyans are coming at him very fast and they get within five seconds late in the race, in the last couple of miles, and Meb is going in his mind through everything that he has to do right. That his stride mechanics has to be exact, that\u2019s he\u2019s got to be very careful how he\u2019s placing his foot, his knee coming up and coming off of his heel really quickly \u2013 those types of things that he works on all the time. He does drills almost every day, so that really paid off for him. </p> <p>He\u2019s still got to stay relaxed, and he\u2019s reminding himself of all those things. And then the two Kenyans who are closing on him, who had to run really fast for the previous 10,000m to catch him, now they\u2019re getting a little bit sloppy, their bodies are twisting, they\u2019re not using their arms as efficiently, their knees are no longer coming up as well.</p> <p>And in some ways that was the difference, with Meb executing his technique throughout the race and especially in those last few miles. In a very close race, he was able to hold them off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun promo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun promo</a> </figure>",

The show itself started out as a YouTube series and when it was picked up by BBC3, its pilot episode became the online portal\u2019s most-shared video in the month of its release. Since then their fanbase has soared, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/18/people-just-do-nothing-get-in-the-party-spirit-with-kurupt-fm\">absurdity of Kurupt\u2019s antics</a>, from soundproofing the station by raiding wheelie bins for old egg boxes to funding their operating costs by DJing S Club 7 at a naff wedding. It\u2019s a homage to an anachronistic medium that teams nostalgia with belly laughs.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t just urban music aficionados who have taken the show to their heart. People Just Do Nothing crossed over into a mainstream fanbase to the extent that when Tate Britain wanted to put on an evening dedicated to exploring \u201cthe cult of celebrity\u201d, they felt the best way to do so was to allow Kurupt FM an hour-long set of decade-old beats and comedy garage lyrics. So popular has it proven that, when it was recommissioned last October, the BBC took the rare step of giving them a further two new series, for both BBC3 and BBC2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b889c8c4c33334a3bc0b0c5556bc4a3a251ed6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b889c8c4c33334a3bc0b0c5556bc4a3a251ed6/0_136_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurupt FM perform in Ibiza.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hands up...

  "<p></p> <p> </p> <p>Dr Jill Stein called for a national state of emergency to be declared over the rapidly worsening effects of global warming, during a campaign swing through New York. </p> <p>Promoting her party\u2019s Green New Deal \u2013 an agenda designed to address the interconnected problems of climate change and the economy \u2013 Stein said the still uncontained Blue Cut fire in California and the record flooding in Louisiana were ample evidence of the worsening effects of climate change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe need to acknowledge the true state of emergency we are in,\u201d Stein said. \u201cThe fires in California and floods in Louisiana are going to become day-by-day occurrences, and, within our lifetimes, there is going to be potentially catastrophic sea-level rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to ensure that these disasters do not become a daily way of life for all Americans and people all over the world,\u201d she said, \u201cand this is why we need to declare a climate state of emergency so that we can respond in real time in the ways that we need to.\u201d</p> <p>In poll after poll, Stein added, the American people say they want substantial action on climate change that meets the severity of the crisis. She called for empowering Americans to instruct their elected officials \u2013 namely Congress \u2013 to act in their interests, not in the interests of lobbyists. </p> <p>Stein remarked that she was astonished to be witnessing a Republican party that appeared to be \u201cunravelling at the seams\u201d. But she also warned that Democrats were moving to the right.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice to appoint former Colorado senator and interior secretary Ken Salazar to be her transition director \u201crepresents the real Hillary Clinton\u201d, Stein said.</p> <p>Salazar, she said, is widely considered a reliable friend to the oil, gas, ranching and mining industries. As interior secretary, he opened the Arctic Ocean for oil drilling, and oversaw the response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Since returning to the private sector, she said, Salazar had become \u201cthe lobbyist\u2019s lobbyist \u2013 a man who strongly supports fracking, is in favor of the [Keystone XL] pipeline and likely to ensure such projects are approved in the future, and supports the Trans-Pacific partnership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo when people say: \u2018Hasn\u2019t the Democratic party moved to the left?\u2019 \u2013 well, talk is cheap. His appointment unveils the real Hillary Clinton who would take office. We\u2019re seeing how much faith people should put into the new vision of the Democratic party. It\u2019s a case of buyer beware. \u201d</p> <p>The Green party nominee, currently polling as high as 6% but well below the 15% threshold required for a podium position in the coming presidential TV debates, said declaring a state of emergency would address two related crises in the climate and the economy. </p> <p>Part of the solution would be the Green New Deal, a plan that would rapidly create 20m new jobs, lead to a sustainable economy and transition the US to 100% clean energy by 2030.</p> <p>The New Deal, Stein said, would help revive the economy, turn the tide on climate change and make wars for oil obsolete. \u201cWhen you have 100% renewable energy, you do not need and you cannot justify a military budget that distributes soldiers and weapons all around the world.\u201d</p> <p>The plan includes \u201crestoring critical infrastructure, including the ecosystem, cleaning up rivers and waterways, restoring our wetlands and forests and ensuring that we have water systems for our communities that are not toxic\u201d.</p> <p>Part of the program, she added, would be to call for a complete ban on new fossil fuel and nuclear infrastructure. Communities dependent on coal or fracking would be assured that jobs would be replaced before they were laid off. </p> <p>Stein estimates the costs of the transition would be completely offset by the money saved by not using fossil fuels. The savings, she suggested, would include billions of dollars related to healthcare costs from asthma, emphysema, heart attacks, strokes and cancers related to exposure to fossil fuels. </p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">The party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, Ajamu Baraka, also appeared at the event. A longtime human rights activist, he told the gathering that participatory job creation and planning was paramount in the development of a Green New Deal economy. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the people are direct participants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principle that this party and this campaign stands for.\u201d</span></p> <p>But getting the Greens\u2019 message out remains problematic. The party\u2019s message on climate has been repeatedly overshadowed by Stein\u2019s controversial comments on the government\u2019s regulatory oversight of vaccines, drawing accusations that she has associated herself with the discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/30/jill-stein-green-party-vaccinations-anti-vaxxers\">\u201canti-vaxxer\u201d movement. </a></p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, has both cited the proven importance of vaccines, noting that they save lives and have eliminated devastating diseases, and suggested that Americans cannot trust the people who recommend widespread vaccination. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/jill-stein-anti-vaccination-green-party-ridiculous\">Jill Stein dismisses perception she is anti-vaccines as 'ridiculous'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Responding to criticisms last month, she said her concerns were about the influence of corporations on government, but they also seemed to echo the concerns of anti-vaccination campaigners that compromised or influenced regulators could open the door for dangerous medicine. </p> <p>\u201cAs a medical doctor, of course I support vaccinations,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI have a problem with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] being controlled by drug companies.\u201d <br></p> <p>But on the campaign trail, Stein largely limited her remarks to concerns over climate change. She proposed introducing a carbon tax of $60 a ton that would yield around $360bn annually and increasing the estate tax to its level during the Reagan administration. Her proposals, she argued, were now a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cEach month now, we\u2019re seeing records set for climate change and global warming. Science is telling us that the day of reckoning is coming closer. This is not something that can wait another four years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in an existential moment where we have to decide if we want a future or not,\u201d she said. </p> <p></p>",

Sliced translucently thin, it dissolved on the palate, deep in salt, fat and flavour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95592d97d1a9bd718ee0d6875f5829b87b805c32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95592d97d1a9bd718ee0d6875f5829b87b805c32/0_82_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"spain-andalucia-aracena-hills-bathing-pigs-at-jamones-eiriz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigs bathing in the Sierra de Aracena</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pura Aventura</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lots of parts of Spain would claim that their hams are the best. Fewer could claim that for their tuna. Bluefin tuna was until recently a byword for overfishing, and animal rights protestors would sit crossly outside Nobu. But the catching of fish below a certain size has now been banned. As a result the <em>rojo</em> tuna, as it\u2019s called here, is back in business. Down on the south coast in places such as Barbate, south of Cadiz, it has been caught in the same way for thousands of years, using a a system called the <em>almadraba</em>. In May and June the fish swim into a series of nets in the bay before being hauled in as part of a great communal effort. Their flesh is then processed in factories like Herpac, where commercial director Jose Vazquez Varo showed me aground. Again, a trip round a tuna processing plant might not be on everyone\u2019s dream holiday list, but I found it fascinating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f9c302092396b2ce1504389d6f37e09ce8a8aeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f9c302092396b2ce1504389d6f37e09ce8a8aeb/0_13_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuna ed cumming\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuna await processing at the Herpac plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Cumming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cutting of the tuna is called the <em>ronqueo</em>, from the Spanish word for \u201csnore\u201d, on account of the sound the knife makes on bone. The fish is filleted for its various parts, and a proportion is salted, cured or canned \u2013 contrary to perception, high-end canned tuna is twice as expensive as the fresh variety. Mojama, air-dried tuna a little like fishy ham, is a prized tapas dish. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd79165a15e4759e8307e7927efcad7b45e83f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd79165a15e4759e8307e7927efcad7b45e83f4/0_412_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foodie trip to Andalucia, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>At\u00fan lomo picante</em> (spicy tuna) at El Campero restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Cumming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a nearby restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.restauranteelcampero.es/en/\">El Campero</a>, we ate a seven-course tasting menu of different parts of the fish, from cheek to heart.

Though his sisters dream of resettlement elsewhere, he is content. \u201cUganda is one of the best places to stay for refugees,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By 2015, Uganda had become the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, after Ethiopia and Kenya, with more than half a million refugees. That number is rising rapidly. Alongside ongoing crises in Burundi and DRC, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/57988f594.html\">violence in South Sudan</a> has driven more refugees to Uganda during three weeks in July than in the first six months of 2016. The <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/drc-steps-emergency-response-south-sudanese-refugees-uganda\">Danish Refugee Council warned last month</a> the situation in northern Uganda could become \u201ccatastrophic\u201d if they don\u2019t receive more support for assisting the influx of refugees from South Sudan. </p> <p>But these recent arrivals are among the lucky ones: Uganda is <a href=\"http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/5129\">one of the most favourable environments in the world</a> for refugees, according to the UNHCR.

Today, he owns a shop and three motorcycle taxis, and employs workers on his land.</p> <p>Refugees in Uganda\u2019s rural settlements are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home \u2013 so that investment in infrastructure benefits locals too; they also receive food aid and access to primary schools and health services. </p> <p>However, some other nationals in Uganda feel restricted by their refugee status. Although the authorities say people are free to come and go, Michael*, a Congolese artist who arrived in Nakivale settlement in 2010, says: \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t agree with you they can just stop you [from doing what you want].\u201d </p> <p>Sometimes the problem is unclear communication. Hakiza remembers brandishing a copy of the Refugee Act when he first went to register his organisation with the local authorities; they had had told him he wasn\u2019t allowed.</p> <p>Mimy Abeja, a Congolese single mother of 10, says Nakivale is \u201cnot a place to raise children\u201d. She is relieved not to be paying rent, but struggles to keep her tailoring business afloat, adding that all of the family have been in and out of hospital since they arrived. </p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/publications/humanitarian-assistance-and-politics-of-self-reliance-ugandas-nakivale-refugee-settleme\"> study from the Centre for International Governance Innovation</a> in 2015 found that, rather than being genuinely self-sufficient, most in Nakivale were \u201cengaged in daily survival tactics\u201d. Countrywide, <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/blog/?p=879\">most refugees live at subsistence level</a>, says David Kigozi, a senior programme officer at the Kampala-based <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/\">International Refugee Rights Initiative</a>, pointing out that over 70% depend on the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/uganda\">World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we wake up fighting because of our stomachs,\u201d says 29-year-old Alex Bucunga, a filmmaker who arrived from DRC nine years ago, explaining that food rations are reduced significantly for those here longer than five years. Casual work helps fill the gaps: Bucunga has taught English, while others dig farmland, make bricks or work as translators. That\u2019s rarely sufficient to start or grow a business \u2014 but <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/partners/ngodirectory/4ea918e924/nsamizi-training-institute-social-development.html\">Nsamizi</a>, a training institute and responsible for livelihoods support in Nakivale, says a revolving credit fund for refugees will be operational later this year.</p> <p>The fund will likely also be open to Ugandans: government guidelines state that around 30% of refugee assistance should help host communities. Under a new UN strategy, acknowledging the longevity of displacement, livelihoods programmes will target refugees and Ugandans together, and some basic services will be merged. Water services in Nakivale will be handed to the district authority, eventually requiring refugees to pay for water just as locals do. Similarly, the UNHCR will hand over responsibility of the only secondary school in the area to the government. And there\u2019s even a suggestion of recruiting refugees into public service jobs, currently only open to Ugandans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82/0_4_4757_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Patton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, more refugees may travel to Uganda, especially if neighbouring Kenya keeps its <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/global-development/2016/may/25/kenya-william-ruto-tells-uk-to-resettle-somali-refugees-living-in-dadaab\">promise to close its camps</a>.

But, while the size of plots given to refugees has already been halved, the government has not indicated that it will limit its open door policy, and a newly-opened settlement area with room for up to 100,000 people is already welcoming refugees. \u201cWhere else in the region would they go?\u201d asks Douglas Asiimwe, assistant commissioner for refugees. Many citizens \u2014 some of whom have been refugees themselves \u2014 share this view, providing some of the land allocated to newcomers.</p> <p>Even if the welcome continues, rising numbers of newcomers, severe funding shortages and further integration of assistance within national structures may encourage more realistic expectations among refugees. Jimmy Maguru, a project manager at Nsamizi, says Nakivale residents are taking more responsibility for their future than ever before \u2014 partly thanks to livelihoods projects, but also because \u201cpeople are hearing that plot sizes are likely to get smaller\u201d.</p> <p>Expectations of resettlement, though, may need to be addressed. Many hope for a future in North America or Europe \u2014 yet the UNHCR\u2019s resettlement target for Nakivale, home to more than 110,000 refugees, is only around 700 this year. </p> <p>\u201cPeople think the only one solution is resettlement [and that you\u2019re a] failure if you don\u2019t to go\u201d says Michael, who is planning new community projects in Nakivale. \u201cI want them to know they can start their life here.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Names have been changed</em></p> <p><em>The reporter\u2019s travel costs were covered by a <a href=\"http://www.oneworldmedia.org.uk/\">One World Media</a> grant</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Sheikha Naeema lifts her glass to take a sip of water, but the large grey telephone on her desk blinks again, red and insistent. It is only 9am and she has already spoken to 11 callers. The woman on the other end of the line is in distress.</p> <p>\u201cPeace be upon you, blessings be upon you,\u201d Sheikha Naeema says in a soothing tone. The woman tells her she has given birth twice and that both babies were stillborn. Now she is pregnant again. Her doctor has said the foetus is showing signs of severe complications and will probably die. The woman wants to know if Islam will permit her to have an abortion. After clarifying a few other details, Sheikha Naeema issues a fatwa. \u201cIf the foetus is severely ill and will not survive, you may have an abortion,\u201d she tells the woman. \u201cYou must take advice from your physician, he will guide you. Religion does not conflict with medicine.\u201d</p> <p>She explains that abortion is allowed under certain circumstances: within 120 days, or 17 weeks after conception if doctors believe the baby has life-threatening defects. The fatwa \u2013 a non-binding religious ruling \u2013 is justified on the basis of a hadith, a saying attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, which states that at 120 days a baby is given a soul, or spirit. When Sheikha Naeema finishes the call, she swivels in the office chair and makes a note. \u201cNormally it\u2019s quiet on Thursday mornings,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We are in the small, cramped office of <a href=\"http://www.awqaf.ae/Affair.aspx?Lang=EN&amp;SectionID=14&amp;RefID=868\">the fatwa hotline</a> on the eighth floor of the <a href=\"https://www.awqaf.gov.ae/?Lang=EN\">General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments</a> in Abu Dhabi, better known by its Arabic acronym, the Awqaf. Abu Dhabi\u2019s dial-a-fatwa hotline is run from a nondescript government building next to a supermarket along a busy stretch of road that leads to the pale turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. Beyond the metal detector, polite receptionists direct visitors. A Bangladeshi employee in a pinstriped waistcoat pours coffee from a slender pot for visitors waiting in the lobby. A painting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/03/guardianobituaries.israel\">Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan</a>, the late president and founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/united-arab-emirates\">United Arab Emirates (UAE)</a>, hangs from a wall on the first-floor landing. He is kneeling in prayer and wearing oversized, aviator-style sunglasses. Awqaf hums with quiet bureaucracy and the whir of air conditioning as religious scholars in long white robes and keffiyehs wander in and out of glass-walled offices carrying papers and heavy books. A trace of rose incense mingles with the cold air.</p> <p>In the hotline\u2019s office, the air conditioning is cranked to sub-Arctic iciness. The room is small, the desks crammed together; soon, the scholars will move to a larger, purpose-built office a few kilometres away. For eight hours a day, five days a week, Sheikha Naeema and two female colleagues field queries from women, and sometimes men, from all sorts of backgrounds: rich and poor, young and old, devout and doubtful. They help them navigate elaborate moral and ethical rules and restrictions governing all areas of an observant Muslim\u2019s life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On the internet, not everything is correct... we teach people about the real Islam</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The iftaa, as the fatwa centre is called in Arabic, is the only one in the Middle East where a team of highly qualified women has been hired by the state to issue religious rulings. The women work across the hall from their male counterparts, 47 muftis who do the same job. The large white sign in the hall outside their office states the Awqaf\u2019s mission as \u201cpromoting social awareness and progress according to the tolerant teachings of Islam that recognise the current realities and understand the future challenges\u201d. The key word is \u201ctolerant\u201d.</p> <p>On this particular morning the queries range from, \u201cAre men and women allowed to work together in an office?\u201d (yes) to \u201cCan I fast during Ramadan if I have my period?\u201d (no). The sheikha\u2019s tone is matter of fact and professional. The next caller asks, \u201cIf I have noises coming from my vagina during prayer, does it nullify the prayer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is not flatulence, so no, your prayer is fine,\u201d Sheikha Naeema tells the caller delicately. \u201cThis problem is common to many women who have given birth.\u201d</p> <p>When she hangs up the phone, she tightens the black shayla scarf around her head, framing her direct gaze and wry expression. Her colleague, Sheikha Radia, hands her a cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no strange questions any more, we have heard everything,\u201d she says. The women smile and shrug.</p> <p>A highly respected legal scholar from Morocco, Sheikha Naeema, who is in her early 40s, has been working at the fatwa centre for eight years. On my first visit, her fingernails are dyed orange with henna and she wears the long black abaya gown commonly worn by women in the Gulf states.</p> <p>The women at the fatwa hotline are attempting to redress a gender imbalance in the religious sphere. Religious life in UAE, as in the rest of the Middle East, is dominated by men. Male imams preach sermons. Religious space is also a male domain: when the call to prayer sounds five times a day (sung by a man), it is men who hurry to the mosque. Women are encouraged to pray at home. And, inevitably, female scholars are rare.</p> <p>\u201cWe know it is unusual to hear a woman referred to as a muftiya, or sheikha, because this job is usually for men, but it is important women have someone they can turn to for help,\u201d Sheikha Radia says. \u201cWhen we communicate with another woman, we understand how she thinks.\u201d</p> <p>Sheikha Radia and Sheikha Naeema struggle to keep up with the volume of queries: up to 200 calls, text messages and emails every day, nearly always from women. The hotline has been such a success that six young Emirati women were sent to Morocco\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/\">Mohammed V University</a> at Agdal on state-funded scholarships to become muftiyas. English-speaking muftiyas are also being recruited, but that is proving tricky. \u201cIf you know someone who may be qualified, please let us know,\u201d Sheikha Naeema says.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to teach people about the real Islam,\u201d says Mariam al Zaidi, 26, one of the graduates, adding that the state takes religious education for women seriously. \u201cWe all had full scholarships, we didn\u2019t pay for anything. We had a car to take us to classes if we needed it, and accommodations were built. We were also given spending money.\u201d</p> <p>She says the government is simply reviving an ancient tradition. \u201cAll the women in the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s life were teaching people, not just women but men, too, and explaining the faith.\u201d</p> <p>The hotline addresses the intimate preoccupations of Muslim women, unmediated by male professionals or clerics, and emboldened by the promise of anonymity. But the female scholars\u2019 work is also part of a long-term government strategy to bring moderate, female scholarship to Islamic discourse at a time when religious fanaticism and sectarianism is on the rise across the Middle East. Jihadist groups such as Islamic State and the Taliban view the removal of women from public life as a critical component of a state ruled by their interpretation of sharia law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ed1e2ad09c67e1cd653258b75003447cbd36afa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ed1e2ad09c67e1cd653258b75003447cbd36afa/5_137_5147_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mariam Al Zaidi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mariam al Zaidi, one of the first Emirati women to train as part of a UAE state-funded programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parisa Azadi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/looking-at-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses\">The Satanic Verses</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\">Salman Rushdie</a> was burned across the Muslim world in 1989 and its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-translator.html\">Japanese translator murdered</a> in Tokyo, the term \u201cfatwa\u201d became associated in some parts of the west with summary death sentences. In fact, a fatwa is a legal opinion that helps an observant Muslim lead an ethical life; there is no obligation to follow it.</p> <p>Abu Dhabi\u2019s fatwa centre is not part of the country\u2019s legal system, which is based on principles of the moderate Maliki school of Sunni jurisprudence with elements of various European legal codes. There are sharia courts and civil courts that run in parallel and cover different parts of the law. In some cases a mufti or muftiya might be consulted, but only a judge can make a legally binding ruling. Islam grades all human behaviour into five categories: obligatory, prohibited, recommended, discouraged or neutral. The women scholars advise the faithful on where their actions fall on this spectrum. A fatwa is not legally enforceable, and if you don\u2019t like the ruling of one mufti, you can go somewhere else for a different judgment.</p> <p>A fatwa is not merely an opinion, however. It must be based on the verses of the Qur\u2019an or the hadith, or the opinions of previous generations of Muslim scholars across 1,400 years of history, or, in the rare cases when those sources do not provide an answer, well-argued logic, to come up with a completely new ruling. These complexities tend to be missing from many self-styled Islamic experts, whose opinions are just a quick Google search away. You can find fatwas giving permission to behead captives or, in the case of Isis, take women as sex slaves. This free-for-all is why the Emiratis have taken steps to direct people towards approved scholars.</p> <p>\u201cOn the internet, not everything is correct,\u201d Zaidi says. \u201cYou ask a simple question and get many opinions. I believe it is better to go to a specialist if you have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost questions from Muslims will have to do with their relationship with the divine and their ability to fulfil that for which they will be rewarded not in this world but in the world to come,\u201d says <a href=\"http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/faculty/justin-stearns.html\">Justin Stearns</a>, an American associate professor and head of the Arab Crossroads Studies programme at New York University Abu Dhabi. I meet Stearns in a cafe in the sprawling pale stone campus surrounded by miles of sand on <a href=\"http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/explore/islands/saadiyat.island.aspx\">Saadiyat Island</a> on the north side of Abu Dhabi. He has a short, greying beard and peppers his speech with fluent Arabic as he types on a silver MacBook. \u201cIn the marketplace of religious opinion, if you are just an average Muslim out there, you\u2019d look to someone who can separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to religious authority,\u201d he says. \u201cHere you have the state doing that.\u201d</p> <p>The Awqaf is effectively the final authority on all matters related to Islam; every religious text is scrutinised for radicalism, every imam vetted. Many countries have an official mufti or fatwa centre but none has stated in clear terms that no one else in the country is allowed to issue these rulings. A committee of religious scholars decides the content of the Friday sermons to be preached in every mosque by the imams who are all on the state payroll and forbidden to deviate from the official topic which adheres to moderate values: respect for religious minorities including Christians and for women. One sermon I attend is about a daughter\u2019s right to choose her own husband, although sometimes the topics concern more mundane matters such as obeying traffic laws.</p> <p>Such a degree of control over matters of faith is highly unusual in the Muslim world. \u201cWhat we found over the last 30 years was that there were a number of non-local imams with longstanding political grievances against their own countries who were giving sermons,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.alhabibali.com/en/biography/\">Habib Ali al-Jifri</a>, chairman and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.tabahfoundation.org/en/\">Tabah Foundation</a>, a state-funded faith organisation in Abu Dhabi. \u201cWe had the same problem with fatwas,\u201d he says, when we meet in the foundation\u2019s library. \u201cThey were contradictory, informal and people could get rulings anywhere. To bring control and balance we began streamlining the process. And bringing in the women muftis was a part of that process.\u201d</p> <p>Jifri knows first-hand how modern communications can spread hate. He has 3.5 million <a href=\"https://twitter.com/habibalienglish\">Twitter followers</a>, and he found out on Twitter that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/02/syria-debate-the-linguistic-battle-over-what-to-call-islamic-state\">Isis (or Daesh</a>, as Arabs call the extremist group) had issued a fatwa sentencing him to death. \u201cThis is the reality we live in,\u201d he says with a shrug as a member of staff appears with a tray of pomegranate juice. \u201cPlease take one, it\u2019s organic. As I was saying, Daesh and its like try to create a barrier to prevent people from engaging with scholars. If people engaged with scholars with real knowledge, like us, then they would see the illegitimacy of the likes of Daesh.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://mmgsurvey.tabahfoundation.org/\">a survey</a> carried out by the Tabah Foundation and Zogby Research Services, a Washington, DC-based polling firm, released earlier this year, 5,374 Arab Muslims aged 15-34 in eight countries were asked to what extent groups such as Isis were a perversion of Islamic teaching. Of UAE respondents, 92% said they were a \u201ccomplete\u201d perversion. Only 45% of Kuwaitis believed the same.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates lies on the south-eastern side of the Persian Gulf, wedged between the region\u2019s two powerful rivals: Iran across the narrow stretch of water to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south. Half a century ago, UAE was poor. Society was homogenous, tribal and close-knit, necessary if people were to survive a climate in which arable land and drinking water are scarce and temperatures often reach 50C. Society and values were structured around the Islamic faith and patriarchal tribal customs. Women were mostly kept out of the public eye.</p> <p>The discovery of oil in the late 1950s changed the country radically. UAE sits on <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/countries-with-biggest-crude-oil-reserves-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">the seventh largest proven oil reserves in the world</a>, and the financial surpluses of oil wealth have been channelled to transform a society once reliant on trading and fishing into a state with an economy focused around finance, real estate and tourism. The purpose is to create a society that can function when the oil and gas run out. Modernity does not necessarily mean democracy, yet the hereditary rulers encourage Emirati women to participate in public life \u2013 in February, <a href=\"http://www.uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/sheikh-khalifa-approves-the-new-12th-cabinet-of-the-united-arab-emirates\">five women were appointed to the cabinet</a>, which has an advisory role. Inevitably, perhaps, there are tensions between modern life and traditional Islamic values. Many Muslim women in Abu Dhabi, both Emirati and expatriate, privately express their anxieties. Are they betraying Islamic values by working with men outside the home, for example? Is it permissible to delay motherhood? Is it OK to eat a meal in a restaurant that serves alcohol? The Abu Dhabi muftiyas, by taking into account how women live now, try to bridge the old values and the new.</p> <p>Despite efforts to move the economy away from dependency on oil, the majority of the government\u2019s revenues come from the hydrocarbon sector. The Emirates needs foreign investment and foreign workers to build a post-oil economy. It can ill afford Islamist violence of the kind that has wrecked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/18/tunisia-beach-holidays-sousse-terrorist-attack\">Tunisia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/mediterranean-resorts-fall-in-tourism-numbers-due-to-isis-attacks\">Egypt\u2019s tourism</a>-dependent economies. The expatriate, transient population, mostly Muslims from South Asia and the Middle East, are rootless and far from home towns where the mosque and faith leaders are the bedrock of their communities. The Awqaf has 14 telephone lines and between them the muftis and muftiyas answer 1,000 queries every day, rising to 3,000 during Ramadan, from both men and women. Services are provided in English, Arabic and Urdu, reflecting the most common languages spoken in the country. The scholars issue fatwas in accordance to all four schools of Sunni Islam. The ease of access is to encourage residents to turn to a local mufti instead of a firebrand with a YouTube channel.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the ways in which the Emirati state assures its own authority is it protects Islam,\u201d Stearns says. \u201cIt advances religion, it guarantees you have a mosque in every city block and it provides easy access to religious expertise for its citizens. It sees this as a duty of the state and a service for citizens.\u201d</p> <p>The Emirates has largely escaped the upheavals of the Arab spring; the six royal families that make up the federation have maintained their grip on power. It is a relatively open society, particularly compared with other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. Emirati women can drive, go to school, work outside the home. Covering their hair is not required by law, although the vast majority of Emirati women do so.</p> <p>There have been no terrorist attacks in UAE. The one exception was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/uae-woman-executed-over-killing-of-american-teacher-in-abu-dhabi\">the strange case of Ala\u2019a al-Hashemi</a>. On 1 December 2014, Hashemi, 30, an Emirati mother of six children, stabbed to death an American teacher in the bathroom cubicle of a luxury shopping centre in Abu Dhabi. The court was told she had been radicalised online by al-Qaida literature. She was convicted and in July 2015 was executed by a firing squad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When we communicate with another woman, we understand how she thinks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mutifyas may not have political or legal power but they exert a powerful, subtle influence on society by shaping values, not only in their work at the fatwa centre but also in mosques in the capital, where they lecture and hold all-female study circles.</p> <p>One evening I attend a lecture at the Shaikh Hamdan mosque on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. The speaker, Edithal al-Shamsi, is a 57-year-old retired Emirati schoolteacher and also a hafiz \u2013 an honorific conferred on the few Muslims who have memorised the Qur\u2019an. The mosque\u2019s slender minarets are lit by green spotlights and glow against the inky black desert sky. Outside, young girls board a bus that will take them home after Qur\u2019an lessons. As in all mosques, the women\u2019s section is at the back. I walk up a narrow, green marble spiral staircase and the scent of sandalwood drifts from the prayer hall. I can hear Shamsi before I see her.</p> <p>\u201cOnly in some matters may a man look at a woman,\u201d she is saying, peering at the crowd through owlish glasses. \u201cIf they are colleagues at work, for example, or if he is in court, or if he will propose. Otherwise he must avert his eyes and be respectful. Do not leer. For women, I advise don\u2019t go out with so much makeup, short skirts and tight clothes.\u201d</p> <p>The point is subtle: women have to be modest but men, too, bear responsibility for their behaviour. The 30 women sitting in a semicircle around Shamsi on the lush carpet tut in agreement. A few are in their 20s but most are older. Some wear the burga, the green-gold face mask worn by Bedouin women.</p> <p>Afterwards the women kiss Shamsi affectionately and offer plates of samosas. She does not issue fatwas but her status of hafiz gives her licence to talk about subjects normally taboo in Arab society. She warns that men should not watch pornography because it \u201cmakes them lose brain cells\u201d and anal sex is a sin. We settle in a corner of the elegantly furnished room where verses of the Qur\u2019an are carved in gold-coloured relief along the walls. I ask if she isn\u2019t embarrassed to bring up sensitive subjects.</p> <p>\u201cThe women like it because these topics are important,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a place for women to come and discuss openly and safely.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes she chooses the topic; other times Awqaf scholars decide. At the end of the evening, her notes, giving a broad overview of it (omitting intimate details that might identify women), will be submitted to the Awqaf authorities, who are looking out not for issues of private moral choices but possible support for radical Islam. Since the Arab spring, everyone is under close scrutiny. In the lectures I attend with the women scholars, no one discusses politics. But that evening, when I finish talking to Shamsi, a tall, heavy-set Emirati woman approaches, looking agitated.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are women and children being killed in Syria? If I pray and kill, I will still go to hell. Praying will not help,\u201d she shouts, gesticulating wildly. \u201cAs a Muslim, I am not allowed to even steal a pen,\u201d she says, snatching my pen from my hand. The room falls into a hush. To break the tension, one of the women passes around Sytrofoam cups of sahlab, a milky hot drink.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7e59fcbff5d652eb2bb30634852222ada9d9b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7e59fcbff5d652eb2bb30634852222ada9d9b5/19_230_4566_2740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women at the fatwa hotline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muftiyas at the fatwa hotline answer up to 200 calls, texts and emails every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Delores Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hotline opened in 2007 and the following year a team of scholars travelled to Morocco to recruit female experts \u2013 Morocco also practises the Maliki school of Islam, and the Emirates at the time lacked qualified Emirati women. Women\u2019s access to education has been very recent \u2013 Shamsi is unusual among her generation in having a university degree. In 1980 only 2.7% of women went to college or university but today Emirati women outnumber men in post-secondary education, making up more than 70% of the student body at the public universities. Morocco, however, has had a longer track record of women in post-secondary education. Sheikha Radia and Sheikha Naeema were recent graduates when they were approached. \u201cWe were asked a lot of questions during the interviews,\u201d Sheikha Radia says. \u201cThey wanted to make sure we were knowledgable and moderate.\u201d</p> <p>Sheikha Radia earned a doctorate in Islamic sciences from Mohammed V University and specialises in jurisprudence. Her thesis was on Islam\u2019s response to Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God. She has hundreds of hadiths at her fingertips and can readily explain their meaning and historical context. Sheikha Naeema has a doctorate from <a href=\"http://www.univh2m.ac.ma/\">Hassan II University in Casablanca</a> and is a hafiz. The daughter of a furniture-maker from Casablanca, she grew up in a religious household and it came as no surprise that faith was her professional calling.</p> <p>The muftiyas may be unusual in the modern Muslim world but that wasn\u2019t the case throughout Islamic history. During the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s lifetime, about 130 women issued religious rulings. The most prominent was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/17/muhammad-aisha-truth\">Aisha</a>, his third wife. The names of approximately 10,000 women scholars, little known to history, were catalogued by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShaykhMohammadAkramNadwi/home\">Mohammad Akram Nadwi</a>, a renowned Islamic scholar and researcher who lives in Oxford. \u201cWe grow up in Muslim societies where women are basically discouraged from anything and there are mosques in the UK that don\u2019t allow women inside,\u201d Nadwi says, speaking on the phone from his home. \u201cBut in the past they were learning, teaching in mosques, and it was normal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When a woman confides that her husband is having an affair, she is advised to urge him to have two wives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The muftiyas do not fit any neat categories of liberal or conservative interpretations of the Qur\u2019an. Sometimes the fatwas issued in Abu Dhabi sit uneasily with the laws of the country. An expatriate man recently contacted the hotline. He explained that his wife had a job but was not contributing to the household expenses. He was considering cancelling his wife\u2019s residency visa, which gave her the right to work in the Emirates, and sending her home. Under the law it was legal but he wanted to know if it was a sin. Yes, it would be a sin, came the ruling. \u201cThe husband is not entitled to her salary or even a portion of it without her full consent,\u201d the fatwa stated.</p> <p>Not that the views of the women scholars would meet a western, secular definition of feminism. Sheikha Naeema explains that when women confide that their husbands are having extramarital affairs, she advises them to urge the husband to marry his mistress and take on a second wife, rather than fall into the sin of adultery.</p> <p>One morning Sheikha Radia is on duty when an Arab woman rings the hotline. Her husband is in love with another woman. She is heartbroken; what should she do?</p> <p>\u201cYou must continue your life,\u201d Sheikha Radia urges her. \u201cDon\u2019t keep your husband at the centre of your life. Do you have children?\u201d She pauses. \u201cOK, focus on your children. Think of your husband as a visitor in the home. He can come and go, eat and sleep.\u201d</p> <p>When she hangs up, Sheikha Radia sighs. \u201cIt is unfortunate that a woman has fallen in love with a married man, this woman\u2019s husband.\u201d You can\u2019t advise her to divorce, I ask. No, she says, divorce is a sin to be avoided. But what if her husband were beating her? Islam forbids domestic violence, she says. \u201cIf a woman tells me this, I try to find out if they are abusive towards each other. Can there be a reconciliation? If not I tell her she must call the police and social services.\u201d</p> <p>She admits it is easier to give this advice than heed it because many abused women, especially those with children, are financially dependent on their husbands. \u201cThe best protection is for a woman to have financial independence,\u201d she concludes.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As the Emirates continues its pursuit of a western-style, Islamic modernity, the role of women is changing. More women, whether they are Emirati or Arab and Asian expatriate residents, are sharing the financial burden with their husbands and working outside the home. They come into contact with new ideas and cultures, and some are starting to interrogate the ideas they accepted while they were growing up. A few women are even questioning the necessity of wearing the hijab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4906bc5f9cd7c4cd2abc7f20b7adb6933b1329cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4906bc5f9cd7c4cd2abc7f20b7adb6933b1329cf/135_284_4744_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheikha Radia talks to women at an all-female study circle in a mosque in Abu Dhabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheikha Radia talks to women at an all-female study circle in a mosque in Abu Dhabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parisa Azadi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sheikha Naeema is about to give a lecture at a newly refurbished mosque. The white stone building is located in a wealthy neighbourhood where villas are surrounded by high walls over which tumbles white frangipani, its luscious scent hanging in the air. Sheikha Naeema is sitting sipping the local cardamom-scented coffee as she makes notes. Most of her audience are in their 30s and 40s, a few much older. Many are Emirati, some Palestinian, Syrian and Moroccan.</p> <p>After giving an hour-long lecture explaining why it is a sin to spread rumours about other people, she is approached by a young Palestinian woman in an orange hijab.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you about the hijab? Is it mandatory?\u201d she asks hesitantly. Her question is startling. Few Muslim women in the region leave their hair uncovered, and fewer still question its necessity.</p> <p>\u201cIt is mandatory, it is in <a href=\"http://quran.com/24\">Surah an-Nur</a>,\u201d Sheikh Naeema tells her gently, referring her to a specific chapter and verse of the Qur\u2019an.</p> <p>But the young woman is not satisfied. She explains that she has worn a hijab since she was a teenager but is now reconsidering. She is 30 and unmarried, and worries that perhaps she is seen as old-fashioned. Her sister, who wears a hijab, advised her it would be a sin to remove it. Her mother also wears a hijab but is ambivalent, having grown up in the more secular 1970s when few Arab women covered their hair.</p> <p>What about the niqab, the young woman asks Sheikha Naeema, referring to the face-covering that leaves only the eyes exposed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a cultural option for some women in the Gulf countries, but you don\u2019t need to wear it,\u201d the scholar answers firmly.</p> <p>The young Palestinian thanks her politely. Afterwards, she says Sheikha Naeema\u2019s reputation in the community settled the question. \u201cShe has the knowledge, so I will listen. But I would prefer it if I didn\u2019t wear it. I like to show my hair.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Franz Schubert composed his <em>String Quartet No 14 in D minor</em> \u2013 better known as <em>Death and the Maiden</em> \u2013 in 1824, following a bout of illness that had left him weak, wretched and convinced that he was dying. In the event, he survived four years more; but in 1828, aged just 31, he died of the same illness (syphilis, most likely) that had laid him low. He was afforded what few are given: a comprehension of mortality and the ability to communicate his conclusions. Nearly two centuries later, <em>Death and the Maiden</em> stands as his act of personal reckoning: a prodigious testament to the agony of life\u2019s transience.</p> <p>It is typical of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alison-moore\">Alison Moore</a>\u2019s particular talent that she should look to such a towering work of art and, with one deft tweak, banalise it; take it down a peg or 10. The seaside, with its perky, mid 20th-century connotations of promenades and ice creams, deck chairs, donkey rides and end-of-pier shows, is as effective an antidote to high art as it\u2019s possible to conjure. The substitution in the title sets the tone for an arch, allusive novel that anchors its complex investigations of consciousness, narrative, reality and \u2013 yes \u2013 death, with prosaic descriptions of rented flats and Chinese restaurants, charity shops and Choose Your Own Adventure books. <em>Death and the Seaside</em> is every bit as searching as Schubert\u2019s quartet, but asks its questions in the context of the modern world, in all its grubby triviality. Nothing is overblown or overstated here; the novel is strikingly ambitious, but the author never gives herself airs.</p> <p>Moore\u2019s debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/the-lighthouse-alison-moore-review\"><em>The Lighthouse</em></a>, won her a place on the 2012 Man Booker shortlist. <em>Death and the Seaside</em>, her third novel, shares a number of aspects with her first, both in terms of structure and texture (the bleak, <em>unheimlich </em>atmosphere of holiday resorts is explored in both), but if anything, it reaches further and unsettles more deeply. The maiden in question here is Bonnie Falls. Nearing 30, with an abandoned English literature degree behind her, no boyfriend and no friends to speak of, she has finally \u2013 at her parents\u2019 insistence \u2013 moved out of the family home. Her new abode is a shabby ground-floor conversion, where a locked door in the bedroom leads to the other half of the house, and an understairs cupboard is filled with the evocative cast-offs of former inhabitants: \u201ca cardboard box filled with dusty baby blankets; a cool box; a camping stove \u2026 a case of LPs with nothing to play them on\u201d. Mornings and evenings, Bonnie works two cleaning jobs to cover her rent. In the afternoons, she sits in her concreted backyard and writes stories, all of which, it soon becomes clear, are echoes or iterations of her own life.</p> <p>Among many other things, <em>Death and the Seaside</em> is a novel about novels, a story about stories, a book-length critique of the role of reader and writer. One after effect of Bonnie\u2019s degree is a lingering tendency to \u201csee the real world in terms of narrative\u201d with \u201cstories and symbolism\u201d everywhere. Reading the book, I soon shared her tendency; the more I read, the more every object and incident \u2013 from names to seashells to slogans on T-shirts \u2013 appeared freighted with ominous significance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Complex and thought-provoking, the book manages to be at once a fairytale and a philosophical treatise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Into this febrile atmosphere steps Sylvia Slythe, Bonnie\u2019s landlady (the word itself is resonant; another nod to those mid 20th-century seaside resorts). Sylvia turns up on Bonnie\u2019s doorstep one morning: a tall and elegant woman whose \u201cbig bright eyes made Bonnie feel like Little Red Riding Hood being looked at by the wolf\u201d. She takes an interest \u2013 one that slides from incongruous to overbearing to borderline-obsessive \u2013 in Bonnie\u2019s life. After recognising Bonnie\u2019s loneliness and vulnerability, and manipulating both to gain her trust, Sylvia reads the story Bonnie is working on \u2013 the tale of an aimless woman with a dead-end job \u2013 and points out the similarities between the writer\u2019s life and that of her protagonist. The story is set in a fictional south-coast town that Bonnie matter-of-factly calls Seatown; when Sylvia discovers a real-life Seaton in Devon, she persuades Bonnie to visit it with her. Reality and fiction draw ever more tightly together, and the stage is set for a showdown.</p> <p><em>Death and the Seaside</em> is a challenging book. Dense, complex, thought-provoking, it manages to be at once a fairytale and a philosophical treatise, high-octane thriller and literary interrogation. Like the dreams that haunt Bonnie\u2019s night-times, it holds its secrets close, and repays careful rereading. The end of the novel, abrupt and death-haunted, feels as neat and tight as a key in a lock, and sheds light on the mysteries that have gone before.

The line is divided into two sections \u2013 north and south of \u00d6stersund \u2013 and just one train travels in each direction along each section each day. This means that although the journey can be done in two days, you can also easily make it last a week or more. Built to transport timber, the line fell into disuse as roads improved and is now operated as a summer passenger service (mid-June to the end of August, so worth planning a trip for next summer). The landscape changes from forest and lakes in the south to tundra and huge wild rivers in the north. The timetable varies each year, and the train stops frequently at trackside restaurants and platform food stalls for delicacies such as smoked trout from the Vojm\u00e5n river, or warm cinnamon buns. The driver will often stop for interesting wildlife, too \u2013 moose, reindeer, and maybe even a bear or lynx. Those who want to learn more about the wildlife can arrange a trip with guide Marcus Eldh, founder of <a href=\"http://www.wildsweden.com/\">Wild Sweden</a>. The banks of the Ljusnan river in R\u00f6jan are the place to look for the protected black vanilla-orchid \u2013 the provincial flower of J\u00e4mtland.

For an island of just 588 sq km the variety of landscapes are breathtaking. At the northern tip of the island, known as the Hammer, the remains of a medieval castle sit above sheer granite cliffs. The most southerly point, Dueodde, has a beautiful beach with white sand so fine it was once used for hourglasses. As it\u2019s an island, nowhere is very far from the sea for a cooling dip on a hot day.</p> <p>In the wooded D\u00f8ndalen valley in the north of the island, Denmark\u2019s longest waterfall tumbles 20 metres into the valley. To the south, 12km-long Ekkodalen was originally called Kodalen (cow valley) but at some point, <em>ek</em> was added and it became Echo Valley. It\u2019s fun trying to find the best spot to send an echo (more information at <a href=\"http://www.ekkodalshuset.dk/\">ekkodalshuset.dk</a>). This is also dinosaur country.

The summer midnight sun, combined with the Gulf Stream and the shelter offered by the mountains results in a relatively mild climate for such a northerly location - and help make this a fantastic area for exploring.</p> <p>The weather is often still good into mid-September, when the autumn colours appear to bring the mountains to life and the northern lights start to light up the clear night skies. Stay in Narvik and explore the coast and up into the mountains, or maybe do the opposite and venture into town only for supplies.</p> <p>Beautiful Skjomenfjord runs south off Ofotfjorden and is framed by steep mountains and peaks. The clear water is perfect for a bracing swim. On its western side, in the shadow of Reintind there are over 80 rock carvings, believed to date from around 5000BC. Although there is no obvious path, the carvings are worth searching out and are remarkably distinct. Located along the water\u2019s edge this is not as difficult as it may sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09510d03ecb0f9686569365ef87ca00882864f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09510d03ecb0f9686569365ef87ca00882864f11/229_0_1691_1015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional k\u00e5ta tents near Narvik, Norway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional k\u00e5ta tents near Narvik</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PAL JAKOBSEN/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another great hike is the Rallarvegen, a trail built by navvies working on the railway line built to carry iron ore across the mountains to Kiruna in Sweden. A particularly spectacular section follows a precipitous path between mountain and fjord for 15km from Katterat on the Swedish border down to the head of the Rombaksfjord. It\u2019s not unusual to find the remains of parachute containers dropped by the Germans during the heavy fighting in the second world war. There\u2019s a boat and bus along the fjord back to Narvik from here (see <a href=\"http://www.visitnarvik.com/Home\">visitnarvik.com</a> for details). Look out for white-tailed fish-eagles and otters and the impressive wreck of the German destroyer Georg Thiele, which was scuttled in the fjord in 1940.</p> <p>For something more technical, Stetind, 80km south-east, is Norway\u2019s national mountain, a steep, smooth granite peak 1,400 metres high. Reaching the summit requires specialist equipment and a guide, but it\u2019s possible to hike as far as the approach (see <a href=\"http://visitstetind.com/en/\">visitstetind.com</a> for routes and local guides). The starting point for the hike is about an hour\u2019s drive along the fjord from Narvik.</p> <p>Long before mines and railways arrived, the nomadic Sami people would spend the summer in settlements along this coast in this area before heading back to Sweden for the winter. Some Sami families now welcome guests for a day tending reindeer or learning birch bark weaving (from \u00a362pp), or a stay in a traditional <em>k\u00e5ta</em> tent (<a href=\"http://njalasoukaadventures.no/\">njalasoukaadventures.no</a>). <a href=\"http://www.visitnarvik.com/no/nyheter\">Visit Narvik</a> (as above) is great for finding budget accommodation ranging from eco-hotels, such as turf-roofed <a href=\"http://www.fjellkysten.com/\">Fjellkysten eco-lodge</a> (doubles from \u00a394 room only, ), to traditional Sami camps such as<a href=\"http://pippirasiida.blogspot.co.uk/\"> Pippira Siida</a> (cabin for two from \u00a333, ).

What was it originally going to look like?</strong></p> <p>The government promised a strategy that would take \u201cdraconian\u201d action, in the words of health secretary Jeremy Hunt last October, to tackle the very serious obesity epidemic in children. One third of children are overweight or obese by the time they reach 11 years of age. Obesity can lead to major health problems in later life, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and costs the NHS more than \u00a34bn every year. NHS boss Simon Stevens has said obesity is going to bankrupt the service.</p> <p>David Cameron made childhood obesity a flagship issue for his second term, putting officials in No 10 in charge, rather than the department of health. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/22/public-health-england-obesity-report-key-points\" title=\"\">Public Health England</a> (PHE) was asked&#xa0;to investigate the evidence and recommend a series of interventions. Top of the list were hitting supermarket promotions of junk food via multibuys and \u201cbogof\u201d (buy one get one free) offers, and curbs on TV ad for foods high&#xa0;in fat, salt and sugar before 9pm, which would affect family shows such as Britain\u2019s Got Talent and the X-Factor. PHE also backed cutting the sugar and fat content of foods. It supported a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, but said it would be less effective.</p> <p><strong>So what did we get?</strong></p> <p>Instead of this comprehensive strategy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/18/former-ministers-attack-massive-damp-squib-childhood-obesity-plan\" title=\"\">the brief document published this week</a> focused on just two things \u2013 reducing sugar consumption and increasing physical activity. There is not a word on&#xa0;advertising or price promotion. And&#xa0;instead of something \u201cdraconian\u201d, the&#xa0;focus is on voluntary action, apart from the sugar tax, which had already been announced.</p> <p>Industry is being asked to reduce the&#xa0;sugar content of foods that children enjoy by 20% by 2020. That is how the&#xa0;Cameron government\u2019s earlier obesity initiative, the <a href=\"https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Public Health Responsibility Deal</a>, worked. This was a&#xa0;voluntary agreement with food and drink companies to reformulate their foods,&#xa0;reduce portion sizes and so on, but not all companies joined in, and critics say it achieved little.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium, representing supermarkets and other outlets, wanted the strategy to make the cuts in sugar mandatory, citing the responsibility deal&#xa0;pledge on cutting salt, which some companies complied with while others did not. But the government has gone firmly down the voluntary road again. The sugar cuts will initially be made in children\u2019s breakfast cereals, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, confectionery, morning goods (such as pastries), puddings, ice&#xa0;cream and sweet spreads. That does&#xa0;nothing to address the issue of&#xa0;\u201chidden sugars\u201d in ketchup, pasta sauces, baked beans and all sorts of ready meals, although the document says work will begin later on other foodstuffs.</p> <p>At the heart of the strategy is&#xa0;the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/sugar-tax-industry-opponents-launch-campaign-levy-soft-drinks-obesity\" title=\"\">sugar tax</a>, which had already been announced by George Osborne in March. That is only on soft drinks and&#xa0;does not come in for two years. If manufacturers lower the amount of sugar in their drinks, they will escape the tax.</p> <p><strong>What about fat in the diet?</strong></p> <p>There is nothing about fat in the strategy \u2013 it is all about sugar. But Sara Petersson, of data analysts Euromonitor, says: \u201cIt is becoming abundantly clear that replacing a critical ingredient of a product, or single nutrient in a diet, is neither an easy process for food companies nor a successful obesity strategy from a public health point of view.\u201d She adds that \u201csimilarly to sugar, fat intake is also higher in diets of countries with higher overweight and obesity rates\u201d. And she points out that replacing sugar with \u201cnatural\u201d sweeteners such as honey or coconut sugar will make no difference, because they are just as high in calories.</p> <p><strong>But surely the measures to get children off the couch and more active will work?</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt that children would benefit from more physical activity in all sorts of ways. It is good for mind and body. But it\u2019s no cure for obesity. To burn off a Big Mac cheeseburger, fries and cola, an adult would need to walk for six hours, it has been calculated. All the evidence shows that exercise can help you maintain your weight \u2013 but not lose it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-not-even-an-e-for-effort\">Childhood obesity strategy: not even an E for effort</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And there is a question mark over whether children will actually end up running about more. Schools are to be asked to give them 30 minutes\u2019 more physical activity each day. Parents and carers are to be requested to ensure children do a further 30 minutes every day. That will be a big ask for some families.</p> <p><strong>For a flagship government strategy, did it get the big push you would&#xa0;expect?</strong></p> <p>Far from it. Instead of a prime-ministerial launch, it was slipped out in mid-August just before the A-level results by the department of health, while Theresa May was on holiday in the Swiss Alps. It would appear that obesity is not the priority it was for David Cameron.</p>",

A thrilling final in the Caricoa 3 arena saw 25-year-old Muhammad lose to the African champion, Cheick Sallah Junior Cisse of the Ivory Coast, in the final agonising second. He was ahead until Cisse took the last kick of the match, picking up four points to win 6-8. Had that kick not made contact with Muhammad\u2019s head, he\u2019d have won 6-4. He looks absolutely gutted \u2013 as you might expect.</p> <p>It was the Londoner\u2019s second Olympic medal, following the bronze he picked up in London. His performance is vindication for GB Taekwondo, who picked him over his rival, Aaron Cook, four years ago. Cook took the huff and ended up accepting Moldovan citizenship in return for a place on their Olympic squad, only to crash out in the first round on Friday.</p> <p>In the women\u2019s -67kg final the Korean Hyeri Oh won a very close battle with Haby Niare of France, 13-12.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T01:56:09.391Z\">at 2.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b7b782e4b047b85f601d19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T01:52:49.946Z\">2.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Jamaican team \u2013 Powell, Blake, Ashmeade and you-know-who</strong> \u2013 are celebrating on the track.

And you\u2019ll have competition from companies around the world that often buy the goods for resale. On Wednesday, for example, with one day left in the three-day auction period, there were 14 bids-with $5,136 the highest shown-for a lot of 4,000 of those chairs valued at $76,000. (That top bid would mean $1.28 per chair.) </p> <p>Rio is the sixth Olympic Games for which RGS Events, a family-owned company in Melbourne, Australia, has provided and disposed of fixtures, furniture, and equipment, starting with Sydney in 2000. This year it\u2019s partnering with U.S. online liquidator B-Stock Solutions to get rid of some of the goods. </p> <p>The majority of buyers who\u2019ve bid on the site to \u201cBuy a Piece of the Rio 2016 Olympics\u201d have been from the U.S., but sales have also been made to buyers in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, said Howard Rosenberg, B-Stock\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>Many products used for those 17 highly televised days eventually go to party-rental companies, furniture resellers, schools, janitorial companies, and event-planning outfits-plus \u201cscrappy entrepreneurial types\u201d who go out and make a market for the items, said Rosenberg. He said \u201chundreds of 40-foot containers of stuff\u201d have been sold. </p> <p>Paul Ramler, chief executive of RGS Events, said more than 90 percent of the 1.3 million or so items from Rio have been spoken for. Some of the products wind up at other major sporting events. Many from the 2012 London Olympics, for instance, spent 16 months stored in 400 40-foot containers at the port in Grangemouth, Scotland, before being used in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, said Ramler. </p> <p>After Glasgow, some of those products took part in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England. Then, RGS donated more than 2 million British pounds worth of well-traveled sofas, wardrobes, bean bags, and more to needy families in Glasgow. Some of the Rio furniture could be used for other sports events in South America, Ramler said; the company is in talks with the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics. </p> <p>Some products will go to a large Brazilian office furniture retailer, Shopping Matriz. Ideally, some of that inventory would have been used in another event RGS is working on, the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia, but storage for two years cost too much to make that feasible, Ramler added.

The Londoner continued pushing after his opponent in the second, enjoying more success, but still leaving himself worryingly open to accurate counters. </p> <p>As the round progressed, he began to land much cleaner and heavier blows, and Dychko, blowing heavily, began to appear increasingly vulnerable. The judges agreed, making the last round effectively a decider, and Joyce pushed forward hurling big right uppercuts as the Kazakh attempted vainly to cling on. </p> <p>Joyce\u2019s fitness was really beginning to tell, bouncing in to deliver further punishment in sharp contrast to Dychko, whose work was increasingly laboured. A left hand swatted the Kazakh\u2019s chin as Joyce finished things off in dominant style to earn the verdict on all three cards. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b752efe4b0b7e64900138f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:42:11.226Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Owen Gibson\u2019s story on the Paralympics\u2019 downsizing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/rio-paralympics-downsized-disappointing-ticket-sales\">Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b751fce4b047b85f601baa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:38:52.694Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Joyce is through to the gold medal bout, the judges decide unanimously.

There is plenty of Dr Wu within its 104 pages, including at least 25 photos of the great man, and this undertaking: \u201cAt AIBA, we have taken great steps to ensure that this year\u2019s Olympic boxing competition is as fair, entertaining and inspiring as it possibly can be.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been entertaining, all right, but not probably as Dr Wu intended.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b7462be4b047b85f601b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T17:47:32.468Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There will be three minutes of stoppage time at the end of the women\u2019s football bronze medal match.

Grrrr! Speaking of whom, I am one of three journalists in the press box. </p> <p>Following yesterday\u2019s ranking round, the competitors are having quite an interesting eliminator: last yesterday takes on second last and it\u2019s winner stays on until they get to the yesterday\u2019s top swordswoman. It allows those who did badly yesterday to try to get a few more points. All the events \u2013 the swimming, the fencing, the showjumping (on horses the competitors don\u2019t know) \u2013 lead up the final discipline: running and shooting. Those higher ranked on the leaderboard after the horse-riding gets a head start before embarking on the final test and whoever crosses the finish line first wins.

  "<p>The first note I found in Dad\u2019s pocket said: \u201cMy name is Tom Carew, but I have forgotten yours.\u201d I soon discovered he was showing this note to everyone. The next one read: \u201cThursday Sep 15 2005, I have no memory of writing this Tom BUT it could not be written by anyone else I must be going BONKERS Tom.\u201d</p> <p>He was coming up to his 86th birthday. I don\u2019t know what made me keep these notes that he wrote himself, but I did. I have a folder full of them. Each one in different coloured pens \u2013 ever since I can remember, he switched colour as he went along. They were like small windows ajar into the twilight world that Dad was slowly and reluctantly entering, and trying to outwit. At the same time they were testimony to his indomitable spirit, his sweetness and courage. \u201c[Black pen, crossed out] TOM CAREW\u2019S Brain is collapsing [blue biro] TOM CAREW\u2019s Brain is switching switching away from Memory \u2013 memory of people and their names [red biro] So you write me off?? not necessarily I invent \u2013 Yes I do \u2013 come to my New HUT Wednesday 28 July Tom.\u201d</p> <p>Dad was always inventive, and had a capacity for great cunning, so it took us, his four children, a while to notice his memory lapses. It wasn\u2019t that he was forgetting things: he had always forgotten things. It was his frustrations that gave him away. He was bewildered and confused. How his bedside light switched on; where the voices on&#xa0;the radio were coming from; why he had to wait for the kettle to boil. My&#xa0;sister, Nicky, eventually took him for a scan. It was confirmed. Dad had begun to suffer little strokes in his brain. Tiny infarcts. Obstruction of the blood supply to the cerebral tissue. Oxygen not getting as far as it should. Small clusters of brain cells&#xa0;dying.</p> <p>I keenly felt the irony of the timing; for only recently had I been able to reconnect with him without the proceedings being strictly monitored under the patrolling eye of my stepmother, who had died the year before. A last, unexpected chance to spend some time with him and it was too late. And yet \u2026</p> <p>As each layer of onion peeled away, the essence of Dad somehow remained. Simpler, more fragile, quite a few wires disconnected, but the person I knew: wacky, alternative, wanting to please, was still very definitely there. He was still making me laugh. In the supermarket one day, I looked round and realised he had given me the slip. I saw him halfway down another aisle. He was standing very close to a lady who was inspecting a blue plastic laundry basket in a design of woven, see-through lattice work, like a trellis. Dad was leaning towards her, and she was leaning away from him. A little alarmed, I sped down the aisle towards them. He was still leaning over her shoulder, very close, as I got there, just in time to overhear him say: \u201cThey leak, you know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3dd8fd7deb65403a58c22b84b415c83036a0fab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dd8fd7deb65403a58c22b84b415c83036a0fab3/15_9_927_1419/653.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Carew in wartime.\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Carew in wartime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Keggie Carew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dad had lost the word for orange, and for me, but not \u201cfastidious\u201d or \u201cscrumptious\u201d, and other slightly old-fashioned words. While I didn\u2019t seem to have a gender, I did have an \u201cindustry\u201d \u2013 which he wanted to join (run, more like). All Dad really wanted was jobs: to be occupied and feel useful again. \u201cGive me a job!\u201d From dawn till dusk every day: \u201cWhat\u2019s my next job?\u201d They were getting harder to find. Something he could succeed at, something that didn\u2019t bore him, something that would give him a sense of achievement. If possible, something where he could invent a better way of doing it \u2013 with a piece of string, a bungy clip or No More Nails, which he applied with his hands straight from the nozzle and then wiped all over his sleeve.</p> <p>One favourite invention was cutting a hole in a two-litre plastic milk bottle. The hole was opposite the handle, so he could pee into it and hold it at the same time. He made one for me and wouldn\u2019t be persuaded otherwise. He made one for everyone! He had them all over the house in case he got caught short. Dad was always practical. Nothing tired him. He could still touch his toes. Pain didn\u2019t affect him. He had never had anaesthetic at the dentist, and still did his own first aid. But everyone was running out of things for Dad to do. And if we couldn\u2019t occupy him, he would be off. And it was hard to keep track of him.</p> <p>Life with Dad had never been dull, and that certainly wasn\u2019t going to change. On my way to retrieve him from next door\u2019s garden, I overheard him saying to my neighbour: \u201cI don\u2019t remember you, but I do remember your teeth. They\u2019re very distinctive.\u201d</p> <p>As my sister, two brothers and I (in our 40s) grew older, and Dad grew younger, it was only logical he didn\u2019t recognise us as his children anymore. Sometimes he hardly recognised himself. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at what goes on,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked him.</p> <p>He pointed to his beard and whiskers: \u201cI didn\u2019t put any of this on.\u201d</p> <p>I suggested it grew by itself. He thought the idea of that was hilarious.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone put it on,\u201d he told me. He looked in the mirror, baffled. \u201cIf it\u2019s not me,\u201d he said mysteriously, \u201cthen it\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Finding out who Dad was, coincidentally, was something I was rather preoccupied with myself \u2013 because now I had the freedom of his attic, and access to the large metal trunks full of letters and diaries and all sorts of mysterious documents. Dad had been a specialist, SOE guerrilla agent in the second world war \u2013 parachuted into France, behind enemy lines, to sabotage the Germans and organise resistance. Once he had a close escape from the Germans by hiding in a schoolteacher\u2019s house, and the BBC sent him a message in their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/02/070122_html_40s.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Message Personnels</em></a> broadcasts to France, which went out after the evening news bulletin. Certain death was the punishment for hiding an agent. Dad said he learnt to trust communists, nuns, priests and schoolteachers, for they had less to lose \u2026 whereas \u201crespectable\u201d French valued their position more than their country\u2019s freedom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125c2f015e52a52784713e14c1bbb4139671789c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125c2f015e52a52784713e14c1bbb4139671789c/0_0_2272_1704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Carew in his garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Carew in his garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Keggie Carew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, he was dropped into the jungles of Burma to raise resistance against the Japanese, where he operated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\" title=\"\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>\u2019s father, and where he made quite a name for himself. In the yellowing Indian newspaper cuttings of 1945, which I remembered as a child, he was referred to as Lawrence of Burma and the Mad Irishman. But 60 years on, my maverick, rule-breaking father had begun to break down in tears. Tears for the loss of people he would never see again. Tears for the loss of a past that could not be revisited. He was experiencing another bereavement \u2013 tears for the loss of him.</p> <p>It was my husband Jonathan\u2019s idea to take Dad to see The Lion King show. We hoped he would enjoy the spectacle, the razzamatazz, that it might take his mind off his memory. The three of us walked up the red-carpetted steps in the theatre foyer when Dad, one step from the top, tripped on something and fell, and started rolling down the steps. Everyone froze, the usherettes froze, the doormen froze, the other theatregoers froze, we all froze. And stared. As an 85-year-old man rolled over and over, bump, bump, bump, all the way down to the bottom. Then sat straight up. Unscathed, unbruised and perfectly fine. There was a loud sigh of relief from the usherettes. What we had just witnessed was Dad going straight into a parachute roll, arms tucked in and totally relaxed. His body had not lost the ability to remember \u2013 his guerrilla training was still second nature to him; it just clicked in. He stood up and dusted down his trousers, enjoying every second of our&#xa0;incredulity.</p> <p>Slowly things were getting worse. All around Dad\u2019s house were notices for reminding. Pinned to kitchen cupboards, in pockets, in drawers, in books. Photographs of us were put up with our names underneath. \u201c[red biro] I HAVE JUST READ pronounced RED all those above BUT I must blame my \u2018MEMORY\u2019 outfit (my MEMORY KIT) MY MEMORY hopesness HOPELESSNESS [green biro] If you are going to be like that IT IS YOUR OWN BLOODY FAULT [red biro] I suppose it is ...\u201d</p> <p>Dad\u2019s contrail became all destruction. Tears of sadness fomented into tears of frustration. Things wouldn\u2019t work. People wouldn\u2019t come. Water wouldn\u2019t boil. He would leave the front door wide open, the blow-heaters on, the gas hob blazing.Every day was getting more and more difficult, and more and more stressful. He ranged about the place precariously, tying things up, scraping things down with his penknife, mixing up dog food with Rice Krispies, cutting the cuffs of his shirt or the tongues out of his shoes. Even when he walked along, he was head-down, his penknife snipping something. \u201cI just want to help someone,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve helped someone.\u201d We showed him photographs to try to jog his memory, but nothing coherent seemed to click. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d I felt like a stranger gaping in.</p> <p>Then, for the first time I had ever witnessed, there was flatness in his voice. I noticed it one day speaking on the phone to him.</p> <p>\u201cWho is this speaking again?\u201d he asked. \u201cKeggie,\u201d he repeated after me, as if he had never said it before.</p> <p>\u201cYour daughter,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cDo I have a daughter?\u201d he asked, but not with wonder, like he usually did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a28cb310f25722b5f53da0541fb4e11577670ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28cb310f25722b5f53da0541fb4e11577670ed1/0_0_1773_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Carew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"775\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Carew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Keggie Carew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou have two,\u201d I told him, \u201cand two sons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Again, flat, lifeless, soulless. Dadless. All I could do was choke off my breath, thinking, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, and all I could get out was: \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>Each day we fed him a handful of pills, which arrived packed, dated: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday ... seven sealed pockets containing each day\u2019s prescribed confection. What, I began to wonder, if we didn\u2019t give him these? What were we really doing with our complex pharmaceuticals, our humane ways, our ethical behaviour, our warped cruelty? I was getting in a bind about Dad. One minute he thought he was going mad, the next that we were trying to rob him. He was always so proud of his clear, unencumbered thinking. I wondered how the old Tom would have dealt with the new one. Once, he said he would sail away if he had to, for whatever reason, when the time came he would get in his boat and head out to sea. I knew if I was able to describe this new Tom to the old one, he would have laughed and said: \u201cShoot me, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d And he would have meant it. But I didn\u2019t know how to shoot my dad. Or when to.</p> <p>There was one of life\u2019s pleasures he still enjoyed. Chocolate. Anything sweet, in fact. He pushed his first course around, but made very quick work of the chocolate ice cream, over which I drizzled two large spoons of golden syrup.</p> <p>\u201cScrumptious. Mmm \u2026 Terribly good!\u201d He pondered on this: \u201cHow absurd to say terribly good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"22afd5730787dd73298461dacb26bedcc2aae80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22afd5730787dd73298461dacb26bedcc2aae80e/0_243_1164_1455/800.jpg\" alt=\"Keggie and Tom in June 2004 at the 60th Jedburgh anniversary reunion at Milton Hall, Peterborough.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keggie and Tom in June 2004 at the 60th Jedburgh anniversary reunion at Milton Hall, Peterborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chatto &amp; Windus publshers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I could see him searching for a better word. I waited. \u201cSexually good!\u201d he says, looking triumphant.</p> <p>Dad wanted to come and live with me, but I had seen what having Grandad living with us for all those years did to Mum, and I did not rate my chances of coming out sane. My sister knew she couldn\u2019t manage either. Dad wouldn\u2019t sleep in a room but stayed in a shed, or sometimes in the tent he had pitched in the garden, with his two dogs who slept with him and which were allowed to do anything they wanted. We called the little one Psycho Dog. It guarded things. When Dad tried to get into bed, it sat bang in the middle of his pillow then growled and spat if you tried to move him off. In the morning, I invariably found Dad at the bottom of the bed, no bedclothes, foetally curled, trying to keep warm, with the dogs stretched out slap in the middle. Yet he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p> <p>We got more help, and then we got a live-in carer, but very soon they could not manage either. Then, just before we were pitched into total meltdown, miraculously we found a home for people with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s half an hour\u2019s drive from Dad\u2019s home, with a room looking out on to a garden, and, miracle of miracles, one that would let him bring his little dog. We began to regularly visit the place for tea; we decorated Dad\u2019s room with all his pictures and photographs, we walked Dad and Psycho Dog in the garden, so that they both became familiar with it. As D-Day loomed, when we would be leaving him there, my sister Nicky and I found the deceit unbearable. The rule for such transitions, when the day finally comes, is to leave the new resident in the home for two whole weeks without any family (or friend) contact; two weeks to bond with the staff and their new surroundings, to transfer all their connections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/30/dadland-keggie-carew-review-remarkable-life\">Dadland by Keggie Carew review \u2013 retrieving the life of a remarkable man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was poor Nicky who drove Dad away from his home for the last time. Knowing he would never see it again, never shut his gate, never open his door, never walk to the bottom of the garden, never go in his bodger-shed, never sit in his conservatory, never call down the stairs. The treachery of it. The acting and pretending to be jolly so he wouldn\u2019t suspect anything, so he wouldn\u2019t get upset. He sat meekly in the front seat of her car in his smart jacket waiting to go out for tea. Unsuspecting. It took Nicky hours to drive home. She had to keep pulling over to stop, sobbing uncontrollably. She said it felt like the worst thing she had ever done.</p> <p>No sooner did she get home when the phone rang. Dad had escaped! So she had to drive back again. He was found half a mile down the road, stopping the traffic. Nicky sat with him on his bed. He was focused and alert.

  "<p>They were born in the same year, in the same country, just six months apart. But the Olympic fortunes of British-raised taekwondo stars Lutalo Muhammad and Aaron Cook could scarcely be more different.</p> <p>When they arrived at Rio\u2019s Carioca 3 arena on Friday morning they were no longer even fighting on the same side, Cook having defected to Moldova in an almighty huff. By the time they went back to the athletes\u2019 village at the end of the night, one of them was silver medallist, the other had to settle for 11th place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/rio-olympics-team-gb-celebration-parade-heroes-theresa-may-london-manchester\">Team GB to receive celebration fit for heroes, Theresa May says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a result which finally laid to rest which of the two 25-year-olds deserved a place on Team GB in the -80kg class, after an unedifying selection battle stretching back five years.</p> <p>Muhammad, the Walthamstow warrior, won a silver for Britain in an agonising final in which he came within one second of beating Cheick Sallah Junior Cisse of the Ivory Coast. The African champion triumphed with the final kick of the match, making contact with the Briton\u2019s head to take four points, winning 6-8.</p> <p>It was Britain\u2019s second taekwondo medal of the Games, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/jade-jones-taekwondo-gold-olympics\">Jade Jones </a>retained her Olympic title on Thursday night, taking gold.

He lost 14-2 to Wei-Ting Liu of Chinese Taipei and will go back home (to Dorchester or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/moldova-protesters-take-to-streets-criticising-mafia-government\">Chi\u0219in\u0103u</a>?) wondering whether it was worth picking such an epic \u2013 and expensive \u2013 fight with GB Taekwondo in his bid to be picked for the British Olympic squad.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Cook will now, finally, be able to forgive the national federation for overlooking him for London 2012 when he was world number one, choosing instead Muhammad, who went on to win bronze in the -80kg category four years ago. He will ask himself, no doubt, if it was worth defecting to Moldova, of all places, when they offered him a passport and a place in their Olympic team.</p> <p>In the run-up to Rio, Muhammad was candid about his relationship with his newly Moldovan nemesis, which he described as \u201cprobably the biggest rivalry in taekwondo\u201d, stressing: \u201cWe are not friends.\u201d</p> <p>After losing his match, Cook was disconsolate. \u201cI am devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have the opportunity to be here is amazing obviously (after) what happened with London when I didn\u2019t have a chance to compete. I\u2019m so grateful that Moldova have done that for me and I feel I let everyone down today. It happened for me on the worst day it could.\u201d</p> <p>To add to Cook\u2019s humiliation, Muhammad breezed through his own first round matches. First he beat Australia\u2019s Hayder Skara 14-0, then he made light work of triple Olympic medallist Steven Lopez (USA), winning 2-9.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79673e94c4f482475fa50c10688f09b4f782fb41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79673e94c4f482475fa50c10688f09b4f782fb41/674_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cheick Sallah Cisse got the better of Lutalo Muhammad in the very last second.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheick Sallah Cisse got the better of Lutalo Muhammad in the very last second.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the semi-finals he beat Milad Beigi Harchegani, who was fighting for Azerbaijan, despite being from Iran. That 12-7 victory put him through to the late night final, guaranteeing a medal upgrade from 2012. He ended up with a different colour metal than the one he was hoping for, but vowed to triumph in Tokyo 2020. \u201cFirst bronze, then silver. You know what comes next,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Following the selection controversy of 2012, Cook has refused to represent the country of his birth. He complained that he had received \u201cno funding or support from the GB system\u201d since 2011, despite coming fifth at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 when he was just 17. For a few years he fought for the Isle of Man, but was always scouting around for other, more lucrative options, claiming to have spent \u00a3100,000 challenging his London shunning.</p> <p>A saviour arrived, in the shape of the Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici, who promised to to fund the young athlete. In April 2015, after weeks of speculation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/16/aaron-cook-taekwondo-nationality-moldova-team-gb\">Cook received his passport</a> from the small eastern European state, prompting a flurry of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/taekwondo-they-think-its-moldova-it-is-now-as-aaron-cook-quits-team-gb-10183328.html\">They think it\u2019s Moldova. It is now</a>\u201d headlines.</p> <p>The nationality switch was reluctantly accepted by the British Olympic Association (BOA). Bill Sweeney, the BOA\u2019s chief executive, said taekwando\u2019s governing body had tried to persuade Cook to change his mind but in the end could do little other than respect the athlete\u2019s wishes.</p> <p>Cook\u2019s first year as a Moldovan athlete was so successful that he was named <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/_Teoh-CDRv/\">Moldovan Sportsman of the Year</a> 2015. Last year he came third in the world championships in Chelyabinsk, Russia, in the 74-80kg category, and second at a world cup event in Mexico City.</p> <p>Moldova has so far won one medal in Rio, a bronze in the men\u2019s canoeing. After 263 of 306 events, Team GB have won 60, including 24 golds.</p>"
