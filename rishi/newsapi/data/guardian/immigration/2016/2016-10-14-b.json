  "<p>Parliamentary committee hearings often get heated. </p> <p>Politicians, from all parties, have made names for themselves with sharp and persistent questions that expose important information or embarrassing facts, or sometimes just provide a look-at-me shouty grab for the evening news. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the then senator Bronwyn Bishop shot to public prominence with her combative questioning of the then tax commissioner Trevor Boucher in the joint committee on public accounts, accusing him \u2013 among other things \u2013 of bankrupting the tax office. Labor senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray were the bane of the public service with clinically calm forensic questioning that often lasted late into the night.</p> <p>Sometimes the witnesses came off best \u2013 most famously when the late Kerry Packer fronted the print media inquiry. He introduced himself as \u201cKerry Francis Bullmore Packer. I appear here this afternoon reluctantly\u201d and after much interrupting and table thumping left having stared down or batted back every question.</p> <p>But the Queensland Liberal National party senator Ian Macdonald has perfected a whole new Senate committee style, sometimes in tandem with a couple of colleagues \u2013 highly disrespectful questioning that almost never elicits significant information.</p> <p>Macdonald, you may recall, was the chair of the Senate estimates committee when it took evidence from the Human Rights Commission president, Gillian Triggs, last year at a time when the government was alleging she was biased and pressuring her to resign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/12/former-solicitor-general-slams-george-brandis-rules-for-the-job\">Former solicitor general criticises George Brandis' rules for the job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Presumably his job back then \u2013 in the nine-hour grilling \u2013 was to force the leading international and human rights lawyer to provide some evidence to back the government\u2019s claim that the HRC\u2019s \u201cForgotten Children\u201d report on children in immigration detention was biased.</p> <p>Instead, the hearing is remembered for Macdonald\u2019s admission that he had not even read the report because he did not want to \u201cwaste my time on a report which was clearly partisan\u201d, which does seem to prejudge the question.</p> <p>He also got to express his deep concern about the title. \u201cWith so much time and money being spent on children\u2019s welfare, how can anyone call them forgotten children?\u201d he complained, rhetorically.</p> <p>Triggs kept her cool throughout the highly combative questioning and will see out her five-year term as HRC president next year.</p> <p>Macdonald rejected the outcry about what was widely viewed as hectoring with a rambling statement insisting the report he had not read was inaccurate.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to all of those who have kindly (and not so kindly \u2013 they are the majority and are all Labor/Greens staffers, union heavies and staff and good old GetUp and old leftie journalists) \u2013 made media and social media comment on recent media reports on the Senate estimate committee on Professor Triggs and the partisan-ly titled report on children in detention, Forgotten Children.</p> <p>\u201cIf any of those who have abused me for not reading this partisan, inaccurate report had themselves bothered to read the facts on children in detention from any number of estimates on immigration \u2013 which sadly the Human Rights Commission [AHRC] itself didn\u2019t bother to read \u2013 then they may have not been so quick to rush to social media,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/did-george-brandis-mislead-parliament-over-solicitor-general-changes\">Did George Brandis mislead parliament over solicitor general changes? | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, Macdonald engaged in a similar performance with another highly respected lawyer and statutory office holder \u2013 the solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, who is locked in a very public argument with the attorney general, George Brandis.</p> <p>The argument centres on a directive from Brandis to Gleeson that says no one in government, including the prime minister, can seek Gleeson\u2019s advice without the attorney general\u2019s permission. Gleeson says he considers the directive unlawful. His predecessor as solicitor general, Gavan Griffiths, says it is akin to treating the solicitor general as a \u201cdog on a lead\u201d. Brandis says it did not constrain Gleeson in any additional way.</p> <p>There is also a related stoush over whether Brandis misled the parliament on the issue with a claim that he had consulted Gleeson over the directive, a disagreement which Brandis says rests entirely on the Oxford dictionary meaning of the word \u201cconsult\u201d and Gleeson says hinges on the fact that the specific new directive was not discussed, something Brandis now concedes.</p> <p>Despite their very public and vehement differences of opinion, Brandis and Gleeson got through their Senate committee appearances without making any nasty personal criticism of each other. </p> <p>There was plenty of disagreement about the substantive matters \u2013 Gleeson regarding the directive, and Brandis of the fact that Gleeson had taken a phone call during the election campaign from the shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus where it was discussed.</p> <p>And while the politeness was sometimes through gritted teeth, the first and second law offices of the land quite properly refrained from an all-in slanging match.</p> <p>Not so Macdonald, who persistently interrupted Gleeson and at one point interjected: \u201cIf you want to get into the political game, join the parliament\u201d \u2013 a statement he was quickly forced to retract.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/first-dog-on-the-moon-reads-george-brandiss-diaries\">First Dog on the Moon reads George Brandis's diaries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the chair, Labor\u2019s Louise Pratt, tried to call him into line, he again stunned those listening.</p> <p>\u201cSenator Macdonald.

Your dealings with witnesses need to be conducted with respect and courtesy, \u201c Pratt said.</p> <p>\u201cI always give witnesses the respect they deserve, madam chair,\u201d Macdonald replied.</p> <p>Quite apart from the fact that his treatment of Gleeson was highly inappropriate, if he paid any attention to the history of Senate committees, Macdonald would quickly learn that tough but respectful questioning usually gets better results. </p>",

  "<p>Contrary to the throaty moans of TV pundits and the aggrieved posts clogging your social media feeds, there is a miraculous silver lining to this methodical meat grinder of a presidential election. Something magnificent has occurred that only a once-in-a-lifetime pile of spoiled bologna like Donald Trump could manifest. The pearl-clutching, holy-rolling conservative media is exposing itself. Not literally, even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/08/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-tv-producer\">Roger Ailes</a> has thought about it once or twice after one too many highballs at the country club.</p> <p>Former Boston Red Sox pitcher <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/real-time/Curt-Schilling-attempts-to-defend-Trumps-sexual-comments-about-a-10-year-old-girl.html\">Curt Schilling has found a new appreciation for his very \u201cbeautiful\u201d son </a>and sees no problem marveling at the attractiveness of underage girls. Rush Limbaugh, once a man committed to making Bill Clinton pay for his marital infidelity, has seen the light and now does not blink twice at stepping out on your wife<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\"> if they \u201clet you do anything\u201d</a>. Observing this is like watching a cat try to escape a burlap sack. The moral majority is struggling to find comfort with the most immoral candidate they could find.</p> <p>Now, seeing that their position is uniquely untenable, they are gamely attempting to claim that it is the Democrats who are the true hypocrites. After all, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rush-limbaugh-defends-trump-assault-229751\">Obama listens to hip-hop and has invited rappers to the White House</a>. Ann Coulter tweeted that Michelle Obama should be ashamed of herself for chastising Trump while giving credence to the notion that Beyonc\u00e9 is a role model for young girls, even though she has, in song, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/irl/ann-coulter-beyonce-twitter/\">declared that her is \u201cpussy curvalicious, served delicious\u201d</a>. Only human strawman Ann Coulter could find any equivalency between extoling the virtues of one\u2019s genitals and claiming someone else\u2019s as yours to do with as you please \u2013 and in any case, that line (from Feeling Myself) was delivered by Nicki Minaj.</p> <p>The thing is, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, and Kanye West are not running for president (yet). No one is wondering if Fetty Wap is fit to run the most powerful military in the world or knows how to solve the Syrian refugee crisis. I have yet to find much support for a last-minute J Cole write-in candidacy, though I feel like DJ Khaled is subtly preparing to run for his local school board.</p> <p>If the above sounds preposterous to you, try to remember how we all felt when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. It seemed like the universe was taking the collective piss out of all of us, declaring that any dimwit possessing enough Twitter followers and a penchant for personal embarrassment could be a viable option for the highest office in the land. This ambulatory piece of salmon jerky can offer himself up for public service and it\u2019s treated as totally normal. The only thing Donald Trump has ever done that remotely resembles a selfless act was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/billy-bush-donald-trump-lewd-comments-tape-arianne-zucker\">when he inadvertently got Billy Bush fired from the Today Show</a>.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9 is not running for president, but Donald Trump is, which is why his words are the ones that matter here. The line for what is acceptable has moved so far, so fast, that the idea of a rapper in the White House should not be so unpleasant to the average Bible-humping conservative. As the Republican party further normalizes outrageous behavior by supporting their wholly unqualified, monstrous candidate, they welcome the very thing they seem so afraid of. </p> <p>There is no such thing as morality in politics any more. What we define as \u201cgood\u201d is irrelevant. Conservative pundits have torn down the wall between them and the popular culture with a glee and aplomb that borders on mania. People who claim faith like Ralph Reed have willfully turned themselves into bigger jokes than they were four years ago. When Desiigner becomes president in 12 years and changes the lyrics of the Star-Spangled Banner to some mindless gibberish about BMWs, it will be their fault.</p>",
  "<p>War used to be described as the continuation of politics by other means. But decades of effort have ensured that some tactics are no longer just a brutal form of diplomacy, but are defined as crimes. In recent years, the noble goal to protect humanity has been hollowed out by the despicable attacks on hospitals and schools carried out with apparent impunity in the wars across the Middle East. This deliberate targeting has to stop. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-hit-yemen-funeral-officials-say\" title=\"\">In Yemen more than 140 people attending a funeral</a> in the country\u2019s capital Sana\u2019a were killed in an air strike by Saudi-led coalition forces prosecuting a bloody war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Russia allies itself with a state that uses chemical weapons against its own civilians. Russian and Syrian warplanes above Aleppo appear to be intentionally targeting civilians. Below them, hospitals, UN aid convoys and schools are no longer safe.</p> <p>This week the quarter of a million trapped and starving people in Aleppo were told by Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, backed by Moscow and Tehran, that he had to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/no-mercy-children-assad-vows-9046927\" title=\"\">\u201ckeep cleaning this area and to push the terrorists to Turkey to go back to where they come from, or to kill them\u201d</a>. International diplomacy pays lip service to the idea that such actions are, if proven, war crimes. In meetings, the UN security council \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d such violations of international humanitarian law. Yet four of its five permanent members support coalitions that attack hospitals in Syria, Yemen and Sudan.</p> <p>On Saturday, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will meet in the Swiss city of Lausanne to consider steps toward settling the Syrian conflict. There is little expectation that anything will come of it. Russia is keen to win the Syrian war for Mr Assad at any cost \u2013 sending signals to the region\u2019s authoritarian regimes that it will fill the vacuum left by a weakened US. Egypt, which backed a Russian&#xa0;resolution in the security council that removed the demand for an end to air strikes on Aleppo, is apparently <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-russia-military-idUSKCN12C2E0\" title=\"\">in talks to site&#xa0;an Russian airbase on its soil</a>. The&#xa0;argument of power is winning over the power of argument.</p> <p>Such actions undermine the spirit and break the letter of international law. Despite the concept of universal jurisdiction, western governments prefer realpolitik. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/israel-tzipi-livni-diplomatic-immunity-uk\" title=\"\">In 2014 the Foreign Office granted temporary diplomatic immunity to Tzipi Livni</a>, then Israel\u2019s justice minister, to protect her against arrest for alleged war crimes. How can justice be seen to be blind when of the nine countries that the international criminal court has <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/03/icc-biased-african-countries-160311140721768.html\" title=\"\">opened inquiries into, eight are in Africa</a>? Little wonder African countries threaten to withdraw when they watch states in the Middle East commit crimes against humanity with impunity.</p> <p>Yet the answer to this is not despair. It cannot be. The construction of international humanitarian law represented real progress for humanity and it must not be abandoned. The evidence of war crimes must still be gathered, and their victims remembered. <a href=\"https://justiceinconflict.org/tag/commission-for-international-justice-and-accountability-cija/\" title=\"\">The&#xa0;Commission for International Justice and Accountability</a> has already begun collecting material on the Assad regime\u2019s actions with a view to potential prosecutions. If, in the future, the politics of Russia or Syria change, perhaps the leaders of those nations, who have blood on their hands, could have their day in court. This might yet happen. It has already happened once, to Chile\u2019s General Pinochet, who died under house arrest facing hundreds of charges of human rights abuse in 2004. This is a history lesson that Mr Putin and Mr Assad do not want to repeat but should be compelled to learn.</p> <p>The west, too, faces a chance to demonstrate that it does respect the constraints of international law. Soon western-backed Iraqi forces will aim to retake Mosul, Islamic State\u2019s last major stronghold in the country. The conduct of the battle will determine whether victory comes at an unacceptable humanitarian cost. The UN predicts that 1.2&#xa0;million people could be displaced. Safe passage needs to be ensured to the refugee camps, set up by agencies like Save the Children, outside of the battlefield. The Iraqi army has already bombarded civilian areas \u2013 and their Shia militias need reining in. Although Iraq is responsible for a judicious application of force, it is backed by London and Washington. Earlier this month, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made the case for Britain\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d to defend values enshrined in the UN charter. Mosul offers a chance to turn words into action and show that there is a better way to win a&#xa0;modern war.</p>",

She wants Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves as a result of Brexit, and although she reaffirmed that she believes this might result in Scotland having to hold a second independence referendum, she also spoke at some length about alternative options.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sturgeon said she wanted to explore \u201ccreative\u201d solutions that might allow Scotland to stay in the single market, even if the rest of the UK leaves.</strong> She said she would be publishing detailed proposals soon. There were various options, she suggested.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The point I would make, and it\u2019s quite a fundamental point, is we are in unchartered territory here. Article 50 is the only rule that exists for what happens now. No country was every expected to ever want to leave the EU. So to some extent the UK as a whole is sitting with a blank sheet of paper. There is an ability to be creative, and to look at different options that respect how different parts of the UK voted. I think there are ways in which that can be done. </p> <p>I don\u2019t pretend, and I have never since the referendum pretended, that it will be straightforward or without challenges. And maybe we will find that none of these ways are possible, and that independence is the only option for Scotland to pursue. But we will try very hard to put other options on the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon did not give details about what these options might be. But she played down the suggestion that she might want to see a customs border go up between England and Scotland. She said the UK government was opposed to having a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and so she did not see the case for erecting one between England and Scotland. She also hinted that Iceland might be a possible model.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are options - for example the kind of option that Norway has. I was in Iceland at the weekend - [the option] that Iceland has of being in the single market but not in the European Union.</p> <p>Is that as good as full EU membership? In my view, no it\u2019s not. One of the downsides of it is that you have to abide by the rules without influencing the rules - but is it better than being outside the single market completely. Emphatically yes.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to keep Scotland in the single market.</strong> If it was not in the single market, there would be barriers to trade, she said, and that would be bad for the economy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said the debate about independence had changed since 2014 because Brexit had changed the balance of economic risk.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK we voted to stay part of in 2014 is not the UK we now face the prospect of.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon said she accepted that the fall in the oil price created difficult questions for those backing Scottish independence. But she went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I absolutely accept that if Scotland is in another independence debate then there will be hard economic questions that will be asked that I and those advocating independence have a responsibility to answer.</p> <p>But this debate has changed since 2014. In 2014 those who argued against independence said it was about the economic certainty and stabililty of the UK versus the uncertainty of independence.</p> <p>What we have now in the UK, particularly if it comes out of the single market, is instability and uncertainty and lost economic growth. So this would be a debate about what gives Scotland the best prospect, not of having a magic wand about its economy, but of building the best economic future.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the UK\u2019s budget deficit was likely to get worse because of Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is very likely that the UK deficit is going to deteriorate because of the economic implications of Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She played down the fact that polls indicate a majority of Scots oppose independence.</strong> She said that when the last independence campaign started only 30% of Scots favoured independence, but the yes side eventually got 45% of the vote, she said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She claimed it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that Westminster would try to stop Scotland holding a second independence referendum if it wanted to have one. </strong>She said she had not heard Theresa May or anyone else in Westminster say they would stop Edinburgh holding a second independence referendum. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T12:25:38.772Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580083a7e4b047a4eaafc5a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-14T07:30:56.084Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I will post a summary of Sturgeon\u2019s Today interview soon.</p> <p>Here are some of the lines from some of the other interviews she has given this morning.

However, he said places such as Dungeness, Rye and Salisbury Plain, where viper\u2019s bugloss is common, could be settled by the bee in future.</p> <p>Notton has also recently discovered a new-to-the-UK digger wasp and spider wasp, with the academic papers confirming the finds due soon. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very good year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The UK hosts 270 different types of bee, but only about half-a-dozen new species have been found in the last half-century. \u201cBut there are a lot of new insects turning up at the moment due to the globalisation of transport and possibly due to climate change making the UK warmer.\u201d The arrival of one unwelcome new immigrant, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/threat-honeybees-asian-hornet-arrival-uk-confirmed-defra-invasive-species\">Asian hornet, which preys on honeybees, was confirmed in September</a>.</p> <p>The viper\u2019s bugloss mason bee joins about 80 species of bee in the Greenwich park, but Notton said the situation is mixed for bees across Britain: \u201cSome bee species are doing OK, while others are struggling, with habitat change, climate change and pesticides all impacting the environment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>They call it the European Champions Cup but who are they kidding? When Schalk Burger arrives at the Stade Felix Mayol on Saturday afternoon for Saracens\u2019 Pool&#xa0;3 duel with Toulon he could almost be back in the southern hemisphere again. Five capped South Africans \u2013 the home captain, Duane Vermeulen, plus Bryan Habana, Juan Smith, Juandr\u00e9 Kruger and Marcel van&#xa0;der&#xa0;Merwe are registered to play for Toulon in Europe this season. A total of 27 current or former Springboks \u2013 not counting those born in southern Africa who now represent other countries \u2013 are due to feature in Europe\u2019s elite club tournament.</p> <p>Super Rugby in disguise? At the last count there were more than 300 South African-reared players operating at various professional levels in Europe or Japan. All this at a time when Springbok rugby has never looked more fragile, the national team having shipped nine tries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/south-africa-new-zealand-rugby-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">at home to New Zealand last Saturday</a>. When Burger met up with Habana and co on the eve of Saturday\u2019s contest, the subject could hardly be avoided. \u201cIt hurts all of us who have played there for a long time,\u201d said Burger, whose 86-cap Test career ended at last year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure what the future is going to hold. At this moment it looks quite bleak out there.\u201d</p> <p>There may be no Table Mountain vistas in St Albans \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with that \u2026 I had it from 2002 until now and Table Mountain\u2019s not going anywhere\u201d \u2013 but the 33-year-old Burger, despite beginning a new life in England with his young family, will never forget his roots. His lust for competition and life make him a popular team-mate; as the son of a former Springbok himself, he epitomises what South African rugby is presently missing. Having come close to death in early 2013, when he contracted bacterial meningitis while in hospital for an operation to remove a cyst next to his spine, he also has a healthy dollop of perspective. There are few better qualified to say where his proud rugby nation goes from here.</p> <p>Economic reality, for now, is shaping everything. After years of wholehearted service to the Boks and Western Province, no one can blame Burger for heading north at the tail end of his career but the drain of younger players is a different matter. \u201cThe issue we\u2019ve got now is the age at which we\u2019re losing players overseas,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no qualms about someone like myself, Duane or Francois Louw plying our trade overseas because we\u2019ve done our bit for the Springboks over numerous years. The big issue is losing the pros in the middle. The bloke who plays 200 games for his team, drives the everyday values, pitches up without complaining and plays 80 minutes every week \u2026 we\u2019ve lost them in South Africa. Our pros are sitting in France or Japan or here. We\u2019ve got top players and promising young players but nothing in the middle.\u201d</p> <p>The situation in England and France is increasingly poles apart. Saracens cannot speak highly enough of Burger\u2019s positive influence on their academy players since his arrival and it is English youngsters who are soaking up precious knowledge from him and fellow former Western Province emigres Schalk Brits and Neil de Kock. Visa restrictions in the UK make the Top 14 more attractive still \u2013 \u201cThe reality is you can\u2019t compare what a pro can earn in South Africa and what he can earn in France,\u201d Burger says \u2013 before you begin to factor in the political and unique selectorial imperatives within South African sport.</p> <p>Either way, Burger believes these are crucial times for South Africa\u2019s rugby authorities: \u201cThe warning signs were there last year and maybe the year before. We probably lost a few games we wouldn\u2019t have lost in the past. We went through a phase when massive alarm bells were ringing but we probably had a good enough international side at the time to mask it.</p> <p>\u201cSA Rugby has to become more proactive. We\u2019ve been a good rugby nation for so long and this is the first time we\u2019re really in big crisis. We could have been more proactive in the past but now the issue is real. Everyone is looking ahead to 2019 but there\u2019ll be no 2019 World Cup for the current crop of players if it goes on like this.\u201d He fears some potential stalwarts may not hang around to find out. \u201cYoung players now are probably more impatient or ambitious than we were. I was willing to sit in the queue behind Bob Skinstad, Corn\u00e9 Krige and others; eventually you started playing with them and became a better player for it,\u201d Burger says. \u201cThe current generation in South Africa, whether it\u2019s down to their agents or what they want to achieve, are moving away earlier.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/13/european-champions-cup-challenge-cup-rugby-2016-17\">European cup rugby returns, with public appetite hopefully to follow | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The short-term consequence is that more overseas-based players are set to be recalled for the first November Test against England at Twickenham. Ideally the previous weekend\u2019s game against the Barbarians at Wembley would act as a useful warmup but it falls outside the official Test window so the head coach, Allister Coetzee, will be denied that luxury. Burger offers one extreme longer-term solution: privately owned South African franchises playing European teams in the same timezone rather than endlessly hopping on planes to Australia and New Zealand: \u201cThe only time we\u2019re going to get into Europe is when rugby as we know it in South Africa has a complete transformation, we get privately owned teams like the clubs over here and basically start a new competition.\u201d As on the field, Burger is never afraid to go where others hesitate to tread.</p> <p>Nothing, though, is more extraordinary than his comeback following the health scare that almost cost him his life. \u201cAfter three days, when I wasn\u2019t cured, the odds go against you,\u201d he says. \u201cDying becomes a reality. Surviving without any scarring becomes an issue; coming out of it but being blind or paralysed. My missus phoned my best mates on day three and said: \u2018This might be the last time you see him as you know him.\u2019 As luck would have it I battled through and got through to the other side.\u201d</p> <p>Minor details such as ending Toulon\u2019s unbeaten European Cup home record or replicating Saracen\u2019s double triumph last season suddenly feel irrelevant. By next summer, you suspect Burger\u2019s unquenchable spirit and physicality will be as woven into Saracens folklore as that of his retired namesake, Jacques Burger.</p> <p>\u201cHe used to tackle with his face,\u201d recalls Sarries\u2019 latest Cape crusader. \u201cI try and use my shoulder a bit more.\u201d South Africa\u2019s loss, not for the first time, is very much Saracens\u2019 gain.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Twelve months ago the government announced plans to allow summer-born children to start school a year later. Why hasn\u2019t it happened yet?<br></strong>Schools minister Nick Gibb wrote an open letter to schools and local authorities in September 2015, announcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/08/parents-of-summer-born-children-get-right-to-delay-start-of-school\">plans to change the rules</a> to allow children born between 1 April and 31 August to start primary school a year later. At the time, the move was welcomed by parents of summer-born children, who have long argued that their offspring are at a disadvantage because of their relative immaturity within a class. But this week it emerged that while some authorities have been pressing ahead with change, the government is delaying because of fears that some parents might try to play the system.</p> <p><strong>Parents play the system? Surely not. What are they hoping to gain?<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-gibb\">Gibb</a>, speaking during a <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-10/debates/5032D3A8-AA55-4388-BCE2-DE2ACAB8CDCC/SchoolAdmissionsCode#contribution-D0C9CE46-71D8-4378-A890-EE44D1F54B98\">parliamentary debate</a>, said there were concerns that some parents might use the change in policy to double their chances of getting a place at a popular primary school. Competition can be fierce for successful primary schools, particularly because of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/16/welcome-big-school-how-baby-boom-supersized-primaries\">increase in the number of school-age children</a>, which has been putting pressure on places for a number of years. The government has become worried that some parents of summer-borns might use the changes to make two applications to their preferred school, applying once when their child is four and again when they are five. So ministers have asked for more time to consider how to best implement the changes to avoid \u201cunintended consequences\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/08/parents-of-summer-born-children-get-right-to-delay-start-of-school\">Parents of summer-born children get right to delay start of school</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Does it really make a difference when a child starts school?<br></strong>It does. Children born in late summer \u2013 in July and August \u2013 will find themselves learning in the classroom alongside children who can be 11 or even 12 months older than them. The older children will be more physically capable; they will be able to concentrate better and their language skills will be more developed \u2013 an advantage that is then reinforced by praise and improved self-esteem. Children born in the summer also tend to perform worse academically than those born in the autumn. The differences are at their most pronounced soon after children start school, but the gap remains up to GCSEs and beyond.</p> <p><strong>So if you are born in July or August, you are likely to do worse in your GCSEs?<br></strong>A <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/comms/r80.pdf\">report</a> by the highly regarded <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> concluded that children born in August are 6.4% less likely to achieve five GCSEs or equivalent at grades A* to C, and around 2% less likely to go to university at age 18 or 19 than children born in September.</p> <p><strong>Does the disadvantage persist in other areas of life?<br></strong>The IFS argues that the effect fades over time and there is little evidence that it persists into adulthood. But in a feature titled <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/18891749\">How to build a champion: Be born at the right time</a>, the BBC points to research into the possible impact of birth date on sporting success, particularly looking at football in England, ice hockey in Canada and competitors at the Beijing Olympics. English football mirrors the school calendar, in that children are divided into year groups based on whether they are born before or after 1 September. The study found that professional football youth academies in England for 16- to 20-year-olds were dominated by \u201colder\u201d players born at the start of the academic year. Figures for 2009 found that 57% of the footballers were born between September and December, compared to 14% who were summer-born. Similarly, 75% of footballers taking part in an under-17 European championship were born within that four-month window.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/08/new-summer-born-school-rules-will-leave-poorer-children-behind\">New 'summer-born' school rules will leave poorer children behind</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Would it help to let all children start school when they are older?<br></strong>You mean like in Finland, where children don\u2019t go to formal school until they are seven? It\u2019s true that the later children begin school, the smaller the relative age difference between them will be. But the fact remains that children are born throughout the year, and school starts at a fixed point. The IFS argues that it is the age at which a child sits a test that is the key driver of differences in educational attainment, rather than their birth date. Perhaps the government should be looking at age-adjusted test scores rather than greater flexibility in relation to school starting dates.</p>",

  "<p>Talking to Colleen Ballinger about her new Miranda Sings show can go a little Inception if you\u2019re not careful. It\u2019s a bit bewildering, a bit meta. For here is a woman, made famous by singing and dancing badly on YouTube, talking about her new Netflix comedy, in which she lampoons women who try to get famous by singing and dancing badly on YouTube. But while Miranda Sings is a piss-take of the sorts of women who overshare, dress up and chat for hours to strangers on YouTube, Ballinger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PsychoSoprano\">personal YouTube channel</a> is full of videos of her doing just that \u2013 and not in character. Not to mention the fact that I am speaking to Ballinger just days after she and her husband Joshua David Evans announced on their YouTube channels that they are to divorce. Yet I am told I must not ask about it \u2013 the thing announced to her 4.5 million subscribers. The rabbit hole just got a little deeper.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/mirandasings08\">Miranda Sings</a>, for the uninitiated, started life as a YouTube show about a talentless, clownish woman singing hit songs and reading out comments from an army of real online \u201chaters\u201d, apparently unaware that she was a pantomime fool. Haters Back Off, available now on Netflix, is a look \u201cbehind Miranda\u2019s camera\u201d \u2013 at the surreal home-life of this talentless ingenue as she plots world fame with her creepy uncle, bullies her wet flannel of a mother and tries to sell selfies at school.</p> <p>The setting is one of those timeless, regionless, suburban glimpses of America that has been the bedrock of so much modern comedy. Watching Miranda speed-eating an ice-cream on her front lawn, dressed in a beige cagoule, it\u2019s hard not to be reminded of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcWPiHjIExA\">Napoleon Dynamite</a>. And watching her family sit around the breakfast table to microwaved muffins and seething arguments, it\u2019s hard not to think of Roseanne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fd254ae3eadaae0f11b88f0827144fa99d49166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd254ae3eadaae0f11b88f0827144fa99d49166/0_0_3607_2164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Nine or 10 years ago, bullying online hadn\u2019t been explored much, but I was fascinated by people who spent all day hating on the internet.

The character is so wacky and extreme for the world to be wacky and extreme too. We had to pull everything back to make it as real as possible.\u201d As she says this, I think of the show\u2019s aquarium scene, where dead fish are sellotaped to the outside of their tanks for a TV advert. It\u2019s funny, but undeniably wacky.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was based on my life and the way I grew up,\u201d says Ballinger. \u201cSome of the bits I\u2019m most proud of in Haters Back Off actually happened.\u201d Oh really. Like what? \u201cOh god. You don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she laughs. Except I do. So I ask again. \u201cAt least half of it actually happened to me,\u201d she answers diplomatically. \u201cI\u2019ll let you try to figure out which half.\u201d Her self-proclaimed willingness to divulge everything, I think, seems to fall short during interviews.</p> <p>Some of the funniest moments in Haters Back Off are when the clownish antics twin up with a brilliant piece of dialogue. Like when the hysterical Miranda, after receiving her first death threat, screams \u201cI\u2019m panic-eating wieners!\u201d while flying through her house with a mouthful of Vienna sausage. From her enormous red mouth to the jerky body language, she is every inch a modern clown. \u201cI take that as a compliment,\u201d laughs Ballinger. \u201cClowns are meant to make people smile. That\u2019s my goal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18c90bf4378cef9ac4fa0fccdb6430f2cf1147ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c90bf4378cef9ac4fa0fccdb6430f2cf1147ae/0_0_3607_2164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s hard not to think of Napoleon Dynamite \u2026 Miranda Sings in Haters Back Off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s hard not to think of Napoleon Dynamite \u2026 Miranda Sings in Haters Back Off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol Segal/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But could Miranda have become successful, got her own Netflix show, attracted millions of online viewers if Ballinger had, herself, actually been ugly? Can weird-looking women make it in comedy? There is, after all, no Curb Your Enthusiasm equivalent starring a bald woman and her fat female friend. \u201cIf I looked a little different, I sure hope I could find the same success,\u201d says Ballinger. \u201cIt would be a very sad world to live in if that weren\u2019t true.\u201d</p> <p>Here we slip down the rabbit hole again, as Ballinger explains that her character became popular on YouTube precisely because she was gross and untalented. But, she argues, nobody knew what Ballinger actually looked like. And yet, to me, it often felt like watching the uglying up of a clearly good-looking woman for laughs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard for me looking disgusting,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the requirements for directors was that they\u2019d be happy to make me look gross. And my brother, who is my co-producer and co-writer, would sometimes run on set to warn me I looked too pretty.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it is difficult to separate Miranda from Ballinger precisely because she created the character so long ago, based on the kinds of criticism any woman might get online about their appearance. \u201cNine or 10 years ago, bullying online hadn\u2019t been explored much,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was fascinated by these people who spent all day just sitting and hating on the internet. So I encouraged it.\u201d</p> <p>Looking through those early videos, there are far more \u201cYou sound like collon\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve got the biggest nose i have ever seen\u201d and \u201cUr face freaks me out\u201d comments than \u201cI luv you Miranda\u201d ones. \u201cWhatever they didn\u2019t like, I\u2019d do it more to get a rise,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lipstick was one of those things \u2013 if they said it was ugly, I made it brighter and bigger. Miranda was built by her haters.\u201d</p> <p><em>Haters Back Off is available on Netflix now.</em></p>",
  "<p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://site.isangoensemble.org.za/\">Cape Town\u2019s Isango Ensemble</a>, who first astonished us in 2001 with their version of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://site.isangoensemble.org.za/repertoire/the-mysteries/\">The Mysteries</a>, are back with an equally powerful piece of music-theatre about a young Somali refugee\u2019s capacity for survival. Halfway between a Brechtian fable and a pop opera, it says a lot about human endurance and demonstrates the company\u2019s exhilarating virtuosity.</p> <p> The show is based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/04/man-of-good-hope-review-jonny-steinberg-south-africa\">book by Jonny Steinberg</a> that recounts the true story of eight-year-old Asad, who sees his mother murdered in Somalia\u2019s civil war before setting out on a journey that will take him through the Horn of Africa. In the course of his long trek, he sees relatives disappear, lives in refugee camps, grows up to acquire an Ethiopian wife and child and eventually arrives in South Africa. One of the show\u2019s bitterest ironies is that, instead of a promised land, he discovers a struggling, post-apartheid society where Somalis are seen as unwanted intruders to be robbed and attacked.</p> <p> In lesser hands, the story might be milked for its sentiment. But in Mark Dornford-May\u2019s production and under the inspired musical direction of Mandisi Dyantyis and Pauline Malefane, one is struck by the show\u2019s vigour. The 22-strong company play a variety of instruments including marimbas and djembe drums, break out into dance and move easily between solo songs and acappella choruses. Of the four actors who play Asad, Ayanda Tikolo as the mature man and Phielo Makitle as the bright-eyed boy are outstanding, and I can only urge everyone to see a show in which the personal and the political seamlessly combine.</p> <ul> <li><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/a-man-of-good-hope\">Until 12 November</a>.

  "<p>In a year of horrifying and ridiculous happenings, the \u201cscary clown\u201d craze may be the most surreal yet. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/11/killer-clown-craze-uk-sightings-police-warning\">And now it\u2019s hit the UK</a>, because we don\u2019t have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">enough awfulness going on</a> right now. Despite the unsettling name, as far as we know, these clowns have not killed anyone yet. And yet, they\u2019re still scary. Clowns are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/I-Hate-Clowns-92458973095/\">widely recognised as things to be feared</a>. But\u2026 why?</p> <p>In theory, clowns are figures of fun, intended to provoke amusement and laughter with their hijinks, not screams of horror. Big smiley faces, slapstick, party tricks, bright colours; none of these things are typically associated with intense fear. And yet, when combined in the form of a clown, they regularly cause the exact opposite reaction to the one intended. Hence the term \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulrophobia\">coulrophobia</a>\u201d, although this isn\u2019t an officially recognised phobia. That in itself if indicative of how common fear of clowns is; it\u2019s inspired its own diagnosis. </p> <p>The reasons for this have been covered <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/halloween/11194653/Why-are-we-so-scared-of-clowns.html\">several times</a> <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-history-and-psychology-of-clowns-being-scary-20394516/\">in</a> <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/56066-why-people-afraid-of-clowns.html\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/expert-explains-why-youre-scared-of-clowns.html\">places</a>, but it does seem that the whole fear of clowns (meaning <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-history-and-psychology-of-clowns-being-scary-20394516/\">the modern day gaudy face-painted clowns, not the more old-school Jesters and the like</a>) is based on their tendency to set off negative reactions that occur deep within our brains. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a9916e6530fb54de70f374f11c0f1ef0adf1c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a9916e6530fb54de70f374f11c0f1ef0adf1c3/0_452_4016_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"conceptual futuristic female robotA1BY30 conceptual futuristic female robot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t mess around with the face.

Glory / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The \u201cuncanny valley\u201d effect</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s important to remember that clowns are people. People in elaborate costumes, but <a href=\"http://junkee.com/heres-everything-i-learned-at-french-clown-school/49170\">people nonetheless</a>. As a result, they have human bodies and faces, like everyone else. But this is where problems arise. </p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uncanny-valley-why-we-find-human-like-robots-and-dolls-so-creepy-50268\">uncanny valley</a>\u201d effect is a phenomenon whereby things that look human but \u201caren\u2019t quite there\u201d are incredibly unsettling. It appears to be <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8344203.stm\">a fundamental reflex</a>. Slap a pair of googly eyes on a sock and you\u2019ve got yourself a loveable puppet that nobody has any issue with, but a highly-realistic android with an almost-but-not-quite-identical face to that of a real human is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNMbFlsLCkQ\">often very off-putting</a>. Ventriloquist dummies share a similar \u201cscary\u201d reputation to clowns, likely for this reason.</p> <p>One theory is that they make us think of death and corpses (a dead face looks like a normal one but \u201cbehaves\u201d differently) which should be avoided due to danger and risk of illness. But whatever the underlying cause, human faces that deviate from the norm are upsetting.

We (again, subconsciously) glean <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-the-way-you-walk-say-about-you/\">an incredible amount of information just from the way someone walks</a>. Posture, stance, gait, we\u2019re sensitive to all this. Again, clowns throw all this out of whack, with their exaggerated tumbling and oversized shows.

Lion tamers tame lions. Jugglers juggle. Acrobats perform impressive stunts. And clowns clown around. But that last bit isn\u2019t quite as predictable as the others. In a way, the whole point of clowns is that they do things which defy normal behaviour. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578277/\">Unpredictability is something which causes knee-jerk distrust and apprehension in humans</a>. The drunk on public transport, the homeless person yelling in the street, these figures are desperately avoided/ignored by those around them because they clearly aren\u2019t conforming to societal norms, and thus present a possible threat. </p> <p>This is even worse if we\u2019re in a social context, as clowns invariably are. <a href=\"http://www.social-anxiety.org.uk/\">Social anxieties</a> are among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/oct/16/social-anxiety-mundane-terrifying-psychology-stress\">the most common in humans</a>, we genuinely fear being judged and mocked by others, whether we know them or not. Have you ever gone to a comedy gig and actively not sat in the front row? Most people do this, for fear of being spoken to and addressed, possibly ridiculed, by the comedian on stage.</p> <p>A comedian is just a person, but they still prove scary enough in the right context. Lump all the upsetting visual qualities of clowns on top, and you\u2019ve got a genuine and potent fear reaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36612d00a80644dcef434acdcbbdcf7be9277306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36612d00a80644dcef434acdcbbdcf7be9277306/0_173_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A clown points a toy machine gun at another clown during celebrations on the International Day of the Clown in Cancun December 10, 2012.

As he puts it, \u201cMickey Mouse for a 5 year old! Mickey Mouse for a 5 year old is a 6-foot fu**ing rat!\u201d</p> <p>Clowns are, these days, often seen as children\u2019s entertainment, but that may be what perpetuates the fear-filled perception of them. All of the triggers for fearful reactions discussed above are still present when clowns are seen by children, but children, still figuring out the world, likely lack the required experience to explain away what they\u2019re seeing. An adult seeing a clown may think \u201cThese things are creepy, why do guys end up doing this?\u201d, whereas a child may be thinking \u201cWHATISSTHATWHATISTHATAAAAAAAAARGHHH!!!!\u201d</p> <p>Many lasting phobias <a href=\"http://www.phobics-society.org.uk/causes-of-phobias/\">stem from events that occurred during early childhood</a>.

This would be the case if nobody had any prior experience with clowns. Unfortunately, the scary-clown stereotype is so entrenched in our society now that it\u2019s basically the norm. The most famous cultural examples of clowns are mostly scary ones, not fun ones. <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/16/pennywise-costume-stephen-king-it-movie\">Stephen King\u2019s Pennywise</a>, <a href=\"http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/The_Joker\">The Joker</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy\">John Wayne Gacy</a>, a modern clown is more likely to become known for murderousness rather than tomfoolery. </p> <p>Just like Jaws did for sharks or One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest did for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/electroconvulsive-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20014161\">ECT</a>, much of modern media arguably prompts an unwarranted fear of clowns.

But colonialism is intrinsically political and personal \u2013 its roots are buried deep in communities \u2013 so getting our approach to studying it right really matters. </p> <p>How should we use source material from Britain\u2019s colonial past? The language we use, and how we choose to represent things, can help us break away from a narrow-minded view of empire. Colonial history provides the basis for much of today\u2019s inequalities, so it\u2019s only right that we avoid the same assumptions as contemporary imperialists. Too often, empire is presented as some sort of faultless railway-producing machine. We should demand better, more inclusive, more nuanced history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Colonialism created \u200b\u200bnarratives that were far more complex than sources tell us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In my own MA dissertation, on western and local medicine in the African colonies, I wanted to break down the assumption that Africa is a singular \u2013 culturally and politically homogenous. This blanket way of describing Africa is rooted in how British colonialists envisioned the continent, as a playground in which to run experiments. But, actually, each colony varied greatly, in structure, social traditions and religious affiliations, as well as their level of engagement with the empire itself. Africa is not a country, but if you look at colonial sources together, it\u2019s difficult to not come away with that sense of homogeneity. </p> <p>It\u2019s not an old or irrelevant problem either \u2013 this flawed perception continues. Just this month, Boris Johnson mistakenly <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-africa-country-conservative-tory-conference-speech-foreign-secretary-a7341936.html\">referred to Africa as \u201cthat country\u201d</a>. So, as students, how do we avoid falling into this trap?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93b000b73b6eb0461ec74171751d7e02c49c38d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b000b73b6eb0461ec74171751d7e02c49c38d5/532_121_1974_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson referred to Africa as \u201cthat country\u201d in a speech at Conservative Party conference.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson referred to Africa as \u2018that country\u2019 in a speech at Conservative Party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good practice to know the conditions that created certain situations,\u201d says history student Francesco Paolo Cioffo. His research into criminal gangs, known as \u201cthugees\u201d, in colonial India uncovered a stark example of how history can be skewed when sources aren\u2019t approached with scepticism. \u201cColonial sources indicated that empire got rid of the thuggees,\u201d Cioffo explains. \u201cBut now it\u2019s been argued that it was an exaggerated crisis to justify more action in the Raj.\u201d Colonialism created narratives that were far more complex than sources tell us. \u201cWe cannot read a piece of writing and immediately believe it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Of course, primary source materials are central to studying colonialism, but students should try reading as many interpretations of a period as possible when forming an argument. The same goes for other subjects that touch on the issue, whether it\u2019s politics, art, literature, or something else. Don\u2019t accept what might seem the most obvious way forward. Challenging the biases of British colonialism is both academic and current \u2013 consider the present to put things into perspective and get a sense of the longer history. </p> <p>Problematic and racist language is pretty much integral to a lot of colonial sources. Racial hierarchy was one of the pillars of Britain\u2019s empire, so it can\u2019t really be escaped. Yet it can\u2019t simply be dismissed as \u201coutdated\u201d, because racism is, unfortunately, not just a thing of the past. Nor should it be ignored. We should be wary of the more subtle ways it can materialise in source material and also about how it may influence the language in our own work. Even though you can\u2019t change the source, you can change your own language and approach to them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Problematic and\u200b racist language \u200b\u200bis pretty much integral to a lot of colonial sources. It can\u2019t really be escaped</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For some students, studying colonial history is a personal political matter. Fatima Rajina, a PhD student studying British Bangladeshi Muslims, says she \u201cbecame fed up of hearing white academics studying south Asian communities.\u201d She explains: \u201cVery rarely did we hear narratives collected by an \u2018insider\u2019. I felt it is time insiders are also given the opportunity to share insights available to them; to collect narratives and share them. It\u2019s important that not only do we challenge history but also play a part in knowledge production, which has been almost exclusively produced by white folks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44bee9effe8a658180e0465b39629d90b9fe2a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44bee9effe8a658180e0465b39629d90b9fe2a0c/0_0_2875_3860/745.jpg\" alt=\"1892 Punch cartoon depicting British colonialist Cecil Rhodes striding across Africa, \u201cfrom Cape Town to Cairo\u201d, with a telegraph wire.\" width=\"745\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Punch cartoon from 1892 depicting British colonialist Cecil Rhodes striding across Africa, \u2018from Cape Town to Cairo\u2019, with a telegraph wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In my own studies, I\u2019ve researched the Indian Partition, in part to understand some of the divisions which still haunt my community. However, if I hadn\u2019t had personal access to the sources myself, I could have very easily believed that religion was the sole cause of division. In reality, Britain\u2019s failure at the close of imperial India to mediate a border that worked between the various factions and to consider local tensions has contributed to persistent issues. A more narrow-minded view might blame the communities themselves, like we see in some colonial material. So when the limitations of colonial sources filter down into public life, it\u2019s even more important that source material is properly interrogated and discussed. </p> <p>But breaking away from a narrow-minded Eurocentric vision of history is not just about scrutinising sources; universities should also encourage more world history. The empire brought Brits into contact with people all over the world and created a myriad of relationships. A Eurocentric education doesn\u2019t reflect the world we live in. More needs to be done to address the country\u2019s global past, because it filters through to so many present issues to do with race, wealth and power. And if students are not exposed to colonial source material (or material from other parts of the world), it it could be harder to challenge biases and recognise where they come from.</p> <p>This is not about apologism; it\u2019s about understanding the broader picture and our responsibility to portray Britain\u2019s colonial history in full. We need to make more of an effort to challenge and avoid the pitfalls of past narratives, which are deeply intertwined with the present, and challenge our own biases.<br></p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",

The Kurds form the world\u2019s largest stateless population. While those in Iran and Turkey continue to exist under hostile regimes, Iraqi Kurds enjoy a degree of self-rule \u2013 and now court the west by carrying out successful operations against Isis. For many of them, full independence feels imminent. Syria\u2019s catastrophe has helped the country\u2019s Kurdish population (long persecuted under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">Assad</a> regime) to carve out their own pseudo-state in the north.</p> <p>Kanabi wants his homeland to have a place at the UN, as well as Fifa recognition. \u201cWe take part because there is no other door open for us,\u201d he says at his desk. \u201cWe have made an impact throughout the world and have many legitimate institutions. We are denied opportunities. For years, we have been oppressed.\u201d Raising his voice, he adds: \u201cThe refrain of Fifa, which we\u2019ve heard from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/sepp-blatter\">Blatter</a> and his ilk: \u2018Football is for everyone.\u2019 It is for everyone \u2013 apart from the Kurds.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Over the next two months the team will train at the nearby Handren stadium in Irbil, returning to see their families in the suburbs at the weekend. On a muggy, overcast May morning, Khaled Musher, 38, defender and team captain, is travelling from Irbil to his ancestral village for the first time in weeks. It is on the road to Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city, held by Isis since June 2014 and now the target of an offensive by pro-government forces and the peshmerga, the armed forces of Iraqi Kurdistan. As Irbil disappears into the distance, military checkpoints and arid scrubland open on to rolling hills ringed by mountain silhouettes. Musher points to a lone peak a short drive away. \u201cBehind that is Mosul,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Musher fits the footballer stereotype \u2013 rich and narcissistic. The youngest of nine brothers and six sisters, he was his late father\u2019s favourite son. Handsome and well-groomed, wearing designer jeans and a fake Armani T-shirt, Musher spends the car journey glued to Facebook on his phone and making hushed calls to friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6575bc105acccae0547a8e3e493ddc119dafc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6575bc105acccae0547a8e3e493ddc119dafc6/0_0_1346_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurdistan football team captain Khaled Musher, holding a football\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdistan captain Khaled Musher.

Musher sits next to his brother as Agha takes centre stage. \u201cOur father loved Khaled a lot. Khaled was, as they say, \u2018the last grape of the bunch\u2019. Our father didn\u2019t pressure him to study, which is unfortunate. But maybe that was Khaled\u2019s fate: he loves football more than his life,\u201d Agha says.</p> <p>Surrounded by elders, Agha is clad in a traditional turban and baggy trousers, with a dagger tucked into a large sash at the waist. The men chat among themselves, their wives and sisters hidden away in the kitchen. Inside the house a television set in the corner shows chaotic scenes in Baghdad where protesters have stormed the city\u2019s fortified green zone and overrun parliament. Several of Musher\u2019s brothers, cousins and uncles are directly engaged in the fight against Isis, on the frontlines and in command posts. \u201cThe situation is very frightening,\u201d he says. \u201cYour heart isn\u2019t at ease \u2013 they are there and we are here. War can change in an instant. God forbid something could happen. But if we\u2019re needed, we will join them.\u201d</p> <p>The Kurds\u2019 hopes for independence are fuel for Musher. \u201cBecause we live in a really bad situation here and have been oppressed all our lives, our dream today is very big. Our dream is to become an independent state.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"050aa2d6063dbe7fff28d3f26913ef22083c9b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/050aa2d6063dbe7fff28d3f26913ef22083c9b25/0_0_3745_2497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurdistan players in the opening match of the alternative World Cup, against Sz\u00e9kely Land\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdistan beating Sz\u00e9kely Land in the opening match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the team live closer to the stadium, including Musher\u2019s vice-captain, Sarhank Mohsin, 29. He is the squad\u2019s hulking, warrior-like goalkeeper. Over lunch at his spacious home in an upmarket Irbil neighbourhood, he talks about his sadness at being unable to play in Fifa. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve wanted to go to the World Cup and wrap my country\u2019s flag around my shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>A natural leader, Mohsin is one of the most engaging and impressive members of the team. When he was three, his father was conscripted by Iraq\u2019s armed forces to fight against Iran, but was captured and spent more than a decade in a Tehrani prison, mistreated and tortured.</p> <p>Mohsin gave up his studies to help his mother support his siblings. \u201cWhen I started as a goalkeeper, my mother would sew gloves for me with material from wetsuits. I would add an Adidas, Nike or Eurosport logo,\u201d he says, showing us his mother\u2019s old sewing machine in his sitting room. \u201cMy mother put aside her life, her interests. In our darkest times, she would walk long distances just to bring us something to eat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f644b262a0b455d56aa3e342c50c86120480b104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f644b262a0b455d56aa3e342c50c86120480b104/52_76_1161_1019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Kurdistan region\" width=\"1000\" height=\"878\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kurds form the world\u2019s largest stateless population</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, word reached Mohsin that his father had returned. He rushed home to find a crowd of neighbours, threw himself at his father and kissed him. The man remained impassive: \u201cHe didn\u2019t know I was his son, so I just sat next to him.\u201d His father eventually realised and turned to hug him, tears streaming down his face. \u201cHe had changed a lot,\u201d Mohsin says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the same bright eyes.\u201d These experiences made him a better team member, he says: \u201cSince my childhood, I have been instilled with the mindset that I can shoulder responsibility and lead people.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time for training. Mohsin changes into his kit, kisses his two toddler daughters on the head and says goodbye to his wife. Turning up some kitsch pop music, he pulls out of the neighbourhood in his white, soft-top Ford Mustang and speeds down a baking-hot highway towards the training grounds on the other side of the city.</p> <p>By 4pm, all the players have arrived \u2013 mostly in big, brash SUVs. The stadium is a somewhat dejected sports complex with broken plastic chairs in the stands and smashed windows at the rear. But the turf is green and healthy, jarringly at odds with the surrounding dusty streets and industrial estate. The men warm up with a game halfway between volleyball and football before they gather round the coach, Khasraw Gurun. The 54-year-old former player commands their respect, his stern face belying a quick wit and paternal warmth. As a young man he was forcibly conscripted under Saddam Hussein, and tortured for playing football while absent without leave.</p> <p>He watches as the players split into groups to work on specific skills: dribbling, tackling, headers. The nearby battlefront is the \u201cbest psychological motivation\u201d for the players, Gurun explains. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018The peshmerga are fighting out there so you need to perform on the field.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cd7d872e1f6a33816ceca44e35c8e38f30f9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cd7d872e1f6a33816ceca44e35c8e38f30f9b9/0_0_1381_1177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarhank Mohsin, goalkeeper and vice-captain of the Kurdistan football team, training in Irbil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdistan goalkeeper/vice-captain Sarhank Mohsin.

He is in the unusual position of playing for two \u201cnational\u201d teams: Iraq, his officially recognised nation, and Kurdistan, his semi-autonomous homeland. He and other Kurdish players on the Iraq team say they have faced discrimination when playing for the Arab-dominated Iraqi side and that they are too often left on the sidelines. \u201cOur relationship with the Iraq team is not good. There\u2019s no balance, they neglect Kurdish players,\u201d Gurun says. \u201cIraq\u2019s rulers don\u2019t want to recognise Kurdistan as a separate region.\u201d</p> <p>The training session for the Kurdistan team ends with a friendly game of around 30 minutes and at 6pm, practice is over. They head back to their hotel rooms or, if local, their homes. Later they reconvene in Iskan Street in the city centre \u2013 the hub of Irbil\u2019s conservative nightlife.

The men\u2019s confidence is high and their camaraderie strong. But cliques emerge, largely formed along provincial lines. Those from Duhok who speak the Kurdish Badini dialect stick together; those from Irbil do not mingle with players from Sulaymaniyah or Kirkuk. Regional divisions run deep, broadly splitting the north-west, which backs the ruling <a href=\"http://www.kdp.se/\">Kurdistan Democratic Party </a>(KDP), from the south-eastern strongholds of the <a href=\"http://www.pukpb.org/english/\">Patriotic Union of Kurdistan</a> (PUK).</p> <p>There are many who even believe Iraq itself no longer qualifies as a true nation-state, riven as it is by conflict, sectarian divide and competing areas controlled by Baghdad, Irbil and Isis. \u201cIt is obvious to all of us that Iraq is a made-up country,\u201d says Mohsin, the goalkeeper, dismissively.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The day of departure for the tournament arrives. Following a scuffle of selfies on the runway at Irbil, the players board the charter flight. In an act of lighthearted subversion, one tapes the Kurdistan flag on to the outside of the Fly Baghdad aircraft.</p> <p>At the front sits coach Gurun. He was once a midfielder for the main club in Sulaymaniyah, then a hotbed of Kurdish resistance against Saddam. \u201cIf there was a game in our stadium, his troops would come and end it,\u201d he says.

Football gives you two hours of happiness. People don\u2019t care what political party you belong to or which religion you are. Football unites all people.\u201d</p> <p>On the flight, the players peer out over a hot, unforgiving desert. Within an hour, the Iraqi Kurdistan delegation touches down in Sochi, southern Russia, to board a bus for Sukhumi, the sleepy capital of Abkhazia. After a slow, tedious wait at the de facto border (one guard tells me it is the first time he has ever seen an Iraqi passport, let alone 43) the team travels past snow-capped mountains, swaths of lush green forest and the overgrown ruins of a past, forgotten conflict.</p> <p>Abkhazia was once a balmy, palm-fringed resort for the Soviet elite and remains a distinct cultural region within the Caucasus. Georgia, the Ottomans, the Russian Empire and the Soviets have all claimed it as their own. Few countries recognise the independence of this obscure yet beautiful statelet, which is propped up by Moscow, loyal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>, and home to 240,000 people.</p> <p>For the next week, the Kurds are based at hotel Aitar, a shabby, Soviet-era complex on Sukhumi\u2019s southern outskirts, alongside other teams and bewildered groups of Russian tourists. The morning after the team arrive, they wake to see the Koreans performing tai chi beneath the conifers and palms. Later the Western Armenia squad descend on the courtyard, with speakers blaring French hip-hop and Armenian folk, as they link arms and dance around the fountain. The younger Chagossians flirt with the local girls assigned to steward the teams; the Kurds retire to their rooms, glued to Facebook and Instagram in between turning towards Mecca for their daily prayers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"542da7baaacff6bf3d0b0f8e4d231cc68c22fa8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/542da7baaacff6bf3d0b0f8e4d231cc68c22fa8e/0_313_4699_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals on the beach at Gagra, Abkhazia, who charge tourists to be photographed with animals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the beach at Gagra, locals charge tourists to be photographed with animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 12 teams are largely amateur, yet they represent tens of millions of stateless people across three continents. For many, the tournament is a podium from which to present themselves to the world. Compared with the global behemoth of Fifa, the turnover of the <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/\">Confederation of Independent Football Associations</a> (Conifa) makes it a minnow. Set up by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conifapresident\">Per-Anders Blind</a>, a reindeer rancher and former referee from Sweden, and <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/dt_team/030-sascha-duerkop/\">Sascha D\u00fcerkop</a>, a German doctoral student in mathematics, it is a non-government organisation that raises funds from annual membership fees, donations (around \u00a372,000 since its foundation), sponsorship (approximately \u00a3900 per year) and pay-per-view online streaming. Headquartered in Lule\u00e5, a remote coastal town in northern Sweden, the confederation states that its objectives are to strengthen people and identity, respect differences, and contribute to world peace.</p> <p>Conifa still manages to rattle some cages. The organisation\u2019s decision to hold the tournament in Abkhazia has angered Georgia, which regards the former as its de jure territory. The competition\u2019s operational costs were shouldered by Abkhazia which, given the territory\u2019s status as a client state of Russia, means that Moscow money is likely to have subsidised the jamboree. Meanwhile, the Isle of Man has been forced to withdraw as the UK government advises against travel to Abkhazia; and the side representing <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/romani-people/\">Romani</a> people had to pull out due to \u201cunexpected issues with the travel documents\u201d, according to D\u00fcerkop. Eyebrows were raised by the recent addition of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, two separatist enclaves at the centre of Russia\u2019s grinding conflict against Ukraine and regularly accused of appalling human rights abuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a817ae7b73e4a3b9407fbe6fde24727e89c49c89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a817ae7b73e4a3b9407fbe6fde24727e89c49c89/0_0_5461_3641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somaliland football team players in Abkhazia  for the alternative World Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somaliland players relaxing in Abkhazia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Avdeev</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Sukhumi, a few hours before the opening ceremony, Blind, Conifa\u2019s softly-spoken president (and himself a member of the Sami ethnic group), is addressing a small gathering of local and foreign press. \u201cConifa doesn\u2019t care about politics. Our mission is to show the world that even if we come from different cultures and different histories, we are one people on this planet,\u201d Blind says. \u201cPoliticians are trying to build borders between people. Our mission is to tear these down. From my point of view, Conifa is a peace project.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>On a warm, clear night in late May, the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony at the 4,300-seat Dinamo stadium starts: a vibrant, near-psychedelic trip of whirling dancers, singing, drumming and a mock battle between armour-clad soldiers. Each team parades around the pitch, proudly bearing their flags to the applauding crowd; it\u2019s a surreal, joyous occasion that offers a semblance of statehood. The stands are packed with locals.</p> <p>Over the coming days, Kurdistan\u2019s matches take place at Dinamo\u2019s modern arena near the burned-out shell of a towering government building, gutted during the fall of Sukhumi in 1993. While evening matches draw the biggest crowds, the Kurds\u2019 games take place in the afternoon before a thin throng of locals, from veterans of the region\u2019s wars throughout the 90s to packs of teenagers on the hunt for selfies with foreign players.</p> <p>Just above the team\u2019s dugout, a small, diehard core of Kurdish supporters invoke the spirit of the peshmerga to rally the Kurdistan team to victory, shouting, \u201cYalla peshmerga! Yalla sherakan!\u201d (\u201cGo peshmerga! Go lions!\u201d) Kurdistan land comfortable 3-0 wins against United Koreans in Japan and <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/szekely-land/\">Sz\u00e9kley Land</a> (a Hungarian-speaking enclave of Romania). After each game, they return to the hotel by bus, belting out peshmerga victory songs.</p> <p>But the quarter-final against <a href=\"http://www.conifa.org/en/members/padania/\">Padania</a> ratchets up the pressure. Kurdistan have lost to them before and are anxious about the rematch. These Italians, from a northern area with a latent independent movement, outsize the Kurds, with a cocksure air and a \u201cnational anthem\u201d of head-banging punk rock. (They qualified after the Romani side developed its visa issues.) The match goes to penalties. One Kurd misses a crucial strike, an Italian slots in the ball with ease, and a devastated Kurdistan team retires to the locker room. Their tournament is over.</p> <p>Several days later, Abkhazia and Panjab meet in the dramatic final. The stadium is teeming, packed beyond capacity, spectators scrambling up its outer walls to steal a view. The game goes to extra time, then another nerve-racking penalty shootout. Abkhazia score the championship\u2019s winning goal. The delirious home fans burst on to the pitch and raise their local heroes above their shoulders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb52300ee3589878975e117dedba6589b22871d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb52300ee3589878975e117dedba6589b22871d/0_0_4000_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abkhazia football team\u2019s Shabat Logua celebrates his team\u2019s victory over Panjab in the alternative World Cup final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"495\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abkhazia\u2019s Shabat Logua celebrates his team\u2019s victory over Panjab in the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Kiehart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The night after the final, Kanabi, the president of the KFA, gathers the dejected delegation at the hotel. He offers neither sympathy nor platitudes. Instead, the scowling boss unleashes a barrage of blame, highlighting faultlines in the squad and, in turn, Kurdistan itself. \u201cIf you\u2019re from Duhok, Kalar, Zakho, Irbil, please don\u2019t say, \u2018This player scored\u2019 or, \u2018That player didn\u2019t score,\u2019\u201d he orders the footballers, some of whom have already vented frustrations against team-mates on social media. The tirade lasts more than 30 minutes as the players sit in a sullen, awkward silence. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed, aren\u2019t you embarrassed? How will you face people when you go home?\u201d he thunders. \u201cYou come in the name of a country where people are fighting and dying, and you play like this? Inshallah, for the sake of Prophet Muhammad, I hope you\u2019ll never wear a football kit again.\u201d<br></p> <p>Mohsin, the goalie, addresses the team in a more constructive tone. \u201cIf we analyse why we failed, we\u2019ll learn how to succeed.\u201d He concludes with an image that is as much about Kurdish society as it is their team. \u201cIf we liken a club to a wooden boat, the planks are the players. If there\u2019s no unity, and there are gaps between the players, water will flood in and we all will sink.\u201d</p> <p>The flight back to Irbil is a sober affair.</p> <p>The tournament is lost, the team humiliated. Soon, they will be disbanded. Gurun will lose his job, and Kanabi will hand in a letter of resignation (which KFA executives will refuse to accept). But Conifa has allowed them to wrap their flag around their shoulders at a World Cup, and to see life beyond a homeland whose edges have unravelled with war. The team remain blindly optimistic about independence, but evidence points otherwise: Iraqi Kurdistan\u2019s political elite are as factional as the football team.</p> <p>When the plane lands, the team keep their goodbyes brief, splinter into smaller cliques and return to their families dispersed across their nationless homeland. Mohsin, reunited with his wife and two little girls, is in reflective mood: \u201cI am like a fish in a pond who thinks that the entire world is that pond. But when it is put in the sea, it realises there is a whole world out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/oct/14/desert-fire-the-world-cup-rebels-of-kurdistan-video\">Watch Desert Fire, a new Guardian documentary about the Kurdistan team by Sebastien Rabas and Jack Losh</a></p>",
  "<p>Look back at the history of glam rock, and you keep running into things that seem like premonitions \u2013 previews of the scary and dangerous man running for the American presidency right now. In his mid-1970s interviews, David Bowie talked about \u201ca strong leader\u201d destined to \u201csweep through\u201d the western world: a charismatic superhero who might emerge not from conventional politics but from entertainment. Sometimes Bowie\u2019s tone was ominous. At others, he\u2019d make it seem like a necessary corrective to a Weimar-style state of decadence, talking with seemingly approving anticipation of \u201ca rightwing, totally dictatorial tyranny\u201d that would clean up all the mess made by the permissive society.</p> <p>At his most extreme, unguarded and&#xa0;cocaine-addled, Bowie proposed himself as a candidate for the job, whether as British PM, as the \u201cfirst English president of the United States\u201d, or maybe even as ruler of the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/07/shock-awe-glam-rock-legacy-simon-reynolds-review\">Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy by Simon Reynolds \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another future-spectre of Trump was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/28/1\" title=\"\"> Alice Cooper\u2019s pretend run for the presidency in 1972</a>.

What does Trump have in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/12/david-bowie-ziggy-stardust-interview\" title=\"\">Ziggy Stardust</a>, apart from orange hair? The Donald is a bigot, a macho bully, a philistine, a proud ignoramus. Bowie and the brightest of his peers were androgynous aesthetes, intellectually hungry and sexually experimental.</p> <p>And yet there are some unlikely affinities, as I discovered while researching <em>Shock and Awe</em>, my history of glam. As signalled by his gilded tower on Fifth Avenue, Trump surrounds himself with glitz. Trump and the glam rockers share an obsession with fame and a ruthless drive to conquer and devour the world\u2019s attention. Trump actually plays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/queen-protests-donald-trumps-we-are-the-champions-song\" title=\"\">\u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d by Queen </a>(a band aligned with glam in its early days) at his rallies, because its triumphalist refrain \u2013 \u201cno time for losers\u201d \u2013 crystallises his economic Darwinist worldview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32d7531aab562bd9cdd48198f13ecc6db8a5b62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d7531aab562bd9cdd48198f13ecc6db8a5b62d/0_787_3232_4040/800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump plays Queen\u2019s \u2018We Are the Champions\u2019 at his campaign rallies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilpo Musto/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A mirror of oligopoly capitalism, pop is a ferociously competitive game that sorts the contestants into a handful of winners and a great mass of losers. Propelled by a stardom-at-all-costs drive, many of glam rock\u2019s principal characters nimbly reinvented themselves and in some cases trampled others on their way up. They willed their fantasy selves into existence. This same ethos of \u201cDon\u2019t dream it, be it\u201d (as articulated by <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>\u2019s Dr Frank N Furter) could be seen in the type of fandom that glam inspired. It had an imitative quality never really seen before in pop: audiences dressing up, copying the hair and makeup. Roxy Music\u2019s fans, responding to the sophistication of the group\u2019s image and&#xa0;artwork, to audience flattering lyrical winks such as \u201csure to make the cognoscenti think\u201d \u2013 costumed themselves as members of a make-believe aristocracy. Bryan Ferry recalled how some would turn up to the shows in full black tie, as if attending an Oscars ceremony.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeal is generally seen in terms of his doom-laden imagery of a weakened, rudderless America. But there is something else going on too: an admiring projection towards a swaggering figure who revels in his wealth, free to do and say whatever he wants. Trump is an aspirational figure as much as a mouthpiece for resentment and rancour.</p> <p>\u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/21/donald-trumps-lawyers-demand-art-of-the-deal-co-writer-pay-back-royalties\" title=\"\">Trump wrote in <em>The Art of the Deal</em>,</a> explaining the role of bravado in his business dealings. \u201cPeople may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\u201d He and co-writer Tony Schwarz coined the concept \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d. That sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it cuts to the essence of how hype works: by making people believe in something that doesn\u2019t exist yet, it magically turns a lie into a reality. As the saying goes, fake it till you make it. Bowie\u2019s manager Tony Defries used this technique to break the singer in the US:&#xa0;travelling everywhere by limo, surrounded by bodyguards he didn\u2019t need, Bowie looked like the star he wasn\u2019t, until the public and the media started to take the illusion for reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump and his co-writer Tony Schwarz coined the concept 'truthful hyperbole'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Early in his career, Trump grasped that \u2013 like a pop star \u2013 he was selling an image, a brand. Licensed out, the Trump name gets affixed to buildings and businesses that he doesn\u2019t own, let alone run. He\u2019s an extreme version of what people on Wall Street call a \u201cglamour stock\u201d: an investment that outperforms the market based on an inflated belief in its growth potential or&#xa0;on even more intangible qualities of&#xa0;cool and buzz. Twitter has been described as the ultimate glamour stock, its attractive image vastly out of whack with its ability to make money. A glamour stock will keep on winning right up until it loses \u2013 when the gulf between its perceived value and actual wealth-generative potential gets too huge, when reality finally disrupts the reality distortion field surrounding it.</p> <p>Self-reinvention was the strategy used by glam stars such as Bowie and Marc Bolan. You can see the same chameleon-like flexibility at work in Trump\u2019s career. Once upon a time he was a Democrat, on genial terms with the Clintons. Years ago he used birtherism as the launch pad for a political career; now he\u2019s dropped it, as&#xa0;a political liability. It\u2019s the same with his recent rabble-rousing rhetoric about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\" title=\"\">\u201cbuilding a wall\u201d</a>. Conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer analyses the agility with which Trump evades attacks by discarding ideas: \u201cHe merely creates new Trumps.\u201d Bowie conjured up new personas to stay one step ahead of&#xa0;pop\u2019s fickle fluctuations and keep himself creatively stimulated. With no&#xa0;fixed political principles, Trump\u2019s only consistency is salesmanship and showmanship: the ability to stage his public life as a drama.</p> <p>And it\u2019s the drama that holds the public\u2019s attention \u2013 the edgy promise of a less boring politics. The New York Times recently quoted a voter who confessed to flirting with the idea of voting for Trump because \u201ca dark side of me wants to see what happens\u2026 There is going to be some&#xa0;kind of change, and even if it\u2019s like a Nazi-type change, people are so drama-filled. They want to see stuff like that happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>Emerging after the earnest, authenticity-obsessed late 60s, glam was a period in which rock rediscovered a sense of showbiz and spectacle. Pop history has repeatedly cycled through such phases of glam and anti-glam: Bowie/Roxy razzle-dazzle was supplanted by scruffy pub rock and street-credible punk, which in turn was eclipsed by the neo-glam of the new romantics. A&#xa0;similar shift occurred in America when glitzy hair metal was displaced by grunge\u2019s mud-slide sound and earth-toned clothes.</p> <p>You can see similar dynamics at play&#xa0;in today\u2019s politics. Hillary Clinton sits squarely in the unglam corner: a&#xa0;worthy but dull public servant, supremely accomplished at everything required of a leader except&#xa0;what the public perversely craves \u2013 being an entertainer. She\u2019s a&#xa0;\u201cvalue stock\u201d \u2013 one&#xa0;of those companies that over time doggedly outperform the glamour stocks, but simply don\u2019t inspire spasms of irrational exuberance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a95df4dd34ee078cb93e112cfb618c1c9613a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a95df4dd34ee078cb93e112cfb618c1c9613a67/697_548_1292_1616/800.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I\u2019m not a personality.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I\u2019m not a personality.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The real anti-glam leader of our age, though, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/11/jeremy-corbyn-parliamentary-beard-of-the-year-victory\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn.

Corbyn tried to change the format and feel of prime minister\u2019s questions, saying he wished to \u201cremove the theatre from politics\u201d. In one&#xa0;particular PMQs, he responded to Cameron\u2019s slick pre-scripted gags with&#xa0;the schoolmasterly reprimand: \u201cI&#xa0;invite the prime minister to leave the&#xa0;theatre and return to reality.\u201d</p> <p>As for oratory, Corbyn seems instinctively averse to all those elements of spoken language \u2013 cadence, musicality, metaphor \u2013 that sway the listener irrationally. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\" title=\"\">as Gary Younge argued recently</a>, his plain-spoken delivery is taken as a token of sincerity by his followers, who \u201chave not come to be entertained; they have come \u2026 to have a basic sense of decency reflected back to them through their politics\u201d. This is how a&#xa0;personality cult has built up around him, despite his honest and accurate admission: \u201cI\u2019m not a personality.\u201d It\u2019s&#xa0;very indie, very alternative rock, the way that the absence of charisma has become the source of a curious magnetism.</p> <p>Once in a blue moon, a politician comes along who combines pop star allure and all the less glamorous qualifications such as temperament, competence and knowledge. Barack Obama has both kinds of cool going for him: perfect comic timing at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, calmness and clarity during moments of Oval Office crisis.</p> <p>Politics without any element of charisma is certainly a dry affair. But the cult of personality can be dangerous outside the realm of showbiz, its proper domain.</p> <p>\u201cI could see how easy it was to get a&#xa0;whole rally thing going,\u201d Bowie said in 1974, recalling the height of Ziggymania in Britain a few years earlier. \u201cThere were times when I&#xa0;could&#xa0;have told the audience to do anything.\u201d In another interview of that era, Bowie spoke of the way Hitler \u201cstaged a&#xa0;country\u201d, combining \u201cpolitics and theatrics\u201d to create the ultimate spectacle. \u201cBoy, when he hit that stage, he worked an audience \u2026 [Hitler] created this thing that governed and controlled the show for those 12 years.

  "<p><a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1\">A new study</a> has just appeared in the <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/toc/clim/current\">Journal of Climate</a> which deals with an issue commonly raised by those who deny that human-caused climate change is a serious risk. As I have written many times, we know humans are causing the Earth\u2019s climate to change. We know this for many reasons. <br></p> <p>First, we know that certain gases trap heat; this fact is indisputable. Second, we know that humans have significantly increased the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Again, this is indisputable. Third, we know the Earth is warming (again indisputable). We know the Earth warms because we are actually measuring the warming rate in multiple different ways. Those measurements are in good agreement with each other.</p> <p>Of course there is other evidence too. For instance, ice loss across the globe is widespread: in the Arctic, the Antarctic ice shelves, Greenland, and from land glaciers. Sea levels are rising as warm water expands in volume and as melt waters flow into the ocean. We are also seeing changes of weather patterns and climatic zones shift. The point is, there is a whole body of evidence that proves the climate is changing and the change is caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Over the years, contrarians have looked for evidence that the climate either isn\u2019t changing or the change is not as fast as predicted. Their findings have often been used in the media to suggest that human-caused climate change was not something to worry about. But we\u2019ve seen, over and over and over again, that these contrarian arguments don\u2019t hold up. <br></p> <p>Repeatedly, mainstream scientists have taken these claims seriously and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/apr/11/climate-change-research-quality-imbalance\">discovered they were just plain wrong</a>. In some cases, the contrarians have made simple arithmetic errors (like mixing up a negative and positive sign in their equations), while in others, they have made more fundamental errors. But regardless, they have been wrong time after time. But whenever they are found to be wrong, they just go and find some new piece of evidence that once again calls into doubt our understanding of the human-climate link. <br></p> <p>One contrarian argument has appeared repeatedly over the past few years, even at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce</a> held by Ted Cruz in 2015. The claim was by well-known contrarian <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/John_Christy_blog.htm\">John Christy</a>. Christy claimed that the mid-troposphere temperatures (temperatures in approximately the middle of the atmosphere) are rising three times faster in climate models when compared with measurements. Another related claim is that there has been no statistically significant warming in the troposphere (lower part of the atmosphere) for 18 years. <br></p> <p>Now, both of these facts, even if they were true, would not prove much. We know the Earth is warming because of measurements in oceans, underground, and at the Earth\u2019s surface. But it would open a question as to why the atmosphere is behaving differently.</p> <p>The recent paper just published looked at these two claims. The authors found errors in the analysis that, when corrected, debunked the contrarian claims. Let me explain some of the science. </p> <p>First, these atmospheric temperatures are measured by satellites which can \u201csee\u201d the temperature of gases in the atmosphere. It works differently from a thermometer but regardless, such measurements are possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/18/ted-cruz-fact-check-which-temperature-data-are-the-best\">These measurements have a lot of uncertainty</a>. <br></p> <p>First of all, as the Earth warms from greenhouse gases, the upper part of the atmosphere should cool down. A simplistic but appropriate description is that greenhouse gases hold the heat down toward the Earth, making the upper atmosphere cooler. Since the satellites see both the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere, the cooling upper region may contaminate the measurements of the warming lower part of the atmosphere.</p> <p>A second source of uncertainty is that the satellites themselves are not perfect. When satellites are launched, they orbit the Earth for a number of years until they are replaced by new satellites. The data, which goes back to 1979, is actually stitched together from multiple satellites in sequence. No two satellites are completely identical \u2013 sort of like no two thermometers will give exactly the same temperature. These differences have to be rectified and are another source of error.</p> <p>Additionally, the satellites change while they are in orbit, in particular they lose altitude and their orbiting time drifts (the time they pass certain global locations drifts later and later in the day). Both of these facts contaminate the measurements and must be accounted for. There are other accuracy issues as well that space doesn\u2019t permit discussion, but you get the point.</p> <p>So, this recent paper did a few things. First, they took the contrarian argument that the mid-troposphere temperatures have been rising at only 1/3 the rate predicted by models. They found that Christy\u2019s team neglected the contamination of the cooling in the upper stratosphere. When they applied this correction, they found that Christy\u2019s claim was incorrect. Differences between modeled and observed warming rates were much smaller, and had known explanations. <br></p> <p>Next, the authors asked whether it is true that there has been no warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) in the past 18 years. They found that for five of the six groups that provide satellite temperature analysis, this claim was also incorrect.</p> <p>Finally, they asked whether it is true that the temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are in disagreement in models and measurements. Their result is that when temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are compared, one of three satellite records is in close agreement with the climate models. <br></p> <p>While this paper largely debunks the most current contrarian mainstay, it doesn\u2019t answer all of our questions. For instance, exactly how accurate are these satellite measurements and how can they be made better? Do the models capture all of the thermal processes which are occurring, especially in the middle and upper layer of the atmosphere? Why does there appear to be a small difference in the satellites and the model predictions in the middle of the atmosphere? Is this difference important? </p> <p>These questions can be answered, but a prerequisite is a continuation of high-quality data from satellites. This means a continued commitment to launching new measurement satellites as the current fleet ages.</p>",

After years of only being put forward for stereotyped roles, I got out of the industry. It wasn\u2019t enough for me to be paid as an actor, but lose my soul in the doing. After that, I managed to land a highly sought-after place at the National Film and Television School as a screenwriter, intent on trying to make the changes at script level.

Inside one was a puzzling artifact of a Maya dynasty that archaeologists call the snake kings, after the snakehead emblem of their house \u2013 a family that ruled 100 miles to the north, far from the tombs found in Holmul.</p> <p>One tomb is a vaulted chamber, built into a pyramid that was constructed to surround an older, fifth-century building. Inside was the skeleton of a middle-aged person whose teeth had jade inlays, a custom of Maya royalty, and an inscribed human tibia, \u201ca very, very rare find\u201d, archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli told the Guardian. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt could be from an ancestor or captive of war,\u201d he said, though the researchers will have to wait for an epigrapher with scanning equipment to read the badly eroded text. </p> <p>In Tikal, another site in Guatemala, researchers have previously found a similar carved bone that bore the name and image of a captured warrior, said Rosemary Joyce, an anthropologist at UC Berkeley who was not involved in the excavation. She cautioned that the bones would need examination by a physical anthropologist before their confirmation as human: \u201cWhen you take a human femur and cut the ends off, deer bone can look like that.\u201d</p> <p>A carved frieze near the tomb depicts five rulers, but the person in the tomb is probably not one of them, Estrada-Belli said, because ceramics found in the tomb suggest the person lived long after those kings.

The inscription on the necklace, which holds a carved cormorant\u2019s head that morphs into the image of a sun god, is unusual because it belongs to a king from an entirely different city: \u201cYuknoom Ti\u2019 Chan, Holy king of Kaanul.\u201d The king was a member of the snake dynasty, 100 miles from their ancient capital of Dzibanche, which stands in modern Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks a lot like Game of Thrones or medieval Europe,\u201d Estrada-Belli said. The snake kings stretched their influence far to the south of that city, and warred with Tikal for power over smaller kingdoms such as Holmul, Naranjo and Xunantunich. \u201cIt\u2019s all being debated, but this jewel tells us that the dynasty\u2019s relationships were quite pervasive, and even a secondary kingdom like Holmul could have a direct relationship with the overlord.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e984f183f103b42e834520759c465316dc82569d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e984f183f103b42e834520759c465316dc82569d/0_0_2443_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vista idealizada de Holmul en la fase final del period Clasico (diseno de J.

During Ban\u2019s 10-year tenure, conflict has forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/20/one-in-every-113-people-uprooted-war-persecution-says-un-refugee-agency\">record numbers of people to flee their homes</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/what-has-the-un-achieved-united-nations\">UN\u2019s overall spend has nearly doubled, to more than \u00a342bn</a>. The UN security council has been heavily criticised for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/24/angelina-jolie-un-security-council-syria-refugees\">perceived failure to protect civilians in Syria</a>, and has been accused of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/un-gross-failure-sexual-abuse-french-troops-central-african-republic\">\u201dgross failure\u201d to address abuse allegations</a> against its own peacekeepers.

Below is a selection of the best responses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/10/first-generation-ends-poverty-ban-ki-moon-development-finance-addis-ababa\">'We can be the first generation that ends poverty'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>He made the UN more inclusive</h2> <p>For me, Ban Ki-moon\u2019s biggest accomplishments and legacy are his strengthening of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/07/un-to-recognise-gay-marriages-staffers\">civil society within the UN system</a>, in particular of youth activists, LGBT advocates and women. Meaningful representation of young people, beyond the photo ops, still leaves much to be desired within the system. But during Ban\u2019s term important steps were accomplished, such as establishing the position of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/youthenvoy/\">UN secretary general\u2019s envoy on youth</a>, and security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc12149.doc.htm\">resolution 2250</a> on youth, peace and security. </p> <p>What impressed me the most was hearing Ban speak in his home country during the <a href=\"http://outreach.un.org/ngorelations/conference/\">66th UN Department of Public Information/NGO conference</a>, in Gyeongju in South Korea. He was not afraid to address controversial societal issues such as LGBT rights, which he said he wanted to be part of his legacy along with youth empowerment. While he might have had a tough time at first stepping out of the charismatic shadow of his predecessor, Kofi Annan, I am grateful for everything Ban has achieved in his quiet but decisive way. Through his approachability he has made the UN and its connected sphere more inclusive than I expected 10 years ago.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sylvia Wittmer</strong><strong>, Humboldt University, Berlin</strong></li> </ul> <h2>Business as usual on failing to protect civilians</h2> <p>Judging Ban Ki-moon\u2019s legacy is a daunting task, not least because of the range of affairs his office was expected to tackle. Yet there is one metric by which we should measure his performance, because it forms the historical bedrock on which the UN was built \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/un-united-nations-peacekeepers-rwanda-bosnia\">its response to the slaughter of innocent civilians</a>.</p> <p>While the UN could, and very likely should, be criticised for its lack of meaningful intervention in times of conflict (look no further than Syria today) it is perhaps even more shocking when this intervention fails to protect those who need it most. Former Lt Gen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/romeo-dallaire-rwanda-united-nations\">Rom\u00e9o Dallaire\u2019s accounts</a> of the impotence of the UN mission he headed to halt the Rwandan genocide is shocking on its own. Yet, when placed in the context of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1995/jul/12/warcrimes.balkans\">massacres at Srebrenica</a> and in Darfur, it becomes part of a gruesome pattern of systemic failure at the UN. It is a pattern that was sustained under Ban\u2019s stewardship, emerging again in the war crimes in Sri Lanka, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/26/head-un-mission-central-african-republic-pledges-end-troop-abuses-minusca-parfait-onanga-anyanga\">abuses by UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic</a>, and in the re-emergence of hostilities only months ago in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/un-peacekeepers-refused-to-help-south-sudan-rebels-raped-aid-workers-report\">South Sudan</a>.</p> <p>Will Ban be remembered for this? It is hard to say. What is perhaps most disheartening is that, in this regard, his UN is virtually indistinguishable from Annan\u2019s, from Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u2019s. While the UN may have been under new management during Ban\u2019s term as secretary general, it was certainly business as usual.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eimhin O\u2019Reilly, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</strong><br></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/09/ban-ki-moon-world-un-humanitarian-summit-conflict-leadership\">Ban Ki-moon: \u2018Close the gap between the world that is and the world that should be\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>He promoted equal rights</h2> <p>Throughout Ban Ki-moon\u2019s 10-year term, the South Korean has been subject to many criticisms. But there have also been a significant number of successes. While it is true that the UN has suffered in many aspects, in particular relating to its lack of involvement in the Syrian civil war, Ban has triumphed in areas such as his role as a supporter of LGBT rights (especially notable given South Korea\u2019s less than welcoming stance on homosexuals). He has also presented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/12/last-generation-tackle-climate-change-un-international-community\">strong opinions on climate change</a>, an increasingly important problem. Perhaps the most important issue he has tackled is women\u2019s rights. Gender equality has been a concern for decades and, once appointed as UN secretary general, Ban not only pioneered the creation of <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women\">UN Women</a>, but also increased the number of women employed by the UN. This was a very important step in the quest for equal rights, not only throughout the world, but also within the UN itself. We cannot lay the blame for the organisation\u2019s recent failures solely on one man, nor can we attribute to him all its accomplishments. We can, however, appreciate what he has done in trying to improve the world in which we live. <br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Sofia Srdanovic, gap-year student, UK</strong> </li> </ul>",
  "<p>How did WikiLeaks go from darling of the liberal left and scourge of American imperialism to apparent tool of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive, incendiary presidential campaign?</p> <p>Thursday brought another WikiLeaks dump of nearly 2,000 emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly by Russians. As usual, they were inside-the-beltway gossip rather than game-changing: the campaign tried to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/email-clinton-campaign-move-back-illinois-primary-42783309\">push back the Illinois primary</a>, believing it would make life harder for moderate Republicans.</p> <p>That has not stopped Trump trying to make hay from the leaked emails and deflect attention from allegations of sexual harassment against him. \u201cVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cSo dishonest! Rigged system!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/wikileaks-emails-trump-clinton-campaign-leaks-media-bias\">If Trump leaks are OK and Clinton leaks aren't, there's a problem | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street banks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches\">apparently revealed in an email dump</a> last Friday, just minutes after the release of a video in which Trump was caught boasting about groping women \u2013 timing that many felt was more than just chance. This follows a hack in July designed to embarrass Clinton on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. </p> <p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/06/accusing-wikileaks-bias-beside-point/\">Robert Mackey</a> of The Intercept website wrote in August: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks Twitter feed</a> has started to look more like the stream of an opposition research firm working mainly to undermine Hillary Clinton than the updates of a non-partisan platform for whistleblowers.\u201d</p> <p>The seeming alliance between Trump and WikiLeaks is an astonishing role reversal. In 2010 it was lauded by transparency campaigners for releasing, in cooperation with publications <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-war-logs\">including the Guardian</a>, more than a quarter of a million classified cables from US embassies around the world. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange became a hero to many.</p> <p>At the time, Republican politicians expressed outrage at WikiLeaks, but now some are seizing on its revelations as potential salvation for Trump\u2019s ailing candidacy. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, took part in a media conference call about an email that purportedly showed Clinton campaign mocking Catholics.</p> <p>Conversely, liberal activists have expressed dismay at the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s email account and the calculated timing of the release. Neil Sroka, spokesperson for the pressure group Democracy for America, said: \u201cThere is a huge difference between risotto recipes in John Podesta\u2019s emails and the Pentagon Papers. The news value of these Podesta emails is fairly limited and the activist value is even less.\u201d</p> <p>Sroka added: \u201cWikiLeaks is like the internet. It can be a force for good or a force for bad. Right now it is propping up a candidate running the most hateful campaign in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>Last week US intelligence officials blamed Russia for previous hacks. It is not yet known whether Podesta\u2019s emails were hacked by the Russians, but US officials say the attack fits the same pattern. Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied the allegation.</p> <p>Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security took the unprecedented step of saying ... beyond any doubt that this hack and then the leaking of the emails was perpetrated by the Russian government for the purpose of intervening in the election and trying to affect the outcome in favor of Donald Trump. This is getting closer and closer to the Trump campaign itself.\u201d</p> <p>All of which raises the question: do Assange, Putin and Trump form a triangle? Are they in communication with each other or merely exploiting a coincidence of interests? </p> <p>Trump has praised Putin and numerous links with Russia have emerged this year. But on Wednesday he denied any business interests beyond staging Miss Universe there. He has contradicted earlier statements about knowing Putin.</p> <p>Assange was asked by <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/25/julian_assange_choosing_between_trump_or\">Democracy Now earlier this year</a> whether he prefers Clinton or Trump. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me, do I prefer cholera or gonorrhea?\u201d he replied. Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks editor, has said it would publish documents damaging to Trump if it had them. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re choosing publications to pick a certain line,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/how-julian-assange-turned-wikileaks-into-trump-s-best-friend\">she told Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>But some observers argue that Assange\u2019s war on Clinton is personal: she was secretary of state at the time of the diplomatic cables leak. Her perceived secrecy and hawkish foreign policy represents the antithesis of his anti-US imperialist worldview. The capricious, nihilistic, non-ideological Trump might seem like a kindred spirit by comparison.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/alina-polyakova\">Alina Polyakova</a>, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: \u201cMy impression of Julian Assange is that he sees US hegemony in the international world order as the biggest problem facing us today. In his attempt to bring \u2018transparency\u2019, he ends up siding with the very regimes that deny transparency and human rights. That\u2019s the irony of my enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI think the Russian government is in fact using WikiLeaks: the connection seems pretty clear to me. Is the Trump campaign tied to WikiLeaks? That\u2019s hard to say but I would be surprised if there\u2019s no coordination.\u201d</p> <p>Russia has uncomfortable associations for WikiLeaks. In 2010 its point man there, Israel Shamir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-israel-shamir-russia-scandinavia\">was exposed as an antisemite</a> and Holocaust denier. A website, israelshamir.com, carries numerous articles, <a href=\"http://www.israelshamir.com/article/a-lousy-dancer/\">one of which comments</a>: \u201cMs Clinton decided to blame her spectacular lack of success on Putin, as well. If she were honest, she\u2019d admit that she is unpopular, even among her own milieu.\u201d </p> <p>In an email, Shamir denied that Assange is coordinating with Russia. \u201cThe problem is that incredible revelations of emails are totally suppressed by the Clintonesque media,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead of discussing Clinton\u2019s hate to ordinary Americans, Clinton\u2019s order to assassinate Assange etc, you discuss whether Russians are involved. Shame!\u201d</p> <p>Assange remains holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after claiming asylum, where he\u2019s been for four years. Two women in Sweden have accused him of rape and other sexual offences, which he denies, citing a wider conspiracy. Assange has expressed fears that, if extradited to Sweden, he would be in danger of being sent to the US, where he thinks he could face the death penalty.</p> <p>A former associate of Assange, who did not wish to be named, noted that there will be presidential elections in Ecuador in 2017 and the current leader, Rafael Correa, has stated that he will stand aside after 10 years in office. This could make Assange feel uncertain about his future protection. </p> <p>\u201cI believe he is basically hoping that Trump will be lenient on him,\u201d the former associate said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Julian Assange. I feel he\u2019s just desperate and it\u2019s a shame.\u201d<br></p> <p>The site has lost its halo in the eyes of what it used to be its core constituency, the ex-colleague added. \u201cAll the lefties were WikiLeaks softies. Now they are getting a different perspective. It\u2019s obvious Julian Assange has lost his ability to be neutral.\u201d</p> <p>But others who know Assange defend him. <a href=\"http://www.vaughansmith.com/\">Vaughan Smith</a>, a journalist and former army officer who allowed the WikiLeaks founder to stay at his UK home for more than a year, said in a text message: \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a minute that Julian is liaising with Moscow.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole thing is that he\u2019s not supposed to know the identity of his sources, who leave material anonymously to protect themselves. He checks that it\u2019s genuine and puts out as much of it as he can. That\u2019s his compact with whistleblowers. As for Clinton and Trump? He hasn\u2019t expressed a preference to me.\u201d</p> <p>And some Democratic voters have declined to criticise the leaks, which appear to show how the Clinton campaign worked to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primary elections. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anondescript\">Dave Handy</a>, a political organiser and Sanders supporter who will now vote for Clinton, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m glad but they\u2019re doing a necessary thing.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s a ploy, it\u2019s the truth. No one has denied this.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Democratic party and the Clinton campaign have colluded for the last two years to make sure she becomes the nominee and to make sure she becomes president. As someone who will vote for her, we can only pray this is not how she runs her administration.\u201d</p>",

I saw it too, but not perhaps as you saw it, for I spent much of the time looking at his suit and feeling a tad embarrassed. It was quite a nice blue suit. Until recently, I had one quite similar. Not just alike in terms of cut or colour; mine actually had his name on it. Not Tom Ford, or Paul Smith, or Hugo Boss (as if I could afford that). This was a <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/merchandise/signature-collection/\">Donald J Trump brand</a> suit.</p> <p>It was pinstriped with fairly big lapels and turn-ups on the trousers. I liked it because it reminded me to some extent of the dramatic cloth-rich baggy suits my father and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">Windrush generation</a> used to wear. And so, on a visit to New York a few years ago, I bought it from Macy\u2019s department store. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but it didn\u2019t break the bank.</p> <p>It was always problematic. I didn\u2019t know much about Trump. I didn\u2019t know he made suits, for a start, or that \u2013 much more likely \u2013 he had textile workers in Bangladesh, China, maybe Mexico to make them for him. I knew he was a bit naff and that his association with my suit was no kind of fashion statement, but I really did like it so I kept the sole mention of his name \u2013 the rectangular label sewn within the jacket, with \u201cDonald J Trump\u201d in gold letters \u2013 close to my chest, as it were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d34a77e56cc720b27f42f7569e717e2570c8dec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d34a77e56cc720b27f42f7569e717e2570c8dec3/0_153_1283_1602/801.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Muir in a suit\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People thought the suit was great.

If anyone asked for details, I\u2019d just say \u201cI got it in New York\u201d and the vagueness of that declaration would always deter further inquiry. But that\u2019s the problem with deception. Even for the most skilled practitioner, the inner doubts never really go away. And so it was with me and my suit from the Trump Collection. As a garment it seemed fine, but how to wear it without thinking of his preposterous bird\u2019s-nest hair, his ridiculous self-regard, his place in American culture while hosting The Apprentice as joke fodder for every late-night comedian?</p> <p>The doubts ate steadily away at me just as moths might happily have eaten away at the suit. Finally the troubling ratio: outward elegance set against the inner degradation, tilted irretrievably. A year ago, I took the Donald suit to the charity shop. Now, when the world knows all it needs to know about his depravity and lunacy, that seems to me a lucky escape.</p> <p>I understand that it may not seem that way to everyone, for in a modern world where celebrity and commerce skip hand-in-hand, we all buy products created or promoted by famous people we don\u2019t know. Some may be admirable, some may privately be rogues.

Soil temperatures in Norilsk increased by almost 1C between 1999 and 2013.</p> <p>The term permafrost is somewhat a misnomer: while deeper soil remains frozen year-round, the \u201cactive layer\u201d of soil extending several feet below the surface thaws each summer. It thaws unevenly, contorting and warping buildings. To avoid this, in the 1960s builders of apartment blocks in Norilsk began drilling holes up to 100-ft deep and pouring reinforced concrete piles that stuck into the permanently frozen soil below. The piles also lifted each building off the ground, allowing air circulation to cool the soil and preventing further thawing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in \u201ccritical condition\u201d across Russia\u2019s far north</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Engineers didn\u2019t think the soil could start warming so much, however. <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125005/meta;jsessionid=988198CE07A3443E077F281ED3228354.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org#erl521538f4\">Data</a> from a Norilsk monitoring station showed the active layer has been thawing earlier and its thickness has increased from three feet to five feet. In addition, climate change has increased precipitation, adding more moisture to the soil that freezes and expands, gradually crumbling the concrete piles. More snow covers the ground and further warms the permafrost.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases the effect of climate change was not accounted for properly or at all, so the story is not about one building falling, even though there are examples of that, but about thousands of people living in buildings which have the potential to fall,\u201d says Dmitry Streletskiy, an assistant professor of geography at George Washington University.</p> <p>The problem also threatens Alaska, Canada and other northern territories, but only Russia has cities so far north. Forty percent of buildings in the coal mining city Vorkuta have been damaged, the emergencies ministry\u2019s Tereshkov says.

More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in \u201ccritical condition\u201d across Russia\u2019s far north, Streletskiy estimates.</p> <p>At 59 Talnakhskaya Street, an 80-apartment building dating to the 1960s, the sinking corner became visible when a giant crack appeared on the side.

Actually, that makes him a rather extraordinary loser \u2013 I used to be a temp, and it was near impossible to get sacked.

When he tries the bracelet on, his wrist starts to smoke and he disappears.

Brian has rocked up in a pretty low-rent, part-fantasy world, just outside a pub called The Jug and the Other Jug, whose regulars are the magical equivalent of losers: a useless soothsayer, a drunken wizard and a&#xa0;half-giant, half-dwarf. The good news is, they have his phone charger. The bad news is, they don\u2019t have anywhere to plug it in, and he is trapped.</p> <p>You may have surmised that Zapped is a comedy, although you would be hard-pressed to find evidence of it. The jokes are pretty thin, and some (the one about the chicken-headed man supplying eggs, for example) were pressed into service more than once. A&#xa0;quality cast do brave battle with the material: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sharon-rooney\" title=\"\">Sharon Rooney</a> is the soothsayer, who thinks she may have predicted Brian, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/13/women.familyandrelationships1\" title=\"\">Paul Kaye</a> brings a certain demented verve to the wizard Howell. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/15/sally-phillips-actor\" title=\"\">Sally Phillips</a> does a nice turn as evil psychopath Slasher Morgan, although the joke is mostly that Slasher Morgan is played by Sally Phillips.</p> <p>Zapped isn\u2019t dire, exactly. It is gentle, amiable and silly. There are a few good laughs and faint rumblings of a plot beneath all the nonsense. But the magical realm of Munty \u2013 for so it is called \u2013 is sketchily imagined. It looks as if the whole thing was filmed in a dusty corner of a&#xa0;decommissioned Harry Potter set. Characters speak in a jumbled mix of sword-and-sorcery tropes and modern-day phrases (eg, \u201cmy dating history\u201d), and very little of consequence occurs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-mighty-boosh\" title=\"\">The Mighty Boosh</a> could make a virtue of this kind of surreal slapdashery, but here it just seems unconsidered.</p> <p>Even Brian, blasted from our world into this one by a bracelet, seemed to lack interest in his new surroundings.

What remains impressive all these years later is the audacity behind the stunt.</p> <p>The aliens were made by special-effects expert John Humphreys, and the operating theatre was mocked up in a flat in north London. The alien\u2019s innards came from Smithfield market. Spyros Melaris, who filmed proceedings on a 16mm camera, spent weeks sourcing period medical instruments and 1940s American bakelite sockets for his set. Sceptics said the curly flex on the wall phone in the background was an anachronism, but they were wrong. When the filming was complete, the hoaxers had to chop up the bodies like murderers and dispose of the parts in various bins around Camden.</p> <p>The fake backstory surrounding the film is just as elaborate. Ray Santilli, a record promoter, said he got the footage from a military cameraman. \u201cThe whole idea, really, was to put it out there and let people make up their own minds,\u201d he says now. When pressed, he claimed the footage he released was actually a reconstruction \u2013 he likened it to art restoration \u2013 of the original film, which had degraded, and that only a few authentic frames ended up in the final version. Weirdly, he still stands by that story. \u201cI still have the original footage,\u201d he said, \u201cand that footage at some later stage, when we decide it\u2019s right, will be made available to the public to see.\u201d</p> <p>To take part as a talking head in this programme risked a certain culpability, or at least gullibility. Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos suggested public credulousness was based on the fear that \u201cthere is something out there, in the same way that cavemen feared big bad dinosaurs\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcusbrigstocke\" title=\"\">Marcus Brigstocke</a> said he was persuaded when the film first emerged.

Frankly, with this shift in atmosphere I feel would rather leave than face the same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jul/27/brexit-exposed-deep-rifts-in-britain-universities-can-help-heal-them\">Brexit exposed deep rifts in Britain. Universities can help heal them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there is the academic job market to think about. It\u2019s tough everywhere, but \u2013 it seems \u2013 especially so in the UK. I have applied for dozens of post-docs and temporary lectureships in the past six months. I feel relieved whenever I secure just a few hours of teaching or a small research grant. I don\u2019t think the rejections are linked to my EU status \u2013 for now at at least, there are just a large number of applications for each post. </p> <p>So this combination of an impending Brexit and the tough job market means it\u2019s no wonder an EU early career researcher might want to get out. But, leaving isn\u2019t that simple either.</p> <p>British higher education is a unique kind of system in which doctoral candidates are still treated as students rather than researchers. But in Finland \u2013 where a doctorate often takes around eight years to complete \u2013 PhD graduates usually emerge with multiple publications and a strong network of colleagues. </p> <p>In some EU countries, it\u2019s not uncommon for PhD researchers to teach full modules and participate in all aspects of departmental life. Of course PhD students in Britain do some teaching, but a British doctorate rarely prepares you for competing in these other job markets, where expectations for teaching experience and research outputs for early career researchers can be much higher.</p> <p>I\u2019m not trying to paint myself as a victim, I have had it easy in many ways. I am lucky that EU structures made it possible for me to come here in the first place and I haven\u2019t had to deal with racism.</p> <p> Nevertheless, EU early-career-researchers based in Britain now face a new pressure to either navigate an impending Brexit or to fit their PhDs and experiences of UK higher education in to completely different academic career trajectories elsewhere. It\u2019s hard to know what to do. For me, I would like to leave Britain, and return home with my English husband in tow, but I\u2019m not sure if that will happen in the near future. </p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/\">higher education network </a>for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

  "<p>Dozens of Eritreans are to join a groundbreaking civil action in Canada as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Nevsun Resources, which majority-owns the Bisha mine in north-west Eritrea, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/eritrea-mining-nevsun-idUSL2N1CC27U\">following a ruling last week</a>.</p> <p> Two of them \u2013 Kidane, a security guard, and Aman, an administrator \u2013 spoke out for the first time about what they claim they experienced at the mine: forced labour, horrendous working conditions and a climate of fear and intimidation.</p> <p>\u201cThe mine was like an open prison,\u201d Kidane told the Guardian. \u201cThey can take you and do what they want with you. I was owned by them. We were like objects for the government and for foreign companies to do with us what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Kidane claims he was forced to work in a majority-Canadian-owned mine in Eritrea during his time as an army conscript. According to his lawyers, he is one of dozens of Eritreans who will be joining a historic civil action in Canada as plaintiffs against <a href=\"http://www.nevsun.com/\">Nevsun Resources</a>, which owns and operates the majority of the Bisha gold, copper and zinc mine. Lawyers representing the group have said it is the first time foreign claimants have been able to file a lawsuit in Canada against a Canadian company over alleged human rights abuses abroad.</p> <p>Kidane and Aman spoke on condition that their identities and whereabouts were not revealed, due to fears their families may be targeted back in Eritrea. They have been granted refugee status in a European country.<br></p> <p>Their testimonies follow a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/eritrea-gold-mine-abuse-case-canada\">ruling last week</a> by a Canadian court, which paved the way for a lawsuit against Nevsun Resources over claims of forced labour at the Bisha mine. The ruling rejected arguments put forward by the Vancouver-based mining company that the case should be heard in Eritrea rather than Canada. The accounts offered by Kidane and Aman will be used by lawyers for the plaintiffs as evidence in the ongoing case.</p> <p>The civil action, which began in 2014, was taken on behalf of Eritrean workers by Canadian law firms CFM Lawyers and Siskinds LLP, and backed by the Canadian Center for International Justice and Human Rights Concern Eritrea. Nevsun owns 60% of the Bisha Mine Sharing Company, which owns and operates the mine. The other 40% is owned by the Eritrean government.</p> <p>The lawsuit claims that Nevsun engaged Eritrean-run contractors and the military to build the mine\u2019s facilities. It is claimed that the companies and the army forced Eritreans to work in abhorrent conditions.</p> <p>None of the accusations have been proven in court. </p> <p>Nevsun, which had revenues of $357m (\u00a3291m) in 2015, and earlier this year expanded its operations in Eritrea, denies the allegations in the lawsuit and says the mine is a model development. In legal filings, the company said the Eritrean military did not provide labour to the mine. Even if it, did, the company argues, Nevsun was not directly responsible for employing the workers. In public statements, Nevsun has said it has a screening process to ensure no conscripts work at the mine.</p> <p>In its response to the ruling on 6 October, by the supreme court of British Columbia, Nevsun said it was studying the court\u2019s decision and is considering an appeal. In a statement, the company said the decision addressed only preliminary legal challenges: \u201cThe judgment makes no findings with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, including whether any of them were in fact at the Bisha mine. The judge also emphasised that the case raises novel and complex legal questions, including on international law, which have never before been considered in Canada.\u201d</p> <p>In a separate email to the Guardian, a Nevsun spokesperson referred to two independent human rights impact audits. He said they showed the company had adhered to international best practices, adding: \u201cAs the bulk of [the Guardian\u2019s] inquiries \u2026 relate to a legal action that is currently before the courts, we are unable to make any comments.\u201d</p> <p>The government of Eritrea did not respond to requests for a response to the ruling.</p> <p>The judge\u2019s ruling referred to the findings of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/un-commission-eritrea-international-criminal-court-hague\">June inquiry into human rights in Eritrea by the UN</a>, which found that the government, a military dictatorship, had been responsible for crimes against humanity \u2013 including an indefinite period of national service \u2013 since assuming control in 1991.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E\">2016 report by the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea</a> said it had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that the national security office \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E\">is responsible for most cases of arbitrary arrest</a>, enforced disappearance and torture in official and unofficial detention centres\u201d in the country.</p> <p>Joe Fiorante QC, lead counsel for the plaintiffs at CFM Lawyers, said of the preliminary judgment last week: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward to hold Nevsun accountable to what our clients allege are very serious breaches of basic human rights. To date, there has been no accountability in Eritrea. It opens the door to a hearing in a court of law in a country where the rule of law governs.\u201d</p> <p>Kidane and Aman claim they worked at the mine between 2007 and 2014 for as little as a dollar a day with no freedom of movement, and faced imprisonment and harsh penalties for transgressions. They allege that state security officers were present at the mine and say this is corroborated by official documents at Bisha. The plaintiffs claim they were fearful of these officers because they suspected some were employed to spy on workers. They also say there are records of conscripts working at the mine as recently as 2014.</p> <p>Another worker, who also spoke to the Guardian last week but is not a plaintiff in the case, claimed he was abducted at his workplace, imprisoned in solitary confinement and tortured so badly he was unable to walk.</p> <p>Interviewed in a hotel in a European capital, the two new plaintiffs described what their alleged experiences as government conscripts at Bisha mine.</p> <p>Aman, 32, said he was conscripted by the army when he was 20 and assigned to work at Segen, an Eritrean government construction firm. He claimed he was </p> <p>sent to Bisha mine, hundreds of kilometres from his family, in 2009. </p> <p>\u201cLife was very harsh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were sandstorms 24 hours [a day], the temperature was 38C [100F] or 40C. We never had full stomachs. My work was constant.\u201d </p> <p>Aman said he worked at Bisha as an administrator for five years, working six and a half days a week, fed only lentil broth and bread and paid $28 a month. \u201cIt devoured my youth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were prisoners. If we were free, we could have looked for a job with better pay.\u201d</p> <p> Aman\u2019s wife, who lived two days\u2019 travel from the mine, was very sick, he said, but he was refused sufficient leave to visit her and had no money to take her to hospital. \u201cI said to them, \u2018My wife is very ill \u2013 she may die.\u2019 They would say, \u2018You think you are the only one with problems?\u2019 I could not see her and take her to hospital. I had no money to pay to take her there.\u201d</p> <p>Aman said he finally escaped from the mine in 2014 and fled to Europe. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the Eritrean government, as they already use conscripts as slave labour. It is accepted as normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Canadian company should know better.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian tried to contact Segen via and email and telephone but received no comment on the allegations.</p> <p>Kidane, 37, a father of two from northern Eritrea, also alleged abuses at the mine. He said he worked at the checkpoint at Bisha mine between 2007 and 2013 and was employed by Eritrea\u2019s defence ministry.</p> <p>\u201cThe helicopter used to come twice a week to take the gold away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were not given enough money for a bar of soap.\u201d</p> <p>After his father died and he was refused permission to attend a religious memorial ceremony, he left the mine without permission and went into hiding for four months. He was punished with two months\u2019 imprisonment. On another occasion, when he failed to recognise a government figure at the checkpoint, he was imprisoned for two months in solitary confinement.</p> <p>The Guardian also spoke to a third Eritrean, who claims he worked for Senet, a South Africa-based company contracted by Nevsun at Bisha mine.</p> <p>Although not a plaintiff in the ongoing case, he said he is considering legal action against Nevsun, claiming he was abducted and tortured while working at the mine.</p> <p>He alleges that he was subjected to months of being followed and intimidated by government agents at the mines after a series of minor workplace disputes with his superiors and other workers. </p> <p>Solomon, 29, said he was abducted at gunpoint from Bisha mine, thrown into solitary confinement, tortured with electric shocks and beatings, and accused of being a spy.</p> <p>He said he still suffers psychologically and physically from his ordeal.</p> <p>\u201cIf a company employs you, [it should] follow up when you disappear from the workplace \u2026 But that is not what happened. They should have protected me.\u201d</p> <p>A South African former employee of the mine, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was known among local workers that Solomon had disappeared. </p> <p>\u201cHe just didn\u2019t arrive for work one day,\u201d said the employee. \u201cWe started asking other workers and they said he had been taken. I spoke to the security manger. They claimed to have investigated but hadn\u2019t found out anything.\u201d </p> <p>Asked for a response to Solomon\u2019s allegations, Pieter Theron, project director of Senet, said: \u201cThere is an ongoing legal case at the Canadian supreme court and therefore we are not prepared to make any statements.\u201d</p> <p><em>Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 17 October 2016 to add the names of the law firms involved in the case. </em><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The solicitor general, Justin Gleeson, has revealed he has ignored George Brandis\u2019s direction to seek consent before giving legal advice because he regards it as invalid.</p> <p>In May, Brandis issued an order requiring the solicitor general\u2019s advice to go through his office first. In a parliamentary committee hearing on Friday, Gleeson labelled it a \u201cradical change in practice\u201d that made his role \u201cexceptionally difficult\u201d and caused him to \u201clie awake at night\u201d.</p> <p>Gleeson said he had decided to ignore the direction in order to give urgent legal advice about the composition of the Senate, sought from him this week. </p> <p>In his opening statement, Brandis rejected the view the direction prevented Gleeson giving the urgent advice. He criticised him for disclosing it in the committee and for discussing the direction with the shadow attorney general during the caretaker period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/14/george-brandis-to-appear-at-senate-committee-over-solicitor-general-politics-live\">George Brandis: it all depends on your definition of 'consultation'  \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a fiery committee hearing the deputy chair, Ian Macdonald, cut off Gleeson\u2019s answers and subjected him to aggressive questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/solicitor-general-says-he-was-not-fully-consulted-on-revoking-citizenship-or-marriage-equality\">why he had revealed disagreements with the attorney general about legal advice</a>.</p> <p>The solicitor general revealed that on Thursday a senior lawyer in the agency of Australian Government Solicitor sought urgent advice about the composition of the Senate.

He explained it prevented him from giving legal advice to other parts of the commonwealth government when acting as counsel, a duty under the Law Officers Act, without the attorney general\u2019s consent.</p> <p>Gleeson said he decided to meet the AGS lawyer in defiance of the direction to begin work on a legal opinion because it was urgent and acknowledged Brandis could seek an injunction to prevent him doing so.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/george-brandis-to-front-inquiry-into-veto-over-solicitor-general-advice\">The direction is likely to be struck down</a> by the Senate after 8 November, when the committee reports.</p> <p>The solicitor general revealed that, when contacted by shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in June 2016 during the caretaker period, Gleeson said that he believed he had not been consulted about the direction and he did not agree with it.</p> <p>Gleeson said he believed Law Officers Act meant he had a legal duty to answer Dreyfus. The direction was a major policy decision, had required Brandis to certify he had consulted Gleeson, and Gleeson had already warned he did not believe he had been.</p> <p>Brandis said the first he became aware of Gleeson\u2019s discussion with Dreyfus was at Friday\u2019s committee hearing.</p> <p>\u201c[Gleeson] did not tell me he had [this] critical conversation ... I consider that he ought to have done so and I am shocked he did not.</p> <p>\u201cEven if on some construction he didn\u2019t do the wrong thing [by speaking to Dreyfus] \u2013 no explanation was offered or is possible for why he did not to disclose that fact to the government.\u201d</p> <p>The attorney general said Gleeson should have sought consent before revealing the request for urgent advice about the composition of the Senate.</p> <p>He rejected Gleeson\u2019s view the direction prevented him giving the urgent advice because Gleeson had recognised the questions came from Brandis so the suggestion \u201cthat he was constrained or delayed [in providing advice] is unmaintainable\u201d.</p> <p>Gleeson said that he wrote to the attorney general and his department before the election to have the direction withdrawn but Brandis said he would not discuss it until after the election.</p> <p>\u201cThe attorney general has refused to engage with me on this topic despite knowing my concerns,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brandis rejected Gleeson\u2019s view, because he wrote to him about the controversy on 16 August, after the election. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the solicitor general had not yet responded.</p> <p>If the 2 July election had produced a hung parliament, the direction would mean the second law officer would need to seek consent from the attorney general before giving advice to the governor general, Gleeson said.</p> <p>Brandis rejected hypotheticals of that nature, saying it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d an attorney general would deny a request for advice from the prime minister or governor general.</p> <p>Brandis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/06/george-brandis-contradicts-solicitor-general-and-says-justin-gleeson-was-consulted\">maintains he did consult Gleeson at a meeting on 30 November</a> about the substance of the procedure for providing advice, if not the form of the legal direction which was nevertheless \u201cidentical\u201d to a guidance note that was discussed. </p> <p>Gleeson said the attorney general did not seek the solicitor general\u2019s opinion about the binding direction before he made it.</p> <p>Gleeson testified that a public statement Brandis made about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/05/solicitor-general-says-he-was-not-fully-consulted-on-revoking-citizenship-or-marriage-equality\">the constitutionality of the government\u2019s citizenship bill</a> neglected to include his qualifications to the opinion, and quoted his advice on an earlier version of the bill, not the one presented to parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThe bill, as introduced on 23 June [2015] \u2026 contained two elements I had never been asked to advise on: about ministerial discretion, and the abolition of any requirement of natural justice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brandis said the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, had carriage of the citizenship bill but the pair were not able to agree on it. The frequent legal advice sought reflected \u201cthe to and fro within the government as to what the features of the bill should be\u201d, Brandis said.</p> <p>Gleeson said constitutional advice should be sought from the solicitor general because he or she has access to confidential legal advice provided to the commonwealth over a century and would have to defend legislation in court.</p>",
  "<p>The first page of Tim Winton\u2019s new essay collection, <a href=\"https://penguin.com.au/books/the-boy-behind-the-curtain-9781926428765\">The Boy Behind the Curtain</a>, sets a disturbing scene. A 13-year-old boy stands at the window of a suburban street, behind a terylene curtain, training a rifle on passersby. </p> <p>\u201cHe was a fraught little thing,\u201d says Winton of that boy \u2013 the boy he used to be. \u201cI feel related to him but I\u2019m no longer completely him, thank god.\u201d</p> <p>The passage opens a surprisingly intimate essay about the role of guns in Australian life, setting the tone for a collection being billed as Winton\u2019s most personal yet. </p> <p>In spite of his inclination for solitude, Winton has spent much of his life in the spotlight. His first novel, An Open Swimmer, catapulted him into the public eye when it won the Vogel literary award in 1981, but it was his 1991 novel, Cloudstreet, that cemented his place in Australian letters. Winton has won the Miles Franklin award four times and been shortlisted twice for the Booker. His books have been adapted for film, TV and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/cloudstreet-review-opera-version-of-tim-wintons-classic-revels-in-australianisms\">even opera</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/08/island-home-tim-winton-review-love-song-to-australia\">Island Home by Tim Winton review \u2013  a love song to Australia and a cry to save it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contradictions of having such a high-profile career while working in a quintessentially solitary artform are not lost on him. \u201cI spend all day in a room with people who don\u2019t exist, and I\u2019m not thinking about any public \u2013 but once the thing\u2019s done it goes out there and it has a public life over which I have no, or very little, control,\u201d he says.</p> <p>On one reading, the boy with the rifle lurking out of sight, watching the world go by, could be a metaphor for the life of a reclusive writer. But Winton is quick to distinguish himself from such a reading. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to see myself as somebody who was just cruelly observing the world behind the terylene curtain of art.\u201d </p> <p>For Winton, the perceived lives of other writers always seemed completely unrelated to his own experience. \u201cI grew up with a kind of modernist romantic idea of the writer as some kind of high priest, someone who saw themselves as separate and better, which I now find a bit repellent,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that was something that was sold to us at school and certainly at university \u2026 that writers were somehow aloof from the ordinary business of life; they didn\u2019t have to abide by the same rules as other people. The worse their behaviour off the page, the more we were supposed to cheer them on. Once I woke up to that idea as a teenager, I think I consciously resisted it.\u201d</p> <p>Winton\u2019s own background was characterised by a working class sensibility and evangelical religion. His parents converted to the Church of Christ when he was a small boy, the circumstances and his experiences of which form the basis of a number of the previously unpublished essays in The Boy Behind the Curtain. As a result, when he finally did start writing, it was with a particularly industrious work ethic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b09a53e524dd6f42fe63d5b5f967a44db4c3e06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b09a53e524dd6f42fe63d5b5f967a44db4c3e06/87_91_1324_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Tim Winton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Winton: \u2018There wasn\u2019t a lot of romance in my view of what writing was about.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hank Kordas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI approached it like I was a tradesperson,\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t necessarily involve FM radio played very loudly on a worksite; it didn\u2019t always require plumbers\u2019 crack or a hard hat and there was certainly no catcalling, but for the rest of it I went a different route.

They\u2019re not sufficiently attractive to us until they become victims or dangerous brutes and bullies.\u201d<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think it\u2019s a mistake to think someone who doesn\u2019t say much doesn\u2019t have strong feelings</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Winton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conflicted masculinity is recurring theme throughout Winton\u2019s fiction, and his characters often suffer as a result of their inability to articulate their feelings. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to think someone who doesn\u2019t say much doesn\u2019t have strong feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we stifle people\u2019s expression or we ignore people\u2019s signals of wanting to express things at our peril.\u201d</p> <p>The distinct tenor of Winton\u2019s prose, a lyricism which manages to turn even the Australian vernacular into a kind of rough poetry, lends itself to the intimacy of the personal essay. The Boy Behind the Curtain contains a number of vignettes that reflect the imagery and landscape that characterises his fiction: hot bitumen roads through the desert; the churning ocean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tim Winton reads his essay A Walk at Low Tide\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/287428716&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to Tim Winton reads his essay A Walk at Low Tide from the audiobook of The Boy Behind the Curtain (Bolinda Publishing)</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is also a clear political streak to Winton\u2019s nonfiction, and the inclusion of a number of more direct essays in this collection mean it\u2019s difficult to collapse the work under the category of memoir. Stones for Bread, for example, calls for a return to empathy and humanity in Australia\u2019s approach to asylum seekers. The Battle for Ningaloo Reef is a clear-eyed account of the activism that prevented a major commercial development from destroying a stretch of the Western Australian coastline. And Using the C-Word concerns that other dirty word that Winton believes we are avoiding: class. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are people talking about class but they\u2019re having to do that against the flow,\u201d Winton says. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a dispensation that is endlessly reinforcing the idea that we are not citizens but economic players. And under that dispensation it\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest, especially those in power, to encourage or foster the idea that there\u2019s any class difference.\u201d</p> <p>The market doesn\u2019t care about people, Winton argues, and neither is there any genius in it. \u201cThere\u2019s no invisible hand,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if there is one, it\u2019s scratching its arse.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear to Winton that neoliberalism is failing, but not without casualties, two of which are very close to his heart: the arts and the environment. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd6113eff1cdf643aa5e903d3d213a5c3249fbe/0_0_2409_3685/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton, published by Penguin books\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover image for The Boy Behind The Curtain by Tim Winton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople in the arts are basically paying the price for this new regime where we pay no tax and where we get less public service and more privatised service,\u201d he says. \u201cThe arts are last on, first off in people\u2019s minds and I think that\u2019s not just sad, it\u2019s corrosive. They\u2019re just seen as fluff, as fripperies, as indulgence, as add-ons and luxury. And I don\u2019t think the arts are luxury; I think they\u2019re fundamental to civilisation. It\u2019s just that under our current dispensation, civilisation is not the point; civilisation is something that commerce has to negotiate and traduce if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Winton is one of a number of high-profile critics of the Productivity Commission\u2019s proposals to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2015/apr/07/removing-import-restrictions-would-impact-australian-authors-say-publishers\">the parallel importation of books</a>, and a signatory to petitions opposing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/19/the-70-drop-australia-council-grants-artists-funding-cuts\">funding cuts to the Australia Council</a>. But he has also been a grassroots activist in the area of marine conservation for over 15 years. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an activist writer or just a writer who has an activist life on the side,\u201d he says.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an activist writer or just a writer who has an activist life on the side</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Winton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Years of lobbying by conservation groups and the general public contributed to the Labor government announcement in 2012 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/14/australia-largest-marine-reserve\">42 marine reserves in Australian waters</a>, including over the entire Coral Sea.
