  "<p>The chief inspector of prisons has praised an immigration detention centre for families facing forced removal from Britain, which ministers have decided to close.</p> <p>Peter Clarke, the chief inspector, says Cedars, which opened in 2011 near Gatwick airport, has been a \u201cgroundbreaking facility\u201d that will now be lost despite significant human and financial investment over the past few years.</p> <p>\u201cCedars produced the best outcomes for detainees that we have seen anywhere in immigration detention,\u201d Clarke says in his report on an unannounced inspection of the centre carried out in June, before its closure was announced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c25af09989908905e4f695bac7f25c3993ee7030\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c25af09989908905e4f695bac7f25c3993ee7030/0_116_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cedars immigration detention centre for families\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An arrivals room.

The number of children detained fell from 1,119 in 2009 to 110 in the year to March 2016.</p> <p>In his report, the chief inspector of prisons confirms that Cedars has been little used since it was last inspected in 2014, with 46 families having been held there and only 16 of them being removed from Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThe low and decreasing level of use was ascribed by the Home Office to the success of the returns process and the fact that more families were accepting voluntary assistance to leave the UK. In addition, two recent reports had made reference to the cost of Cedars,\u201d says Clarke in his introduction. He adds that 2,442 families have \u201centered the family returns process\u201d since 2014, 1,597 of which have been removed from Britain.</p> <p>The inspection report says the centre has been fitted out to a very high standard, with a kitchen and sitting room in each family apartment. There is also a fitness room, library, IT room, chapel, playroom and lounge areas. It adds that Cedars has gained an international reputation for the quality of its facilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">Hungry, scared, and no closer to safety: child refugees failed by Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke praises the Home Office, the security company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/g4s\">G4S</a> and the children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s for the way they jointly run the detention facility, saying it provides an excellent environment for children at a very stressful and potentially traumatic moment in their lives.

The early groups of asylum seekers who arrived on Nauru came under Australia\u2019s previous Labor government. Although the government\u2019s policy had hardened against the prospects of resettlement in Australia, many still hoped they could find a way there.<br></p> <p>These hopes began to dim. The children, particularly, began to try to fit into life on Nauru. Teachers were brought to the island, mostly from Australia, and a school was set up within the detention centre to give them lessons.</p> <p>\u201cThey were welcoming, they were keen to learn and also they were very tolerant of each other,\u201d Davies said.<br></p> <p>At the primary school, Rose said, she usually had 95% attendance. \u201cThey want to learn, they\u2019re very passionate about education.\u201d<br></p> <p>They would draw in classes, play football. But the days were monotonous. Processing their asylum claims was slow, and the Australian government\u2019s increasingly tough policy began to weigh heavily on the asylum seekers.<br></p> <p>Living there was difficult, particularly for the children. Entire families would live in a single canvas tent. For teenages, the lack of privacy made it hard for them to develop naturally. \u201cThey were under surveillance constantly,\u201d Reen said.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was so upset at that moment, and I was nervous so I drunk cleaning liquid</p> <footer> <cite>Five-year-old boy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat feeling that the children had that they were criminals, because they were escorted everywhere \u2026 they were wanded in, wanded out; their bags were checked,\u201d she said, referring to the guards\u2019 use of metal detectors.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are no private moments in the camp, so that\u2019s really difficult for teenagers. They\u2019re at a stage of development where they need to express themselves, and grow into their personality.\u201d<br></p> <p>And as the length of their detention increased, so too did rates of self-harm and other of other serious incidents. The Nauru files show a steady increase in the number of critical incidents as time in detention increased.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about exposure,\u201d Reen said. \u201cEven the children who weren\u2019t directly affected by assaults themselves they were constantly exposed to incidents and to adults who were experiencing psychiatric disorders as a result of their prolonged incarceration.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cAnd the children always knew that \u2013 and they were just living on a knife\u2019s edge all the time.\u201d<br></p> <h2>School shut down</h2> <p>Weeks after the Australian immigration department announced it was shutting down the school, officials interrupted one class so they could measure it for use as an office.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1012f08d0539d29d7c7b5cd79b7a497a6f78fec9/0_362_1075_1153/932.jpg\" alt=\"An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An asylum seeker holds a letter asking for the school to remain open</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The teachers all pointed to the closure of the Australian-run school as one of the lowest points for children at the detention centre. The immigration department made the decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/31/asylum-seeker-children-start-campaign-to-save-their-nauru-school-from-closure\">to shut the school</a> in March 2015. From September, the children would be funnelled into Nauruan schools. All asylum seekers aged between seven and 17 were to attend local schools, while children under seven would stay at the detention centre.<br></p> <p>School was more than a place of learning for the asylum seekers on the island, the teachers said. It was also a place they could be safe in what was becoming a more volatile environment. The Nauru files show that the pace and frequency of serious incidents at the detention centre steadily increased between 2013 and 2015.</p> <p>Children would sometimes just curl up in a beanbag in a corner, Davies said. \u201cThey were safe there without any possibility of being hurt,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe one last thing left in their life was the school. And they knew it was good so what did they do? They decided to take it away from them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The teachers were shocked that the school was closed, and also by what was planned for the site. Recreation rooms, coffee machines and new offices for Australian immigration department staff replaced the rooms filled with children\u2019s drawings.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was absolutely criminal what they did to those kids,\u201d Davies said.<br></p> <p>Rose said the department went about the closure with little planning or consultation. \u201cHad we know that was going to happen we could have prepared those children a lot better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just meant there was another shock in their lives. It was really difficult for them.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Nauruan schools were poorer quality. Education standards are low on the island. Facilities are in a dire state. And, in some schools, corporal punishment is still practised. Some of the Nauru files detail allegations of corporal punishment by Nauruan teachers.<br></p> <p>Some of the children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/30/nauru-plan-to-move-asylum-seeker-children-to-local-schools-sparks-concern\">were so distressed</a> they began writing letters to the immigration department expressing thoughts of self-harm.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/08/nu-files/embed/embed.html#incident=sca150463\" data-alt=\"Incident report of protest at school\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/08/nu-files/embed/embed.html#incident=sca150463\">Incident report of protest at school</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe all boys from secondary class made in the school \u2026 we [planned] that we are all going to protest without eating,\u201d a five-year-old boy said in a handwritten note.

  "<p>When Donald Trump pitched an economic policy platform nakedly contrived to benefit other multi-millionaires to an assembled crowd in Detroit this Monday, it was quite a spectacle. If there was ever any doubt about the absurdity of the signifier of populism in American politics, it should have been dashed there and then.<br></p> <p>What\u2019s clear by now is that Donald Trump\u2019s populist appeal is limited to a very specific populace, by design. The question of whether Trump\u2019s support is predicated on race versus class isn\u2019t really a question anymore. It\u2019s the kind of thing that can be tested with polls and multivariate regression models. Which is exactly what political scientist <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11833548/donald-trump-support-race-religion-economy\">Philip Klinkner</a> did, and found that, controlling for one another, pessimism about the economy doesn\u2019t predict support for Trump; resentment toward African Americans and Muslims does. </p> <p>It\u2019s the reason why Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/19/this-one-survey-shows-why-trump-wont-win-over-sanders-supporters/\">won\u2019t win over Sanders supporters</a>: however much he invokes Nafta and the decline of manufacturing in the Midwest, as he did in his Detroit speech, trade just isn\u2019t as politically salient as he thinks.

And most of Trump\u2019s supporters care far more about immigration and terrorism, which makes his frequent racist and Islamophobic dog whistles far more effective at shoring up his base.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/aug/10/donald-trump-economic-policy-wealthy-tax-breaks\">How Trump's 'populist' economic policy hides a payday for the wealthy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are, of course, many on the left who wish trade was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support\">more of a salient issue</a>, just as many wish the US had stronger unions and an honest-to-God populist party. But given our history as a country founded on white supremacy, the dream of a kind of pure populism, unadulterated by racism and xenophobia, has always been elusive. Trump\u2019s platform and rhetoric neatly dovetail with those of earlier American populist parties, the Know Nothings (for whom their alien scourge was Catholics) and the People\u2019s Party (who called for restricting immigration in their founding document).</p> <p>Which is why it doesn\u2019t really matter that Trump gets so much wrong on economics. Just in this one speech, he asserted, without evidence, that the Department of Labor is misreporting unemployment figures, apparently confusing their U3 and U6 rates. He conflated retirees with people out of work. He used out-of-date census data to say that household income dropped $4,000 in 16 years, which is not true. He claimed a Congressional Budget Office report says \u201cObamacare will cost the economy two million full-time jobs,\u201d when the report says no such thing. He flat out made things up about Clinton\u2019s tax plan. He called for repealing an estate tax that affects only him and a handful of his richest peers, a display of self interest that\u2019s so unabashed it\u2019s impressive. Make me president and I\u2019ll end the tax on private jets and orange hair weaves. </p> <p>He can get all this wrong and it won\u2019t matter. Just as it doesn\u2019t matter that a man who appears to use bankruptcy as a business model can claim to be a jobs candidate. Just as it didn\u2019t matter that the last movement to be called populist, the Tea Party, had average incomes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=0\">well above the US median</a>. It\u2019s not about jobs and it\u2019s not about income. Even if it should be. <br></p> <p>To be sure, the Democrats\u2019 allergy to anything resembling class-based politics does much to enable Trump, and the continuation of a racialized populism largely divorced from economics. When Democrats say \u201cmiddle class\u201d, they mean \u201cworking class\u201d, and when Republicans say \u201cworking class\u201d, they mean \u201cwhite people\u201d. To be called working class in America means being an evangelical, being a gun owner, living in a rural area, not being black or Latino or Asian \u2013 being, in other words, a typical Republican.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So when Democrats flip flop on trade, and cozy up to Wall Street while keeping unions at arms length, who can blame Republicans for seizing an opportunity to fill the void? And the more Trump\u2019s racialized populism alienates establishment Republicans, the more Clinton embraces them, trumpeting an elite Washington consensus that she is the only responsible candidate in the race. Which may be true. </p> <p>But if there\u2019s anything that feeds the Trump phenomenon more than racial resentment, it\u2019s suspicion of an elite Washington consensus. When class disappears, being declared wrong by the whole of the establishment is enough to qualify you as a populist.<br></p>",

  "<p>I want death: three plain words encapsulate the horror and the shame of the treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru. That a child at the very start of life should want only to end it is a tragedy. That so many held in Australia\u2019s offshore immigration centre express that kind of despair, as revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">in documents leaked to the Guardian</a>, tells you the system is a disgrace. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">The Nauru files</a> tally callousness and outright cruelty towards the hundreds of asylum seekers held on the island since 2012.</p> <p>Each of these cases is an affront. But their volume matters too; this is not about isolated errors or abuses. There are more than 2,000 incident reports, more than half involving children, who account for less than a fifth of those incarcerated. They include seven reports of sexual assault, 59 of assault, 30 of self-harm and 159 of threatened self-harm \u2013 and yet staff from Save the Children, who wrote many of these reports, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/former-save-the-children-workers-say-nauru-files-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg\">say they are the tip of the iceberg</a>. We know, too, that adults on the island live in fear and despair. We read of a mother-to-be begging authorities to take her baby, knowing she cannot protect it.</p> <p>The guards \u2013 and the company that employs them, Wilson Security \u2013 must take the blame for some of what happens on Nauru. Though some appear compassionate and committed to supporting detainees, others are clearly unfit to work there. No doubt they are hardened by the daily misery, but it is hard to imagine how any human could laugh upon seeing that a traumatised child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive#incident=sca140787\">had sewn her lips together</a>, as some officers allegedly did. The bigger issue is that the system dehumanises the desperate. The psychiatrist who previously oversaw their care has described the environment as \u201cinherently toxic\u201d.</p> <p>The justification for Nauru \u2013 and a second detention centre on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island \u2013 was that they would deter asylum seekers from boarding boats to Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/a-short-history-of-nauru-australias-dumping-ground-for-refugees\">More than three-quarters</a> of those whose claims have been assessed have been found to be refugees, with a well-founded fear of persecution and a legal right to protection. The boats are still setting out, but being turned back \u2013 in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/vietnamese-asylum-seekers-forcibly-returned-by-australia-face-jail\">taking their passengers to jail</a> for their attempts to leave. In any case, no one is deterred by misery that they cannot see; and they cannot see it because it has been hidden deliberately. Media access is expensive and has been highly selective. Since last year, those working in the system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/08/why-cant-we-know-whats-happening-on-nauru-and-manus-island\">can be jailed for \u201cunauthorised disclosures\u201d</a>. Some have blown the whistle anyway; traumatologist Paul Stevenson said <a href=\" https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime\">he had never seen more atrocity</a> in a four-decade career that included helping victims of the Bali bombings and Boxing Day tsunami.</p> <p>Officials and politicians appear to hope that, once out of sight, asylum seekers will be out of mind, too. But ignoring the problems does not and cannot make them go away. They mount as the days pass because humans cannot live without hope. The UN high commission for refugees warns of a progressive deterioration in the situation.</p> <p>This is not \u201coffshore processing\u201d but warehousing. The centre holds a relatively small number of refugees: 442. A few hundred more live outside on this impoverished island of just 9,000 citizens, with tensions already evident. If Australia will not accept them, it should explore a third country option seriously. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/turnbull-rejects-new-zealand-offer-to-take-150-refugees-from-detention\">it rejected New Zealand\u2019s offer</a> to take in 150.</p> <p>Both the government and the opposition back the current arrangements, though Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/labor-will-reintroduce-bill-to-force-mandatory-reporting-of-child-abuse-after-nauru-files\">Bill Shorten has now called for increased oversight and the appointment of a children\u2019s commissioner</a> to protect the welfare of those in immigration detention. Those measures, like increased transparency \u2013 ensuring access for the media <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/un-investigators-denied-access-to-nauru-detention-centre-20140409-zqspk.html\">and UN investigators</a>, for instance \u2013 might bring minimal improvements but cannot address the fundamental shortcomings.</p> <p>If the test of a civilised society is how we treat the vulnerable, there can hardly be a greater condemnation than indifference towards those exposed twice over, because of their age and because they have fled their country. Britain, too, has a wretched record in this regard. It has taken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-refugee-crisis-action-not-words\">just 20 unaccompanied children</a> of the hundreds it promised to accept, while more than 600 remain in squalor in Calais. Nauru cannot offer a home and should never have been made a dumping ground. But even if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/10/gillian-triggs-says-onus-on-australian-public-to-change-detention-policy-after-nauru-files-leak\">growing clamour over its miseries</a> can bring an end to this system, it embodies a hostility to asylum seekers \u2013 in Australia and beyond \u2013 that will persist and must be tackled.</p>",
  "<p>Scientific evidence of starvation has been extracted from the teeth of people who died in the Great Famine in 19th century Ireland. It is the first time analysis of the stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in human teeth has been used to establish markers for starvation.</p> <p>Some of the individuals studied by Julia Beaumont of the University of Bradford, and Janet Montgomery of Durham University, had survived earlier periods of famine before the Great Famine of 1845-52, when the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/02/gm-potato-blight-ireland-famine\">Irish potato crop</a> on which the poor were dependent totally failed in successive years.</p> <p>Others died of malnutrition after trying to survive on a diet of imported American maize, the main ingredient distributed as food aid, and used for most workhouse meals.</p> <p>The researchers\u2019 analysis suggests that the changing levels of nitrogen and carbon have been wrongly interpreted in the past as indicators of a high status rich diet. In fact, their grim discovery is that it is really evidence of body tissue breaking down and being recycled, as the starving human literally consumes itself. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing evidence here of the body virtually eating itself as starvation gets a grip,\u201d Beaumont said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the potato crop was good the evidence is that the people\u2019s diet was remarkably good. The maize was also potentially a useful foodstuff, but the problem was cooking it properly and for long enough to make it nutritious - in Mexico lime is used to help break it down, but of course in Ireland there was no knowledge of that, and no way to make use of the information if they had known,\u201d she said.</p> <p> The Irish were also afflicted with scurvy as a result of their new diet, which compared to potatoes was severely deficient in vitamin C. The bright yellow maize was first imported under Sir Robert Peel as prime minister, and was so loathed it became known as \u201cPeel\u2019s brimstone\u201d.</p> <p>The work is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0160065\">published this week</a> in the journal PLOS ONE, and has wider applications than unpicking one of the greatest disasters in Irish history, in which an estimated one million people died of starvation and disease. Beaumont said it could also allow new insights into both archaeological finds and current investigations. Tragically, one expert in touch with the researchers intends to use the technique to establish whether a child who recently died of neglect also suffered starvation.</p> <p>The samples of teeth and bone used in the study thanks to the National Museum of Ireland, came from children and adults buried in a known and well-documented famine burial ground in Kilkenny. The graveyard, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/the-kilkenny-workhouse-mass-burials-an-archaeology-of-the-great-irish-famine.htm\">excavated ten years ago</a>, held the remains of almost 1,000 people who died in the Kilkenny Union workhouse, either during the famine or shortly afterwards, and were buried in mass graves.</p> <p>\u201cSuch data from people who were nutritionally deprived to such a degree is extremely rare,\u201d the academics write, \u201cand the opportunity to use their untold stories is of significant import for the assessment of both modern and ancient individuals where nutritional stress may be suspected and soft tissues are not available.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2016 to make clear that Julia Beaumont referred to lime being cooked with maize in Mexico, not lime juice.</p>",

Plot is first, then character, then dialogue, right the way through to the least important element: spectacle. This is the opposite way round to the priorities of film production studios, who routinely specify the action sequences they require (for merchandising purposes) before the script is even begun. In other words, spectacle dictates plot. No wonder the&#xa0;blockbuster needs a reboot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Plot is first, then character, then dialogue, right the way through to the least important element: spectacle</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Extra gym, no tonic</strong></h2> <p>A new study has suggested that the World Health Organisation\u2019s exercise guidelines are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/09/whos-recommended-level-exercise-too-low-beat-disease-study\" title=\"\">way too low</a> to fight chronic disease.

  "<p>Isn\u2019t there a wonderful irony in our admiration for the feats of US and British swimmers at the Olympics this week? We may applaud gold medalists Michael Phelps and Adam Peaty as they scythe through the pool with exquisite hydrodynamic skill, but <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/us-swimmers-top-podium-most-americans-struggle-pool/\">54% of Americans would not pass a basic swim test</a>. There\u2019s a potentially fatal disconnect, it seems, between ourselves and the water.</p> <p>I feared the pool at school, partly because our teacher was a former army officer who\u2019d ignore weaklings like me floundering about with my fingernails dug into a plastic float while the sports heroes earned his encouraging words. As result, I was in my late 20s before I confronted my aquatic demons. Now I swim every day in the sea, winter or summer, rain or snow. This morning I was there in the dark at 4am, looking for shooting stars. For me it\u2019s not about exercise. Rather, it\u2019s a subversion, inspired by heroes such as Katharine Hepburn, famous for swimming in the ice off her home in Fenwick, Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s stimulating and it\u2019s fun,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it irritates everybody. It makes them cowards.\u201d</p> <p>Following the example of Miss Hepburn (with whom I once spend a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/portrait-of-a-lady-111105.html\">memorable morning</a> in her Upper East Side house, where she tried to feed me crabmeat from a half-open can), I swim off Cape Cod in January, following the advice of the New York Times of 23 August 1883, which recommends the Cape shores to \u201cthose looking for good surf-bathing\u201d, so empty even on a summer\u2019s day that \u201cif one wishes to go in in his bare pelt he may do so without the fear of shocking propriety\u201d. I swim there in the summer too, occasionally in the company of John Waters, who hitchhikes to the beach. (We once got a ride in a cop car. John quipped as we got out: \u201cWe\u2019ve been paroled to the beach\u201d).</p> <p>The summer stirs our relationship with the water, and swimming has a noble tradition in the United States, a rebellious republic bound from sea to shining sea. The act of abandoning land and gravity has a sensual, even decadent air. On his 1882 tour of the US, which turned him into an international celebrity, Oscar Wilde <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2015/05/orchid-prairies\">spent an extended stay on Fire Island</a>, already fashionable as a resort for New Yorker swimmers. Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper portrayed him in flowing Pre-Raphaelite locks and a <a href=\"http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/features/a-scene-at-long-beach.html\">daringly tight</a> swimming costume, the ultimate in aesthetic undress. Wilde\u2019s son said his father swam like a powerful shark. Wilde v Phelps swim-off, anyone?</p> <p>More obviously macho was Jack London, self-declared \u201cblond beast\u201d and highest paid author in the world by 1913. An inveterate swimmer, London wrote ecstatically of midnight swims \u201cunder the starshine\u201d in water \u201cwarm as tepid milk. The good salt taste of it was in his mouth, the tingling of it along his limbs; and the steady beat of his heart, heavy and strong, made him glad for living.\u201d</p> <p>But Henry David Thoreau is my man when it comes to transcendental swims. It was one of the reasons for building his hut at Walden: \u201cI got up early and bathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best things I did.\u201d The philosopher even tried to analysise the colour of the water \u2013 \u201clying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both\u201d. Less idyllically, modern analysis of Walden Pond in midsummer reveals a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/why-has-the-olympic-pool-turned-green-the-good-news-is-its-not-urine\">high volume of human urine</a>.</p> <p>Swimming was also an essential part of Thoreau\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thoreausociety.org/news-article/threshold-chaos-henry-thoreau-cape-cod-elizabeth-kalman-nicholas-holdgate\">celebrated visits</a> to Cape Cod.</p> <p> Locals told him there was \u201cno bathing on the Atlantic side, on account of the undertow and the rumour of sharks\u201d. Undeterred, he continued to swim there, \u201conly observing first from the bank if the cove was preoccupied\u201d. At Ballston beach, where I\u2019ve skinny-dipped in the company of passing humpback whales, Chris Myers <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/metrodesk/2012/08/03/man-who-survived-shark-attack-off-ballston-beach-truro-calls-himself-very-lucky/RC6VoTuTt23Rt8Liy7tOfL/story.html \">was bitten</a> by a great white shark in 2012, sustaining severe injuries to his legs.

To that end, on Tuesday the organization launched Focus 2020, vowing to help elect enough pro-choice Democratic women in 2016, 2018, 2020 and beyond that they will be able to build Democratic legislative majorities in 14 states in time to affect the partisan makeup of the US Congress.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to end this process of gerrymandering by Republicans,\u201d Schriock added. \u201cWe have to make sure that we have fair districts in this country, so that we can fight over ideas, not process.\u201d</p> <p>First up in 2016, Emily\u2019s List is pushing candidates in Michigan, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, Minnesota, New Mexico and Colorado \u2013 all states that have passed or nearly passed anti-abortion legislation over the last few years.</p> <p>In Colorado, widely seen at the original home of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/29/colorado-personhood-fails-signatures-ballot\">so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d movement</a> \u2013 which attempts to define fetuses as people under the law and thereby classify abortion and even some methods of birth control as murder \u2013 the senate went from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/08/colorado-state-senate-majority/115049/\">blue to red in 2014</a>, after a razor-slim Democratic majority created by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/gun-lobby-democrats-colorado-connecticut\">recall</a> of two pro-gun-control senators in 2013 failed to hold.</p> <p>To change that, Emily\u2019s List has endorsed three pro-choice women in state senate races there, though Democrats only need to pick up two seats. Rachel Zenzinger, who is challenging a Republican incumbent, Laura Woods, to retake the seat she she lost to Woods by 663 votes in 2014 is one of them.</p> <p>Zenzinger described her race as taking place in \u201ca swing district in a swing country in a swing state\u201d where \u201cyou would think [Woods] would be trying to defend and protect women and women\u2019s issues, but she\u2019s done the exact opposite\u201d.</p> <p>Woods supported a variety of anti-abortion bills in the last session, including ones that Zenzinger said \u201cranged from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2016/04/22/forced-waiting-period-mandated-ultrasound-measures-go-down/\">mandatory, invasive ultrasounds</a> to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://coloradopols.com/diary/82515/woods-we-are-concerned-about-the-abortions-behind-the-tissue#sthash.LgsodMzP.dpbs\">defunding a local university because it used fetal tissue for research</a>\u201d, in addition to one that would have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.lambornforcongress.org/index.php/articles/it-is-time-to-defund-planned-parenthood\">defunded Planned Parenthood</a>.</p> <p>Given the anti-abortion movement\u2019s history of unsuccessfully putting \u201c<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-perfect-storm-may-be-brewing-in-colorado-to-pass-a-personhood-law-aeb2903308ae#.7n58rx9m9\">personhood</a>\u201d legislation on the ballot, Zenzinger believes that many Republicans \u201cwill try to seek action legislatively, where they have the opportunity to control the agenda if they are able to maintain the Republican majority\u201d in the state senate.</p> <p>But beyond the immediate concerns for reproductive rights in the state, Zenzinger said that if her party fails to regain a majority presence in the state senate by 2020, her constituents will see a \u201csignificant rolling back of the clock, just trying to go back and undo some of the good, progressive work that has been done over the past few years that really benefited everybody in Colorado\u201d \u2013 let alone anything that might be on a Democratic president\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Last April, the <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/04/michigan_house_passes_379_bill.html\">Michigan state House of Representatives passed a budget defunding Planned Parenthood</a>. It\u2019s another state where Emily\u2019s List is backing candidates under the Focus 2020 initiative in an attempt to bring that state\u2019s house of representatives back under a Democratic majority. One of these candidates is Collene Lamonte. Like Zenzinger in Colorado, Lamonte also lost a seat she held during the 2014 midterm elections. She\u2019s running to regain the seat she lost to a Republican opponent.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of issues in Michigan, things are not able to move forward because of a lack of women in our political system right now. <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/life/family/kristen-jordan-shamus/2015/03/22/gender-wage-gap-michigan/25200671/\">Pay equity in our state is a huge issue</a> \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2014/09/Michigan-Pay-Gap-2014.pdf\">Michigan is lower than the national average</a> when it comes to pay equity for women. And we haven\u2019t been able to get that addressed with our current legislature,\u201d Lamonte said. \u201cAnd we continue to see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.eclectablog.com/2016/03/michigan-legislators-use-womens-health-as-a-bargaining-chip-ahead-of-primary-deadline.html\">bills that restrict women\u2019s access to proper healthcare in the state</a>. We need to ensure that women receive proper access to healthcare when they need it, without facing barriers.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Emily\u2019s List plans to expand its focus to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2013 many of which have legislatures that are notoriously hostile to women\u2019s reproductive rights, and some of which have voted for national Democrats even while their Congressional delegations skew Republican.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we have three full election cycles ahead of us,\u201d said Schriock. But if Republicans are able to gerrymander as many districts in 2021 as they did in 2011, \u201cwomen for generations are going to be left behind in this country.\u201d</p>",

But whether the passage will completely open in 2016 remains to be seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/2b0629d0bea77f645e469ca695f7d887f6026284/0_0_3377_2532/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/2b0629d0bea77f645e469ca695f7d887f6026284/0_0_3377_2532/1000.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/9fd9550f695889673ae8068898c794b4483a230a/0_0_3377_2532/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/9fd9550f695889673ae8068898c794b4483a230a/0_0_3377_2532/1000.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Queensland\u2019s arid Channel Country, Australia\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/2b0629d0bea77f645e469ca695f7d887f6026284/0_0_3377_2532/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/2b0629d0bea77f645e469ca695f7d887f6026284/0_0_3377_2532/1000.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/9fd9550f695889673ae8068898c794b4483a230a/0_0_3377_2532/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/9fd9550f695889673ae8068898c794b4483a230a/0_0_3377_2532/1000.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Queensland\u2019s arid Channel Country, Australia</a> <figcaption>Credits: Planet</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winter rains bring green vegetation to Queensland\u2019s arid channel country in Australia as seen in these images taken on 25 July and 30 January 2016.</p>",
  "<p>Two days before he was due to meet the president of the US, Antonio Rodiles was arrested by the Cuban police.<br></p> <p>But this was nothing new \u2013 as a democracy activist in Cuba you get to know the police pretty well. Rodiles estimates that he has been arrested more than 50 times since the beginning of the year.<br></p> <p>I met Rodiles in his house in Havana, shortly after the US president\u2019s historic visit. He was eventually released and met with Obama, who spent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/obama-meets-cuban-dissidents-221095\">two hours with prominent Cuban dissidents and anti-Castro civil society leaders</a>. \u201cIt was a good meeting, but it doesn\u2019t mean we will have a good result,\u201d Rodiles says. And yet, despite plenty of negative experiences, the activist admits that these days, he has moments of optimism.<br></p> <p>Rodiles, a native Cuban, has been openly critical of the Castro government since his return from the US in 2010. A qualified physicist, he spent 12 years away from Cuba until he turned to political activism, concerned and frustrated by the lack of civic liberties in his country.<br></p> <p>His activism is mainly about reclaiming public space and intellectual freedom. Last year he launched <a href=\"http://www.todosmarchamos.com/\">#TodosMarchamos</a> (we all march), an initiative to exercise the right to freedom of expression and take back the streets from the government \u2013 there\u2019s a saying in Cuba \u201c<em>esta calle es de Fidel</em>\u201d (this street belongs to Fidel).<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/25/press-freedom-mexico-murder-threat-duopoly\">Murders, threats and duopoly: the state of press freedom in Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a smaller scale, every Thursday Rodiles hosts meetings at his house \u2013 an organisation called Estado de SATS \u2013 an open space to present art exhibitions, independent films and debates. They are \u201ca kind of therapy session for activists,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no space like this in Cuba. It\u2019s so important to have these kinds of events. People can come here and speak openly without limits. They can say they hate Fidel or even, well, we haven\u2019t had anyone say they like the Castros, but they could do that here,\u201d he jokes.<br></p> <p>And these meetings are poignant. Ex-political prisoners are given a microphone to share their thoughts on the future of Cuba and openly discuss their experiences of their restricted life. It seems to be a lifeline for those who think differently to the Cuban communist ideology; and it is perhaps now more important than ever to continue these discussions. The invitation to meet with Obama was a recognition of their work.<br></p> <p>This all comes against a backdrop of rising repression. \u201cIn general the repression is increasing,\u201d Rodiles says. \u201cThe regime is more violent, more comfortable. People care more about economics than promoting human rights in Cuba.\u201d<br></p> <p>According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, there were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.co.uk/world/2016/mar/20/cuba-obama-visit-anti-castro-protesters-clash\">8,500 cases of arbitrary detention in 2015</a> and more than 2,500 in January and February of this year.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305XilibeFA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/305XilibeFA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Antonio Rodiles, after he was beaten by Cuban security agents in July 2015 on his way to a protest.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe are suffering more arrests. They [state security forces] are beating us hard,\u201d Rodiles says, his voice measured and calm. It seems he has become desensitised to this violence. If you search Antonio Rodiles online, you will find an image of him with reddened eyes wearing a bloody shirt, his face almost fully covered by a bandage on his nose which was broken, along with his eardrum, in a brutal beating by security agents last year. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=305XilibeFA\">says he was on his way</a> to the Sunday protest organised by opposition movement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_in_White\">Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White)</a> in July 2015 when he was attacked \u2013 the protest he still attends every week. \u201cThe opposition movement needs to show people you can\u2019t be afraid. That\u2019s the main goal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Economic changes won\u2019t bring political changes; now human rights and democracy are not the priority</p> <footer> <cite>Antonio Rodiles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a political sense there may be no change. \u201cThe regime is more legitimate after the change in relations with the US,\u201d he says. In his view, the growing rapprochement, which began in December 2014, has given the Castro government greater international credit, legitimising a regime that continues to repress dissent. \u201cEconomic changes won\u2019t bring political changes; now human rights and the promotion of democracy are not the priority of the discussion.\u201d<br></p> <p>But for ordinary Cubans and their understanding of their rights, Rodiles is more hopeful. \u201cPeople are more frustrated, more tired, and so they are more engaged. It is like there\u2019s a small hole [in the power of the regime] and as that hole increases things move faster.\u201d<br></p> <p>He moves to show me a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7IZh2BpdfE\">YouTube video by Estado de SATS</a> of a recent demonstration in central Havana. A couple of activists walk down a busy street throwing pro-democracy flyers in the air, shouting \u201c<em>Libertad!</em>\u201d (freedom). After a few moments they are taken away in police cars, but this is when Rodiles gets excited. \u201cLook, look at the people pick up the papers. They are taking papers and reading. For us, this is amazing. People are feeling less afraid.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america\">The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More Cuban people, Rodiles tells me, are talking about change, speaking in the streets about their frustrations, and more interested in a different future.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople are complaining openly and this has never happened before. Little by little people are realising more government broken promises. When you start to break that order you start to break the system. People need to feel as though they have the right to be a human being, and after that you\u2019re ready to face the regime.\u201d</p> <p>Rodiles rises abruptly from his chair \u2013 it\u2019s a Thursday and he needs to get ready for the the Estado de SATS meeting. Today they\u2019re showing Richard Attenborough\u2019s Gandhi. Perhaps he sees something of himself in the civil rights leader. \u201cI don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m brave,\u201d Rodiles says. \u201cI do it because I feel tired of these people.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<h2>Portland, Oregon, US<br></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Walking is the best way to see a city. I recently visited Portland, Oregon, and began by taking the bus to an inner city dormant volcano. Starting out with a beautiful view of the central hub of the city in the distance, the walk begins through a beautiful park before finding a set of lakes. From here you hit an incredibly long and straight road called SE Hawthorne Avenue, toward the Willamette river that chops the city in two. Walking the full length of this road shows the diversity of Portland culturally with the aromas wafting out from restaurants: South Korean, Mexican, Greek, French.</p> <p>Next are the many coffee and tea shops grinding their own beans to the sound of local music. This area of Portland buzzes with diversity: theatres, music houses, instrument shops, organic farmers markets, art shops and second hand thrift and furniture stores. It is a relaxed and mellow walking experience as you head toward the river. When you cross the river and beautiful bridge, you hit the high-rise hustle and bustle of downtown. Look up or you\u2019ll miss the glitz of the modern world as you head toward the Pearl District where again, the chilled nature of the city takes over from the core business district of downtown. </p> <p>From here, you can head north-west and enter the enchanted world of Forest Park. With over 70 miles of trails where the air feels cooler and healthy to each breath you take. A walk in suburbia shows off the true diversity of a city.\u201d <strong><em>(Andy Bee)</em></strong></p> </blockquote> <h2>Dublin, Ireland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670d2656b21d80a2f83365ea7d3969d699a5965e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/670d2656b21d80a2f83365ea7d3969d699a5965e/0_157_5041_3025/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Patricks Cathedral and St Patricks Park, Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018splendours and wonders\u2019 of Dublin: St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and St Patrick\u2019s Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dublin is a fantastic city to walk in.

Such a Parisian feel. </p> <p>I continue on to the the sub-tropical gardens, the firstin England built in 1863 when the park warden travelled to South Africa for horticultural inspiration. I carry on to the 1950s cafe and have an ice cream while sitting on a bench looking across the boating lake to the Victorian rockery.

Starting from the Rumeli Castle to Dolmabah\u00e7e, on the side of Bosphorus, feel what the great discoverers of ancient history felt when they first saw these lands, and understand why Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror was so eager to make it the capital of his empire after 100 years of Ottoman\u2019s attempts to conquer Constantinople. </p> <p>You need to touch the ancient stones of Hagia Sophia, smell the Rodos clay, and feel the glory of what was once the biggest worship building in the world. Walk by Byzantine walls, touch its stones, look at the sea and feel the history in your veins. And if you want to walk even earlier in history, go to the first settlement: Khalkedon, which is now the most modern and westernised part of Istanbul. You can have some tea with locals, talk about politics, and get lost in the narrow, chaotic streets.</p> <p>Go to the old settlements of Beyo\u011flu, the back streets of the main walking route Istiklal Street and find yourself in something out of Harry Potter\u2019s universe. If you prefer some colourful buildings, walk through Balat, up the hill until the Armenian school, and feel the diversity and freedom. I have lived in Istanbul for 16 years, and with every walk it is completely different, but in many ways it remains the same: great, giant, glorious.

Nayden Gerov Street, tucked between the main street and one of the city\u2019s seven hills, hosted a street art festival in 2013, which transformed the walls into an explosion of colour. Opposite the walls, the rocks at the foot of the hill had faces of famous people drawn on them.

Three top climate scientists just made a very bold prediction regarding sea level rise; we should know in a few years if they are correct. <br></p> <p>As humans emit greenhouse gases, it\u2019s causing the Earth to warm. That\u2019s indisputable and proven. We can actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">measure the amount of extra heat</a>. Since most of it ends up in the oceans, we can also measure other changes in the oceans.</p> <p>For instance, the oceans are rising. We know that\u2019s indisputable. Measurements taken from physical gauges and from satellites confirm sea level rise. The cause of the rise is more complex. <br></p> <p>Part of the rise is from ocean warming \u2013 warm water is less dense so the sea level rises as temperatures increase. Another part of the rise is from melting ice, especially ice that is currently on land (like glaciers and ice sheets). As this ice melts and flows into the oceans, the water levels rise. A third reason for sea level changes is from alterations of where water is stored on the planet. For instance, changing rainfall patterns and storage of water underground, in lakes, or in the atmosphere can affect sea levels. <br></p> <p>The three ways we know sea levels are rising are from physical tide gauges, from satellites that measure the water height, and from satellites that measure where ice is stored across the globe. While tide gauge measurements go back many years, they only measure water levels at their location. Many tide gauges have to be in place to get an accurate sense of what is happening globally. <br></p> <p>Satellites, on the other hand, are much more capable of taking global measurements. The problem with satellites is they have only been taking measurements since approximately 1993 (not nearly as long as tide gauges). So scientists try to combine these two measurements to get a long-term and global picture of what is really happening. <br></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31245\">very recent paper</a> published in Nature has evaluated the history of sea level rise, and what they find is really interesting. The lead author (<a href=\"http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/fasullo/\">John Fasullo</a> from the National Center for Atmospheric Research) and his colleagues tried to determine if the rate of sea level rise is changing. That is, are the water levels rising linearly, the same amount each year? Or, is the rate increasing (faster and faster each year)? <br></p> <p>Using satellite data, the authors found little evidence of an acceleration. However, they show that this is because the satellites began measuring in 1993, right after a large volcanic eruption (Mount Pinatubo). This eruption temporarily reduced global warming because particles from the eruption blocked sunlight. Just by coincidence, the timing of the satellites and the eruption has affected the water rise so that it appears to be linear. Had the eruption not occurred, the rate would have increased.</p> <p>This allows the scientists to make a prediction: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>barring another major volcanic eruption, a detectable acceleration is likely to emerge from the noise of internal climate variability in the coming decade.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This means that the authors will be able to statistically observe an increase, even though the Earth experiences natural changes that may mask any increase.</p> <p>I communicated with Dr. Fasullo, asking him why this paper is so important. He told me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>This article shows that the acceleration of sea level rise is real and ongoing. It is also an example of how climate models can play a key role in both the interpretation of observations and the prediction of near-future climate.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>While only time will tell if they are right, I\u2019d put my money on the scientists. </p>",

  "<p>Do you trust the private sector? No? Neither do I. But I also know that we have to find a way to overcome the knee-jerk reaction that all private sector is bad, and all public sector is good.

The private sector has different incentives from the public or NGO sector and markets don\u2019t necessarily reward good behaviour. Indeed, quite often, at least in the short-term, they offer the strongest incentives for those who can find ways to cut standards and lower costs, exploiting anyone and everything in their wake.</p> <p>But nonetheless, I still think its time to get beyond the rhetoric. The arguments have hardly changed in fifteen years, and, quite frankly, I\u2019m bored. The lines are pitched as an argument between the pragmatists and the idealists: those who partner with the private sector, and those who campaign against them. On the one side, you get <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/the-power-of-collaboration-6-success-factors-for-private-ngo-partnerships-86366\">Care\u2019s partnership with Cargill</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/barbara-frost/clean-water_b_10923698.html\">Wateraid\u2019s partnership with Diageo</a>. For this camp, collaborating with the private sector is perceived as necessary and inevitable. Governments have failed people, they might say, and NGOs can\u2019t deliver to scale. Putting a private-sector lens to the challenge of development has brought innovation and the newly worn phrase \u201cdisruption\u201d to a tired industry. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Private-sector led development will be Priti Patel's calling card</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For others, however \u2013 let\u2019s call them the idealists \u2013 private sector-led development removes people\u2019s rights and individual freedoms, while further embedding corporate control of everything. For this camp, NGOs who partner with the private sector have undermined our mutual, long-term cause.</p> <p>The pragmatists are certainly more in favour with the government of the day. The UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID)\u2019s new minister, Priti Patel, the former tobacco lobbyist who once wanted to axe the entire department, will continue the priorities already set by her predecessor. Private-sector led development will be her calling card, and collaborations between NGOs and the private sector will be at an even greater premium. Any NGO wanting a future funding relationship with DfID will be expected to tow the line. They were already giving roughly a third of their budget away to the private sector or private sector partnerships with NGOs. This could easily rise.</p> <p>The idealist in me is concerned. Development agendas centred around rights and freedoms have been taking a back seat to the business of economic development \u2013 the pragmatists seem to have won. DfID\u2019s statement of purpose says, among other things: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development/about\">\u201cwe\u2019re ending the need for aid by creating jobs\u201d</a> as if development were just a matter of employment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs\">Forget 'developing' poor countries, it's time to 'de-develop' rich countries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So who is right? The pragmatists or the idealists? Are those who eschew private-sector partnerships just ideologues, blind to modern realities? Or has the NGO sector really sold out to the highest bidder, throwing their ideals out the window?</p> <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that in roughly the same period as we\u2019ve seen a rise of private-sector led development, we\u2019ve also seen some worrying trends: rising levels of inequality over the past 15 years, more insecure work, environmental degradation and tax evasion on a massive scale. NGOs who enter into partnerships are clearly not to blame for these outcomes, but should we be asking: have they aided and abetted their rise, concentrating power into the hands of the wealthy?</p> <p>Frustratingly, it\u2019s not that simple. Moral clarity makes campaigning easier, but as Duncan Green pointed out to me recently: NGOs, even more radical ones, spend a lot more time working with the private sector than they care to admit. \u201cSmall farmers and SMEs or cooperatives are as important a part of the private sector \u2013 if not more so \u2013 than big irrelevant corporations,\u201d he said. We need to reframe this debate, he argued: it\u2019s not about private v public, but about size, scale, and form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/07/sdgs-progress-stay-humble\">We won't conquer the mountains of the SDGs without humility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crux of the matter is the relevant role of NGOs. A DfID model sees NGOs as just one vehicle to deliver economic growth, to help raise standards in the private sector or to provide some basic services to the poor. Where NGOs sing, however, is in their ability to challenge unfair structures, not to pander to them. Can NGOs really be both partner, and provocateur? Instead of bringing influence and innovation, have relationships with the private sector rendered NGOs role as advocate, watchdog and change agent, marginalised and ineffective?</p> <p>Sunita Narain, the chief executive of India\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.cseindia.org/\">Centre for Science and the Environment</a>, speaking recently at the Institute of Development Studies\u2019 50th anniversary conference, said that many in development believe that over the past period, we\u2019ve empowered society through the growth of the market. Instead, she asked us provocatively: \u201cWhich society? The poor or the rich?\u201d</p> <p>If private sector-led development, and the partnerships it brings, can be about genuine power shifts, then I would shout from the rooftops. But for now, that small, cooperative private sector that Green refers to is hidden in the shadows, lacking power and toothless. Most NGOs will continue to take big corporate cash, while holding their critical tongues of dissent. All private sector development is certainly not bad \u2013 but the type of private-sector led development, I fear, that Patel foresees, is far from this type of genuine shift.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

So we did our own.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert and Jaime drew on their mother\u2019s enthusiasm, as well as classic Hollywood films, and their local music scene, which features prominently in Jaime\u2019s stories. \u201cWe had our version of punk here LA, which came later than London and New York,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPeople were like \u2018Oh you guys are starting punk? Ha-ha, late bloomers,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Jaime says he partly put punks in his comics because of their clothes. \u201cThe way these people are dressing is way more interesting than the way superheroes dress,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>Yet the attitude also made for great dialogue. Jaime eventually married the woman whom he based one of his best-loved characters, Esperanza Leticia \u201cHopey\u201d Glass. \u201cI really liked her spitfire attitude, her foul mouth, and way she didn\u2019t care about what people thought,\u201d he says \u201cThat\u2019s why I created my punk girls.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert, meanwhile, dreamt up Palomar, his imagined Central American village where rural life rubs up against a fair amount of magical realism. The artist says that, despite his Mesoamerican heritage, very little of the place comes from first-hand experience. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Mexico but that\u2019s about it,\u201d he admits. \u201cI made up almost everything.\u201d</p> <p>Early editions also featured space travel and dinosaurs, though these aspects gave way to the kind of storytelling that has more in common with HBO than Marvel or DC. \u201cEveryday stories got more interesting to me,\u201d says Jaime. \u201cMy home life was more interesting, but all people were getting from southern California was Baywatch.\u201d</p> <p>Today, much of Love and Rockets\u2019 charm lies in the ways the brothers have matured their characters. Jaime\u2019s stories in particular, now focus on what happens to punks when they grow up.</p> <p>\u201cSome have terrible lives, suffering from drug addiction, and others have great ones \u2013 they\u2019ve become TV producers, or things like that,\u201d he says. \u201cNow that they\u2019re older, it\u2019s OK to talk about your past.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers\u2019 fortunes have been similarly mixed. Jaime says that, despite many offers, he has given up trying to develop his stories into a feature film. \u201cMy conclusion is they [film producers] don\u2019t want to make what I want to make,\u201d he says, \u201cit breaks my heart, but I understand. Making a film is about working with a lot of people. When I\u2019m doing Love and Rockets it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p> <p>And, while this new edition comes out at a time when comic book sales are booming, Love and Rockets hasn\u2019t quite enjoyed the kind of commercial success it might have. \u201cI think Love and Rockets is mentioned more often than it is actually read,\u201d says Gilbert. \u201cIt has influenced a whole lot of cartoonists, directly or indirectly I think can say.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Hernandez brothers can content themselves with the knowledge that, a generation on from its debut, they have created and sustained an enduring and much loved American saga, by jettisoning flights of fantasy, and finding very human stories, closer to home.</p> <p>\u201cThis little world that I live in has so much to tell; it\u2019s a really rich culture,\u201d says Jaime. \u201cI mean, almost every neck of the woods does, but I just happen to be a guy who can get it out there.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>We must have made a strange sight: 12 wetsuited swimmers suddenly landing on a nudist beach. I often feel overdressed in a wetsuit, but this was ridiculous. But rather than disrobe and get into the swing of things, we averted our eyes, opened our towfloats and rehydrated with some water, before swimming off again on our exploration of the coastline.</p> <p>As the nudists receded from view, we stopped beneath craggy cliffs and dipped our heads under the water. Our guide, champion long-distance swimmer Miquel Sunyer, pointed out a bright orange starfish making its slow way across the seabed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c61d34dd21fefc98e5fd1c75dc8a848eaa53bc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c61d34dd21fefc98e5fd1c75dc8a848eaa53bc6/4003_60_6441_3866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Tracks\u2019 500m to 2km long off the Catalonian coast are buoyed off from boats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tracks\u2019 500m to 2km long off the Catalonian coast are buoyed off from boats</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vies Braves</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were exploring Spain\u2019s Costa Brava and Costa Barcelona with <a href=\"http://viesbraves.com/\" title=\"\">Vies Braves</a>, a simple solution to the problem of swimming in busy seas. A series of \u201ctracks\u201d, from 500m to 2km long, in the water off the Catalonian coast are buoyed off from boats, so people can explore the coast safely, swimming from beach to beach. Signs at the start and end of each track have a map of the area, distance and estimated time, any hazards or currents, and return land routes for those who want to swim just one way (or for family and friends to follow on foot). So far there are 25 routes and more than 25km of buoyed lanes to explore, from Sitges, south of Barcelona, to Portbou on the French border. The Vies Braves tracks can be explored in a number of ways: on organised trips for groups of friends or swimming clubs tailored to suit abilities and length of stay; by joining sessions with swim guides held in several towns in high season; or by going it alone, using the Vies Braves website to plan your itinerary.</p> <p>On our organised three-day swimming trip in early June, water temperatures were between 16C and 18C \u2013 very pleasant for British swimmers, although on longer swims we did wear wetsuits. Later in the season, water temperatures reach the mid-20s, so they would not be necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ba387b295e67debe51e4e211b4ed2fdf1adb5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ba387b295e67debe51e4e211b4ed2fdf1adb5d/107_0_3199_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wetsuits can be left behind as the water gets warmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wetsuits can be left behind as the water gets warmer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vies Braves</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We started in Lloret de Mar, the busy Costa Brava resort. The beauty of the Vies Braves tracks, however, is that you are soon off the tourist trail and exploring the coast away from the crowds. We swam out from Fenals Santa Cristina beach and hugged the coastline as we swam around the headland. The buoys were a reminder that we were safe from boat traffic, but just in case we also had towfloats and wore bright yellow hats.</p> <p>Miquel was fast. Very fast. But the emphasis of this trip is exploring, not racing. So we pootled along the coast, stopping to photograph jellyfish and starfish. Throughout the trip we spotted a handful of jellyfish, but they were nothing to be alarmed about. In fact, the creatures were so beautiful they were one of the highlights of the marine life we saw.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50675861e286fbf8687cf318a1bdd142d306a3b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50675861e286fbf8687cf318a1bdd142d306a3b4/0_451_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Cowie swimming on the Costa Brava\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Cowie at the end of a swim</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second swim of the afternoon was off the sandy beach at Platja d\u2019Aro, a little further north, around a headland dotted with beautiful villas. It\u2019s a good way of nosing at some impressive property. As the sun started to go down, we rounded a final outcrop to a small beach. After a 2km swim, it was a pleasant walk back along the path to where we started, stopping to look down the cliffs to the water we\u2019d been swimming in.</p> <p>Our base for the next two nights was Girona, 60 miles north of Barcelona. On our first morning there we drove to Colera for the first swim of the day. It was early and the town was quiet as we headed past apartment blocks down to the beach. The only sign of life was at the shack hiring out kayaks and stand-up paddle boards. For this swim, 2km out-and-back, we dispensed with the neoprene and were accompanied by one of our group\u2019s family in kayaks. The scenery was stunning as we headed away from Colera \u2013 rocky outcrops, twisted pine trees and sheer cliffs rising out of the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86a72a4302080b27b27295381281a26af7f687b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86a72a4302080b27b27295381281a26af7f687b4/0_149_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Vies Braves swimming courses around the Costa Brava coastline. stopping to look at wildlife was a good, natural way of regrouping\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stopping to look at wildlife was a good, natural way of regrouping</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get to the next swim, we took a steep footpath out of Colera along the top of cliffs, stopping to take in the view of the bay. We climbed a few hills as the sun beat down, and then scrambled down a rocky path before climbing up again through a grassy meadow. We paused under some trees to catch our breath and cool down, letting the hikers overtake us again, before we headed back down to the beach and our next swim at Garbet.</p> <p>We swam along the coast to the next beach, dodging the sea urchins before diving into a gully where the water suddenly went deep and cold. We stopped to take photos of ourselves underwater, then it was back to the beach and a lift to a campsite in Colera for a lunch of delicious paella with ros\u00e9 wine.</p> <p>That evening we returned to Girona, which makes an excellent base if you are planning on hiring a car and exploring the local Vies Braves routes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a942eef9e3c981d7019b64f2734426c97ff7d5b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a942eef9e3c981d7019b64f2734426c97ff7d5b0/0_569_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Vies Braves swimming courses around the Costa Brava coastline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For those based in Barcelona, Vies Braves is a fun and original way to see lots of the city\u2019s coast in one day: the 8km Costa Barcelona is a magical mystery group tour of four swims, linked by minibus.</p> <p>We start at Barceloneta Beach, near the end of Las Ramblas, in company with a group from Barcelona\u2019s open water swimming club, with a 1km open water dash. It is fun to be swimming in a group of 20 swimmers: it\u2019s small enough to be sociable, and even though we don\u2019t speak Catalan we are made very welcome.</p> <p>After a quick snack of oranges and Spanish sausage we headed off in the bus for swim number two, a fun 2km in lumpy seas from Port Ginesta. The bus met us at the end of the swim with more snacks and then it was on to the longest swim of the day. We gathered at the end of the promenade in Sitges for a 4km swim west to Home Mort (Dead Man\u2019s Point) and those nudists.</p> <p>Some swimmers didn\u2019t join us for the full 4km but joined us at the halfway point. The swims aren\u2019t competitive so are suitable for all abilities \u2013 we tended to naturally form groups based on speed, but the faster swimmers were quite happy waiting for the slower ones. And stopping to look at wildlife was a good, natural way of regrouping.</p> <p>The final swim of the day was at Calella, north of Barcelona, where we saw a colony of shags and a flatfish. Back on the bus we tucked into our packed lunches before contentedly dozing our way back to Barcelona, a creditable 8km and lots of fun under our belts.<br>\u2022 <em>Holidays with </em><a href=\"http://costabrava.viesbraves.com/en/noticies/52/VIES-BRAVES-SWIMMING-AND-TRIATHLON-TRAINING-CAMPS-2016/\" title=\"\"><em>Vies Braves </em></a><em>can be tailormade but a five-day trip for a group of 10 costs from \u20ac800pp, including guides, transfers and half-board hotel accommodation.

Many of the incident reports reflect unconfirmed allegations or uncorroborated statements and claims \u2013 they are not statements of proven fact.</p> <p>\u201cAll alleged criminal incidents within the regional processing centre are referred to the Nauru Police Force (NPF) for investigation.

This is driven by hopelessness which is known to be the strongest predictor of suicide. </p> <p>\u201cSome self-harm, such as lip sewing, has a protest element and is common in prisoners as an expression of feeling powerless and voiceless.\u201d </p> <h2>Squalor</h2> <p>Other reports show the squalor and the difficulties getting medical treatment. One female asylum seeker, who has urinary incontinence, <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/08/nu-files/pdf/sca141271.pdf\">complained about how she was no longer provided with sanitary pads</a> to treat the condition.</p> <p>According to another report a female guard allegedly refused to let a child under 10 use a toilet and made her squat on the ground instead.

Trump has accused his Democratic rival of wanting to abolish it, a charge that she denies.<br></p> <p>His extraordinary remark on Tuesday was swiftly condemned by Democrats. Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said: \u201cThis is simple \u2013 what Trump is saying is dangerous. A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way.\u201d</p> <p>Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting took place in Newtown in 2012, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/763106278319198208\">went further in a tweet</a>: \u201cDon\u2019t treat this as a political misstep. It\u2019s an assassination threat, seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy &amp; crisis.\u201d<br></p> <p>British novelist Salman Rushdie then weighed in, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/763114271039451136\">tweeting</a>: \u201cOf course the Trump flacks are now trying to confuse the issue, but Senator Murphy is clear about what Trump meant.\u201d</p> <p>The claim was rejected by Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama and longtime Trump supporter. He responded on CNN: \u201cTotally wrong. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s at all what he meant.\u201d</p> <p>But Sessions acknowledged: \u201cIt may have been awkwardly phrased.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said later in reply to Sean Hannity on Fox News that he was referring to the political movement around the Second Amendment.</p> <p>Hannity asked: \u201cYou know, so obviously you\u2019re saying that there\u2019s a strong political movement within the Second Amendment, and if people mobilize and vote, they can stop Hillary from having this impact on the court. But that\u2019s not how the media is spinning it. What\u2019s your reaction to it?\u201d</p> <p>Trump replied: \u201cWell, I just heard about that, and it was amazing because nobody in that room thought anything other than what you just said. This is a political movement. This is a strong, powerful movement, the Second Amendment \u2026 there can be no other interpretation. Even reporters have told me \u2013 I mean give me a break.\u201d<br></p> <p>Trump has been striving to show more discipline on the campaign trail after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">string of gaffes in recent weeks</a>. He remained in control in Detroit on Monday when a speech on the economy was repeatedly interrupted by protesters. But in Wilmington, he apparently could not resist going off-script.<br></p> <p>Campaigners for gun control expressed outrage at his off-the-cuff remark. Po Murray, chair of the <a href=\"http://newtownaction.org/\">Newtown Action Alliance</a>, said: \u201cDonald Trump continues to pander to the corporate gun lobby and the gun extremists who thrive on fear and rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cAny suggestion that gun violence should be used to stop Hillary Clinton from appointing supreme court justices is dangerous and reckless. It\u2019s no surprise that 50 GOP national security experts have signed a letter making a pledge to not vote for him.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkCGlaze?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mark Glaze</a>, former executive director of Everytown for Gun Safety, said: \u201cIt may well be an incitement to violence, but understand it\u2019s the basic theory on which the modern gun industry is built. Their core audience is people who hate the government and believe they\u2019re going to have to take up arms against it. My guess is this is a deliberate dog whistle to that significant number of people.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people out there who hear this kind of thing in a certain way, and if they\u2019re already inclined to hatred of government and Hillary Clinton and see guns as a public policy solution, who knows what could happen?\u201d</p> <p>The concern was echoed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBegala\">Paul Begala</a>, a former adviser to Bill Clinton in the White House. \u201cThis is not something that should be joked about,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI hope in the best case you could say he was joking. It didn\u2019t seem like a joke to me. Tony Schwartz, the guy who wrote [Trump\u2019s book] The Art of the Deal, says Trump never jokes.</p> <p>\u201cI fear that an unbalanced person hears that in this inflamed environment and, God forbid, thinks that was a threat. I certainly take it as a threat, I really do, and Trump needs to apologise.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and National Security Agency, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/763108278276468736\">said on the same channel</a>: </p> <p>\u201cWell, let me say, if someone had have said that outside the hall he\u2019d be in the back of a police wagon now with the secret service questioning him.\u201d </p> <p>As yet another controversy threatened to engulf him, Trump\u2019s campaign insisted that his words had been misunderstood. Jason Miller, a spokesperson, attempted to explain the candidate\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s called the power of unification,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power. And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won\u2019t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called the uproar over Trump\u2019s remarks a \u201cdistraction created by the dishonest media.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe NRA represents law-abiding gun owners and we support lawful behavior,\u201d she wrote in an email. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe NRA and Donald Trump are calling for Second Amendment supporters to protect their constitutional right to self defense by defeating Hillary Clinton at the ballot box,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSecond Amendment voters understand the stakes. They understand that the Second Amendment is on the ballot.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s campaign went on the record in May saying that she believes the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision, a key victory for gun rights, was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">wrongly decided</a>.\u201d </p> <p>The 5-4 Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban as unconstitutional, ruling that Americans have an individual right to own guns for self-defense in their homes. </p> <p>\u201cIf Heller is overturned, that paves the way for extreme gun control for decades,\u201d Baker said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/763158125721497600\">official NRA Twitter feed</a> compared Trump\u2019s remarks to a 2008 comment from then-Senator Joseph Biden, who said \u201cIf [Obama] tries to fool with my Beretta, he\u2019s got a problem,\u201d and asked \u201cWas Joe Biden\u2026suggesting violence here?\u201d</p> <p>Katie Pavlich, a prominent conservative writer who spoke at this year\u2019s NRA annual meeting, also slammed the media\u2019s coverage of Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting: \u201cMedia totally exposed itself (again) today by assuming Second Amendment supporters are assassins instead of voters.\u201d </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/763134167794135040\">she added</a>: \u201cThat said Trump is reason Trump has no credibility/isn\u2019t given the benefit of the doubt when actually misunderstood.\u201d She was referencing Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/donald-trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-and-still-not-lose-voters\">remark in January</a> that \u201cI could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters.\u201d </p> <p>Pavlich wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not defending Trump or his comments, I\u2019m defending Second Amendment supporters.\u201d </p> <p>The supreme court has become a central election issue since the death earlier this year of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who has not yet been replaced. Trump claims that liberal judges could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/jun/17/trump-texas-rally-second-amendment-guns-orlando-shooting-video\">threaten the second amendment.</a></p> <p>Progressive pressure groups that have been watching the process closely joined the condemnation of Trump on Tuesday. Michael Keegan, president of <a href=\"http://www.pfaw.org/\">People for the American Way</a>, said: \u201cThere has been no shortage of inexcusable rhetoric from Trump, but suggesting gun violence is truly abhorrent. There is no place in our public discourse for this kind of statement, especially from someone seeking the nation\u2019s highest office.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Sroka, communications director of <a href=\"https://www.democracyforamerica.com/\">Democracy for America</a>, added: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little unclear whether Donald Trump was calling for his supporters to assassinate a Clinton court pick or take up an armed insurrection against a government that allowed her to appoint one. Either way, the only thing more insane than electing someone president who blows this kind of violent dog whistle would be buying the furious spin coming out of his campaign trying to explain it away.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has produced a shortlist of conservative justices that he hopes will appeal to the Republican base and deter those considering defecting to Clinton, who could set the court on a liberal trajectory for years to come.</p> <p>He told supporters on Tuesday: \u201cI guess there\u2019s a scenario in which this president could pick five supreme court justices, and if you pick two that are left, left, left, it\u2019s going to be a disaster for our country.\u201d<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">NRA had endorsed him early</a>, he added. \u201cWe want to replace with justices very much like Justice Scalia and that\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s so important. One of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also told the rally that Clinton is \u201cdangerous\u201d and could destroy the country from within because of her immigration policies.</p> <p>Trump was introduced by Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who brought up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/iran-executes-nuclear-scientist-shahram-amiri-returned-country-from-us\">the case of Shahram Amiri</a>, an Iranian nuclear scientist executed for spying for the US. Clinton received emails mentioning him on her controversial personal server when she was secretary of state.</p> <p>Giuliani said: \u201cRemember Hillary told us there was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-investigation-next-steps\">top secret information on her emails</a>? Remember she told us that. Well, she lied! And I don\u2019t know the connection between that and the death of Mr Amiri, but what I do know is it put a lot more attention on him when they found those emails. It certainly put him at great risk, even if they didn\u2019t find them, and it shows you that when the director of the FBI said she was extremely careless, he was being kind.\u201d</p> <p>But Giuliani repeatedly waved away chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from the crowd.</p> <p><em>Lois Beckett contributed reporting.</em></p>",

Why has the government allowed these incidents to continue?</p> <p><strong>Turnbull</strong>: As you know, and Scott as a former immigration minister may want to add to this, but we continue to support the Nauru government to provide for the health, welfare and safety of all transferees and refugees on Nauru. The material that\u2019s been published will be examined. It\u2019s not clear over what time period it relates, at least not in the report that I saw. <strong>It will be carefully examined to see if there are any complaints there or issues there that were not properly addressed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Morrison</strong>: I note the incidents reports, as you know Paul, are reports of allegations, <strong>they are not findings of fact in relation to an incident</strong>. And the reporting system that was put in place was to monitor what those allegations are and provide an opportunity to follow up and discussion both at the centre level and between governments, and that\u2019s their purpose. It\u2019s important to stress that incidents reports of themselves aren\u2019t a reporting of fact.

Indeed, that had long been the case - on pretty much every surface. The most dominant world No 1 in the history of the ATP rankings went on to win the French too - finally - and seemed in good shape for Wimbledon.

He was able to return to training following an operation, but the doubts meant his mother had not bought tickets to Rio. \u201cDaniel had a very serious injury,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure if he was going to make it to Rio.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T10:05:00.254Z\">at 11.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a9a90be4b0f5d064841bd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-09T09:58:37.155Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a recap of today\u2019s gold medals on offer, courtesy of my colleague Claire Phipps\u2019 exhaustive briefing earlier</strong>.</p> <h2>Diary</h2> <p>Find the full schedule in your timezone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/05/rio-olympics-2016-full-events-schedule\">on this link</a>.

  "<p>A neat, if alarming, explanation for the astonishing rise of political outsiders across the western world is the idea that we live in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\" title=\"\">\u201cpost-truth era\u201d: one in which support for outsiders soars</a> when they make preposterous claims that are obviously not true. In contrast, when those who are seen to be on the inside \u2013 elected politicians and policy experts \u2013 counter with informed assessments, their popularity slumps.</p> <p>There is something in this. Uncontaminated by the complexities of power, the outsiders\u2019 propositions are untested. They utter words to euphoric audiences, and do not implement policies that can fuel intense disillusionment and cries of betrayal. Yet the concept of the post-truth era is also dangerously untruthful in its implicit evocation of a recent past that was a glorious age of candour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The implication is untrue partly because it cannot be true. Truth in politics is always partly subjective, and&#xa0;rightly so. One person\u2019s noble public&#xa0;spending commitment will be another\u2019s reckless waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. More importantly, the concept of the post-truth era obscures the main&#xa0;reason why mainstream parties have become so fragile.</p> <p>In the new, traumatically constraining&#xa0;context of the globalised economy, mainstream parties on the left&#xa0;and the right have failed calamitously to find ways of telling the truth about what they can do, they want&#xa0;to do and they should do. Their failure to frame arguments based on an essence of truth gives space for the outsiders to flourish mendaciously.</p> <p>Only a year ago in Britain a general election was contested on a scandalous untruth. George Osborne framed the election around his plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-freeze-fuel-duty-2015-budget-surplus\" title=\"\">wipe out the deficit in this parliament</a>, a framing as tenuous in its relationship with the truth as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-wall-plan-texas-central-america-migrants\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico</a>.</p> <p>In the drama of post-Brexit events the chancellor announced almost casually that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\" title=\"\">dropped the target</a> he was&#xa0;never going to meet. Yet 12 months&#xa0;earlier the election was dominated by the deficit mistruth. Ed Miliband was forced, or felt he was forced, to make arguments he did not believe in order to appear \u201cresponsible\u201d on spending. Miliband had to propose Osborne-like cuts or face accusations of&#xa0;tax bombshells. In order to appear even more \u201cresponsible\u201d than Osborne in relation to the untruthful deficit target, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-labour-to-reject-pressure-to-match-tory-nhs-spending-plans-10182796.html\" title=\"\">Labour refused to commit even to the modest increases in NHS spending</a> that the Conservatives had proposed. Privately, Labour\u2019s leaders knew that they would have to spend much more, but they could not speak openly because they would be accused of spending recklessly rather than focusing on the deficit.</p> <p>When Miliband did speak the truth&#xa0;on&#xa0;BBC\u2019s pre-election Question Time, insisting that he did not accept that the spending of the last Labour government had caused the financial crash, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/30/ed-miliband-snp-opposition-question-time-election\" title=\"\">honesty was viewed widely as a fatal gaffe</a>. He should have lied and&#xa0;played the untruthful game in which the profligacy of the past would be replaced by an Osborne-like stringency, even though Osborne had no idea how he would be so stringent without wrecking lives and the economy&#xa0;\u2013 and would later drop the&#xa0;whole objective. The entire election&#xa0;was based on a fantasy.</p> <p>The false framing was obviously a disaster for the Labour party. It lost an election trying too hard to be like Osborne, even though the chancellor was not speaking the truth. The failure to frame a coherent pre-election left-of-centre argument in part explains the rise&#xa0;of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Thanks to the ineptitude of his internal opponents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\" title=\"\">Corbyn has been granted a second leadership contest</a> to show that he could not dissemble if he tried \u2013 conveying to some a grizzled integrity, in contrast to those trapped into not being able to tell the truth. His platform is more solid than it was before the official start of the second contest now that a court has ruled that recently signed-up party members will be allowed to vote and more of Corbyn\u2019s supporters have been elected to the party\u2019s ruling national executive.</p> <p>But the false framing of the fundamental economic argument has not proven to be a great triumph for Osborne. He is now on the backbenches, his deficit game-playing a device consigned to history as Theresa May gives the early impression at least of seeking a more balanced approach.</p> <p>The biggest victim is the entire electorate, which has been unable to benefit from a grown-up debate about how we pay for public services, or to reach more nuanced conclusions about&#xa0;the priority that should be given to wiping out a deficit.</p> <p>There is a mountain of other depressing examples that show the UK&#xa0;suffers when mainstream leaders are&#xa0;trapped in the pre-post-truth era that was also untruthful. Why was there&#xa0;so little preparation in Whitehall on the detailed implications of Brexit? Part of the answer is that the prime minister and&#xa0;others could not admit in public the&#xa0;obvious: that there was a possibility they might lose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/01/george-osborne-scraps-2020-budget-surplus-plan\">George Osborne scraps 2020 budget surplus plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair, if there had been evidence of extensive Brexit preparations the media would have gone for Cameron.

  "<p>Millions of people living in areas with a high density of minority ethnic households are paying an \u201cethnic penalty\u201d of up to \u00a3450 a year each in higher car insurance premiums, according to a report co-written by the former equality commissioner Trevor Phillips.</p> <p>The study said there was a strong statistical link between the proportion of minority ethnic households in an area and the cost of car insurance, and added that the phenomenon existed in well-off and poorer areas. It concluded that the way insurers calculated their premiums \u201chas definitely produced an inequality of outcome to the detriment of BME [black and minority ethnic] groups\u201d.<br></p> <p>The report prompted an angry reaction from the insurance industry, with the main trade body, the <a href=\"https://www.abi.org.uk/\">Association of British Insurers</a> (ABI), saying it \u201cmakes serious accusations using a flawed analysis\u201d and was compiled \u201cby people with no understanding of how car insurers price their policies\u201d.<br></p> <p>The report was published by Webber Phillips, a consultancy co-founded by Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and was commissioned by a firm of personal injury solicitors.<br></p> <p>Webber Phillips was asked to investigate whether there was evidence of systemic bias and said it had found a \u201cstrong statistical relationship\u201d between the prevalence of minority ethnic households and the higher cost of average motor insurance premiums for all motorists in each postcode area. The report said these additional costs affected an estimated 12 million people \u2013 more than one in five UK adults \u2013 regardless of the driver\u2019s ethnic origin.<br></p> <p>The authors used data provided by the AA for all 124 postcode areas in the UK and said their analysis showed that about 60% of the variation in average premium could be accounted for by the difference in the ethnic composition of the area, rising to 90% in some cases. \u201cThe variations cannot be accounted for by prevalence of crime, fear of crime, available claims data or by relative affluence,\u201d they said.<br></p> <p>Insurers were imposing a penalty on motorists living in areas with a high proportion of minority ethnic households, and this varied from an average of \u00a354 in Manchester to \u00a3458 in London, said the authors, adding that their findings suggested that some groups were suffering a bigger penalty than others.<br></p> <p>Phillips and his co-author, Richard Webber, said some people may conclude that the so-called ethnic effect described in the report might simply be a proxy for high levels of crime. \u201cIntuitively, most people assume that ethnic minorities are poorer than average and live in areas with elevated crime levels,\u201d they said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, this explanation is hard to sustain, if only for the reason that the minority group mostly obviously affected in the UK, Indian-heritage Britons, are far wealthier than other racial minorities and economically almost indistinguishable from white Britons. In fact, this group is slightly more likely than white Britons to occupy higher-skilled professional jobs. Yet they, too, pay a significant ethnic penalty.\u201d<br></p> <p>The report said it was difficult to test the effect of actual levels of crime since reported crime data was \u201cnotoriously unreliable\u201d. Instead, the authors said, they had focused on fear of car theft in an area using the most recent <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmar2016\">official crime survey data</a>.<br></p> <p>Phillips said insurers urgently needed to examine their procedures, either to demonstrate beyond doubt that the ethnic penalty did not exist or ensure that new systems were put in place to eliminate discrimination.<br></p> <p>\u201cPublicly available government data demonstrates that high levels of vehicle crime are unlikely to be linked to ethnicity, and our analysis shows that the ethnic penalty persists even in areas populated by prosperous minorities \u2026 We examined the effect of other factors, such as fear of crime and available claims data, but we did not find that these factors carried any significant weight in our model,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>However, James Dalton, the director of general insurance policy at the ABI, rejected the findings. \u201cCar insurers have never and will never set prices based on ethnicity, as it is ethically wrong and prohibited by the 2010 Equality Act. Premiums are higher in certain parts of the country because claims costs are higher in certain parts of the country,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis report was compiled without any consultation with the insurance industry, by people with no understanding of how car insurers price their policies, and was paid for by a firm of solicitors with a vested interest in fuelling the compensation culture.\u201d<br></p> <p>The authors of the report, commissioned by Thompsons Solicitors, said that without access to data held by insurers, they could not rule out the possibility of other factors having a role to play, such as taste in vehicles, age profile and immigration status.<br></p>",

  "<p>In 2013, at a conference on endangered languages, a retired teacher named Linda Lambrecht announced the extraordinary discovery of a previously unknown language. Lambrecht \u2013 who is Chinese-Hawaiian, 71 years old, warm but no-nonsense \u2013 called it <a href=\"http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21440949/nearly-lost-language-discovered-in-hawaii\">Hawaii Sign Language</a>, or HSL. In front of a room full of linguists, she demonstrated that its core vocabulary \u2013 words such as \u201cmother\u201d, \u201cpig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d \u2013 was distinct from that of other sign languages.</p> <p>The linguists were immediately convinced. William O\u2019Grady, the chair of the linguistics department at the University of Hawaii, called it \u201cthe first time in 80 years that a new language has been discovered in the United States \u2014 and maybe the last time.\u201d But the new language found 80 years ago was in remote Alaska, whereas HSL was hiding in plain sight in Honolulu, a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. It was the kind of discovery that made the world seem larger.</p> <p>The last-minute arrival of recognition and support for HSL was a powerful, almost surreal vindication for Lambrecht, whose first language is HSL. For decades, it was stigmatised or ignored; now the language has acquired an agreed-upon name, an official \u201clanguage code\u201d from the <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html\">International Organization for Standardization</a>, the attention of linguists around the world, and a three-year grant from the<a href=\"http://www.eldp.net/\"> Endangered Languages Documentation Programme</a> at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/03/the-race-to-save-a-dying-language-podcast\">The race to save a dying language \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just as linguists were substantiating its existence, HSL stood on the brink of extinction, remembered by just a handful of signers. Unless the language made a miraculous recovery, Lambrecht feared that her announcement might turn out to be HSL\u2019s obituary.</p> <p>Three years after announcing its existence, Lambrecht is still unearthing her language sign by sign. She may be the only person in the world who still uses HSL on a regular basis, signing into a camera while a linguist named James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodward and a handful of graduate students from the University of Hawaii document her every move.</p> <p>Led by Lambrecht, Woodward, and researcher Barbara Earth, the project aims to document what may be the last-ever conversations of native HSL signers. The goal is to record at least 20 hours of high-quality video footage of natural HSL and then transcribe, translate, and archive it. The researchers hope that this work \u2013 along with a series of illustrated handbooks depicting over 1,000 signs, and a regular class at the University of Hawaii set to begin next year \u2013 will jump-start the revitalisation of HSL.</p> <p>The project faces numerous obstacles. The first is the scepticism of many of the remaining signers themselves. Hawaii\u2019s tiny Deaf community is deeply divided. Some say HSL is not a real language, others see it as backward; still others are sceptical of Lambrecht.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178/0_0_556_1155/481.jpg\" alt=\"Dying Language\" width=\"481\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Christian Montenegro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: dutchuncle.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the gravest threat to HSL is <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL), which is advancing across the globe \u2013 from Hawaii to Thailand to Togo \u2013 just as fast as English. The Deaf world, intensely local until recently, is consolidating and globalising in unprecedented ways. And the forward march of ASL, which in certain ways brings people together, also poses a significant danger to many of the estimated 400 sign languages used all over the world \u2013 most of which we know nothing about.</p> <p>Hawaii is a bellwether, but Deaf culture all around the world \u2013 for many on the inside it is a \u201ccapital-D\u201d culture, not a \u201clower-case-d\u201d disability \u2013 faces threats from every direction. The \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of deaf students means that they are placed in hearing schools, where they are encouraged to be just like everyone else but with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, in a process that some call deliberate assimilation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/16/bionic-ears-cochlear-implants-transformed-lives-children\">Cochlear implants</a> (and the potential of gene therapy) even more fundamentally endanger sign languages \u2013 some Deaf activists condemn such \u201ccures\u201d as <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/sociologylens/2011/02/24/cochlear-implants-miracle-technology-or-cultural-genocide/\">being akin to genocide</a>.</p> <p>If the loss of a particular language such as HSL means the end of a whole expressive system, the disappearance of sign language in general \u2013 the only fully fledged form of language completely independent of speech \u2013 would permanently impoverish human communication.</p> <p>Like every natural language, HSL is the evolved product of a specific history, the unconscious creation of a community. For it to survive, local signers will have to make a deliberate choice to use it. The same may be increasingly true of Deafness itself. The story of HSL raises crucial questions in an age of globalisation: Do cultures on the margins have a future? Will enough people choose to be that different, and will they do it together?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Though they parallel spoken languages in certain ways, sign languages represent a fundamentally different way of communicating. They neither derive from, nor correspond to, spoken languages. Nor are all sign languages mutually intelligible, as hearing people often assume \u2013 they are as various as spoken languages.</p> <p>Their historical evolution is distinctive. Infants can sign before they can speak, and the great sign language linguist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/william-stokoe-jr-sign-language-advocate-dies-at-80.html\">William Stokoe</a> argued that sign may have preceded speech in the history of human language. It\u2019s considered normal for one in 1,000 children to be born profoundly deaf, but places with higher rates of inherited deafness \u2013 such as the village of <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/deaf-arab-villagers-create-new-language/\">al-Sayyid in Israel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-a-village-in-bali-where-everyone-knows-sign-language-511\">Bengkala in Bali</a> \u2013 have been natural hotspots for sign languages.</p> <p>For sign languages, and for Deaf culture more broadly, intergenerational transmission is far from straightforward. The vast majority of deaf adults give birth to hearing children, while most deaf children are born to hearing adults who have no connection with the Deaf communities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not just gestures that anyone can immediately grasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not \u201cjust\u201d gestures that anyone can immediately grasp. \u201cIconic\u201d signs, where the gesture self-evidently expresses meaning, play a role in every sign language, but even they can be wonderfully nuanced. In HSL, for instance, \u201ccry\u201d is signed with spread-finger \u201ctears\u201d running out from the sides of the eyes, while \u201cbawl\u201d has the fingers running straight down. Still, abstraction and convention are essential, just as in speech, because not everything can be expressed with self-evident gestures. There is nothing obvious, for example, about the HSL sign for \u201cman\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d: a spread hand moving down across the head.</p> <p>For most of recorded history, sign languages have been effectively invisible to hearing people. It was not until William Stokoe\u2019s groundbreaking study of ASL, published in 1960, that any sign language had been analysed as a fully fledged communication system with a grammar of its own. In 1965 Stokoe published an ASL dictionary, also the first of its kind.</p> <p>Now that the kind of geographical isolation that once bred new languages is no more, sign languages represent something of a final frontier. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how many sign languages there are,\u201d says Albert Bickford of the global sign languages team at the language database <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/\">Ethnologue</a>. \u201cIt seems reasonable to assume that the majority of sign languages currently in use in the world have not been discovered yet,\u201d Victoria Nyst, a linguist at Leiden University, told me.</p> <p>The most recent edition of Ethnologue, published earlier this year, mentions 141 sign languages. Over a hundred more have been reported, Bickford says, but no solid information on them exists \u2013 just the barest indication that Deaf people may sign differently in a particular place. We may never know much about these languages, or even confirm their existence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lambrecht\u2019s announcement in 2013<strong> </strong>was the culmination of a lifetime of work. Born deaf, she hears almost nothing, barely even the noise of a siren blaring in her street. \u201cI grew up very frustrated, thinking I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m hearing! I want to be an actress, I want to be a dancer, I want to be a movie star!\u201d Lambrecht told me late last year at the University of Hawaii. \u201cI was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t be those things.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.linfo.org/teletype.html\">Teletype</a>, an early form of texting, and <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/closed-captioning-television\">closed captioning</a>, which made TV and films accessible, were life-changing developments for her when they became widespread in the 1970s. \u201cAfter that, I settled down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hated being deaf until that communication barrier broke down, when all those devices came out.\u201d</p> <p>The youngest of seven children, Lambrecht started signing HSL at home in the late 1940s \u2013 learning it from two of her older brothers, who were both deaf like her. She was probably one of the last people anywhere to learn HSL naturally, as a first language, and picking it up from family was particularly unusual. By then, the dorm at Hawaii\u2019s only deaf school was the closest thing HSL had to a homeland \u2013 it was there that one of her brothers learned it.</p> <p>But ASL was already coming in. Soon after the second world war, an unprecedented number of Deaf mainlanders came to Hawaii to work or retire. Within a few decades, ASL was dominant, HSL almost dormant. \u201cWe would get a lot of insults, a lot of negativity,\u201d Lambrecht recalled. \u201cDeaf people here would put themselves into an inferior category compared to the people who brought ASL. People said, \u2018They\u2019re from America, they\u2019re white people, they know better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lambrecht made a living by teaching ASL for 33 years, mostly to hearing people, but in her spare time she pursued HSL, tracking down old signers in hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cWe used to go to the other islands to drum up people, and now they\u2019re all dead, dead, dead,\u201d her husband, Jeff, said. Interested mainlanders had documented a small number of local signs, and they encouraged Lambrecht to do more. Years in, she realised she had been collecting the remains of a complete and original language.</p> <p>Without funding and without linguistic expertise, Lambrecht\u2019s efforts stalled until 2007, when a woman named Barbara Earth came to Hawaii and enrolled in her ASL class. After a career working on gender and development in Asia and Africa, Earth was going deaf and wanted to learn how to sign.</p> <p>Embracing Lambrecht\u2019s cause and digging into HSL history, Earth hunted for money to support the project. Three years later, she found enough for a pilot study, interviewing 19 elderly Deaf people and two children of Deaf adults on four Hawaiian islands. William O\u2019Grady, the linguistics department chair at the University of Hawaii, agreed to host the project at the university: \u201cBarbara knocked on my door and said there was an unknown sign language here in Hawaii, and she needed help to prove that it existed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf/0_60_5870_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An initial estimate of up to 280 surviving HSL signers was soon revised down to 40, then down to just 10 or so old-timers still likely to be competent in HSL. ASL had made deep inroads even among these signers, but there was evidence, especially from Lambrecht\u2019s signs, that HSL was distinct, and lay close enough to the surface to be recovered. Spoken languages such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/basque.shtml\">Basque</a>, Welsh, and Hawaiian have come back from the brink of extinction \u2013 could HSL be the first sign language to do it?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For James Woodward, the mass extinction<strong> </strong>of sign languages is bound up in prejudice and chauvinism. He believes that every local sign language should have the chance to become a valued, modernised language of education, giving communities a choice and a chance at continuity. Like the spread of English, the triumph of ASL might enable communication, but convenience cannot replace intimacy and history, which people soon forget ever existed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/07/british-sign-language-changing\">Signs of the times: deaf community minds its language</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One day late last year in Honolulu, I sat in on a gathering that included some of the last active HSL signers. Besides Lambrecht, there were the three other elderly signers who had joined the project within the last year. Their funny and furious signing was almost all in ASL, as usual, but here and there old bits of HSL were surfacing.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Deaf culture or what!?\u201d Hilda Lopez signed. \u201cI love it, I love it, I love it.\u201d She kissed her own hands as she signed. \u201cHSL is really number one in my life. The ones who don\u2019t like it are small-minded!\u201d</p> <p>Lopez explained to me that her first name in English is Hilda, but her name sign \u2013 her real, everyday name in the Deaf community \u2013 is a pointing gesture towards the mouth, based on an incident at her fifth birthday party when someone fired a BB gun and shot out some of her teeth. It\u2019s a classic HSL name sign: blunt, comic and personal, based on physical characteristics and memorable incidents.</p> <p>Like any language, HSL can be broken down by linguists, but its personality, its characteristic style of discourse, is harder to get a handle on. Even when signing ASL, Lopez seems to embody the HSL style. \u201cWhen they\u2019re using ASL, people talk too long and make other people bored,\u201d she told me. \u201cHSL is short and thrilling and fast.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>HSL has a bigger 'signing space' than ASL \u2013 anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HSL has a bigger \u201csigning space\u201d than ASL \u2013 meaningful signs can be made anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso. Signs that occur not on the hands but elsewhere on the body also play an important role. \u201cKick\u201d is signed only with the leg, for instance, while a raised eyebrow is a vital bit of grammar, signalling a yes or no question, or a conditional clause beginning with \u201cif\u201d. The \u201cvocalisations\u201d accompanying certain signs, which fellow signers can sometimes lip-read, echo different spoken languages: borrowed words from <a href=\"http://www.polynesia.com/polynesian_culture/hawaii/languages.html#.V6m7VzYrKuo\">Hawaiian</a>, English and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/12/living/pidgin-english-hawaii/\">Hawaii Pidgin</a>.</p> <p>Lopez thinks and talks to herself in sign. \u201cI\u2019m 100% Deaf!\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI don\u2019t hear sound, but I can feel it, I feel the body vibrations in my chest: bass drums, police sirens. The only thing I can hear is fireworks \u2014 I don\u2019t like the smell of them, they make me sick, but I like the noise and vibration.\u201d</p> <p>Lopez never knew her biological parents, but she is fiercely proud of her <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/06/native-hawaiian-population/\">Native Hawaiian</a> and mixed-ethnic roots. At least one piece of evidence, an 1821 letter discovered by Barbara Earth, seems to link HSL to the Native Hawaiian past. In that year, an American missionary, newly arrived in the <a href=\"http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/political-history.shtml\">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, met a deaf man and bargained with him over 40 sticks of firewood and a pig. Some of the man\u2019s signs were \u201cin common use\u201d, seemingly among both deaf and hearing people, wrote the missionary. The signs he recorded for \u201cpig\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, \u201csee\u201d, and a system of counting by clapping, are still present in HSL today.</p> <p>The rate of inherited deafness in Hawaii is normal. But by the late 19th century, waves of Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Filipino immigrants were coming to Hawaii to work on the American-run plantations, and a new multi-racial Deaf community took shape in Honolulu, including boot shiners, launderers, and flower sellers. There was even what a contemporary newspaper called a \u201cfancy deaf wedding\u201d, where 80 of the guests used \u201cthe sign language\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe turning point, the beginning of the end of HSL,\u201d according to Barbara Earth, was the founding of Hawaii\u2019s deaf school in 1914. Like most schools at the time, it promoted <a href=\"http://www.deafwebsites.com/education/oralism.html\">oralism</a>, the system of lip-reading and speaking that is almost universally despised in Deaf communities for being painful, unnatural and ineffective. But for a while the school was also a unique environment for the clandestine transmission of HSL. One former student, Norman Galapin, told me that he learned HSL \u201con the playgrounds and in the dorm\u201d, though \u201cif the teacher saw you signing, sometimes they would slap your hands, or hit you with a ruler, or pinch your cheek.\u201d</p> <p>During the 1940s, HSL was already a language in transition, according to Galapin: \u201cThey weren\u2019t using the old [HSL] sign for \u2018mother\u2019, they were using this [ASL] one, but they were still using the old sign for \u2018father\u2019.\u201d Starting in 1939, a few charismatic teachers from the mainland played a vital role in overturning oralism and legitimising sign language, but they ended up promoting ASL over HSL in the process.</p> <p>Employment, education and access to government services \u2013 from court interpreters to mental health provision in sign language \u2013 were perennial problems in the community, but many deaf Hawaiians thrived as master carpenters, printers, mechanics, postal workers and even ukulele makers. As elsewhere, an informal Deaf Club was at the centre of an unusually tightknit community, organising Christmas parties, bowling nights and an annual summer camp-out on the beach, with up to 100 people fishing and cooking for two weeks straight.</p> <p>Yet Hilda Lopez, like many Deaf Hawaiians, left Hawaii for the mainland for education and for work, arriving in California in her teens. The culture shock was intense: \u201cIt was all ASL, and I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople seemed to know so much, I felt that I wasn\u2019t very smart\u2026. I got confused and I lost HSL, I didn\u2019t really remember it any more.\u201d Only now, haltingly peeling away the layers of ASL, is she starting to reclaim the language.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No other sign language comes close to having the influence of ASL. Accurate, up-to-date signer numbers do not exist for any sign language, but most of the larger ones are not even yet secure in their own countries. There are more than 20 million deaf people in China, for instance, but <a href=\"https://www.start-american-sign-language.com/chinese-sign-language_html\">Chinese Sign Language</a>, which has hardly been documented, has only been acknowledged as a distinct language for the last 30 years.</p> <p>By comparison, ASL is a powerhouse, supported and promoted by institutions such as the <a href=\"https://nad.org/\">National Association of the Deaf</a>, and <a href=\"http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/\">Gallaudet University</a> in Washington DC, which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s only university with programmes and services specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students\u201d. Gallaudet plays a critical role in the American Deaf community and in the life of ASL. Until recently, the university supported both a college prep centre in Honolulu (to ensure qualified deaf applicants to Gallaudet) and ASL interpreter training in Hawaii (to bolster ASL more broadly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c/0_29_5311_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht and Emily Jo Noschese speaking in Hawaii Sign Language in Honolulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht having a conversation in Hawaii Sign Language, Honolulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ASL may now be going global, but the language is at least partly rooted in local sign languages that have long since gone extinct. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_Sign_Language\">French Sign Language</a> was the first modern, \u201cmethodical\u201d sign language, codified in the 1760s and 70s for formal instruction from existing signs used in the Deaf community of Paris by the <a href=\"http://giving.gallaudet.edu/HOF/pastinductees/the-abbe-charles-michel-de-lepee\">Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e</a>. When America\u2019s first school for the deaf opened in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817, French Sign Language was imported and likely fused with a handful of existing New England sign languages. The result was ASL. (British Sign Language, dominant in the UK but only granted official status in 2003, is not directly related to ASL.)</p> <p>Today, there are at least 500,000 ASL signers in the US, while ASL and ASL-derived sign languages are also widespread across the Caribbean, the Pacific and much of Africa and south-east Asia. The language\u2019s increasing dominance in countries on every continent reflects the strength of Deaf culture in America and the role that well-meaning American missionaries and educators have played in spreading Deaf education through ASL.</p> <p>In the past, James Woodward told me, missionaries would often tell deaf people in other countries that they didn\u2019t have a language. \u201cIt\u2019s improving now,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I saw that going on as late as 1999 in Thailand, when some Americans came over. I think there\u2019s a growing awareness in the Deaf community in the US of how ASL has really endangered many other sign languages, and even destroyed some.\u201d</p> <p>As with English, prestige plays a major role in the growth of ASL. The linguist Victoria Nyst has written that \u201csigners in West Africa tend to perceive ASL-based sign languages as being superior to sign languages of local origin.\u201d Similarly, Misella Tomita, a young Gallaudet graduate from Hawaii, described visiting the Netherlands and seeing everyone using ASL rather than Dutch Sign Language: \u201cI felt like ASL is taking over the world.\u201d Closer to home, Woodward has studied Black ASL, which seems to have evolved in the second half of the 19th century at segregated deaf schools in the southern US. The dialect, which is an inspiration to Lambrecht, carries a heavy stigma and has become highly endangered. Almost all black signers now use standard ASL.</p> <p>At the Hawaii School for the Deaf and Blind, ASL became the standard in 1960. Today, more than half the teachers are Deaf and students are expected to sign ASL while learning to read and write English. HSL is only used, occasionally, by one dedicated teacher, and Linda\u2019s proposal to teach the language there was turned down.</p> <p>\u201cI think ASL is the reason for the decline of HSL,\u201d Woodward told me matter-of-factly, but then added: \u201cYou can\u2019t really separate the personal issues from the linguistic issues.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts enormous stress on a community. For years, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/mexico-language-ayapaneco-dying-out\">last two fluent speakers of Ayapaneco in Mexico</a> were not on speaking terms, until outside pressures and incentives convinced them to reconcile. According to William O\u2019Grady, one language with just 60 speakers has four competing writing systems. In any community that speaks an endangered language, there are often groups who think the language is not worth saving. \u201cBut usually when it\u2019s too late, there\u2019s a deep sense of regret,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.</p> <p>In Hawaii, the remaining community of HSL signers is deeply divided. Lambrecht is the face of the language, but as a past president of the Aloha State Association of the Deaf (ASAD), she is on the opposite \u201cside\u201d from many of the older signers, who belong to a group known as the Diamond Head School Alumni (after the former name of the deaf school).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts stress on a community. The remaining HSL speakers are deeply divided</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The two organisations are the institutional expression of a seemingly intractable split in the Deaf community that dates back to at least the 1970s. Some explain it as generational, historical and linguistic, but it is also personal, visceral and mysteriously self-perpetuating. In 2014, when the deaf school marked its 100th anniversary, there were two separate celebrations: one for the Diamond Head group, one for the group Lambrecht is a part of. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just natural now, this fighting,\u201d Lopez told me.</p> <p>Because HSL was in retreat by the 1950s, most younger Deaf people can hardly sign in the language \u2013 there was virtually nowhere for them to pick it up. Many take great pride in their identity as Deaf Hawaiians and emphatically support HSL as a symbol of that identity. But some of the most fluent of the older HSL signers, in the Diamond Head group, are deeply ambivalent about reviving the language. \u201cEven though they use it in their conversations, they don\u2019t feel that HSL is a real language,\u201d said Darlene Ewan, a community activist who teaches at the deaf school.</p> <p>Early on, Wanda Andrew, who is part of the Diamond Head group, warned off the researchers: \u201cI said, \u2018To tell you the truth, for HSL it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cThe loss of HSL is sad, but it was just sort of a mixture of everything, like chop suey, just kind of like an accent.\u201d For Andrew, who is in her 70s, ASL enabled a cosmopolitan life, from studies at Gallaudet to decades on the mainland and eventual marriage to a Deaf Australian man.</p> <p>Explaining why some keep their distance from the project, Andrew added that \u201cPeople will just say they don\u2019t want to, because they don\u2019t want to work with Linda.\u201d She continued, \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t remember [signs], then they just don\u2019t remember [them]. Or they might be afraid of what it\u2019s for, or they don\u2019t want to feel dumb\u2026 I don\u2019t support Linda, I think she\u2019s a little narcissistic.\u201d</p> <p>Others close to the Diamond Head group agreed that personal animosity and questions of authority \u2013 whose signs to record and revitalise? \u2013 are part of the problem. Lambrecht\u2019s supporters counter that she has almost single-handedly led the revitalisation effort. Lambrecht herself points to the lingering power of the stigma: \u201cHSL is in their hearts, but they\u2019re resistant. They want to be modern.\u201d</p> <p>The divide, which has implications for how the language is documented, is now reflected in a similar rift between the researchers. Earth and Woodward now acknowledge that ASL must have had a deeper impact than was initially understood, obliterating HSL and leaving in its place a hybrid of ASL and HSL that Woodward calls CHSL (Creolised HSL).</p> <p>Earth believes that when signers refer to HSL today, they may actually mean CHSL \u2013 a view Woodward does not share.After meeting more members of the Diamond Head group, Earth argues that CHSL is the only thing left: \u201cI have never seen pure HSL. Fewer and fewer old folks retain strong HSL elements\u2026 They cannot recover pure HSL because they never knew it.\u201d Woodward counters that \u201cthe past two years have shown that Lambrecht is using a different language from CHSL\u201d \u2013 during recording sessions where Earth, increasingly estranged from the project, was not present.</p> <p>The signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d have become a particular flashpoint in this dispute. Woodward argues that Lambrecht\u2019s distinctive signs for these colour terms make semantic sense, because they are clearly related to the HSL signs for \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cbamboo\u201d and \u201cpineapple\u201d. But other signers were incredulous, saying they had never seen the signs before and suggesting that they might be specific to Lambrecht or her family. Their own signs for those colours were basically ASL, and they couldn\u2019t remember any others that might be original to HSL. Earth felt that the pressure to find such \u201coriginal\u201d non-ASL signs risked distorting the research.</p> <p>\u201cIf no other person has a sign and Linda has a sign, I don\u2019t know what else to do except use her sign,\u201d said Woodward, who worked with the last known signer of Chiang Mai Sign Language in northern Thailand before he died of complications from diabetes in early 2015. Lambrecht\u2019s signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, and \u201cyellow\u201d are likely to be the standard for teaching HSL going forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s only one person left,\u201d Woodward said, \u201cthen that\u2019s what you have to document.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Now in its final month, the three-year project to document and revitalise HSL has made progress, but the hardest work remains ahead. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to do everything we wanted,\u201d Woodward told me recently. He is applying to the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme for a six-month grant extension. Even now, he said, the team is still finding new signs.</p> <p>While she continues her work with Woodward, Lambrecht is looking beyond Hawaii, since ASL is spreading to other islands across the Pacific: \u201cI want to tell people there: it\u2019s not that you\u2019re stuck with your local sign language, you can borrow signs from ASL, but please don\u2019t throw out your local language.\u201d Woodward believes that many of the Pacific\u2019s innumerable islands had, or may still have, traditional, indigenous sign languages of their own \u2013 he has already identified one on Majuro, one of the Marshall Islands.</p> <p>\u201cTime is passing quickly,\u201d Lambrecht said the last time I talked to her. The oldest signer who had joined the project, a Japanese-Hawaiian woman named Mildred, was dying. \u201cI remember Mildred would always tell me, \u2018I don\u2019t like HSL, I like ASL, it\u2019s for educated people like me,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018No, no, no, it\u2019s our local language!\u2019\u201d Mildred was seen as one of HSL\u2019s remaining masters, but she had been reluctant to sign for the camera when I visited last year.</p> <p>Then in February, Linda told me, Mildred had a bad fall and went to the hospital. She couldn\u2019t walk and was now under hospice care, living with her son. Linda visited her recently: \u201cI saw her signing \u2013 and I noticed that she had reverted to HSL. We were just shocked. The others didn\u2019t understand her, I said let me translate. Now when I visit her I try to catch every story I can, while she\u2019s still here.

Her rival Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was somewhere, either ahead or behind. She had no idea. So she kept pushing her arms her feet, her stomach until near the end she burped. And as she did she thought she would vomit in the water for all the world to see on live television.</p> <p>When Ledecky finished and realized her quest to be the second woman to take gold in the 200m, 400m and 800m at the same Olympics was still alive, she was not elated. She didn\u2019t pump her fist or shout. \u201cI was done when I hit the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a really tough race \u2026 the closest I\u2019ve come to throwing up.\u201d</p> <p>Ledecky makes winning gold look so easy it\u2019s hard to forget the agony she puts herself through in every race. The 200m is her toughest challenge \u2013 a sprint for a body designed to outlast everybody in the longer distances. Her lust to seize those three golds extracts an excruciating price in the pool. She almost welcomes the pain It\u2019s a symbol of accomplishment, a sign that she wasted nothing. \u201cIt meant I had pushed as hard as I could,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/09/simone-biles-us-team-gymnastics-gold\">Simone Biles helps USA to team gymnastics gold \u2013 and targets four more | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She did not feel this way on Sunday night when she won the 400m freestyle with relative ease. This was a fight, a battle she wasn\u2019t even sure she could win. After her qualifying race the day before, one in which she came in behind Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, she saw on video that she had taken too many strokes. She wanted to control that pace on Tuesday. And yet once the race started she didn\u2019t feel as if she had been perfect. Her second turn was too wide. She was tired. She was worried. She wondered just how far she might have fallen behind. But because she does not look to her right when she races she could not see Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m in the lane beside her.<br></p> <p>All she could do was try to squelch the dinner that was bubbling up in her throat and pray it didn\u2019t spill into the water. \u201cI\u2019ve come pretty close in practice a few times so I\u2019m kind of used to it,\u201d Ledecky said after the race. \u201cAnd I know I can get through it and it\u2019s almost like you get mad when that happens and I swim better when I get mad so I just sucked deep and knew I had only 25m left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61e4dcb3ce017925e249e92d296effb6c0b91d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61e4dcb3ce017925e249e92d296effb6c0b91d63/0_136_5432_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Ledecky claims her second gold of the Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Ledecky claims her second gold of the Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it was will or fury, she has taken golds in her first two Rio finals. She is now the third woman and sixth swimmer overall to win gold in the 200m and 400m in the same Olympics. The only other females are the American, Debbie Meyer, who did it in 1968, and Shane Gould who accomplished the feat in 1972. That means it\u2019s been 44 years since a woman has done what she did these last few days. <br></p> <p>The great prize is Meyer\u2019s three golds in Mexico City \u2013 the 200m, 400m and 800m trifecta. Since the 200m is Ledecky\u2019s worst event it\u2019s safe to assume she has an excellent shot at the 800m. But it depends on the torture with which she has subjected her body. Will she have enough for the 800m on Thursday night? This is what she has trained these last four years to do.<br></p> <p>She knows Meyer, and the two have spoken about her pursuit. Meyer has told her she wants her to win the three races. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let her down,\u201d Ledecky said.</p> <p>The irony of Ledecky\u2019s stress is that Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m felt the same thing. The Swede knew she had a chance to beat Ledecky in the final and she pushed hard to catch her. At one point, she got a wave generated by Ledecky\u2019s body and rode it a bit, finding an extra burst from her opponent. In the end it wasn\u2019t enough, beaten by the reach of a finger. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to give the last 50m,\u201d Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m said.</p> <p>When the race was over, Ledecky stood in a hallway beneath the Olympic Aquatics Center and watched team-mate Michael Phelps win the 200m butterfly on a television. She was perhaps more nervous watching him than racing herself. She put her hand over her mouth, then on her head and over her mouth again. She agonized over a race she didn\u2019t even swim. There seemed irony in this. The next great Olympic swimming champion watching America\u2019s greatest champion celebrate in a way only both of them can. </p>",

This is not like us. One of the great questions that hovers over this system is how we can allow it to go on \u2013 how we can know so much about our prisons on Manus and Nauru yet manage not to face the facts of the Pacific solution. </p> <p>Put simply: we think the horrors are worth it. First because both sides of politics tell us that only by detaining refugees out there will the boats stop coming here. And second, we\u2019re assured there is somewhere in the world ready to take our prisoners off our hands.</p> <p>Those are both lies.</p> <p>The boats are stopped because they are turned back. They are still setting out from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, India and Indonesia, hoping to ferry asylum seekers to Australia. In June, both the prime minister and the minister for immigration, Peter Dutton, boasted they\u2019d turned back their 28th boat.</p> <p>If the smugglers\u2019 customers knew about the prisons on Manus and Nauru \u2013 widely and expensively advertised by Australia \u2013 they were not deterred from risking an expensive voyage by fear of ending up there.</p> <p>Australian Border Force and the navy stopped them reaching Australia. Turnbacks have their own horrors and present diplomatic dangers for this country, but there is no doubt they work \u2013 just as they did last time under John Howard.</p> <p>The second lie is worse: that some country will take the prisoners on Manus and Nauru off our hands.

The last men and women to leave Manus and Nauru were damaged souls. We did that to them. They are now getting on with their lives in Brisbane and Ballarat and the outskirts of Adelaide.</p> <p>Now would be the time \u2013 in the aftermath of an election campaign in which the boats barely featured \u2013 for Canberra to start bringing its prisoners quietly ashore. The problem is, the promises made to keep every last one of them out of this country are so much more extreme than last time.</p> <p>What\u2019s new is the river of information flowing here about life in the island prisons.

  "<p>Only the Australian public paying attention to the horrors in offshore immigration detention can change government policy, the Australian human rights commissioner has said.</p> <p>The commissioner, Gillian Triggs, was addressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">the Nauru files</a>, a cache of more than 2,000 leaked documents from inside Australia\u2019s offshore immigration processing centre on Nauru.</p> <p>The documents, published by the Guardian on Wednesday, has revealed the extent of abuses and trauma on the island over a 26-month period and reaction from the public, human rights organisations and politicians was swift, including calls for a royal commission.</p> <p>Triggs told ABC radio the report backed up what the Human Rights Commission had tried to tell the parliament with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/11/children-in-detention-scathing-criticism-in-human-rights-commission-report\">its own review</a> into children in detention two years ago. </p> <p>Asked if her report was now vindicated, Triggs said: \u201cWe rely very heavily on the media to report these facts and ensure the public is accurately informed, and I think that\u2019s the case here.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need to public\u2019s attention to ensure that our politicians change the policy. This is unsustainable, and of course extremely expensive to the Australian taxpayer.\u201d</p> <p>If media had access to the immigration centres, the Australian public could be moved in the same way they were over the Don Dale juvenile detention abuses broadcast last month.</p> <p>\u201cOur democratic system depends on transparency and access by our journalists and also by other community groups who can speak up and take photographs. That is what really moves the public, when they actually see, preferably on video, how these children are being treated.\u201d</p> <p>Elaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said the Don Dale images shocked the Turnbull government into action, and called for the same in response to the evidence presented in the Nauru files and in other investigations.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the number of serious incidents has not declined but continued steadily, and in some cases escalated, is further proof that the failure to address abuses is a deliberate policy of the Australian government to deter further boat arrivals,\u201d Pearson told Guardian Australia. </p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s policy of deterrence is premised on making people in offshore locations suffer. This policy is inhumane and irresponsible, and it means refugees and asylum seekers remain vulnerable to further abuse and mistreatment. Men, women and children need to be removed from Nauru immediately.\u201d</p> <p>On social media, many people reacted with shock, others with frustration and anger that the government stands by its policy despite frequent revelations about conditions on the island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mrseankelly/status/763120993199992832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Files from Nauru.

Still under way, the commission had documented the horrific sexual abuse of thousands of children in state or state-sponsored care. </p> <p>Various state governments have held inquiries and investigations into child protection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/its-high-time-we-looked-at-the-care-of-vulnerable-children-nsw-is-failing-them\">children in out-of-home care</a> and disability services to uncover abuse, neglect and system failures. </p> <p>And now the Turnbull government, sparked by harrowing footage from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/30/nt-juvenile-detention-centre-treatment-snap-protests-called-across-australia\">Don Dale youth detention centre</a>, is establishing <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/here-are-the-terms-of-reference-for-the-royal-commission-into-the-northern-territorys-juvenile-detention-system-2016-7\">a royal commission into the Northern Territory juvenile justice system</a>.</p> <p>All these reports. All these damaged children. All on our nation\u2019s watch. All on our consciences. </p> <p>Each report is in a different context. All teach us similar lessons. </p> <p>Abuse and mistreatment occurs when absolute power is wielded over vulnerable people. Abuse is most easily undertaken when the victims have been dehumanised, especially on the basis of their race, disability, gender or economic class. </p> <p>Abuse flourishes systematically when information doesn\u2019t flow transparently. Without oversight, monitoring and independent reporting, or where there are ineffective or no whistleblower protections, there is little chance for mistreatment to come to light. When vulnerable young people have limited access to family or other advocates, or when the media has poor or no access to institutional care or information about it, abuse can continue for years unchecked. </p> <p>Publicly, in many of these circumstances, politicians and other authorities continue to assert that everything is just fine. </p> <p>Like the politicians who told us nothing was amiss at the Don Dale juvenile detention centre.
