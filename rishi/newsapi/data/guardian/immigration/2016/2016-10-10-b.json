  "<p>Last week the treasurer Scott Morrison <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/speech/019-2016/\">told an audience</a> in the USA that not only would interest rate cuts no longer have any impact in Australia, but neither would any fiscal stimulus. It was an extraordinary statement at a time when the outlook is for below average growth. </p> <p>The treasurer has resorted to faith in the private sector to solve our problems while at the same time saying the private sector is not investing. </p> <p>It\u2019s almost become a clich\u00e9 to talk about the new normal of low economic growth since the GFC, but we shouldn\u2019t become accepting of it. </p> <p>The reality is, what we are experiencing now is abnormal growth compared to what we have experienced at any time since the second world war. </p> <p>This week US economist Narayana Kocherlakota <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-04/why-americans-feel-poor-in-one-chart\">posted an interesting graph</a> trying to explain why so many Americans feel poor.</p> <p>He looked at the 10 yearly change in GDP per capita since the second world war. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/scott-morrison-warns-resentment-to-free-trade-and-immigration-threatens-economy\">Scott Morrison warns resentment to free trade and immigration threatens economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now I am perhaps the number one ticket holder of the \u201cGDP does not tell us everything club\u201d, but the growth of American GDP per capita over the past decade is quite stunning.</p> <p>When GDP is growing well, there can still be larger sections of the economy doing badly, but when it is growing slowly there is rarely any hidden \u201cgood news\u201d \u2013 and certainly none relating to the poor sections of society. And GDP per capita is a good rough guide for national living standards. </p> <p>Kocherlakota found that since the second world war, American GDP per capita had never grown by less than 10% in any 10 year period. And yet since 2009, 10 year growth has never been above that rate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in USA GDP per capita compared to a decade earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1h3zS/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is a dramatic display of what the IMF talks about when it suggests advanced economies in the world are experiencing subdued growth. </p> <p>The ABS doesn\u2019t have quarterly GDP per capita data before 1973 so we can\u2019t do the same times series for Australia, but we can compare the 10 year growth since 1983:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in GDP per capita compared to a decade earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7KMap/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While living standards here have not slowed as fast as in the USA, it is worth noting that the current 10 year growth in GDP per capita is slower than any time since the horror recession in 1982-83.</p> <p>Now of course looking at 10 year intervals can also hide a lot \u2013 in 2006 our economy was booming. So a look at five year intervals might reveal a bit more:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in GDP per capita compared to 5yrs earlier\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qNURG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This measure certainly shows the depth of the USA recession, and how Australia missed out on those horrors. But even still, the past five years has seen our living standards grow at a level more associated with a recession than either an average or strongly growing economy. </p> <p>More surprisingly, in the past five years, Australian and USA GDP per capita has grown by the same amount. That is because while currently our GDP per capita is growing faster, for most of the past three years, and even going back to 2010, that has not been the case:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"GDP per capita - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2pKDf/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other than being a nice little history lesson, that would be interesting, but when we look at where the IMF has us projected to be up to 2021, it looks like the past five and 10 years are not an aberration, but the start of a trend:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia's annual GDP per capita growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Lb6eG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The IMF would have Australia\u2019s GDP per capita not growing above 2% in any one calendar year in the next five years \u2013 a stretch we haven\u2019t experienced any time since the second world war.</p> <p>So what is our treasurer\u2019s response?</p> <p>Well it is clear from the speech Scott Morrison gave he wants to get investment going \u2013 his speech was essentially an advert to foreign investors. </p> <p>But the speech also touched on specific ways to get growth going. He made a good point \u2013 namely that with interest rates so low, monetary policy is basically done. </p> <p>The RBA has been saying this for a long while now (and so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/may/02/inflation-is-scarily-low-but-its-morrison-who-needs-to-act-not-the-rba\">have I</a>). But Morrison then went further. He argued that \u201cwhile so much of the global economic discussion focuses on monetary and fiscal stimulus, we believe that these options have largely exhausted their effectiveness, at least from an Australian perspective. </p> <p>Astonishingly our treasurer is telling the world that the two biggest tools available to spur growth no longer work. </p> <p>How\u2019s that for an invitation to come invest? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/25/the-new-normal-why-we-need-to-shake-up-economic-policy\">The new normal: why we need to shake up economic policy | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead he believes private investment (despite also admitting investment is not responding in this environment) will do the trick and so too will \u201ctrade\u201d.</p> <p>Now trade is certainly good for economic growth, but anyone believing the Trans Pacific Partnership (which is now unlikely to go forward) or our free trade agreements will do much (if anything) to <em>improve</em> growth are really off with the fairies. </p> <p>At best (the very best) the impact will be marginal. </p> <p>Morrison also suggests that his \u201c<a href=\"http://budget.gov.au/2016-17/content/glossies/tax_super/html/tax_super-04.htm\">10-year enterprise tax plan</a>\u201d will help work wonders. Except his own treasury modelling suggests the majority of the benefits will only come once the full cut to 25% occurs for big businesses \u2013 and that isn\u2019t scheduled to occur until 2026-27.</p> <p>It\u2019s all pretty lame, and fairly despairing if you were hoping that the new normal might be abnormal. </p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn was challenged about his position on Brexit and questioned over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/conor-mcginn-holly-lynch-labour-mps-whips-resign-rosie-winterton\">sacking of Rosie Winterton as chief whip</a>, as he faced his party\u2019s MPs for the first time since his re-election as leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/conor-mcginn-holly-lynch-labour-mps-whips-resign-rosie-winterton\">Two Labour MPs resign as whips after Rosie Winterton sacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Labour leader was pressed by colleagues after the party\u2019s shadow secretary of state for exiting the EU, Keir Starmer, appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/keir-starmer-calls-for-immigration-to-be-reduced\">set out a different line on immigration</a> policy than the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn told journalists outside the meeting that Starmer\u2019s call for immigration numbers to be reduced was not at odds with Abbott or Corbyn himself.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy has made clear chasing after impossible targets or caps doesn\u2019t work and inflames divisions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the case he was making during the referendum campaign was for decisive action against the undercutting of wages and the exploitation of migrant workers. If you take effective action \u2026 you will reduce numbers.\u201d</p> <p>This came after Labour MPs said they were not clear on the party\u2019s position on Brexit in advance of an opposition day debate on Wednesday, with Barry Sheerman asking Corbyn: \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s response was not satisfactory for some of those present, with one MP heckling: \u201cWhat\u2019s the line? What\u2019s the line?\u201d</p> <p>Emma Reynolds called on the leader to consider taking a more robust position on freedom of movement because of the demands of constituents across the Midlands and the north of England.</p> <p>The MPs also asked their leader about a Guardian/ICM opinion poll, which gives the Conservatives a 17-point lead at the end of the party conference season. The survey places Theresa May\u2019s party on 43% while Labour slips to 26%, with Ukip on 11% and the Lib Dems on 8%.</p> <p>One MP said the meeting felt like \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d and they were not convinced by Corbyn\u2019s call for unity. During a tribute to Winterton, whom he has replaced with Nick Brown in his post-victory reshuffle, the Labour leader was heckled by MP John Spellar who shouted: \u201cWhy did you sack her then?\u201d</p> <p>Another MP, Jess Phillips, challenged the leader for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/corbyn-under-fire-speaking-anti-racism-rally-links-swp-socialist-workers-party\">speaking at an anti-racism rally</a> linked to the Socialist Workers party.<br></p> <p>Some MPs were angry after they felt Corbyn questioned whether Russia had been involved in the bombing of a UN aid convoy in Syria that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians. MPs said Corbyn referred to an attack that was \u201capparently\u201d carried out by the Russians.</p> <p>Angela Smith MP, who asked about the issue, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning that Jeremy is unwilling to face up to the role that Putin\u2019s Russia is playing in Syria. The recent criminal atrocities committed in Aleppo make the case for an effective international response overwhelming and Labour needs to show moral leadership on what is an intolerable situation.\u201d</p> <p>However, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman denied that he had held back on the issue. \u201cThe evidence is often very murky but he said that the evidence appears to show that Russia was involved in the bombing, if not Russia the Syrian airforce, and all evidence appears to show it was a war crime. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking at real evidence rather than the rhetoric. He has condemned all atrocities, he has condemned Russia, he opposes all forms of foreign intervention in the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesman said he had not heard Corbyn use the words \u201capparent\u201d or \u201calleged\u201d in reference to Russia\u2019s bombing. \u201cThere are many, many other atrocities taking place as well.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Corbyn had used the meeting to push for unity, but said MPs were having to adjust to the size of the leader\u2019s second mandate. </p> <p>\u201cThe majority of Labour MPs are looking for ways to work with the leadership. It\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interests. That\u2019s the clear mood at the meeting tonight. There have been a number of stormy meetings and this doesn\u2019t even register on the low level of the Richter scale,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The decision to remove Winterton was taken because of a clear need to reset the relationship with the parliamentary Labour party, he added. \u201cAfter a year, it\u2019s necessary for that to be reset in a way that represents his mandate. It\u2019s time to move to a new one.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, a leading thinktank is preparing to launch an initiative examining what people who voted remain believed about \u201ctaking back control\u201d of their lives.</p> <p><a href=\"http://neweconomics.org/political-leaders-ignore-remain-voters-at-their-peril/?header=Latest\">Research</a> from the New Economics Foundation found that the majority of remain voters felt they were lacking in power, with 62% saying the world is run by \u201cthe few people in power and there is not much the ordinary citizen can do about it\u201d.</p> <p>Just 27% of remain voters agreed with a statement saying, \u201cThe average citizen can have an influence on government decisions\u201d, while 55% specifically identified big business and corporate elites as having \u201ctoo much control over their lives\u201d.</p> <p>At an event attended by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and greater Manchester mayoral candidate Andy Burnham, the thinktank will launch a \u201cnew agenda\u201d that looks beyond Westminster to institutions such as devolved government, forward-looking businesses, and trade union and community-led campaigns.</p>",
  "<p>Cuts to legal aid are far worse than anticipated and are creating a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system which denies the poorest people access to justice, warns a critical report by Amnesty International.</p> <p>The government should conduct an urgent review of the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act, which came into effect in 2013 and has severely restricted funding, the study says. A review has been promised within three to five years but ministers have delayed.</p> <p>The year before the act was introduced, legal aid was granted in 925,000 cases, Amnesty points out. The year after, assistance was given in 497,000 cases, a drop of 46%.</p> <p>The report calls for all children to be granted entitlement to legal aid regardless of the issues at stake. Some teenagers, it says, are at risk of having to represent themselves in immigration cases where they may face deportation.</p> <p>The report highlights the emergence of \u201cadvice deserts\u201d across England and Wales where the provision of free legal advice is disappearing. Worst affected are said to be the south-west, parts of the Midlands and the north of England. <br></p> <p>The Legal Aid Agency\u2019s exceptional case funding system, which was supposed to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable claimants, is said to be inadequate and flawed. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Laspo has been blamed for a surge in the number of litigants in person, slowing court processes. Legal aid is no longer available in the family courts unless one partner can prove he or she was a victim of domestic violence.</p> <p>One consequence has been that separating couples are not evenly represented. One woman told Amnesty: \u201cWhen I go to court I have to cross-examine my ex. That terrifies me. I have so many sleepless nights. If I lose I know I will blame myself \u2013 it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t good enough. But then I think, how can I be good enough when I\u2019m up against a barrister?\u201d</p> <p>Legal aid for immigration cases has also been cut, exposing unaccompanied or separated children to having to make applications to stay in the UK on their own, unrepresented. The report says up to 2,500 children a year are claimants in their own right in such cases, according to MoJ figures.</p> <p>Children are at an \u201cautomatic disadvantage as the laws, processes and systems governing their circumstances are profoundly complex\u201d, the report states. \u201cThey require specialist advisers that are experienced not just in immigration law, but also with working with children.\u201d</p> <p> One lawyer told Amnesty: \u201cThe idea that children and young people can represent themselves just does not work. This is such a vulnerable group. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t understand legal processes and legal concepts, which they don\u2019t, but it\u2019s also that they have no idea how to fill forms out properly, what to write, where to send paperwork, where to get advice and who to speak to.\u201d</p> <p>A youth worker told Amnesty: \u201cI had one young person I was working with who had to self-represent at the lower asylum and immigration tribunal. He had a good case, but no access to legal aid \u2026 I accompanied him to court, explaining that I wouldn\u2019t be able to help him as I\u2019m not qualified but could give him moral support. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cHe was vulnerable, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. I had to explain everything: what the court looks like, what the environment will be. He didn\u2019t know, he hadn\u2019t seen any of it before. All he could do was tell his story to the judge, he couldn\u2019t argue the case law \u2026 We asked for an adjournment but the court said no. In the end his appeal was refused.\u201d </p> <p>Alice Wyss, Amnesty International\u2019s UK researcher, said: \u201cCuts to legal aid imposed by this government have decimated access to justice and left thousands of the most vulnerable without essential legal advice and support. We are in danger of creating a two-tier civil justice system, open to those who can afford it, but increasingly closed to the poorest and most in need of its protection.</p> <p>\u201cIf Theresa May is really determined to deliver a country that works for all then there needs to be a justice system for everyone, not just those who can afford it.The government must start by protecting the most vulnerable and launching a review of this failing system immediately.\u201d</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a generous legal aid system - last year spending more than \u00a31.5bn on legal aid. We must ensure legal aid is sustainable and fair - both for those who need it and the taxpayer who pays for it. That is why we have made sure support remains available to the most vulnerable and in the most serious cases, and are taking action to ensure people can access the help they need.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Speaker Paul Ryan told members of the House GOP caucus on Monday \u201cyou all need to do what\u2019s best for your district\u201d and seemed to write off Trump\u2019s chances of winning, saying he would \u201cspend his entire energy making sure that Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress\u201d. </p> <p>After widespread condemnation over his debate threat to jail his political rival, Trump did not explicitly renew his calls to jail Hillary Clinton if he was elected. Instead, he took a somewhat milder tone and merely called for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. Trump also suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the NSA might have the missing emails that Clinton deleted from her personal email server.</p> <p>But Trump also attacked Clinton on policy grounds. He railed against the Democratic nominee from the left on entitlement reform and claimed that she wants to \u201cknock the hell out of Medicare and Medicaid\u201d. The former secretary of state has committed to expanding both programs. </p> <p>He also attacked Clinton for her support for \u201copen trade\u201d. \u201cYou know what that does to your community,\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s the end.\u201d He also returned to familiar attacks and falsely claimed Clinton is \u201cfor radical unlimited immigration\u201d.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/02/donald-trump-renews-voter-warning-and-says-clinton-could-be-crazy\">once again offered a</a> vague, evidence-free warning of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. He told the almost entirely all-white crowd \u201cit\u2019s so important that you watch other communities because we don\u2019t want this election stolen from us\u201d. He has made this statement several times in the past in the Keystone state, seemingly based on a popular <a href=\"http://billypenn.com/2016/08/08/what-sean-hannity-got-wrong-about-philly-election-fraud/\">rightwing conspiracy theory</a> that Mitt Romney was the victim of voter fraud in Philadelphia in 2012. The theory, which is a dogwhistle reference to African American voters, is premised on the fact that in 59 precincts in majority black neighborhoods, Romney did not receive a single vote. There are 1,687 precincts in the city and Obama received over 85% of the vote there in 2012.</p> <p>While a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-after-trump-tape-revelation-clinton-s-lead-double-digits-n663691\">new NBC/WSJ poll</a> showed the Republican nominee falling behind Clinton by 14 points in a two-way race, Trump supporters in Pennsylvania were unfazed by the nominee\u2019s growing woes. Instead they took heart in what they saw as a dominating debate performance, one which former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told the crowd was \u201cthe best performance any presidential candidate had in the history of debates\u201d.</p> <p>Joe Tedeski, a Trump supporter who watched the debate, thought his candidate won while Clinton was \u201cthe greatest liar I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. He dismissed concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks saying \u201cpeople change, attitudes change\u201d and insisting that Trump\u2019s graphic description of groping women without their consent was \u201cjust talk\u201d and that he had never actually engaged in that behavior. </p> <p>This was echoed by Isaac Foldi of Bloomingdale, Ohio, who was decked out in Trump merchandise for the event and praised his candidate\u2019s performance. In particular, Foldi pointed to Trump\u2019s line that Clinton was \u201cno honest Abe\u201d as an effective zinger. While the Trump supporter thought the nominee\u2019s 2005 comments were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, he found them insignificant compared to Clinton\u2019s sins. \u201cIt makes little sense to go after him for saying some crude things when Hillary humiliated women raped and assaulted by her husband.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Pennsylvania on Monday night before spending the next two days in Florida.</p>",

  "<p>Ireland\u2019s government has confirmed that discussions are under way with Britain to try to reach an agreement on how to secure the two countries\u2019 borders after Brexit, control immigration and counter terrorist threats.</p> <p>Irish and British immigration officials are already sharing intelligence about foreign visitors passing through airports and ferry ports by measures such as the personal information from biometric passports, the Department of Justice in Dublin said on Monday. It said the sharing of information from points of entry into both states was also part of a strategy to counter terrorism and organised crime.</p> <p>A spokesman for the department said: \u201cClearly it is in the best interests of both Ireland and the UK to cooperate as fully as possible on these matters and that has been the approach adopted by both jurisdictions going back many years, including the introduction earlier this year of new arrangements to allow for the sharing of advanced passenger information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the common travel area (CTA).</p> <p>\u201cThe development of the British-Irish visa system was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics.\u201d</p> <p>As well as protecting the Anglo-Irish CTA, the Irish justice spokesman said there were mutual security concerns that prompted more cooperation in areas such as immigration control. \u201cNegotiations on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU have not yet begun and this process will of course involve a negotiation between the UK and all EU member states,\u201d he said. \u201cAny commentary now on what may emerge from those negotiations is speculative.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it should be noted that it is vital, not just for Ireland but for all EU member states, that we are in a position to combat terrorism and serious crime through the sharing of relevant information in an appropriate manner. There are a number of ongoing EU initiatives in this area in which Ireland is committed to playing a full part.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, two Irish government ministers said the republic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/idea-of-uk-border-controls-in-ireland-is-ridiculous-says-irish-mep-matt-carty\">would be prepared to allow for extra monitoring at its airports and ferry terminals</a> to help the UK control post-Brexit immigration.</p> <p>The finance minister, Michael Noonan, said there could be the usual \u201cnormal checks\u201d at points of entry into Ireland which would keep tabs on any illegal immigration using the Irish border to enter the UK.</p> <p>Even though Northern Ireland voted 54% in favour of staying in the EU, the overall outcome of the 23 June referendum means the region will be outside the EU when Britain leaves. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/brexit-plan-divide-britain-ireland-uk-border\">This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once more | Diarmaid Ferriter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to the proposal by the Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, for a new ramped-up intelligence system between the republic and the UK to clamp down on illegal migrants, Noonan said: \u201cSo, if you do not have a border, going from Newry going across, dividing Sligo and Donegal from the northern counties, the next step is to have your controls at the ports.</p> <p>\u201cSo that would mean Rosslare, and Larne [sea ports], and the airports, but that wouldn\u2019t be much more than the normal checks we have at airports already, where you show your passport.\u201d</p> <p>Noonan and his cabinet colleague, the Irish justice minister, Frances Fitzgerald, welcomed Brokenshire\u2019s opposition to any \u201chard border\u201d arrangements on the UK\u2019s only land frontier with an EU state as well as his promise that the CTA would continue after Brexit.</p> <p>Fitzgerald said there was \u201cnot anything surprising\u201d in Brokenshire\u2019s views and that such a move would avoid the re-establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. He said: \u201cThe whole question of security in the ports as well as our interests is going to be an area where there is more focus on in relation to the risks of terrorism and security cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cI envisage the security co-operation continuing and developing if anything over the next number of years. There is not anything surprising in what he has said.\u201d</p> <p>Brokenshire had earlier told the Guardian that London and Dublin would work to strengthen Ireland\u2019s external borders in order to combat illegal migration into the UK once it left the EU.</p> <p>Brokenshire said there was now a \u201chigh level of collaboration on a joint programme of work\u201d between the two states to control immigration.</p> <p>\u201cWe have put in place a range of measures to further combat illegal migration working closely with the Irish government,\u201d Brokenshire said. \u201cOur focus is to strengthen the external border of the common travel area, building on the strong collaboration with our Irish partners.\u201d</p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary added: \u201cWe are already working closely with the Irish government and other members of the common travel area to prevent people from seeking to evade UK immigration controls from entering via another part of the CTA. There is a high level of collaboration on a joint programme of work. This includes investment in border procedures; increased data sharing to inform immigration and border security decisions; passenger data systems enabling the collection and processing of advance passenger information; and harmonised visa processes.\u201d</p> <p>The Fine Gael-led coalition government has stressed, however, that any new intelligence gathering and data sharing system on people entering Ireland who may also travel into Northern Ireland must first win support among all of the republic\u2019s EU partners.</p> <p>Any system designed to enable the UK to control and monitor immigration via Ireland is bound to be politically controversial. One Sinn F\u00e9in MEP whose constituency includes the border region described Brokenshire\u2019s suggestion as ridiculous.</p> <p>Matt Carty, who represents the Midlands/Northwest constituency in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe Irish government and a succession of its representatives have been deferential to the British government from time to time. What we are saying is that this is not an occasion for this. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to be pointing out the needs of this island and making demands for the Irish people.

  "<p>When Irish republicans sat down with members of the British government in 1921 to negotiate what became the Anglo-Irish Treaty, ending Ireland\u2019s war of independence, the state of Northern Ireland, and thus the partition of Ireland, was already a reality, having formally come into being earlier that year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/brexit-secretary-no-return-to-hard-border-in-ireland\">Brexit secretary: no return to 'hard' border in Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To prevent the negotiations breaking down over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/14/eamon-de-valera-will-to-power-review\" title=\"\">Irish republican demands for an end to this partition</a>, the British government concocted a cunning plan for a boundary commission to review the border in accordance with the \u201cwishes of the inhabitants\u201d and with due regard to economic and geographic conditions.</p> <p>Irish negotiators maintained the commission would produce favourable findings that would lead to a significant territorial gain, ultimately making unity with Northern Ireland much more likely. The eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/28/northernireland1\" title=\"\">report of the boundary commission in 1925</a> \u2013 involving only a minimal transfer of territory from Northern Ireland to the south, and even some transfer in the other direction \u2013 shattered these illusions, leading to a hasty agreement between Dublin, London and Belfast to leave the border as it was.

Despite much rhetorical and emotional attachment to reunification, and a disastrous IRA campaign targeting the border from 1956-62, pragmatism has dominated the southern Irish approach to the border question. Anglo-Irish and north-south relations noticeably improved from the 1960s, with a particular focus on trade. The outbreak of the Troubles, from the late 1960s, led to numerous crises but was eventually solved by the peace process and the Good Friday agreement of 1998. This agreement maintains that it is \u201cfor the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b46f48124675284fc005d13567e05546ecd3dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b46f48124675284fc005d13567e05546ecd3dae/0_71_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passport control at Dublin airport, where Britain wants tighter controls to be imposed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passport control at Dublin airport, where Britain wants tighter controls to be imposed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the Brexit vote in June, when 56% of Northern Ireland\u2019s electorate voted to remain in the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/brexit-northern-irish-politics-border-eu-good-friday-agreement\" title=\"\">historian Ian McBride argued</a> that the Good Friday agreement \u201cclearly envisaged that Northern Ireland\u2019s future constitutional arrangements would be worked out in the context of continuing partnership between the north and the south, and between politicians in London and Dublin\u201d.

For all the soothing rhetoric from Irish foreign affairs minister Charles Flanagan about sharing information and systems to counteract illegal immigration, he also warns: \u201cThis will be a decision not just by the UK or Irish governments but ultimately also by the 27 EU states.\u201d</p> <p>This will be a difficult balancing act, given Ireland\u2019s continuing membership of the EU. Brexit represents the Republic\u2019s greatest challenge since joining the EEC in 1973, because the Irish government needs to emphasise both Irish distinctiveness from Britain and the two nations\u2019 common needs. Senior members of the Irish government, because of their fear of a \u201chard\u201d north-south border, are playing down the significance of Brokenshire\u2019s suggestions; but moves to make ports of entry proxy border posts for Britain are likely to stir opposition. One hundred years after the 1916 Rising, some of the older arguments about Irish psychological independence may resurface as a reaction to Britain seeking to \u201cuse\u201d Ireland and its borders to assert its new isolationist status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/14/eamon-de-valera-will-to-power-review\">\u00c9amon de Valera: A Will to Power review \u2013 the man who made modern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost 40 years ago, a senior Irish civil servant, irritated that the Republic was being taken for granted by Britain, urged the Irish government \u201cto bring out once more again the fact that we are not an appendage of the British in the European communities\u201d.</p> <p>In the last few years such tensions have eased, and there have been frequent and accurate assertions that Anglo-Irish relations have never been better.

Speaking for Labour, the shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer </strong>said MPs should get a vote \u201con the basic terms\u201d of the renegotiation.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to commit the government to publishing a white paper on the Brexit negotiations.</strong> He proposed one in an article he wrote as a backbencher in July, shortly before he was appointed to the cabinet, but, despite being asked repeatedly, refused to commit the government to publishing such document.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the terms \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit were \u201cdesigned to deceive\u201d and \u201cnot meaningful in any way\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He hinted that the government might accept a transitional trade deal with the EU if it could not agree a final one within two years. </strong>Labour\u2019s <strong>Hilary Benn</strong> said a transitional deal might be necessary to stop the UK having to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms if, after two years, a permanent trade deal has not been finalised. Benn asked if Davis agreed. Davis said he did not expect this to happen. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to offer a view. I will just simply say this; we are going to do everything possible to protect, enhance and maximise the opportunities for British business. And he can draw his conclusion. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the government could not stop the pound going up and down during the Brexit process. </strong>In response to a question from Labour\u2019s <strong>Emma Reynolds</strong> about why the pound dropped to a 30-year low after the Conservative conference, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recommend you read a book called Flash Boys because part of that fall, the major part of that fall was the flash crash as a result of that. Otherwise, there are lots and lots of speculative comments that will drive the pound down and up and down and up in the next two-and-a-half years and there\u2019s little we can do about that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said there would be no downside to Brexit and only \u201cconsiderable upsides\u201d if the government got what it wanted. </strong>The government had four goals, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One is to regain control of our borders. Another is to get back control of our laws. The one I did not list was our aim to keep our justice and security arrangements at least as strong as they are. Finally, and most importantly in this context, the United Kingdom must aim to maintain the best possible open access to European markets and vice versa. If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected EU leaders to compromise during the Brexit talks.</strong> What they were saying now was not what they would be saying in the future, he said.

Earlier,<strong> Ed Miliband,</strong> the former Labour leader, told BBC News that MPs should vote on the Brexit strategy, not least to give the government a mandate. The government could publish a white paper on its plans and put it to a vote, he said. He said he was not trying to enable MPs to reverse the referendum result.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am saying we are going to be leaving the European Union. That\u2019s what the British people voted for. But we\u2019ve got to get those negotiations right. It was Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who said last week the British people did not vote to make themselves poorer. And he\u2019s right about that. And what worried me about some of what we heard at the Conservative conference was - I understand the concerns about immigration - but what I felt was our whole economy was in danger of being thrown off a cliff ...</p> <p>We need to be knowing now what the government will be negotiating for. And I believe they need to get the consent of MPs. Because there is no other mandate here. The Conservative manifesto said that the Conservative party was determined to stay in the single market. Now, it sounded from what Theresa May and some of her ministers were saying that we were going to leave the single market, contrary to the mandate. So there is no mandate for a hard Brexit. That is why parliament has got to be consulted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the World at One <strong>Dominic Grieve</strong>, the Conservative former attorney general, said MPs should be given the chance to vote on triggering article 50, the move that will start the formal EU withdrawal process. And <strong>Andrew Tyrie</strong>, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, told the same programme that he thought MPs should debate the government\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to me British interests will be best served by an early and full and detailed explanation from the government of what its negotiating position is before it embarks on those discussions ...</p> <p>What has never been discussed in any depth is what we arrive at.

It gives them a 17-point lead.</p> <p>Here are the new figures, and how they compare to the previous Guardian/ICM polling figures from early September, before the conference season started.</p> <p>Conservatives: 43% (up 2)<br></p> <p>Labour: 26% (down 2)</p> <p>Ukip: 11% (down 2)</p> <p>Lib Dems: 8% (down 1)</p> <p>Greens: 6% (up 2)</p> <p>The fieldwork was carried out from Friday to Sunday.</p> <p>The 17-point lead is the joint second highest ever recorded for the Conservatives by ICM in its polling series going back to 1992. They only once got a higher lead (20 points in June 2008, when Gordon Brown was at his most unpopular) although in September and October 2009 they also had a 17-point lead in ICM polls. But Labour did have larger polling leads at various points in the Blair era.</p> <p>At 26%, the Labour figure is only one point higher than their lowest rating in ICM polling - the 25% they hit in June 2008 and August 2009.</p> <p>The Conservative conference was dominated by news about Theresa May hardening up her stance on Brexit and the ICM figures suggest this has gone down well with voters. Although the proposal to force firms to reveal what proportion of their workforce is foreign has now been dropped, following a backlash from business,<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/public-backs-plans-make-companies-say-how-many-for/\"> a YouGov poll at the end of last week suggested voters backed the idea by two to one.</a></p> <p>The Tories may also have benefited from the fall in the Ukip share of the vote. At 11% Ukip are on their lowest level in an ICM poll since the 2015 general election, and this may reflect the damage done to the party\u2019s reputation by the fight in the European parliament on Thursday that left Steven Woolfe MEP hospitalised.</p> <p><em> ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,017 adults aged 18+ on 7-9<sup>th</sup> October 2016, and the data has been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T11:07:13.912Z\">at 12.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fb64f3e4b03258bcac633e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:06:58.098Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/all\">here.</a></p> <p>As for the rest of the papers, here is<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/must-reads\"> the Politics Home list of top 10 must-reads</a>, and here is<a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/frontpage/2016/10/newslinks-for-monday-10th-october-2016.html\"> the ConservativeHome round-up of today\u2019s politics stories.</a></p> <p>And here are two Brexit-related stories worth reading.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/773a9770-8e34-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923\">George Parker and Arash Massoudi in the Financial Times (subscription) say the government plans a new system of vetting foreign takeovers.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May is to push ahead with a new system to vet foreign investment in Britain, but has heeded warnings from chancellor Philip Hammond that the country cannot afford to adopt \u201cFrench-style\u201d protectionism.</p> <p>The UK prime minister wants the government to be able to intervene in an \u201corderly and structured\u201d way in sensitive foreign investment and is studying regimes used in other countries such as the US and Australia.</p> <p>But at a ministerial meeting last month Mr Hammond led a chorus of warnings that any new regime must not undermine Britain\u2019s position as Europe\u2019s top destination for foreign direct investment, particularly with Brexit approaching in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12d7ac24-2433-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0\"> down the Danone route</a>,\u201d Mr Hammond said, referring to action taken by the French government a decade ago that appeared to be intended to prevent a takeover of the yoghurt maker Danone.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/brexit-risks-closing-door-on-economy-bosses-warn-9ksg7n5x8\">Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says the CBI has warned about Brexit being a threat to Britain\u2019s \u201copen economy\u201d.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leader of Britain\u2019s biggest business group has warned Theresa May that she risks \u201cclosing the door\u201d on an open economy with her immigration clampdown and Brexit policy.</p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, issued the stark message in an interview with <em>The Times </em>as the government climbed down on its plan to name businesses thought to be relying too heavily on foreign workers ...</p> <p>Ms Fairbairn, who took over at the CBI last year, said: \u201cWhat we have heard over the last few days, if you add up the messages in total, are signs that the door is being closed, to an extent, on the open economy, that has helped fuel investment.

This is the danger we are in, this over-extrapolation. It is not good for our country and it is not the way we go forward. </p> <p>This is precisely why we do need to take the debate into parliament and not see it as having a vote at this stage or that stage, but just beginning at least to know what are the guiding principles as we now leave the European Union.

So fine is The Magnificent Seven that it\u2019s convenient to forget that John Sturges\u2019s 1960 western is a remake \u2013 of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1954 classic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/14/my-favourite-film-seven-samurai\">Seven Samurai</a>. Yes, relocating from Japan to Mexico loses a lot: specifically, a village of farmers menaced by bandits in 1586, during the Warring States period. But we gain so much: not just Elmer Bernstein\u2019s Bart\u00f3k-inspired score, but something very uncommon in Hollywood cinema \u2013 the idea that victory is far from simple, and can even conceal its opposite. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e76150282482f2f455d00dcaa1baf3d9fb25ddc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e76150282482f2f455d00dcaa1baf3d9fb25ddc/0_70_2912_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Classic remake \u2026 The Magnificent Seven.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic remake \u2026 The Magnificent Seven.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Yul Brynner rides off past the graves of his fallen comrades, he reflects: \u201cOnly the farmers won.

Indeed, Kurosawa liked the film so much that he apparently sent Sturges a sword (of course, he may have thought the film was so bad he wanted Sturges to commit <em>seppuku</em>, but it seems unlikely). </p> <p>Often, it\u2019s invidious to choose between remake and original: like PM Dawn\u2019s Set Adrift on Memory Bliss and its source, Spandau Ballet\u2019s True, both should exist in the best of all possible worlds. Peter Moffat\u2019s 2008 BBC series Criminal Justice inspired Steven Zaillian and Richard Price\u2019s no less wonderful new TV drama The Night Of, transferring the action from Britain to New York, but retaining much of the storyline. Both Con O\u2019Neill in the original and John Turturro in the retool play lawyers struggling with horrible eczema of the foot \u2013 and they\u2019re both wonderful. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Get Carter Caine chucks a gangster off a brutalist Gateshead car park.

Few would defend the 2003 remake of The Italian Job, which shifts much of its best car chases from Mediterranean corniches to Los Angeles. But I would, not least because the 1969 original is ridiculously overrated and the remake features not just better action sequences but a performance from Mark Wahlberg \u2013 in the Michael Caine role \u2013 that no one has properly appreciated. Why there isn\u2019t an Oscar for Musclebound Suffering at the Wheel of a Stupidly Small Car is beyond me. </p> <p>Is John Simm more convincing as a ruthless hack in conspiracy drama State of Play than Russell Crowe is in its Americanised incarnation? Is the Washington House of Cards better than the Westminster one? Here\u2019s another poser: is Steve Carell better in the US Office than Ricky Gervais is in the original? I\u2019m not sure, but what I regret losing is the opening credits that featured Slough in all its bomb-worthy glory to the sound of the Stereophonics singing Handbags and Gladrags.

One of the great pleasures, for me, of seeing Michael Caine as the cockney hit man roaming the north east to hunt down his brother\u2019s killer is the bit where he chucks a gangster off a brutalist car park in Gateshead. None of these cherishable local details remain in the 2000 remake starring a risibly moustachioed Sylvester Stallone, who plays a Vegas mob enforcer terminating Seattle hoods who whacked his brother. Caine, god love him, was even inveigled into a cameo, but even his imprimatur can\u2019t rescue a remake that the New York Times called \u201cso minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world\u2019s first movie without even a text\u201d.  </p> <p>Naturally, when it comes to remakes, Alfred Hitchcock is in a class of his own. His 1956 film The Man Who Knew Too Much is a retooling of a 1934 film of the same name \u2013 by one Alfred Hitchcock. Some lovely details get excised. Gone is the ending in which, for the final shoot-out with the rozzers, the criminals return to their lair \u2013 a temple to a sun-worshipping cult in Wapping. Instead of those barmy scenes are new ones that are no less preposterous. Can it be true that Doris Day helps foil an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister in the Royal Albert Hall?

But as a Tory MP and now leader and prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/18/theresa-may-does-it-matter-what-the-new-prime-minister-wears\">she embodies it</a>. What she wears embodies what she wants the party to be. Her wardrobe is an object lesson in brand management.</p> <p>May was first elected as an MP in 1997, the year of the Labour landslide, the year when there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/22/women.labour1\">101 Labour female MPs</a>. That year, precisely <a href=\"http://conservativewomen.uk/content/women-parliament\">13 Conservative women were elected</a>. And, in an 1998 interview after she became one of the first new MPs to be given a frontbench job, she was confident that gender was irrelevant. How she has changed.</p> <p>Back then, the Tories were in shock and in decline after 18 years in power. Recovery seemed distant. Yet, for Conservatives, office is always the principle ambition, and that means it often makes a very unconservative accommodation with social trends. After the 1997 defeat, powerful figures in the party grasped that appearing more female-friendly would be at the heart of modernisation. Soon, May was speaking on women\u2019s issues. In 2002, after the second election defeat, she became the first woman to chair the party. That was the year she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\">described the Tories as the \u201cnasty party\u201d</a>. It was the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/09/gender.fashion\">she wore kitten heels</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35bf3a0c3e5b77f043e2670559f0092d2ca44466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35bf3a0c3e5b77f043e2670559f0092d2ca44466/237_139_2104_3258/646.jpg\" alt=\"May dons a colour-block coat on her first day as prime minister.\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May dons a colour-block coat on her first day as prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kitten heels gave May an identity that was separate from her politics. In popular imagination, they were so ... well, unTory. They were a little quirky. They were almost cheeky. They were animal print, for heaven\u2019s sake! It was as if every other woman in the party was still in shiny leather brogues. What May said about herself with those shoes, she came also to say about the party. The shoes helped to identify where the change in public perception had to come; they began to lay the ground for a party leader who really was modernising. Only it was David Cameron who capitalised on it, not May.</p> <p>Fashion writers applaud May as a woman who treats the frontbench in the Commons like the front row at a fashion show. It\u2019s much more than that \u2013 since that day at the 2002 party conference, May has never stopped using how she looks to indicate what she is thinking.</p> <p>She dresses strikingly when she intends to make a striking intervention; as emphasis, not distraction. Last autumn, at the first party conference after the 2015 election victory, May made a deeply controversial speech about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/theresa-may-boutique/\">immigration in a zip-backed black Roland Mouret dress</a>. A few years earlier, she had been equally provocative about the Human Rights Act in another party conference speech, in a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2045156/Theresa-May-Ken-Clarke-clash-catgate-Human-Rights-Act.html\">waisted navy jacket and a dress with an asymmetric hemline</a>. During what turned out to be George Osborne\u2019s last budget in March, she <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3495666/Put-yer-baps-away-darling-Theresa-steals-budget-dress-divides-Twitter.html\">sat beside the chancellor in a scarlet dress</a>. Soon afterwards, she had a dramatic haircut, following Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> and Merkel with the power bob (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jul/26/pob-power-haircut-women-theresa-may-political-bob\">AKA the Pob</a>). At that point, it occurred to me she thought the Brexit vote might not go the government\u2019s way and that, if so, it would be her chance for the top. She was not going to lose out to the Camerons again. Picture the tortoise sturdily marching past the snoozing hare. Then remember last July\u2019s steps-of-Downing-Street colour-blocked coat and skirt by Amanda Wakeley, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/theresa-may-wears-amanda-wakeley-coat-to-enter-downing-street/\">read the wardrobe of triumph</a>.</p> <p>May can do this because wearing interesting clothes is at last a legitimate \u2013 maybe even a desirable \u2013 attribute for women in power, and she can take some of the credit for that. When she began her career in Westminster 20 years ago, an interest in fashion was taken as an indication of a woman who can read nothing more challenging than the captions to magazine fashion shoots. Labour women who took part in photo shoots soon after the election in 1997 were told they had destroyed their political credibility. When Sturgeon did the same thing in September last year, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225121/Sturgeon-attacks-hideous-cruel-focus-appearance-posing-glamorous-Vogue-photoshoot.html\">even the Daily Mail let it pass</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92d976941a0b8b6307520de4ff0ba0862747426a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d976941a0b8b6307520de4ff0ba0862747426a/228_1298_1489_1860/801.jpg\" alt=\"At the 2015 Conservative party conference.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the 2015 Conservative party conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May has played a part in making style a legitimate part of a political personality. She uses what she wears to underline her wider message: every public appearance announces that she is in touch with a reality outside Westminster (even if it is limited to prosperous southern England), and that she shares ordinary people\u2019s \u2013 or at least well-off people\u2019s \u2013 interests in the quotidian concerns of life. But her appearance says something else about her, too. From statement haircut to shiny toe cap, her appearance represents her freedom from anxiety about what other people think \u2013 a quality that, May\u2019s friends say, is one of her defining characteristics.</p> <p>May pushes boundaries with clothes as well as policies. Female MPs who reveal that, in fact, they \u2013 along with other women \u2013 do have breasts still get trolled on Twitter (when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alison-mcgovern\">Alison McGovern</a> wore a low-cut dress on Channel 4 News last year, she was <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mp-accused-flashing-cleavage-channel-6315978\">accused of deliberately trying to distract male viewers from the interview</a>). When May wore that red dress behind Osborne, I\u2019m not sure she thought she was reclaiming breasts from sexploitation. But she was saying that she will wear exactly what she likes.</p> <p>Contrast this with the Thatcher era. Margaret Thatcher made a Thatcher-shaped hole in the glass ceiling. Apart from the significant fact of being there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-no-feminist\">she did nothing to make it different for women</a>. Her lack of interest in feminist revolution was exemplified by many things she did, and also by her outfits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd7647f62dd965fe222b8272aa09b4fd0c953fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7647f62dd965fe222b8272aa09b4fd0c953fff/0_0_1646_3000/549.jpg\" alt=\"May\u2019s 2011 waisted jacket and dress.\" width=\"549\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May\u2019s 2011 waisted jacket and dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thatcher wore clothes to make her look less threatening than she was: her attitude to gender was far more fully described by her wardrobe than anything that she said (<a href=\"http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/101687\">a speech to the 1969 party conference archly quoting Socrates</a> \u2013 \u201cwhen woman is made equal to man she becomes his superior, and I would not dissent from anyone as wise as Socrates\u201d \u2013 may be the best indication of her fey approach). In Thatcher\u2019s view, women could share power only if they let men think that they were still making the tea.</p> <p>One of the more odd developments in feminist politics is the motherhood divide. In last year\u2019s Labour leadership contest, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/does-it-matter-liz-kendalls-not-mother-row-reveals-more-you-think\">Helen Goodman suggested Yvette Cooper\u2019s experience as a mother made her the best candidate</a>. It is a terrifying thought that if Andrea Leadsom, a mother, had not tried the same line against the childless May, Leadsom might now be prime minister.</p> <p>But it has become much more likely that men will face similar random tests of their familiarity with voters\u2019 experiences. Women are no longer obliged to pretend to be domestic goddesses. It\u2019s hard to imagine May bothering to perpetuate the myth that she cooks for Philip every night the way <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/08/5-surprising-things-you-didnt-know-about-margaret-thatcher/\">Thatcher apparently cooked for Denis</a>. Mr May has already been objectified as Maidenhead man, and <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion-news/theresa-may-s-husband-peter-may-the-style-file-3581\">his choice of outfits is almost as scrutinised as hers</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1686925/theresa-may-reveals-she-hates-her-nose-and-compares-herself-to-elizabeth-i-in-an-astonishingly-candid-interview/\">May says her heroine is Elizabeth I</a>: head of a buccaneering nation; queen of Galleon Britain.

  "<p><br>Migrant workers and their supporters are planning a day of action to highlight their role in the UK in what is being billed as a celebration of the contribution they make to British society.</p> <p>Plans for the event, called One Day Without Us, include a labour boycott to show how important migrants are to the UK workforce.</p> <p>Organiser Matt Carr, a writer and commentator, has urged migrants and their supporters to join in the day of action on 20 February 2017. He said the trigger for the event was profound concern about worsening attitudes to migrants in the UK.</p> <p>Carr said he believed that those who voted against Brexit, and also many of those who voted in favour of it, were alarmed at the levels of racism and xenophobia that had manifested before and after the referendum vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make this an inclusive event,\u2019\u2019 Carr said. \u201cWe realise that because of the legal constraints on striking, many workers will not be able to take formal strike action. However, they can choose to support this event simply by taking the day off work.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was surprised how quickly the event had gathered momentum. Despite discussions taking place in a closed Facebook group over a few days, Carr said there were now about 6,000 people involved in the conversation about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1769655753283868/\">A Day Without Us</a>. </p> <p>The aim of the day of action is to emphasise the variety of work migrants undertake to help keep the UK afloat \u2013 from NHS doctors to those who staff the hospitality sector. The organisers say a day without migrant labour will demonstrate how much the economy would struggle without their contribution.<br></p> <p>The day of action, scheduled to coincide with the UN\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/socialjusticeday/\">World Day of Social Justice</a>, is based on similar events <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1189899,00.html\">in the US in 2006</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/world/europe/02iht-italy.html?_r=1\">in Italy in 2010</a>.</p> <p>Carr plans to approach religious and community organisations as well as political parties and trade unions to support the idea and to ensure it takes place across the country and is rooted in local communities.</p> <p></p> <p>Carr said he was hopeful that employers who relied on migrant labour would support the strike and shut their businesses for the day. \u201cSince Brexit we have seen levels of xenophobia and racism that have been increasingly legitimised. We want to make a bold and powerful statement and give migrants an opportunity to express themselves,\u201d he said. </p>",

When the camp clearances take place in the next few weeks we will be working very closely with the French.\u201d<br></p> <p>Rudd told MPs that the French authorities had agreed to verify by the end of this week a list of 387 child refugees with a legal right to come to the UK drawn up by the campaign group Citizens UK. \u201cOnce we have that official list we will move quickly within days and remove very quickly those children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rudd said that as many children as possible with direct family links in Britain would be brought to the UK under the Dublin convention before the Calais camp was closed, while the rest would be transferred during the rest of the operation. </p> <p>\u201cI emphasised to Monsieur Cazeneuve that we should transfer as many minors as possible from the camp eligible under the Dublin regulation before clearance commences, with the remainder coming over within the next few days of operation,\u201d Rudd told the Commons.</p> <p>\u201cI also outlined my views that those children eligible under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act 2016, must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered.\u201d Rudd added that Britain was prepared to help fund the accommodation. <br></p> <p>MPs on all sides welcomed the home secretary\u2019s apparent new sense of urgency on the issue. </p> <p>The chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, Yvette Cooper, said the home secretary\u2019s commitment to take all the Calais child refugees with family in the UK \u201cwithin the next two weeks\u201d was important and welcome.</p> <p>\u201cClearance of the Calais camp is due to start next week but there still aren\u2019t proper safe places for the hundreds of unaccompanied children to go \u2013 putting them at even greater risk of trafficking and abuse,\u201d said Cooper.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe commitment for the first time to take additional children from Calais under the Dubs amendment is also an important one \u2013 but we need to know how many and how fast, and what will happen to them when the camp is cleared next week.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd promised that bureaucracy would no longer hamper the government\u2019s determination to help the lone child refugees in the camp. A second Home Office asylum expert is to be sent to France and an official-level contact group has been set up between the two governments to deal with the situation. In London a dedicated Home Office team has been set up within its \u201cDublin unit\u201d to process the transfers.</p> <p>Rudd refused to put a figure on the number of child refugees who were likely to be brought to Britain as a result of the expected deal or give a likely timetable, saying it would only help the people traffickers. She did however tell the Daily Mail in an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3829954/Child-refugees-finally-coming-UK-Home-Secretary-says-100-unaccompanied-youngsters-arrive-weeks.html\">interview published on Monday</a> that if 300 child refugees came to the UK that would be \u201ca really good result\u201d.</p> <p>The French have also refused to name a specific date on their planned clearance of the refugee camp in Calais but it is expected that its closure will rapidly follow the agreement between the French and British over the fate of the near 1,000 unaccompanied child asylum seekers believed to be in the camp.</p> <p>The deal is not expected to cover the estimated 9,000 adult asylum seekers in the Calais camp who will instead be dispersed to other centres around France when the camp closes. Those adults with close family ties to Britain will have their claims to be transferred to the UK considered under the lengthy Dublin relocation process.<br></p> <p>Officials from the main French children\u2019s charity working in Calais started a census of all the children currently based in the camp on Monday. The registration of all children was expected to take two days and will be used to verify the original list of 387 children with a legal right to go to the UK provided to the Home Office on 2 September.</p> <p>The Calais prefecture asked the organisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/calais-refugee-children-abandoning-plans-to-reach-uk\">France Terre d\u2019Asile</a> to conduct a census of all minors, collecting names and ages of all the children currently living in the camp. <br></p> <p>Although Citizens UK and the local charity L\u2019Auberge des Migrants have previously counted and made unofficial registers of the children, the population is very fluid, with some children leaving and new children arriving every day. A spokesperson from France Terre d\u2019Asile said it would not comment on its findings until the census was complete. </p> <p>Mary Jones, who runs the Kids\u2019 Cafe in the camp, where approximately 200 unaccompanied children receive free food daily, said she had been told to expect representatives from the charity on Monday to begin making a list of minors. \u201cIf they are focused on under-12s, there are very few of them. The youngest, an eight-year-old, made his way to the UK at the weekend,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The campaigner and actor Juliet Stevenson, representing Citizens UK\u2019s Safe Passage project in Calais, said she welcomed the government\u2019s announcement that it was willing to take in some of the unaccompanied children from the camp in Calais. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, they need to do it much faster. Much faster,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery night unaccompanied children are risking their lives trying to reach the UK, and the imminent threat of the demolition of the camp is only making them more desperate.\u201d</p>",

He set the tone however he pleased.</p> <p>There was no room for race talk, but there was room for a hall of questioners who mostly seemed like props made out of meat, bolstering the TV producers\u2019 illusion of democracy. They asked softball questions with little substance. They reflected well how the US has been bullied into a state of idiocy, fear, shame and incuriosity.</p> <p>There was room for more questions about Hillary\u2019s email server \u2013 and none at all about the biggest social movement of the day, which exploded in 2014 just down the road from the hall.</p> <p>When a Muslim American woman <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/9/13220702/second-presidential-debate-live-transcript-clinton-trump\">asked</a>: \u201cWith Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being a threat to the country after the election is over?\u201d there was no room to answer her plea about prejudice. Trump began ranting about San Bernardino, Orlando, 9/11 and \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d. That was expected, but Clinton\u2019s response was depressing, too. </p> <p>Though more sympathetic, it only took her seconds to say: \u201cWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our frontlines\u201d \u2013 a burden white people would never be asked to bear about their most deplorable race kind \u2013 and to invoke the war against Isis!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/09/debate-live-fact-check-trump-tape-presidential-election-republican-critics\">Second US presidential debate \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How race did come up was in how Trump <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/9/13220702/second-presidential-debate-live-transcript-clinton-trump\">referred</a> to \u201cmany illegal aliens\u201d as \u201cmurderers and some very bad people\u201d, painting them as sexual threats to American women, which he has been doing for more than a year.

I know Clinton will be better than Trump in many ways, but she\u2019s not going to protect black people. Not really. At best she will maintain the status quo, which even with a black man in the White House involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/14/black-lives-five-years-shorter-why-we-interrupt-you\">black folks dying younger</a>, having a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-opportunity-wealth_us_568c44cee4b0c8beacf4a391\">fraction of white wealth</a>, being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/09/27/yale-study-suggests-racial-bias-among-preschool-teachers/\">considered guilty in preschool</a> and being more likely to be <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/\">arrested</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">killed</a> by police. Another Clinton presidency will not change this.</p> <p>And yet, as the writer Kiese Laymon mused, I looked at Clinton, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel physically afraid for her as she faced off against this monster, seething with white male rage \u2013 this man who stalked her around stage and who cut her off whenever she spoke, even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/09/everything-that-was-said-at-the-second-donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-debate-highlighted/\">just to say</a> \u201cyou have nothing to say\u201d.</p> <p>Trump managed to dictate the conversation however he wanted, and so maybe there would never have been a chance to discuss Black Lives Matter. But if racism can\u2019t be vigorously debated in a town hall in 2016, in St Louis, when we have a black president, then what hope do we have?</p> <p>Perhaps it is appropriate then that Black Lives Matter never came up, even in St Louis. It is a movement taking up issues which are beyond the scope of presidential politics and the failures of the American political system. Sunday night made that all too clear.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 10 October 2016 to reflect the fact that Washington University in St Louis is around 8 miles from the Canfield Apartments, where Michael Brown was killed.

Wealthy and abashed GOP-ers gulped $29 glasses of Silver Oak cabernet and sidled up next to self-righteous silver-haired Democrat hippies to ask sheepishly for a toke off their joints, and we all, CEOs and chakra readers, dads and daughters, young and old, disappeared into the music.</p> <p>When golden gods of rock are your escorts, of course, that escape comes at a price: tickets alone already generated a cool $160m from the estimated 75,000 attendees. A general admission weekend pass to the fest cost $399, but to stand in line for overpriced wine with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/oct/10/great-barrier-reef-legacy-invites-leonardo-dicaprio-to-join-its-campaign-video\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> or Tommy Lee, both of whom were spotted at the festival, you had to pony up $1,599 for tickets in the pit.

At 73, Mick Jagger strutted down the catwalk better than Cara Delevingne, who was watching the Rolling Stones\u2019 ecstatic set of nonstop hits. Dangling a cigarette from one hand and grinning crookedly, Keith Richards played with obvious joy. Neil Young delivered the best line of the festival (\u201cCome back tomorrow night \u2013 Roger\u2019s gonna build a wall and make Mexico great again\u201d) and ripped into a 20-plus-minute rendition of Down by the River. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> stayed on stage for almost three hours, the Who roared what seemed to be the loudest set of the festival and Waters saved the whole thing from being stuck in the past by using the stage as a political platform. Dylan elicited some grumbles by not saying a word to the audience or allowing his face to be shown on the big screens, but a fan plugging up his phone to a charging station shrugged and said he\u2019d been the same way when he saw him play in 1978.</p> <p>When news of Desert Trip\u2019s two-show-per-night lineup and cushy seating options broke in mid-April, it coincided with Coachella, the sweaty, frantic festival that squeezes in nearly 60 shows and 100,000 partiers per day.

What we are saying is that this is not an occasion for this. We need to be pointing out the needs of this island and making demands for the Irish people. It is not their job to be pushing for the wishes of the British government.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit has presented a huge amount of challenges for the Irish government in terms of the trading relationship with Britain, both to the UK and between Northern Ireland and Ireland. To add on the task of immigration controls, I think is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>His colleague Mairead McGuinness, a Fine Gael MEP for the same constituency, said she did not support the notion of Ireland taking on Britain\u2019s immigration controls.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But she said no such discussions had taken place and that Brokenshire\u2019s remarks centred on \u201cincreased cooperation between the UK and Ireland with regard to combatting illegal immigration, such as sharing immigration data for non-EU nationals entering the common travel area\u201d. She said this built on existing efforts that were unrelated to the outcome of the UK\u2019s EU referendum.</p> <p>The former taoiseach John Bruton recently warned of the \u201cincalculable consequences\u201d that Brexit would have on trade.</p> <p>\u201cThe underlying assumption of the Good Friday agreement \u2026 was that both parts of Ireland would be included in a zone of free movement of goods and people, an assumption that is in the process of being unilaterally reversed by the UK side\u2019s decision to leave that zone.

  "<h2>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!</h2> <p>One game under the belt for Caretaker Gareth and things are looking up for England. Winning the first match under their new manager was decent enough. But the real challenge was whether he would exhibit the necessary self-control required to stay clear of celebrating Saturday\u2019s thumping 2-0 win over Malta by hiring a gold limousine to take him out for a big night in London\u2019s West End, during which he would unwittingly accept a lucrative offer to feature as a keynote speaker at the Pizza Hut Christmas party later this year, all while taking gulps from a pint of absinthe. It would all end with him saying he\u2019s never much cared for Mary Berry\u2019s recipes and that would be that; Phil Brown would have been England\u2019s manager by the end of the week. But no, none of that for Caretaker Gareth, which means he\u2019s already one up on his predecessor. After the debacle of Big Sam\u2019s grubby demise it\u2019s progress, enough for $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver to proclaim England as favourites for the next World Cup if they maintain this rate of improvement.<br></p> <p>For all that Malta cowered as England squelched past them, Caretaker Gareth wasn\u2019t entirely pleased. While it initially seemed that he wasn\u2019t going to rock the boat, heightening the impression that he\u2019s too nice to succeed in the job, he\u2019s decided that it\u2019s time to steer it into some choppy waters, having come to the conclusion that the majority of England supporters reached a long time ago: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifier\">it seems he\u2019s about to drop Wazziesta</a> for Tuesday\u2019s World Cup qualifier in Slovenia. That\u2019s right. No more Mr Nice Caretaker Gareth. He\u2019s unveiled his mean streak and the first casualty is his wheezing, spluttering, red-faced captain, whose attempt to convert himself from a deadly striker to a midfield maestro looks more doomed than ever, with that trademark crossfield pass out to the right-back not enough to spare him from a place on the bench.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/wayne-rooney-gareth-southgate-england-slovenia-world-cup-2018-qualifier\">Wayne Rooney set to be dropped by Gareth Southgate for England qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now we can drop the pretence that Wazziesta was any use during Euro 2016. While it\u2019s a brave move in some ways, it\u2019s an obvious one in so many others. It won\u2019t cure all of England\u2019s flaws, it is slightly reminiscent of Schecond\u2013Schoish Schteve\u2019s decision to omit David Beckham from his first squad after replacing $exy Sven and there is every chance that Wazziesta will be back in the side sooner rather than later, given how these episodes have played out in the past. Above all, however, it does show two things. Firstly Caretaker Gareth isn\u2019t overawed by fame, unlike, say the surprisingly timid Sam Allardyce. Secondly that he is the owner of a functioning pair of eyes, enabling him to spot that England would probably be better off with a lump of cheese instead of Wazziesta in midfield.

  "<p>The pound has continued to fall against the US dollar as worries persist over the UK\u2019s economic prospects outside the EU.</p> <p>Sterling suffered sharp losses last week as ministers at the Conservative party conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">signalled they would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d settlement</a> that sacrifices access to the single market and prioritises stricter immigration controls. </p> <p>Sterling was under pressure again at the beginning of this week but some calm had returned to markets. The pound fell 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2395 on Monday. It was flat against the euro at \u20ac1.11. </p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s weakness boosted the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index \u2013 which features companies that make a significant proportion of their profits in dollars \u2013 as it closed at 7,097.5, near its record closing high of 7,104 last year.</p> <p>Investor nerves were strained on Friday when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\">the pound slumped more than 8% in a \u201cflash crash\u201d in overnight trading in Asia</a>. It dropped from $1.26 to $1.1491 in just eight minutes \u2013 a huge plunge in a market where a single cent is a big change \u2013 and recovered only some of those losses during London trading hours. Sterling still ended the week about 4% lower against the euro and US dollar.</p> <p>One market watcher said the currency was stabilising after the events of Friday morning. \u201cThe dust has started to settle after the flash crash overnight on Thursday saw the pound briefly trade below \u20ac1.10 and $1.20,\u201d said Chris Saint, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s currency service.</p> <p>With a quiet week ahead on the economic indicator front, he expected the pound to continue to take its cues from politics. \u201cThere is little on the domestic calendar this week to draw attentions away from ongoing worries over how politicians will handle Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, although Friday\u2019s construction output data will garner some interest,\u201d said Saint.</p> <p>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that the \u201cmajor part of the fall\u201d in the pound to a 31-year-low had been down to a \u201cflash crash\u201d. He told parliament on Monday: \u201cThere will be lots of speculative comments in the next two-and-a-half-years that will drive the pound down and up and down and up and there is little we can do about that.\u201d</p> <p>The pound\u2019s sharp fall has raised pressure on those UK firms that rely on imports, such as retailers and those manufacturers who need raw materials like plastics and metals. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive. On the other hand, it makes UK exports more competitive and some companies have reported a pick-up in overseas sales since the British vote to leave the EU in June knocked sterling.</p> <p>For consumers, the weak pound makes overseas holidays more expensive. There are also worries that sterling\u2019s fall will be felt at the tills as retailers pass on their higher costs. The British Retail Consortium warned on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/prices-will-shoot-up-if-uk-fails-to-get-eu-single-market-access-retailers-warn\">a failure to get a good trade deal would push prices up further still</a> as shops adjust to higher trade tariffs.</p> <p>Currency experts expect the pound to remain under pressure against the dollar on continued fears about the UK economic outlook. Another key factor keeping the pound low against the dollar is the prospect of US interest rates being raised while the Bank of England has hinted that with economic growth weak interest rates in the UK have further to fall from their already record low of 0.25%.</p> <p>The dollar and US stocks were also boosted on Monday by a market view that Hillary Clinton had won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">latest US presidential debate</a> against Donald Trump. </p> <p>Jasper Lawler, analyst at online trading company CMC Markets, said the \u201cfascinating presidential debate left markets\u2019 favourite Hillary Clinton with a firm lead in the polls. Donald Trump was more measured in the debate but the damage had already been done after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">\u2018lewd comments\u2019 video</a> was leaked two days earlier.\u201d</p>",

I don\u2019t think that incident in the last game will have too much effect. They are professional players. They have all been through it before. I think if anyone gets caught up in that type of thing it will be an advantage to the other team.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest problem was England\u2019s batsmen let the bowlers down. To limit Bangladesh to 238 was a fine effort \u2013 none of whom performed badly \u2013 in the heat of day, although allowing the tail, led by the estimable (and, after his fine, now slightly poorer) Mashrafe Mortaza, to thieve 75 from the final 10 overs perhaps began the rot.</p> <p>But from ball one, when Jason Roy survived an lbw appeal, England simply could not read the grippy surface. Only the brilliant Buttler and, comically, Jake Ball, who matched his highest List A score, got the measure of the pitch. If England struggled with the second track at Mirpur (and in fact it was seam, not spin, that did for them), then they will not like Chittagong much either, where it should be slower and grippier still, and the toss \u2013 win and stick them in \u2013 is key. Mitigation, as Bayliss says, comes in the order\u2019s relative youth.</p> <p>\u201cWe were disappointed by the way we played,\u201d he said. \u201cWe showed the inexperience we have in the batting order on this tour. We won the toss and bowled thinking the wicket in the first game skidded on with the dew but it wasn\u2019t quite as warm and there was nowhere near as much dew. The ball was holding up more often off the wicket than it was in the first innings but still 240 in this day and age on any wicket, if you bat well, you should achieve it. We were disappointed not achieving that target.\u201d</p> <p>Even with England\u2019s notable absentees, as Farbrace said on the tour\u2019s opening weekend, the ideal scenario would have been to mix up things in Chittagong. England may still but the regime\u2019s method, as they have said many times, is to give a player a game too many rather than one too few. So James Vince, a beneficiary of that mantra in the Test side last summer, should play, although there will be temptation perhaps to squeeze in Sam Billings.

Trying to come up with that depth for 2019 it is a good exercise in that. Along the way we hopefully find some young guys who can step up to the mark and England cricket goes on into the future. From that point of view it is a good exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Already the tour\u2019s second \u2013 and vital \u2013 period looms. The Tests here will be essential in developing a strategy for taming India, while Bangladesh will prove sturdy opposition themselves.</p> <p>There are 21 England players here (only Alastair Cook is absent) in Chittagong as the baton begins its journey from the white-ball guns to the Test specialists \u2013 including Gareth Batty and Haseeb Hameed, 20 years apart in age when the former turns 39 on Thursday \u2013 with the ever-decreasing number with feet in both camps. One of those is Buttler, whose limited-overs form, comfort in alien conditions and increasing centrality to the squad make him look worthy of a queue-jump pass.

  "<p>So it turns out that Alicia Keys, whose comeback has been based around the concept of being makeup-free, isn\u2019t quite as untouched as she claims to be. Last week, in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/story/alicia-keys-no-makeup-glowing-complexion-secrets\">W magazine</a>, her makeup artist Dotti revealed that Keys wears brow definer, self-tanning anti-ageing serum and mattifier that total more than \u00a3300. The singer also applies cucumber pulp and does \u201cice work\u201d on her skin (rolling an ice stick on her face until the blood rushes to the surface) to achieve the bare, fresh-faced naturalism she is after. \u201cIt practically makes her skin say, \u2018Hi. I love you,\u2019\u201d Dotti explains.</p> <p>Keys has been lauded for her #nomakeup look and it has been central to a new album campaign, underscored by tastefully shot black-and-white photos. In May, she penned a <a href=\"http://www.lennyletter.com/style/a410/alicia-keys-time-to-uncover/\">letter for Lenny</a> (Lena Dunham\u2019s online newsletter) explaining why she was ditching heavy cosmetics. \u201cIn one song I wrote, called When a Girl Can\u2019t Be Herself,\u201d Keyes wrote. \u201cIt says: \u2018In the morning from the minute I wake up / what if I don\u2019t want to put on all that makeup / who says I must conceal what I\u2019m made of / Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my esteem.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to cover up any more.

  "<p>A pro-leave Tory MP has applied for an urgent debate on Brexit in an attempt to prevent the government from negotiating the terms for leaving the EU without consulting parliament.<br></p> <p>Stephen Phillips, who voted to leave in the referendum, said the government appeared intent on negotiating \u201cwithout any regard to the House of Commons\u201d in a way that was \u201cfundamentally undemocratic, unconstitutional and cuts across the rights and privileges of the legislature\u201d. </p> <p>Phillips said: \u201cI and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government that apparently wishes to ignore the views of the house on the most important issue facing the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips said he voted to leave for reasons of restoring sovereignty but was not a supporter of the official leave campaign.</p> <p>The barrister, a member of the public accounts committee, said it was apparent after the Conservative party conference that the government had no intention of consulting parliament about its negotiating aims, and this was \u201csimply not an acceptable way for the executive to proceed\u201d.</p> <p>He said Theresa May\u2019s government had \u201cno authority or mandate to adopt a negotiating position without reference to the wishes of the house and those of the British people expressed through their elected representatives\u201d.</p> <p>He has written to the Speaker, John Bercow, to request the urgent debate for this week, which will be ruled on later on Monday. </p> <p>Asked about Phillips\u2019s comments, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said it was absolutely necessary for MPs to scrutinise the process of leaving the EU but that MPs should not be given a vote on the package negotiated.</p> <p>He said: \u201cParliament is of course going to debate and scrutinise that process as it goes on. That is absolutely necessary and the right thing to do. But having a second vote, or a vote to second-guess the will of the British people, is not an acceptable way forward.\u201d</p> <p>There appears to be growing disquiet among MPs \u2013 both from the leave and remain camps \u2013 about the government\u2019s decision to press ahead with triggering article 50, which starts the two-year \u201cdivorce process\u201d, without consulting parliament about the kind of relationship the UK should have with the EU in the future.</p> <p>Phillips\u2019s application for the debate was in addition to former Labour leader Ed Miliband\u2019s unsuccessful request for an urgent question on the issue in the Commons. Instead of the question, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is due to give a statement on plans to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fd8eab90b80dff29b96af96a0068c96db0ba6de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd8eab90b80dff29b96af96a0068c96db0ba6de/0_67_4302_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Soubry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Soubry said parliament needed a proper debate about the terms of Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Pruchnie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miliband and Phillips were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/tory-mp-anna-soubry-concerned-rush-hard-brexit\">backed by Anna Soubry</a>, the former Tory business minister involved with the Open Britain campaign group, which aims to hold the government to account over Brexit.</p> <p>Soubry said she had been in touch with the former Labour leader over the weekend and was supporting his request to press the government to allow proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process. <br></p> <p>Miliband\u2019s push <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\">has attracted cross-party support</a> from MPs alarmed at May\u2019s indication that the UK is likely to leave the EU\u2019s single market when it departs the bloc.</p> <p>Soubry said she and Miliband had talked on Saturday. \u201cI want to make it very clear that we began our conversation from the absolutely shared position that we accept the result of the EU referendum, that we are leaving the EU,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Hard Brexit risks destroying UK's open economy, says CBI chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe do take exception to the idea that this is an effort to thwart the will of the people.

About 75,000 Syrians have since been trapped in no-man\u2019s land, unable to either enter Jordan or return to Syria.</p> <p>Aid groups managed to deliver food and supplies by lorry until June this year when Jordan sealed the border to all traffic after a car bomb in the area. In the four months since, refugees at the \u201cberm\u201d \u2013 as the border fortifications are known \u2013 have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/ghost-refugees-stuck-jordan-border-syria-disease-aid-workers-say\">virtually without humanitarian aid</a>. </p> <p>Without formal shelter, refugees had dug holes in the ground to escape a Russian bombing raid. At the height of summer, when temperatures reached 50C (122F), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said those at the berm were experiencing \u201csome of the most extreme conditions on Earth\u201d.</p> <p>But there was a glimmer of hope on Monday when the Jordanian government said aid could be delivered without opening the border \u2013 by using a crane to regularly lift supplies over the berm, or sandy ridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/jordan/giv-31075CjvEHddFajb8/\" data-alt=\"The berm\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/jordan/giv-31075CjvEHddFajb8/\">The berm</a> </figure>  <p>Aid groups in Jordan told the Guardian nothing had been confirmed. But Mohammed Momani, a government spokesman, said in interviews with <a href=\"http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-allows-aid-delivery-cranes-berm-refugees\">the Jordan Times</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/jordan-permit-regular-aid-drops-crane-syrians-42694612\">Associated Press</a> (AP) that a plan had been set in motion.</p> <p>\u201cThe new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes, and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,\u201d he told AP. Aid was previously delivered using a crane once in August.</p> <p>If the plan goes ahead, the aid could alleviate a dire humanitarian situation on the border, where <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/syria-jordan-border-75000-refugees-trapped-in-desert-no-mans-land-in-dire-conditions/\">Amnesty International says</a> disease is rife owing to the absence of medical care since the start of summer.</p> <p>Several people have died of hepatitis, and <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/syria-jordan-border-75000-refugees-trapped-in-desert-no-mans-land-in-dire-conditions/\">satellite footage obtained by Amnesty</a> last month showed refugees had begun to create makeshift burial grounds in which to inter the corpses. \u201cMany people have died,\u201d one refugee at the border told the charity. \u201cThe humanitarian situation is very bad, the situation of children in particular is very bad. We have drinking water but hardly any food or milk \u2026 [it] is awful.\u201d</p> <p>Amnesty cautiously welcomed Monday\u2019s announcement, but warned that cranes were no substitute for allowing aid workers direct access to the 75,000 refugees.</p> <p>Khairunissa Dhala, a refugee researcher for Amnesty, said: \u201cNews that humanitarian assistance will be resumed to tens of thousands of refugees stranded at the berm comes as a welcome relief. However, Amnesty International is extremely concerned about reports that aid will be delivered by crane rather than through a response that would allow for organisations to have unfettered humanitarian access to refugees at the berm who continue to live in inhumane conditions. <br></p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, this short-term solution must not distract the Jordanian government and the international community from finding a sustainable longer\u2013term solution for the stranded refugees. Jordan, must allow refugees at the berm into the country while carrying out necessary checks in line with international standards, to allay security concerns. World leaders must also relieve the pressure on host countries like Jordan by assuming their fair share of responsibility and significantly increasing resettlement places offered.\u201d</p> <p>The situation highlights the worsening prospects for displaced Syrians hoping to reach safety outside their home country. In the early years of the Syrian war, refugees could easily flee to neighbouring countries, with about 2.5 million escaping to Turkey, 1.2 million to Lebanon and more than 650,000 to Jordan. Syrian refugees now make up about a fifth of Lebanon\u2019s population and a 10th of Jordan\u2019s.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But as the war dragged on, Middle Eastern countries gradually shut their borders, particularly once it became clear that western countries would not share the responsibility by resettling significant numbers in Europe and North America.</p> <p>Syrian refugees must now choose between living under regime rule; fleeing to refugee camps in rebel territory, which have at times been overrun by jihadis or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/syrian-refugee-camp-bombing-airstrikes-sarmada-un-msf\">bombed by the government</a>; or risk being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/turkey-safe-haven-refugees-shoots-border-illegal-deportations-syrians\">shot on the Turkish border</a> as they smuggle themselves across.</p>",

Once gathered, the data remains on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-pupil-database\" title=\"\">national pupil database</a>, where <a href=\"http://defenddigitalme.com/\" title=\"\">it can be shared with third parties</a> such as thinktanks, data management consultancies and journalists.</p> <p>For the government this is apparently <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/schools-must-collect-data-on-immigrant-children-from-autumn\" title=\"\">about limiting \u201ceducation tourism\u201d</a> and better allocating resources for children with English as an additional language (EAL).

  "<p>If you ignore the nasty, divisive rhetoric on immigration and the worrying attempt to position \u201chuman rights lawyers\u201d as figures of hate, Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\">conference speech</a> was basically an admission that Ed Miliband had it right. Gone was the individualism and free-market fetishism that has defined her party for decades. In its place, a focus on collectivity and the necessity of activist economic policy.</p> <p>The reception among conference attendees was fairly muted. Mutters of \u201csocialism\u201d were heard from the floor, and libertarian thinktank the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/news/may-must-accept-that-markets-not-the-state-are-the-solution-to-our-problems\">Adam Smith Institute published a statement</a> condemning the move towards government intervention.</p> <p>In many ways it feels like the death of an old order. Post-financial crash, there\u2019s little reason to believe in the efficacy of a laissez-faire approach to governance. It\u2019s strange to think that a decade ago, Labour and the Conservatives were competing over who could most enthusiastically deregulate the financial sector. The mood of the country has changed dramatically. We were told that we should celebrate the rich getting richer because the wealth would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/trickle-down-economics-broken-promise-richest-85\">trickle down</a> and benefit us all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no point telling people that immigration is beneficial for the economy if they\u2019re not feeling those benefits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, there\u2019s a feeling that we\u2019ve been conned. Elites have taken us for fools as employment rights have been rolled back, communities have been destroyed and our economy has been savaged by the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/22/vince-cable-criticism-attacks-capitalism\">spivs and gamblers</a>\u201d in the City. No wonder the \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan of the Vote Leave campaign was so seductive. Collective control is exactly what we\u2019d lost. EU membership became a symbol of the faceless, unaccountable, technocratic power that people in many parts of the country have grown to resent.</p> <p>In hindsight, the return of class politics was inevitable. Twenty years ago, John Prescott told us that \u201cwe are all middle-class now\u201d \u2013 but in 2016, the stark divisions in our society are impossible to ignore. Across Europe, centrism is in a similar state of decline. Even the term seems outdated, as the centre point of public opinion is now in a different place altogether. Collectivism is the new mainstream. The most relevant debate isn\u2019t over the necessity of working together, it\u2019s about who is allowed in the tent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/565ge\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2779394\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come\u2019 \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f51072e4b08ebe3d557166\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\">Theresa May\u2019s speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the dawn of the post-liberal era we have the opportunity to make a choice. When we demand policy that benefits the majority rather than an elite minority, who does that include? There are two options here and it\u2019s clear which May has opted for. The sort of rightwing, xenophobic rhetoric she espouses has a long and unillustrious history. Focusing her critique primarily on economic elites would probably be difficult given that they make up the majority of Conservative party donors and cabinet ministers. Instead, she has trained her guns on a group far less able to fight back: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/the-message-of-brexit-was-mixed-now-we-are-told-it-was-simply-a-referendum-on-immigration\">migrant workers</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/18/mass-eu-migration-into-britain-is-actually-good-news-for-uk-economy\">Mass EU migration into Britain is actually good news for UK economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The terrifying thing is that this has a track record of working \u2013 and it\u2019s working again.

When people face real hardship, when they\u2019ve seen their communities decline in the face of processes they feel powerless to control, they\u2019re naturally on the lookout for someone to blame. Media barons like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> \u2013 who are much more the genuine enemies of working-class interests \u2013 have stoked the idea that migrants are the cause of all society\u2019s problems.</p> <p>The facts of the situation are largely irrelevant. There\u2019s no point telling people that immigration is actually beneficial for the economy if they\u2019re not feeling those benefits. Pointing out that migrants are net tax contributors doesn\u2019t have much impact when people have seen our public services gutted. On the left, we\u2019ve tried to fight powerful, emotional narratives with stats and wonkery, and unsurprisingly we\u2019ve come up short. It\u2019s time to talk to voters in language that makes sense.</p> <p>Some aspects of this will make those with liberal instincts uncomfortable. In the face of venomous, racist, anti-migrant rhetoric many of us feel a natural desire to defend freedom of movement without any qualification. This allows the line to become blurred between the utopian principle that people should be able to live wherever they want and the reality of what is currently happening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/11/the-media-needs-to-tell-the-truth-on-migration-not-peddle-myths\">The media needs to tell the truth on migration, not peddle myths | Alberto Nardelli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people do not relocate out of a personal desire to experience life somewhere new, but because economic pressures compel them to seek a higher income than they\u2019d be able to secure in their place of birth. Why should someone from Sheffield or Bolton be forced to move down to London \u2013 away from family, friends and support networks? Why should someone from Poland or Romania have to live in cramped, shared accommodation and send money to a partner and children hundreds of miles away? Whose interests does this really serve?</p> <p>While supporting all workers making these decisions in the current economic context, shouldn\u2019t the left have greater ambitions than this? How has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/15/norman-tebbit-interview\">Norman Tebbit\u2019s instruction to \u201cget on your bike\u201d</a> if you can\u2019t find decent employment close to home come to be seen as something desirable?</p> <p>If we only talk about the positives of the current regime, we\u2019re never going to connect with voters who don\u2019t perceive that their lives have improved in recent decades. And the issue is not going to go away. Climate change is the greatest looming threat and is likely to cause refugee flows magnitudes greater than the current Syrian crisis. It\u2019s going to be hard to adjust. Unless we can develop a version of collectivist politics that doesn\u2019t draw a sharp line between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthe other\u201d, the most likely consequence is rising hate, fear, and a political culture that edges closer to the exclusionary authoritarianism of fascism.</p> <p>Labour will never convince people that it has the answers if it is forced into defending the status quo. However, the cynical triangulation attempted by some MPs in recent weeks concedes ground to xenophobia, while utterly failing to persuade voters that its advocates mean what they say. It\u2019s time to ditch the reticence and come up with a more radical vision: what do we actually want the future to look like?</p>",
  "<p>Pope Francis has put his progressive stamp on the American Catholic church with the selection of three new like-minded cardinals \u2013 including one who has sparred with the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mike Pence \u2013 in a clear rejection of bishops who have advocated for the church\u2019s exclusion of divorced and LGBT Catholics.</p> <p>The American choices were among 17 new cardinals named by Francis. He has chosen more from the developing world and only one from Italy, reflecting his desire to decentralise power away from the Vatican in Rome.</p> <p>In choosing these new cardinals \u2013 the \u201cprinces of the church\u201d who serve as the pope\u2019s primary advisers \u2013 Francis has made it more likely that his successor will be a moderate or progressive. It also partially balances out the influence of the cardinals chosen by his far more conservative predecessors, Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. </p> <p>The choices could create a \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://cruxnow.com/analysis/2016/10/09/popes-cardinal-picks-bernardins-seamless-garment-back/\">seismic shift</a>\u201d in the Catholic hierarchy in the US, according to John Allen, a commentator from Crux, a Catholic news publication. While the selection of Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis, Kevin Farrell of Dallas and Blase Cupich of Chicago could not be considered liberal by conventional political standards, Allen wrote that each was considered to be part of the \u201ccentrist, non-cultural warrior wing of the country\u2019s hierarchy\u201d.</p> <p>Of the three, Tobin was the surprise choice, in part because cardinals are usually chosen from the main centres of power in the biggest Catholic countries, and Indianapolis does not fit the bill. He has sought a greater voice for women in the church and was involved in a high-profile battle with Pence last year, after the Indiana governor \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/vp-nominees-tim-kaine-mike-pence-catholic\">a former Catholic who converted to evangelical Protestantism</a> \u2013 fought Tobin\u2019s efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in the state, claiming they posed a security risk. The archbishop prevailed.</p> <p>Cupich is also seen as an advocate for Francis\u2019s agenda and has encouraged other archbishops to be a voice for workers and immigrants. Irish-born Farrell has been a vocal supporter of gun control laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe picks show Francis wants the church in America to be more focused on issues like immigration, the role of women in the church and the need to bypass traditional centres of power in order to find leaders who smell of the sheep, as the pope has put it,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/new-cardinals-signal-shift-away-us-culture-wars\">wrote</a> Michael O\u2019Loughlin, a journalist for America Magazine, a Catholic publication.</p> <p>Only 13 of the 17 cardinals Francis has elected will be eligible to vote in the next conclave because of age restrictions. Three of the new \u201celectors\u201d come from Europe.<br></p> <p>The choices were noteworthy in part because of who Francis passed over for promotion, including the staunchly conservative archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput, who presides over one of the largest Catholic archdiocese in the US. Chaput made headlines this summer when he released his own interpretation of a document that had been written by Francis that was meant to encourage priests to show more \u201cdiscernment\u201d in their treatment of Catholics who had divorced and remarried, as well as other practices that fall outside church doctrine. </p> <p>Instead of emphasising the latitude Francis seemed to encourage in Amoris Laetitia (Joy of Love), Chaput set out his own rules, including that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/philadelphia-catholic-church-rules-divorce-gay-sex\">remarried Catholics who wanted to receive communion needed to abstain from sex and live as brother and sister</a>, and that lesbian and gay Catholics could still opt for heterosexual marriage with children notwithstanding \u201csome degree of same-sex attraction\u201d.</p> <p>There was only one Italian among the new cardinals: Mario Zenari, the pope\u2019s ambassador to \u201cloved and tormented\u201d Syria. Calling the promotion a \u201csurprise\u201d, Zenari told Vatican radio that the honour was a gift to the victims of Syria and all those who suffer in the conflict. </p>",

  "<p>The retail industry has issued a stark warning that prices of consumer staples such as food and clothes will shoot up if the UK government fails to negotiate a good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-talks-may-be-most-complicated-negotiation-ever-says-minister\">trading deal with the EU</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\">Business leaders urge Theresa May to avoid hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Retailers are already facing rising costs that may have to be passed on to consumers because of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which has raised the price of imports. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) says prices will be increased further if the UK fails to negotiate access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Europe\u2019s single market</a> and has to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. </p> <p>The BRC says under such rules, the new tariff on imports from the EU would be highest for food and clothing.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, the average duty on meat imports could be as high as 27%, while clothing and footwear would attract tariffs of 11-16% versus the current zero-rating for all EU imports,\u201d the trade group said as it launched its \u201cA Fair Brexit for Consumers\u201d campaign on Monday.</p> <p>Falling back on to WTO rules would also increase the cost of sourcing from beyond the EU, according to the BRC. The import cost of women\u2019s clothing from Bangladesh would be 12% higher, while Chilean wine would be 14% dearer for importers.</p> <p>The group has written to secretary of state for international trade, Liam Fox, calling for the government strike a deal with other EU countries that does not squeeze household budgets and to focus on lowering import costs and avoiding any increase in tariffs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Hard Brexit risks destroying UK's open economy, says CBI chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe will be supporting the government through this complex and difficult process, helping them analyse how increased cost pressures on retailers could mean higher shop prices and identifying any opportunities for new trade deals that could benefit individuals and families,\u201d said BRC chairman Richard Baker.</p> <p>\u201cThe retail industry is the UK\u2019s biggest importer, and has huge experience of importing from every corner of the world.

But according to the nonprofit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The nonprofit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency saw an average of 135 police deaths, a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, which saw an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date to 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty. Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 in accidental deaths died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet. The last four years of Bush\u2019s presidency and the first four of Obama\u2019s saw <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_29_leos_fk_type_of_weapon_2005-2014.xls\">about the same number of gun-related police deaths</a>, according to this data, with about 46 a year.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI did not say that \u2026 it\u2019s locker room talk.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump did say that he would \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d, and was recorded saying so in 2005 in a video published by the Washington Post on Friday. </p> <p>Pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper, he did admit to having made the comment, though he then said he had never actually acted in the way.

A fourth woman appeared with Trump whose rapist (ultimately convicted of a lesser charge) was defended by Hillary Clinton when she was a 27-year-old lawyer.</p> <p>The four women are guests of Trump\u2019s in the debate hall tonight at Washington University in St Louis. The format is a town hall, with forty uncommitted voters selected by Gallup asking some of the questions. The moderators are ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. The debate is to last 90 minutes with no commercial interruptions.</p> <p>The first question, the moderators have said, was to be about Trump\u2019s remarks caught by a hot mic that being a star meant he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women for example \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Clinton campaign called Trump\u2019s appearance with the Bill Clinton accusers a \u201cstunt\u201d in a statement that concluded, \u201cas always, she\u2019s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own disparaging comments about one of the women he appeared with, Paula Jones, and other women linked to Bill Clinton have resurfaced this evening, as have reports about hostile working environments for women in Trump companies and on his reality show.</p> <p>Here\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s appearance with Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump&#39;s Pre <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Debate?src=hash\">#Debate</a> Press Conference with Rape and Sexual Assault Victims of Bill Clinton. <a href=\"https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD\">https://t.co/JPrYX88uoD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/eFW5xuWAeU\">pic.twitter.com/eFW5xuWAeU</a></p>&mdash; REGATED (@regated) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/regated/status/785264884267290625\">October 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Thanks again for reading and please join us in the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:52:00.859Z\">at 1.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fae36ae4b03258bcac6119\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:41:47.447Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bill Clinton accusers are Trump's guests in debate hall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump campaign has confirmed all four women, Paula Jones, Broaddrick, Wiley and Kathy Shelton will be guests of Trump in the hall tonight</p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/785277458065006593\">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fae284e4b03258bcac6114\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T00:39:49.240Z\">1.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The \u201cBill Clinton raped\u201d strategy </strong>and its exponents have been competing for oxygen in the Trump campaign for months.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her.

The stories about whispers and crackling of Aurora Borealis have been told for centuries, but since there was no hard scientific evidence of the phenomenon, many people have taken the observations as old wives\u2019 tales. In the last few years Finnish scientists have <a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/current_archive/news/2012-07-09/\">finally managed to confirm</a> that the Northern Lights do cause human-like whispers, cat-like hissing and clapping sounds in lower parts of the atmosphere, which are detectable by human hearing. </p> <h2>Best building</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3faa48ce8e8f0e6fb948d9e1a98362adb998cd83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3faa48ce8e8f0e6fb948d9e1a98362adb998cd83/0_0_3509_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lappia House in its surroundings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fjell-shaped Lappia House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Ka\u0308hko\u0308nen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The work of <a href=\"http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/get-inspired/architecture\">Alvar Aalto</a> (1892-1976), a Finnish functionalist architect responsible for the post-war <a href=\"http://lapinkavijat.rovaniemi.fi/aalto/jkaava_en.html\">town plan</a>, exemplifies Rovaniemi\u2019s relationship with its hills and nature. The facade of fjell-shaped Lappia House, finished in 1975, might be as cold and grey as slushy snow, but Aalto\u2019s simple choice of making the ridge of the roof mimic the fjells, saves the building from being dreary.<br></p> <p>Lappia House is home to the Theatre of Rovaniemi, a music school and broadcasting company. Together with Aalto-designed city library (pictured on the left above) and the town hall, it is the cultural and governmental centre.

The S\u00e1mi people speak multiple endangered languages and many families still practise semi-nomadic livelihoods \u2013 most prominently reindeer herding \u2013 along with a wide variety of urban professions.</p> <p>Some Finnish travel agencies are using the S\u00e1mi culture and lifestyle to promote \u201ctrue and genuine Lapland\u201d, regardless of their limited knowledge of the subject. The colonial misuse of S\u00e1mi symbols is a heated topic here in the north. The people of S\u00e1mi heritage are sick of seeing the shamanic drums used out of context and their traditional clothing worn as more of an exotic costume than a respectful outfit.</p> <p></p> <h2>Look on the street</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"090aada0861b41f01f9529dc3eef6369ce22e88f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/090aada0861b41f01f9529dc3eef6369ce22e88f/0_0_2048_1511/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roosa Nevala dressed for the autumn weather.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roosa Nevala dressed for the autumn weather.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arttu Nieminen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Homegrown talent</h2> <p>Mr Lordi (real name Tomi Putaansuu) is a Rovaniemi-born musician, and the mastermind behind the hard rock band <a href=\"http://www.lordi.fi/band/\">Lordi</a>. The band is known for its elaborate monster masks that hide their identities, and the pyro-spitting horror props of their gigs. The group made history in 2006 by becoming the first hard rock band to win the Eurovision Song Contest with their song Hard Rock Hallelujah.</p> <p>He was featured in the 2014 documentary <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/monstermandocumentary\">Monsterman</a>, by Antti Haase, as \u201cthe monsterboy who never grew up\u201d living in the fantasy world he had created.</p> <h2>Smell of the city</h2> <p>A large part of Rovaniemi is covered in forests, so the pleasant and piny scent of coniferous trees really embodies this town of lumberjacks. The pine trees are ubiquitous and their aroma is subtle yet distinctive. One catches the entire range of it by taking a walk in a summery evergreen forest, heating a sauna with firewood and then maybe enjoying a reindeer dish seasoned with pine or juniper in one of the fine dining restaurants that experiment with tastes of the Arctic.</p> <h2>Underrated location</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56761bbc16b6cc6e3a2c86f68e5f232b0ff7e371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56761bbc16b6cc6e3a2c86f68e5f232b0ff7e371/0_0_1024_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rovaniemi\u2019s annual bonfire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rovaniemi\u2019s annual bonfire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olli Junes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Located on the Arctic Circle, my home town has built its reputation around extremes: the white nights of summer and the polar nights of the Christmas season. Rovaniemi lies on the shores of the river Kemijoki, which is a popular destination for summer and winter swimmers alike, as well as a much loved ice-covered venue for winter sports and leisure. The riverside and its events in autumn, however, don\u2019t get much attention.<br></p> <p>Throughout autumn \u2013 starting with the <a href=\"http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/experience-rovaniemi/events/old-market-square-carnival-of-rovaniemi-old-market-square\">Rovaniemi Old Time Fair</a> (<em>Rovaniemen Wanhat Markkina</em><em>t</em>) on J\u00e4tk\u00e4npuisto strand in August \u2013 cultural events and harvest markets take place on the riverside.  In the beginning of November the Arctic fall is crowned by an annual bonfire art event, Riverlights (<em>Jokivalkeat</em>).</p> <p>If there are no special seasonal events on, I recommend opting for a calming river walk to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavvu\">laavu</a>, an open hut, and enjoy hot cocoa and snacks. The laavus are open and free for all the visitors and are found around riverbanks and forests.</p> <h2>Moment in history</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b20cd5bcf815f2fa7fb5ab795cf9b1a7851decfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b20cd5bcf815f2fa7fb5ab795cf9b1a7851decfc/126_126_4733_4644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Destruction in the centre of Rovaniemi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"981\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Destruction in the centre of Rovaniemi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vilho Uomala/SA-kuva</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most influential single event in the history of Rovaniemi is the <a href=\"http://barentsobserver.com/en/content/70-years-after-war-finland-looks-back\">near-total destruction</a> of the town in the second world war. The Moscow Armistice (September 1944) between the Soviet Union and Finland ended the four-year alliance between Nazi Germany and Finland, once united by their mutual enemy in war. As a result, German troops withdrew from Finnish Lapland and its capital Rovaniemi using a scorched earth policy. There\u2019s still debate on what happened next, but 90% of the buildings were destroyed, including homes and farms. Even the town\u2019s ski jump ramp was reduced to rubble and ashes.<br></p> <p>The blaze demolished everything familiar to the locals and today\u2019s rebuilt Rovaniemi is naturally something very different. Understandably some locals tend to criticise the modern blocks of flats of the centre, yearning for something \u201cold and authentic\u201d. On the other hand, Rovaniemi wouldn\u2019t be the same, original town of its own kind if it had not been forced to reinvent itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people choose to cycle to work, school and nightclubs all year around, whether it is 30C above or below zero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Best Instagram account</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/wmRIs2iYbW/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Antti Kertsi Ker\u00e4nen (@cvltfvck)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2014-12-14T18:54:49+00:00&quot;&gt;Dec 14, 2014 at 10:54am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Antti Ker\u00e4nen is a 22-year-old nature photographer whose eerie and gloomy Instagram feed tells otherworldly stories from the midst of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga\">taiga</a>.

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet.

The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

  "<p>As Romesh Ranganathan shows me into his mother\u2019s home, I make small talk by asking him if he lives nearby. \u201cJust 10 minutes,\u201d he replies.

Shanthi stole every scene she was in, so it\u2019s no surprise to hear that, for the second series, the pair will cross the United States together in search of more relatives, and more laughs.</p> <p>Today, the post-office worker, with her hennaed hair and warm smile, is as funny and outspoken as she is on screen. Romesh, meanwhile, is more relaxed than the sardonic, grumpy front he presents on panel shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/11/what-we-learned-from-the-weekend-tv-hignfy-works-best-when-theres-news\">such as Have I Got News for You</a> and Jack Dee\u2019s HelpDesk.

His third standup tour, Irrational, has been extended to 133 dates (many sold out) across the UK.</p> <p>Both Asian Provacateur and his standup mine a rich seam of second-generation angst.

Growing up, the family would make a visit to his parents\u2019 friends every few weeks. This involved Romesh and his brother, Dinesh, sitting with the other kids (\u201cwho all spoke Tamil \u2013 so we would get that in the neck\u201d), while in another room: \u201cDad would get drunk.

There are also lavish complaints about his mother\u2019s sudden popularity, and jokes about his children (he calls his middle child \u201cferal\u201d and a \u201clittle arsehole\u201d). Doesn\u2019t Shanthi mind when he makes fun of her \u2013 or, worse, her beloved grandchildren?</p> <p>For once, she is placid. \u201cIf his children have a sense of humour, they will take it as a joke,\u201d she says. Then, with impeccable timing, she adds: \u201cI mean \u2013 instead of attacking somebody [else], why not use the family?\u201d</p> <p>Romesh grins. \u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected angle,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As a child, it was his father \u2013 a \u201cparty guy\u201d \u2013 that Romesh felt closer to. The pair would bond over comedy shows. \u201cOne day, I brought home Eddie Murphy\u2019s Raw, and Dad and I would watch that together.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just a sense of humour they shared. \u201cHe was incapable of keeping in touch with anybody, and could be accidentally inconsiderate. I think I have that lack of organisation. I don\u2019t call people for weeks. Mum and Dinesh want to see you a lot, but they will do anything for you. I expect very little and deliver very little.\u201d</p> <p>An accountant who moved to the UK to study, Ranga was an indulgent father, says Shanthi, someone who would give his two sons anything they asked for. \u201cThey just had to click their fingers and it would be here.\u201d</p> <p>Both were sent to private school (where Romesh was mocked for living in Crawley rather than the posher Reigate). But Ranga, says Romesh, was also a \u201cbit of a Del boy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven though he was in a well-paid job, he would think: \u2018If I just do this, we could be millionaires.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But there were disastrous consequences. When Romesh was 12, his father walked out of his accountancy job after a disagreement, and then struggled to find another position. The bills mounted up and he couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage. The family home was repossessed, Dinesh and Romesh had to leave their school, and the couple\u2019s marriage cracked under the pressure. Shanthi and her sons moved into a council-funded bed and breakfast, and she separated from her husband. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone,\u201d says Shanthi. \u201cI would cry to Romesh all the time, but how could he help me? I used to pray so hard \u2013 please get us out of this.

To protect my husband, I stayed at home, kept myself away. It was a mistake. I should have gone out and faced people.\u201d</p> <p>While he and his father \u201cdrifted apart\u201d, it was Shanthi, says Romesh, who held things together. \u201cShe dragged us through those years pretty much singlehandedly,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was fiercely independent.\u201d Having never worked before, she took jobs wherever she could \u2013 first, a cleaning job, and later, working in a shop. \u201cMy boys were everything to me,\u201d she explains. \u201cI thought: \u2018I will come out of this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Being given a council house proved a turning point, Shanthi says. \u201cThat house is like a temple for me. I started working, I got on better with Ranga.\u201d</p> <p>She continues: \u201cI don\u2019t know what power God had given me. Twice, I had lost my handbag and people brought it to my home.

Everybody loved it.\u201d His act began as a hobby, he insists. By day, he was head of sixth form at Hazelwick school in Crawley, and in the evenings, he would go to open-mic nights \u2013 often with his wife, Leesa, a drama teacher, and their first baby in tow.</p> <p>By 2010, he had made it to the final of the new-act competition So You Think You\u2019re Funny, where a judge suggested he try to make a living from it. Wasn\u2019t it a risky idea, with a young family? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d he pauses. \u201cBut yes, arguably, it was an irresponsible time.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, Leesa supported his ambitions \u2013 while his parents had no doubts. \u201cAs soon as I did a gig, they thought I would be on everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember Dad saying after just three gigs: \u2018When are we going on Live at the Apollo?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c1fc2095ded813ca016a0dfc687f946f533200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c1fc2095ded813ca016a0dfc687f946f533200/91_0_4370_2623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romesh with Pratheep Sevanthinathan in series two of Asian Provocateur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romesh with Pratheep Sevanthinathan in series two of Asian Provocateur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Green/BBC/Rumpus Media/Benjamin Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year later, he had given his notice in, but three days before he was due to leave the school, his father died of a heart attack in his living room chair. The family were devastated; five years later, Shanti is still coming to terms with her loss. But she is trying hard to make peace with her new circumstances. \u201cI always think there is a reason behind it \u2013 why it has happened. I have to accept it, and enjoy the time we have been given to be together \u2013 with the boys.\u201d</p> <p>For Romesh, the loss of his father was compounded by his own money troubles. He and his brother struggled to settle his father\u2019s affairs at what should have been the start of his full-time comedy career. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get enough gigs in, we were trying to get [the probate] sorted. I didn\u2019t have the teaching money. If it had gone another six months, I would have had to go back to teaching,\u201d he says. He was on the point of quitting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/02/romesh-ranganathan-seann-walsh\">when Live at the Apollo star Seann Walsh stepped in</a> \u2013 recommending him for jobs and sending work his way until he started making ends meet. \u201cI owe him a lot,\u201d Romesh says.</p> <p>Holding his nerve paid off. A year later, Romesh was winning awards and doing stints on Mock the Week and Radio 4. Appearing on Live at the Apollo was bittersweet, because he wasn\u2019t able to share it with his father. He also can\u2019t help but wonder what it would have been like to have both parents on Asian Provocateur. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/17/romesh-ranganathan-grumpy-funny-edinburgh-festival-2014-review\">Is his prolific work rate \u2013 from his year-long tour</a> to onscreen ubiquity \u2013 fuelled by this bumpy start?</p> <p>\u201cI am not playing at it,\u201d he agrees. He says he has a duty to \u201cwork my arse off\u201d to repay Leesa\u2019s unstinting support. But he is also wary of being described as successful. \u201cI never really think it is going well. I feel very lucky but ... next year I could be teaching again. I always think these things are temporary. Teaching is so solid and reliable, comedy is not.\u201d</p> <p>His mother, however, has no such insecurities about her new-found fame. \u201cSome people put their hood up and act coy,\u201d Romesh says. \u201cMum will deliberately pay by card, so they can see her surname \u2013 even if it\u2019s for a sandwich \u2013 so she can say: \u2018Yes, it\u2019s me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One day, he says, \u201cwe were walking through Soho and someone in a van shouted to Mum: \u2018You need your own show, you are brilliant.\u2019\u201d He starts mimicking her reply: \u201cThank you dah-ling!\u201d</p> <p>Shanthi chips in. \u201cYou were pissed off.

She continued to work Saturdays without telling me.\u201d</p> <p>Shanthi laughs: \u201cBecause darling, I have expensive taste. Sorry, darling, I shouldn\u2019t have ... but I do.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time to go, and Shanthi kindly gives us both a lift to the station. I get out, but when I turn around, I notice Romesh struggling to open his door.

I\u2019m thinking <strong>plebiscite</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>banking behaviour</strong>. I\u2019m thinking <strong>tax threshold legislation</strong>.<br></p> <p>First up, <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong> has told the ABC that she will support the respect for emergency services volunteers bill. This is the so-called CFA bill, which became an issue in the federal election because of a stoush between the Victorian professional firefighters and the volunteers over an enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA). The bill gives emergency service volunteers more power in any EBAs. The government needs nine votes and with four One Nation senators coming across the line, with three <strong>Nick Xenophons, Derryn Hinch </strong>and<strong> Bob Day, </strong>the Coalition appears to be in the clear. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/09/labor-poised-to-kill-off-marriage-equality-plebiscite-when-parliament-resumes\">Katharine Murphy reported late yesterday</a>, after um-ing and ah-ing and foot shuffling while still pointing out their vehement opposition, Labor is finally going to decide what to do about the Coalition\u2019s plebiscite bill. This is the legislation which would create a plebiscite on marriage equality. The plebiscite would give an indication of the electorate\u2019s feelings, though its outcome would not bind the parliament or the Coalition to the outcome. At the last sitting, Labor announced it would undergo consultations and those meetings have included both the LGBTI community and church groups who oppose marriage equality. They will take the issue to Tuesday\u2019s party room meeting.</p> <p>While I was sitting in a quiet corner reading a book last week, the bank bosses appeared at the much-vaunted house economics committee hearings set up by the Turnbull government. There was a fair bit of squirming involved but it did not soften the resolve in Labor, the Greens and Independent <strong>Bob Katter</strong> among others for a royal commission. The Greens have already flagged they will be moving for a commission of inquiry this week. I reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/parliament-could-force-banking-inquiry-despite-hostile-coalition-says-senate-clerk\">this advice</a> from the clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing to Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson in August. Her letter then suggested the parliament could force an inquiry like the one into Lionel Murphy in the 80s. (That one was abandoned due to Murphy\u2019s illness.) The problem for those in favour of a banking royal commission is that it can only be established by executive government, that is the Turnbull government. But a commission of inquiry could be \u2013 according to Laing \u2013 forced by the parliament if their numbers in both houses were there. We shall await developments there.</p> <p>Also on the agenda are income tax cuts. Today, first thing we shall see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/bracket-creep-changes-in-budget-to-save-500000-from-second-top-marginal-tax-rate\">Scott Morrison\u2019s bracket creep bill</a> in the house again, which:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5683\">increase the third personal income tax threshold</a> so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80,001 to $87,000 for individuals is 32.5%. The Greens are not having a bar of it but Labor supports it so it is done deal. </p> </blockquote> <p>Also around this morning, <strong>Gina Rinehart</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/australias-richest-woman-gina-rinehart-buys-two-cattle-stations-20160721-gqb0mh.html\">who has lately gone long in cattle</a>, has thrown her weight behind a $365m bid for the Kidman cattle company, confirmed last night. The Stock and Land has a <a href=\"http://www.stockandland.com.au/story/4216028/rinehart-bids-for-slice-of-kidman/?cs=4582\">version of this story here</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, Shanghai CRED Real Estate Stock Co Ltd and S. Kidman &amp; Co Ltd (Kidman) have announced today that they have entered into a Bid Implementation Agreement (BIA) under which a joint venture company Australian Outback Beef Pty Ltd (AOB) owned 67 per cent by Hancock and 33pc by Shanghai CRED has committed to make a takeover offer to acquire the Kidman and Co. </p> <p>In a statement to the media issued by a public relations company acting on behalf of Kidman and Co and Hancock Prospecting, it was revealed the offer was conditional on approval from Australia\u2019s foreign investment regime and Chinese government approvals.</p> <p>It is also conditional on the completion of the divestment of the Anna Creek station and the Peake by Kidman to other Australian grazing interests.</p> </blockquote> <p>So you can see where this parliamentary week is going along at a clip already. And if you think this week is full, next week we have the house sitting and budget estimates \u2026</p> <p>Of course, it will be hard for even the most eventful Australian parliamentary day to compete with the second Clinton-Trump debate after the weekend\u2019s revelations of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/john-mccain-donald-trump-sex-boast-tape\">sordid little conversation</a> otherwise dismissed as \u201clocker-room banter\u201d. Get me a bucket. We will have live coverage of this elsewhere on the big G. Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tqxzWdKKu8\">duelling banjos</a>, the Australian and American political blogs will create (if not beautiful then) music of sorts. </p> <p>Join us in the thread or on the Twits @gabriellechan or @mpbowers.

  "<p>To quote those legendary Englishmen the Beatles, <a href=\"http://genius.com/The-beatles-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band-lyrics\" title=\"\">it was 20 years ago today</a> (or thereabouts).

Tony Blair and the prime movers of New Labour were already on that political wavelength.

By the following year, a new Labour government was working on nothing less than \u201cthe rebranding of Britain\u201d.

In contrast to that bright 1990s vision of a future UK, it is, moreover, an old country, whose dotage is portrayed as a matter of crabby resentment, a place where there is a collective wish to lock all the doors.</p> <p>This newly rebranded place underpinned one of the key plot lines that ran through this year\u2019s conference season. In Liverpool, for all Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claims to be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/28/jeremy-corbyn-immigration-labour-conference-speech-live/\" title=\"\">\u201crelaxed\u201d about immigration</a>, some of his own MPs were voicing a sudden hostility to the principle of free movement, which peaked when the Leeds MP Rachel Reeves said immigration had turned her Leeds constituency into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/labour-can-win-immigration-enoch-powell-rachel-reeves\" title=\"\">\u201ctinderbox\u201d</a>. A week later came all that Tory nastiness in Birmingham, with a serving home secretary floating serious plans to make companies declare the number of non-British workers on their books, a monstrous illiberal idea that Tories were , amid much furore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/09/plan-to-force-firms-to-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers-abandoned\" title=\"\">forced to abandon</a>. But there was also Jeremy Hunt, with the support of the prime minister, boasting of his plan, which apparently endures, to minimise the numbers of foreign doctors. This was an English proposal in every way: aimed at an English audience by a minister who, thanks to devolution, sees only to the English NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa8a147b963c4836f7fdb04b8a9cb47da3ab40f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa8a147b963c4836f7fdb04b8a9cb47da3ab40f/58_94_4759_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steel Pulse at a 1978 concert organised by the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steel Pulse perform at a 1978 concert organised by the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism in east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Corio/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was telling perhaps, that as the Labour party fumbled, the most pointed response came from a trio of voices that included the leaders of the UK\u2019s two progressive nationalist parties: Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Leanne Wood, who joined the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas in rightly decrying \u201cthe most toxic rhetoric on immigration we have seen from any government in living memory\u201d.</p> <p>We are in a bad place, but we didn\u2019t get there overnight. Over the past 10 years or so, a small set of English people and organisations have led the toxic recasting of their country. Nigel Farage and his de facto English nationalist party didn\u2019t just push the EU to the top of the political agenda, they also created the impression that they spoke for a forgotten nation. And then there were the English grassroots Conservatives, most of whom raged against David Cameron\u2019s modernisation drive, such as it was. A big role has also been played by the great minds at those self-consciously English media outlets, the Mail and the Express. Witness the Mail\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/who-will-speak-for-england-asks-the-daily-mail-and-twitter-answers\" title=\"\">\u201cWho will speak for England?\u201d</a> front page, used this year to open its campaigning against the EU.</p> <p>What distinguishes the point we have reached today is that this poisonous illiberalism, this recasting of the way we view ourselves and the face we show to the world, has been given an official stamp of approval by a group of shameless Tory politicians at the top. Seemingly they are terrified of the people who voted for Brexit, but also they scent a great political opportunity. Shame on them, and their cynicism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The liberal left also shares responsibility for leaving the question of what England is to more destructive voices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People on the liberal left also have to bear some responsibility, for averting their eyes from the essentially cultural elements of politics, and leaving the question of what England is to altogether more destructive voices. England, after all, is not just the Brexit heartlands. Its other aspects are there in Leeds, Bradford and Manchester; in mischievous, multicultural Bristol; and Leicester, a magnificent English city that represents hope for the future, and people\u2019s ability to get on. London speaks for itself. And there is another England beginning to stir in the supposedly staid suburbs (like the one I grew up in, 12 miles south of Manchester), areas fast filling up with a diverse array of people who have moved beyond the city limits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22de52fcf967dce1893f0b3afb7236f24c583b19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22de52fcf967dce1893f0b3afb7236f24c583b19/0_99_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Bragg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To paraphrase that great Englishman Billy Bragg, we ought to be looking for a New England.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in the places for which May and the Tories now affect to speak, things are more complicated than they seem to think. I have met plenty of English Brexit supporters who have expressed worries about immigration while paying warm tribute to Poles, Czechs and people from the Baltic states as admirable \u201cgrafters\u201d, and assets to the places where they have settled. Their kids mix with new arrivals at the local schools, where the children of migrants acquire local accents. Where some people do indeed shout and seethe about immigration, one can nonetheless divine the country that led George Orwell, among others, to celebrate its essential moderation and gentleness (\u201cYou notice it the instant you set foot on English soil. It is a land where the bus conductors are good-tempered and the policemen carry no revolvers\u201d).</p> <p>These things need to be loudly celebrated, and talked about in specifically English terms. But when politicians will not recognise England\u2019s existence, let alone the fight for its soul, how will that happen? Those of us who live in England and feel a profound attachment to it ought to wake up to a simple truth: that our country is being stolen away, and repainted in truly ugly colours. What is afoot is as much cultural as political, and it will take much more than conventional politics to turn things round. This is a moment: one that demands the attention of musicians, writers, dramatists, journalists \u2013 and the millions of people in England who surely feel a deep dismay about what is happening.</p> <p>And if we want the beginnings of an idea about what to do, we could look back not to the giddy, superficial 1990s, but to a much more troubled period: the late 1970s, when a surge of largely English racism and bigotry was killed off by trailblazing creations such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/06/rock-against-racism-book-syd-shelton-clash\" title=\"\">Rock Against Racism</a> and the Anti-Nazi League, and a great counter-movement \u2013 a movement of people that went right to society\u2019s roots. I do not know what form a 21st-century version of that fight will look like, but I do know we need one. To paraphrase that great Englishman Billy Bragg, we ought to be looking for a New England. That feels now like a matter of urgency.</p>",

  "<h2>Ride a Snooc, Le Grand Bornand, France</h2> <p>Hiking off into the wilderness and finding peace away from the pistes is one of the most rewarding things to do in the mountains. But learning how to ski in backcountry takes years, and can involve a lot of swearing and slapstick mishap. Now, thanks to a new invention called the Snooc, even those who can\u2019t ski or snowboard can go snow-touring off the beaten track. It functions as a pair of easy-to-use skis for walking uphill, then when it\u2019s time to head down, it quickly transforms into a toboggan for riding safely and enjoyably back to the resort, perhaps even with a few powder turns along the way. Le Grand Bornand is one of the first resorts to offer Snooc rental. <br>\u2022<a href=\"http://snooc.ski/try-the-snooc/\"> <em>snooc.ski</em></a><em>, two-hour lesson \u00a326<br></em><strong>Book it: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.peakretreats.co.uk/winter/ski-resorts/aravis-lake-annecy/le-grand-bornand/le-village-de-lessy\"><strong>Peak Retreats</strong></a><strong> has a week in a four-star self-catering apartment, based on five sharing, including Eurotunnel crossing, for \u00a3214pp</strong></p> <h2>Baseboarding, Whistler, Canada </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19eb4b8bed3a0f6ded67d5adce53b0e6907e4cf9/0_662_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baseboarding, Whistler Olympic Park, Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Given that snowboarding, which is essentially surfing on snow, was invented over 40 years ago, it\u2019s surprising that it\u2019s taken so long for someone to introduce front-lying bodyboarding to the slopes.

Foetid and pestilential, this wasteland has long been a haven for the waifs of Kenya\u2019s fifth city, the country\u2019s highland capital and long-distance running heartland.</p> <p>\u201cCalifornia Barracks\u201d, as it is known to the 700 homeless children and young adults who sleep there, usually provides something to eat: unwanted food dumped by local hotels or overripe fruit discarded by traders from the nearby market. It also offers a refuge, from society and from Eldoret\u2019s police, who can rarely stomach the stench.</p> <p>But not on that day, the penultimate Sunday of May. It was getting on for 4pm, the shadows lengthening on a chilly afternoon. Some of the children were asleep. Others sought solace in the cheap, hunger-suppressing fix of solvent abuse: boys inhaled glue from plastic containers clutched to their nostrils, girls in their early teens shared theirs with infants strapped to their backs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/kenya-dadaab-refugee-camp-what-happens-when-it-closes-asad-hussein\">I grew up in the world's biggest refugee camp \u2013 what happens when it closes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the warren of alleys above, the police advanced silently from three directions. Municipal officers, known as county askaris, carried cudgels and led the way; men from the Administrative Police, a feared state paramilitary unit, followed with rifles and teargas.</p> <p>The inhabitants of California Barracks have grown accustomed to police brutality. Many there that Sunday had experienced it, like Samuel Asacha. A decade ago, when he was 15, he had one of his eyes gouged out by a particularly notorious officer. Or Shereen, then 10, and Shelagh, 14, both badly disfigured in 2014 when the same man, they say, threw acid in their face.</p> <p>But the raid on California Barracks seemed different. This was not casual, workaday bullying but a carefully planned operation, systematic, meticulous \u2013 and one which city authorities have until now largely managed to cover up.</p> <p>\u201cThey gave no warning,\u201d said Eric Omondi, who at 20 is, like Samuel, one of the older members or \u201cprefects\u201d of California Barracks. \u201cIt was an ambush. Suddenly there were kids screaming, teargas being fired and officers shooting into the air.\u201d<br></p> <p>Advancing in a line, beating as they went, the police forced their victims towards the Sosiani river, which hugs the southern perimeter of the dump. Babies, girls, boys, disabled and able alike, were trampled down in merciless fashion.</p> <p>None caught were spared, not even a 17-year-old called Mary, whom Omondi saw being beaten with such force that her baby fell headfirst from her arms onto the stony ground.</p> <p>In a wheelchair after being run over by a county bulldozer clearing homeless shelters last year, Ronny, 16, had no chance of escape.</p> <p>As blows rained down on his head and shoulders, he begged his tormenters to stop: \u201cI told them \u2018If you don\u2019t stop, you are going to kill me.\u2019 They replied: \u2018We don\u2019t care if we kill you. If killing you is what will scare others away, we will do it.\u201d</p> <p>By now some had managed to slip through the police lines, but others had been pushed to the riverbank. To escape the blows, they had no choice but to plunge into the Sosiani, then in full spate after heavy rains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/706ec1c506636e8ef19c49074bba3137a40111a6/0_619_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sosiani river.

The following October, the county authorities forcibly rounded up more than 100 street children, forced them into a lorry and dumped them 80 miles away in Malaba, a town on the Ugandan border. Most walked back to Eldoret.</p> <p>The killings began after that, activists say. Ex-Street has documented the deaths of 14 minors so far this year, including three boys shot dead as they ran from police and three more whose bodies were found days after they had been arrested. At least five more are missing after being taken into custody and another two \u2013 9-year-old Kevin Simuyu and David Kamau, eight, have not been seen since they were shot and wounded by police a fortnight after the raid on California Barracks.<br></p> <p>Some believe that the attacks on street children are ethnically motivated. Most are not members of the county\u2019s dominant Kalenjin community, the ethnic group of Kenya\u2019s powerful deputy president, William Ruto.</p> <p>The region around Eldoret has witnessed some of Kenya\u2019s worst ethnic violence, often because of politically-manipulated tensions over land ownership. In 1991, Kalenjin warriors impaled foetuses ripped from dying Kikuyu women on spears which were then placed on the side of the road leading into Eldoret, as anger over Kikuyu encroachment into the ancestral lands exploded.</p> <p>The violence reached a peak after a controversial election in 2007 saw Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, re-elected president. At least 1,200 people were killed in the ensuing violence across Kenya, but the clashes were at their deadliest in and around Eldoret, where scores of Kikuyu women and children sheltering in a church were burned to death by Kalenjin fighters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ea4ae841c1e0ad546f04b84d3bb633a6e5e60f/0_202_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Eldoret, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Eldoret, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the Kalenjin and Kikuyu are now reconciled and share power (President Uhuru Kenyatta is a Kikuyu), some local politicians and clergymen say the attacks on street children appear to be part of a campaign of intimidation designed to force non-Kalenjins to leave Eldoret.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the killing of street families, this will escalate,\u201d said Peter Chomba, a ruling party county legislator, who is Kikuyu. \u201cIf you look at what is happening, it is a pre-planned campaign. They profile professions drawn from certain communities and then attack them. What is happening is an attempt to claim this place for one community.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the motive, few Kenyans would be particularly shocked to hear that the police were killing minors in Eldoret. Human rights groups have raised repeated concerns that extrajudicial killings have become part of police culture in Kenya. Reports of the execution of suspected Islamists, petty criminals and even human rights activists are becoming increasingly common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/kenya-seaside-look-peaceful-murderous-war-al-shabaab\">Kenya\u2019s seaside looks peaceful, but a murderous war is being waged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week Kenya\u2019s Daily Nation newspaper published a database documenting 122 police killings in the country so far this year.

They want to work within the trust but through the normal processes they\u2019ve not been successful.\u201d Nationwide, there is a high vacancy rate in nursing; Leeds is no exception and this scheme also helps the trust meets its staffing requirements. Chapman adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d</p> <p> Chapman insists that entry requirements for roles have not been compromised.

We want to focus on the question of what is going to happen in the future and seek to protect our rights,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cOur aim is to get to the point where we can get the government to pass a law to protect our rights.\u201d</p> <p>Like many EU citizens who have settled in the UK, Hatton has watched recent political developments with a growing sense of alarm and feels xenophobia will take root unless it is challenged. </p> <p>Immigration lawyers are advising many EU citizens who wish to stay in Britain beyond Brexit to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/home-office-prepares-for-rise-in-residency-applications-from-eu-migrants\">apply for permanent residence</a> in order to acquire a degree of protection in the event Theresa May proves unable to negotiate a continuation of reciprocal rights as part of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>There is no legal requirement to do so because all EU citizens currently have reciprocal rights to live, work, retire, draw a pension and access public services across the entire bloc, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\">leading barristers have said there is \u201czero chance\u201d this will remain the case after Brexit</a>. They point out that the only rights protected under international law are those to own property and run a business.</p> <p>Those who have decided to apply for permanent residence say the process is a bureaucratic nightmare. They have to complete an 80-page application form and back it up with dozens of documents including original payslips, bank statements, P60s, tax papers and proof of identity. Applicants must also list all travel during their stay in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cI have had to list all trips outside the UK for the past six years. If I have been out of the country for more than six months in any one of those trips, they reset the clock,\u201d said David Lusseau, a professor of behavioural biology at the University of Aberdeen, who supports the campaign. </p> <p>\u201cI feel like a second-class citizen having to do this and my instinct is to tell them where to go, but I have to do this to protect my family,\u201d said Bruno Pollet, a French national living in Britain for 25 years. </p> <p>Hatton says the 80-page application form is not fit for purpose and the initial focus of the campaign will be to persuade the Home Office to simplify a process that was not designed for EU citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want is something that will give a blanket right to all EU citizens. We don\u2019t think this will happen before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">the great repeal act</a>, but we don\u2019t want to wait until Brexit day.

It\u2019s an everyday tale of torture, drugs and death in Mexico, with Armando Espitia as the likable young man scratching a living with his wife, their baby, his father and sister, when a stash of cocaine dumps them into a terrifyingly violent underworld of gangsters and corrupt cops. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: Shanghai Masters</strong></p> <p>The opening day\u2019s play at the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena.</p> <p>6am, Sky Sports 1</p> <p><strong>Test Cricket: India v New Zealand</strong></p> <p>Live coverage of the third day of the third Test at Holkar Stadium in Indore, central India.</p> <p>6am, Sky Sports 5</p> <p><strong>Football World Cup Qualifier: Faroe Islands v Portugal</strong></p> <p>All the action from the Group B fixture (kick-off 7.45pm).</p> <p>7.40pm, Sky Sports 1</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull says Islamist terrorists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/race-discrimination-commissioner-criticises-pauline-hanson-for-stoking-division\">have succeeded in raising levels of anxiety about Muslim immigration</a> and about the role of Islam within Australia, but he says political leaders have to reassure and \u201cexplain the facts\u201d rather than add to disunity.<br></p> <p>The prime minister joined on Monday with the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, in moving a parliamentary motion denouncing \u201cracial intolerance in any form\u201d and reaffirming Australia\u2019s commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s parliamentary debate follows Pauline Hanson\u2019s declaration in her first speech to the Senate in mid-September <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">that Australia was in danger of being swamped by Muslims</a>, and an Essential poll that found 49% of Australians support One Nation\u2019s call for a ban on Muslim immigration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/10/pauline-hanson-backs-malcolm-turnbulls-country-fire-authority-bill-politics-live\">'Our multicultural character began long before Europeans,' says Turnbull \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull in his contribution validated community concerns about Islam, saying they were real, but he said the job of political leadership was to \u201cexplain the facts, reassure citizens and ensure that everything we do is calculated to keep Australians safe\u201d.</p> <p>He said extremists were a \u201ca tiny minority whose madness offends and appals Australian Muslims as much as it does the wider Australian community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMr Speaker, the terrorists want the wider Australian community to turn against Australian Muslims. Their message to Australian Muslims is, \u2018You are not wanted here, you will never be accepted here, you cannot be Australian.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe most effective weapon against the terrorists is an inclusive nation. An inclusive nation is a safer nation. It enables our security agencies to better protect us. It enables them to secure the support and assistance of the Muslim communities without which they cannot keep us safe.\u201d</p> <p>Monday\u2019s parliamentary motion, which was suggested by Shorten in the last parliamentary sitting but deferred until this week on the basis it would be moved jointly, echoes a gesture made 20 years ago by John Howard and Kim Beazley when Hanson first entered the political scene.</p> <p>The motion reaffirms the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin and it denounces \u201cracial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be\u201d.<br></p> <p>It also reaffirms the commitment to maintaining an immigration policy \u201cwholly non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin\u201d.</p> <p>The motion also references parliament\u2019s commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, \u201cin the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage\u201d \u2013 and it says the parliament is committed to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/we-cant-eradicate-racism-but-telling-its-targets-to-grin-and-bear-it-isnt-good-enough\">We can't eradicate racism but telling its targets to grin and bear it isn't good enough | Tim Soutphommasane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his contribution to the debate, Shorten contended with Hansonism more explicitly, declaring Australia was not in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d by anyone.</p> <p>\u201cMigrants are not filling our dole queues, or taking our jobs, or clogging up our highways \u2013 or doing all three at the same time,\u201d the Labor leader said. \u201cMigration is not a cost, or a burden. It is a powerful force for our continuing economic growth and future prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten said political leaders had a responsibility to unite the nation, not divide it. Politicians, he said, needed to \u201cdo more than mouth words of respect \u2013 we must thoroughly and publicly reject racism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place in Australia for extremism, no matter the party, no matter the agenda,\u201d the Labor leader said. \u201cAnd as leaders, we cannot choose to pass by on the other side of the road.</p> <p>\u201cWe are our brother\u2019s, our sister\u2019s keepers. We have to call out prejudice whenever we see it: in this parliament, in the workplace, on the sporting field and in the media.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten said countering extremism depended on building societal cohesion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/23/bill-shorten-turnbull-must-be-clear-he-is-not-on-side-of-people-doing-isiss-work\">and he again pointed to what he characterised as \u201ca bizarre unity ticket between Daesh and the extreme right\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBoth argue that it is not possible to hold western liberal democratic values \u2013 and be Muslim. Both say, somehow, you cannot be a Muslim and a good citizen.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows no understanding of Australia \u2013 or the remarkable contribution our Muslim community makes. People need to realise when they set up this false choice \u2013 or allow it to go unchallenged \u2013 they are doing Daesh\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/23/code-of-race-ethics-proposed-for-parliament-to-counter-rise-of-one-nation\">Code of race ethics proposed for parliament to counter rise of One Nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/23/code-of-race-ethics-proposed-for-parliament-to-counter-rise-of-one-nation\">is also pursuing a code of race ethics</a>, echoing an initiative advanced by the ALP and the Australian Democrats during the period Hanson was last in parliament.
