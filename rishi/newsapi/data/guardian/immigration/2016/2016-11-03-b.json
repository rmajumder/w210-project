Claude Puel describes Inter as \u201ca great team with great players\u201d \u2013 though their 12th place in Serie A isn\u2019t overwhelmingly impressive \u2013 but says that given the Italian side sacked their manager, Frank de Boer, on Tuesday, \u201cit\u2019s difficult for us to prepare for this game because we don\u2019t know what to expect in terms of the profile, the spirit, the system of play\u201d. Funny that, as before the game against Burnley last month Puel said \u201csometimes it can be difficult to prepare\u201d, while ahead of the EFL Cup tie against Sunderland 10 days later he said \u201cit\u2019s a difficult game to prepare, because you don\u2019t know the Sunderland team\u201d. I think we can conclude that Puel quite frequently finds it difficult to prepare for stuff.

  "<p>There\u2019s an all-too-resonant scene in Joachim Lafosse\u2019s bitter drama in which children have their age verified by their teeth \u2013 though the drama focuses on westerners who actually want to welcome refugees. A bit too much, in fact: in a story based on the real-life 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/29/spain.france\">Zoe\u2019s Ark controversy</a>, Vincent Lindon leads an NGO in Chad that masquerades as an orphanage but plans to abscond with the kids back to adoptive families in France. The organisation lets neither the fractious Saharan security situation, or the local chiefs\u2019 pragmatic propensity for fibbing about the ages and parentage of kids they wish to offload, get in the way of its unwavering and mostly selfish idealism. </p> <p>It\u2019s a diagnosis of geopolitical power relations nearly as effective as the 2012 Somali pirate thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/09/a-hijacking-review\">A Hijacking</a>. Lafosse damns his do-gooders in a disciplined set of medium-shot dustscapes and murky Conradian interiors, rarely allowing anyone \u2013 even the pugnacious, impatient Lindon \u2013 to plead their case in closeup.

  "<p>How can you tell if an artist means it in 2016? Independent pop has grown so referential that it can be hard to tell deference from critique. </p> <p>For a while, Melbourne group Client Liaison seemed an amusement belonging to the second category. They wear flamboyant curls and dress like an RSL Wham! cover band. Their music sounds like Video Hits circa 1989: club-indebted, fossilised chart pop both dreamy and assertive, aspirational and relaxed. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clientliaison/videos/1264616716934043/\">The video used to promote this debut album</a> is a laboured parody of 1980s corporate-chic, goading the amusement of a generation who thought American Psycho was funnier than it was alarming. </p> <p>So yeah, Diplomatic Immunity sounds a bit crap on paper. Like many of their contemporaries, Client Liaison trades in an outmoded pop idiom and, typically enough, that idiom originates from the late 1980s. It\u2019s a popular period to parody because it threw up the likes of Rick Astley, George Michael and hundreds of tracks from the Stock Aitken Waterman production line. This ilk can\u2019t help but evoke Reagan and Thatcher: the looming inevitability of immaculately groomed neoliberalism, the way it painted the world a peculiar shade of corporate blue. Chart pop of this era recalls these regimes, making it an attractive period for modern artists to revisit and repurpose.</p> <p>Sadly, it\u2019s no longer 1988 \u2013 and Client Liaison isn\u2019t really a group from the past. Opening track Canberra Won\u2019t Be Calling Tonight samples a 2014 exchange between the former immigration minister Scott Morrison and the Labor senator Kim Carr during <a href=\"http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/australian-immigration-minister-gives-little-away-to-senate-committee/1257582\">a Senate hearing</a> into withheld documents related to Operation Sovereign Borders.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49e4f61872dca1664745f981313d21af9353f380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49e4f61872dca1664745f981313d21af9353f380/0_552_3840_4798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Morgan and Harvey Miller, the core members of Client Liaison\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monte Morgan and Harvey Miller, the core members of Client Liaison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remote Control Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carr\u2019s pummelling of Morrison is deliberately foregrounded, but its presence at the beginning of the album seems to preface a direction the duo never really travels in. Instead, the present is kept at a safe distance throughout: the liner notes are festooned with drawings of Fosters cans, water coolers and giant wireless telephones, as well as a botched-up letter from former governor-general Bill Hayden granting the duo diplomatic immunity.</p> <p>Juxtaposed with its backdrop of a cheerful late 80s house, that Senate hearing sample is an interesting choice. In Australia, our 1980s were different \u2013 and with the benefit of hindsight, utopian. We operated under a prime minister still mythologised as an authentic schooner skolling alpha-bloke \u2013 indeed, one half of Client Liaison <a href=\"https://acclaimmag.com/music/after-dark-feature-interview-client-liaison/\">has described</a> Bob Hawke\u2019s famous beer skolling incident, perhaps in jest, as a big influence on the group\u2019s music. In the 1980s, at the height of our short-lived cultural export boom, we were somebody. We were Crocodile Dundee, Yahoo Serious, Kylie, Merv Hughes, Scott and Charlene. These are exemplars of our charm to many of the era.</p> <p>Client Liaison evokes that period relentlessly. Tracks such as Wild Life and A Foreign Affair \u2013 the latter featuring Tina Arena \u2013 bulge with a faintly sad optimism, an elusive hope borne of less complex times.</p> <p>Molding their songs from the soft focus ambience of late 80s club and house palettes, Client Liaison is capable of producing very beautiful pop music, suffused with a powerful combination of dancefloor vigour and bittersweet nostalgia. But the kitsch veneer can become distracting, even annoying. The duo\u2019s affectations threaten to bury the genuine, earnest pleasures these songs have to offer; to have to stop and wonder whether they\u2019re serious during a track like Home \u2013 a lusciously smooth jam recalling Pet Shop Boys\u2019 moodier material \u2013 makes it harder to love.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywMAAEIb5YE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ywMAAEIb5YE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> And while there are no stinkers on Diplomatic Immunity, one begins to wonder whether Australia\u2019s independent music scene will ever tire of revisiting our past as salve for its present identity crisis \u2013 whether it be the antiquated pub rock of Bad Dreems, the new wave aping Shining Bird or the carefully channeled 1990s grunge of Violent Soho, to name just a few examples. Settler Australians may find little to love about themselves in the modern age, but this reflexive pillaging of the past for remnants of an uncompromised self does not bode well for our mental health, nor the longevity of our art. </p> <p>Of course, that may sound like a thoroughly neurotic hang up to you, in which case Diplomatic Immunity is among the best pop records Australia will get this year. Client Liaison is great without the retro window dressing, and a strange dilemma with it. </p> <p>Either way, the songs are undeniable. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Diplomatic Immunity is out on 4 November through Remote Control</em></p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019re an ardent remainer hoping the high court judgment is a chink of light that could ultimately result in Britain remaining in the European Union, don\u2019t hold your breath.

May chose to delay, perhaps on the advice of Whitehall civil servants understandably anxious about the scale of the challenge of the negotiations.</p> <p>But by stringing out the process, while appearing to give MPs and the public as little information as possible about the government\u2019s stance, she has riled many in her own party.</p> <p>Meanwhile, by carrying out such a sweeping reshuffle when she arrived in No 10, she has peopled the back benches with articulate advocates of a different, more collegiate approach \u2013 such as those sacked in the reshuffle, including Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and George Osborne, who have all begun to flex their muscles.</p> <p>There have been other early indicators of a less-than-sure political touch, too: May blundered into a row with the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, by breaking the convention that politicians don\u2019t comment on monetary policy, expressing concerns in her conference speech she had concerns about quantitative easing.</p> <p>She struck a pose as the champion of the people against big business but watered down Cameron\u2019s planned obesity strategy so radically that even supermarkets said they would have liked tougher regulation.</p> <p>On Heathrow, she partially suspended cabinet collective responsibility and shelved the idea of an immediate vote for fear of the scale of opposition in her own party. She still lost an MP over it and then chose not to stand a candidate against him. It hardly looks like deft political management.</p> <p>And over a series of other questions: from Hinkley Point C to Amber Rudd\u2019s language on immigration; to the Orgreave non-inquiry; to the secret Nissan deal; somehow the political dots haven\u2019t quite joined up.</p> <p>Whitehall insiders say, despite May\u2019s loathing of Cameron\u2019s \u201cchumocracy\u201d, that key decisions are made by a tight clique of close allies and are not always subjected to the test of open, robust debate.</p> <p>If the supreme court upholds Thursday\u2019s ruling, No 10 has conceded that the \u201clogical conclusion\u201d will be to place a bill on triggering article 50 before both houses of parliament. But to have been dragged into doing so is not a great look. One pro-remain MP muttered darkly yesterday: \u201cAt best, she\u2019s been very badly advised.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The average westerner\u2019s carbon emissions destroy 30 square metres of Arctic sea ice every year, according to new research. </p> <p>The work indicates that, even with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">current efforts to cut emissions</a>, the Arctic will lose all its ice in summer within about 20 years.<br></p> <p>Plummeting Arctic sea ice cover is one of the most obvious signs of climate change and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/01/rapid-arctic-ice-loss-linked-to-extreme-weather-changes-in-europe-and-us\">increasingly linked to extreme weather events</a> such as storms and floods in Europe and severe cold snaps in the US.</p> <p>The new study revealed a linear link between emissions of CO2 and the loss of Arctic sea ice, which has shrunk by half in the last 40 years. The link enables people to understand their own contribution to climate change, according to the leader of the work, Prof Dirk Notz, at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. </p> <p>\u201cIt allows us, for the first time really, to intuitively grasp how we all individually contribute to global warming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe observed numbers are very simple. For each tonne of CO2 that a person emits anywhere on this planet, three square metres of Arctic summer sea ice disappears.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far the global warming debate has always been about very large numbers like billions of tonnes of CO2 or very small numbers like 0.1C of temperature change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur study allows us to understand that it is really our own individual actions, every day, that contribute to ongoing global warming.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aag2345\">published in the journal Science</a>, analysed the declining extent of Arctic sea ice from 1953 to 2015 and found it tracked the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The relationship fits well with the underlying physics.</p> <p>As a result, it is possible to calculate how much Arctic sea ice is lost as a result of an individual\u2019s emissions. The average annual emissions of a citizen of the 35 rich nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is 10 tonnes per year, leading to 30 sq m of ice being lost. Citizens of the US, Canada and Australia have a higher carbon footprint - about 16 tonnes - each causing almost 50 sq m of ice loss per year. In the UK, the average emissions are 7.5 tonnes per year, meaning 22.5 sq m of ice loss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/sea_ice-zip/giv-140675hgNEGoM1d5\" data-alt=\"CO2 emissions and Arctic ice loss by country\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/sea_ice-zip/giv-140675hgNEGoM1d5\">CO2 emissions and Arctic ice loss by country</a> </figure>  <p>Prof Len Shaffrey, at the University of Reading in the UK, said the new research was sound and showed a new way of linking Arctic sea ice loss and personal CO2 emissions: \u201cIt means on average we are [each] responsible for the loss of tens of square metres of summer Arctic sea ice. That\u2019s a pretty sobering thought.\u201d</p> <p>The link also allows the calculation of how much CO2 can be emitted in future before the Arctic is entirely ice-free in September, usually the month of the smallest extent. The scientists found 1,000 gigatonnes (GT) of CO2 was the limit. If all the carbon-cutting pledges currently made by the world\u2019s nations are implemented, the Arctic will be ice free in summer in about 22 years, according to the new research.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not a god-given year when the ice will be gone but there is this number of 1,000GT - once we have emitted that amount, the [summer] Arctic sea ice will be gone,\u201d Notz said. \u201cIf emissions don\u2019t change at all from today\u2019s level, which is extremely unlikely, then the ice will be gone in 25 years. If emissions continue to rise then the ice will be gone sooner than that.\u201d</p> <p>The 1,000GT carbon budget is also the limit for keeping climate change below the internationally agreed threshold of 2C. This means that even if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate treaty</a>, which enters into force on Friday, is successful, the Arctic will still become ice-free in summer. </p> <p>However, the Paris treaty also includes an aspiration to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C, which would require radical cuts in CO2 emissions, including sucking the gas out of the air and burying it. If this was achieved, the Arctic ice cap would remain year round.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice fell to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded\">second lowest recorded extent in September</a>, and scientists say this matters for a number of reasons. \u201cBy losing Arctic sea ice, we are losing a very effective refrigerator, as sea ice today reflects most of the sunlight and keeps the Arctic cool,\u2019 said Notz. \u201cIf we lose this refrigerator, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/greenlands-huge-annual-ice-loss-is-even-worse-than-thought\">Greenland ice cap will melt much more rapidly</a>, for example, and drive up sea levels.\u201d<br></p> <p>Other scientists are increasingly linking the loss of Arctic sea ice to a weakening of a high level wind, called the jet stream, which is in turn linked to increasing extreme weather events, such as storms and floods in western Europe, severe cold snaps in the US and drought in California. \u201cThe jury is still out on how robust these studies are but there is mounting evidence,\u201d said Notz.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, we are destroying a landscape from this planet which is extremely beautiful and future generations would have nothing to look at but open water in September, so for me that is an ethical thing,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Even though my protocol droid is fluent in more than six million forms of communication, it has drawn a blank with some of the utterances Lindsay Lohan made on the steps of her new Athens nightclub, LOHAN.</p> <p>But so what? Lost in Showbiz is excited that Lindsay that should have followed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhtq1ObGHy8\">former England manager Steve McClaren into the muddy waters of cod-European accents</a> \u2013 and, heaven knows, we\u2019ve all ended up being able to speak only broken English on nightclub pavements. Usually on the way out, rather than the way in, but still.</p> <p>By way of a recap, Lindsay has put her name, and supposedly some investment, to a fancy new nightclub in the Greek capital, and used an appearance there this week to explain \u2013 with the smiling staccato of someone feeling their <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3896028/Lindsay-Lohan-breaks-silence-reveals-new-accent.html\">heavily accented way in the unfamiliar American tongue</a> \u2013 how this was just the start of the brand rollout. \u201cThere\u2019s bigger things to be done with the LOHAN club,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThere is spas, there is refugee camps.\u201d</p> <p>Well, quite. Actually, hang on \u2013 what?</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid the answer to that question is slightly unclear. According to Lindsay, an unspecified percentage of profits from the club may be going to charity \u2013 at least, she says haltingly \u201cwe can make it a good purpose\u201d, and \u201cwe can create charity from the club\u201d. The nature of the charity in question is also fairly broadbrush \u2013 Lindsay claims it will fix \u201cbad things in the world\u201d, seemingly focused on refugees from Syria. An energy-drink brand ambassador, she recently talked about <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/28/entertainment/lindsay-lohan-refugees/\">handing out cans of the stuff to refugees after her visit to a camp in Turkey</a>. \u201cWe have to help people,\u201d she goes on, \u201cand if we can do it with a nightclub, or with a spa, or with refugee camps, or with containers \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the Rosetta Stone to all this is in one of the containers? Until we locate it, however, we have only Lindsay\u2019s business plan/wellness-driven moodboard. \u201cWe create peaceful locations where we can all be happy,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd we start with the refugees, and then we open nice places, and maybe one of the refugees will open a place with us \u2026 I want LOHAN to be a celebration of everybody coming together, in the European nations.\u201d</p> <p>It is a hell of an ask of a nightclub, in the circumstances. But certainly worth a shot. Certainly a shot of the aforementioned energy drink, which is sold at the bar.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lohan completists will know that has she long aspired to use her celebrity to the generalised benefit of troubled regions. In 2006, Lindsay announced plans to visit Iraq. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/actress-lohan-wants-to-visit-iraq-with-sen-clinton.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=actress-lohan-wants-to-visit-iraq-with-sen.-clinton-2006-08-10\">she explained</a>, with the apparent failure to be able to synchronise diaries likely to have been of equal if not greater frustration to the current Democratic nominee for the US presidency.</p> <p>\u201cHillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous.\u201d Or as Hillary\u2019s spokesman put it: \u201cIt was suggested to her that if she wanted to go, she could pursue doing so through the <a href=\"https://www.uso.org/\">USO</a>.\u201d Look, whatever. Lindsay had a clear plan: \u201cI wanted to do what Marilyn Monroe did, when she went and just set up a stage and did a concert for the troops all by herself. It\u2019s so inspiring seeing that one woman just going somewhere, this beautiful sex kitten, who is basically a pin-up, which is what I\u2019ve always aspired to be.\u201d</p> <p>Still, God love Lindsay, who has added to the gaiety of various nations since her horrendous parents pushed her on stage far too young. If, as entertainment cliche holds, you are frozen in development at the age at which you become famous, then Lindsay will for ever be preserved at the age of 11, when she made her name in Disney\u2019s The Parent Trap remake. Looked at this way, her latest venture is no more sweetly clueless than a child being admonished for not eating its egg at breakfast on the basis that there are people starving across the world, and asking worriedly if it can post the remains of the egg to them.</p> <p>As for her accent, the extensive WTF-ery that has attended its debut has caused Lindsay to respond with details of its genesis. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of the languages I can understand or am trying to learn,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI\u2019ve been learning different languages since I was a child. I\u2019m fluent in English and French, can understand Russian and am learning Turkish, Italian and Arabic.\u201d As for what this pending creole should be called, Lindsay declared: \u201cWe should let the people decide.\u201d</p> <p>Odd to see her coming round to the idea of referendums. After all, she was less enamoured during a lengthy series of tweets posted in conjunction with the BBC\u2019s coverage on the night of the European referendum itself, at one point issuing the dismissive inquiry: \u201cSorry Kettering but where are you?\u201d (I think they\u2019re south of the river somewhere, but probably best to get them to come to you). Following a defensive mention of this in the House of Commons by the local MP, Philip Hollobone, Lindsay later apologised to the town, and agreed to switch on its Christmas lights. Thereafter, it all went a bit quiet.</p> <p>Indeed, last week Hollobone was raising the spectre of a no-show, telling the BBC: \u201cShe said she would come and switch on the Christmas lights at Kettering but, despite everyone\u2019s best efforts, it\u2019s simply not been possible to track her down.\u201d Yet since then some progress appears to have been made. On Thursday, a spokesman for Kettering borough council revealed: \u201cWe have made direct contact with Lindsay\u2019s publicist. We get the impression she is genuinely really interested. It just depends on whether or not she can fit it in.\u201d</p> <p>Surely it all flows together? Energy drink, exclusive nightclub, spas, refugee camps, containers, Kettering \u2026 I\u2019ll let you know when I guess the next one in the sequence. In the meantime, let\u2019s just accept that Lindsay\u2019s new accent would be the most eye-catching festive curiosity in Kettering since Neil and Christine Hamilton gave us their Fairy Godmother and Baron Hardup in the town panto in 2011, and cross our fingers accordingly.</p>",
  "<p>The devastating impact of cigarette smoke on the body\u2019s DNA has been laid bare by the first comprehensive study into the damage tobacco inflicts on human cells.</p> \n<p>People who smoke a pack of cigarettes each day for a year develop on average 150 extra mutations in every lung cell, and nearly 100 more mutations than usual in each cell of the voice box, researchers found.

They can be inherited from parents and turn up in almost every cell in the offspring, or they can be picked up during an organism's life and appear only in some tissues. Mutations can be acquired when DNA is not copied correctly during cell division, or when cells are exposed to environmental factors such as UV rays or chemicals in tobacco smoke. Mutations can range in size from tiny ones that alter only single units of the genetic code to much larger ones that change several genes at once.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While chemicals in tobacco smoke have long been known to raise the risk of at least 17 forms of cancer, the precise molecular mechanisms through which they mutate DNA and give rise to tumours in different tissues have never been clear.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cThis is about running down the root cause of cancers,\u201d said David Phillips, a professor of environmental carcinogenesis at King\u2019s College London and a co-author on the study. \u201cBy identifying the root causes, we gain the sort of knowledge we need to think more seriously about cancer prevention.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than 70 of the 7,000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Some damage DNA directly, but others ramp up mutations in more subtle ways, often by disrupting the way cells function. The more mutations a cell acquires, the more likely it is to turn cancerous.<br></p> \n<p>The reason why some people can smoke for years without getting cancer, while others develop the disease, is down to the way mutations arise. When a person smokes, the chemicals they inhale create mutations at random points in the genome. Many of these changes will be harmless, but others not so benign. The more smoke a person is exposed to, the greater the chance that the accumulating mutations will hit specific spots in the DNA that turn cells cancerous.<br></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/sep/08/smoking-lung-cancer-scans-screening\">Do lung cancer scans deter smokers from giving up?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cYou can really think of it as playing Russian roulette,\u201d said Ludmil Alexandrov, a theoretical biologist at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico and the first author of the study. \u201cYou can miss the right genes. But if you smoke you still play the game. It\u2019s a very strong message for people not to start smoking. If you smoke even a little bit you\u2019ll erode the genetic material of most of the cells in your body.\u201d Smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer in the world and accounts for more than 1 in 4 UK cancer deaths.<br></p> \n<p>With researchers at the Wellcome Trust\u2019s Sanger Institute near Cambridge and others, Alexandrov analysed the DNA of more than 5,000 cancers. The team then turned to pattern recognition software to tease apart the various mutational signatures found in tumours from smokers versus non-smokers. To find the signatures - the patterns of mutations present in cancer cells - researchers performed the genetic equivalent of recording the chatter at a party and then extracting individual conversations from the hubbub.<br></p> \n<p>The scientists spotted more than 20 mutational signatures in 13 types of cancer linked to tobacco smoking. But only five of these were more common in smokers\u2019 tumours. One pattern of mutations, dubbed signature four, was found to be a major driver for lung cancer. It is thought to be caused by benzopyrene, a chemical found in tobacco smoke.<br></p> \n<p>More intriguing was how tobacco caused mutations in tissues that are not directly exposed to smoke, such as the bladder, kidneys and pancreas. The study found that chemicals from tobacco smoke found their way to different organs and tissues and then sped up the molecular clocks in the cells. This ramped up the natural rate at which mutations built up in the tissues.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cWe knew there was direct damage from smoking in the lungs. What we didn\u2019t expect was to see smoking speed up the molecular clocks inside cells,\u201d said Alexandrov, whose study appears in the journal <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aag0299\">Science</a>. \u201cIn bladder cancer, the only thing that causes the extra mutations in smokers is the speeding up of the clock, and that will be very dependent on the intensity of smoking. For every pack of cigarettes you smoke per year, you accumulate 18 mutations in all of your bladder cells,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Scientists hope that by understanding how the individual ingredients of tobacco smoke raise the risk of various cancers, they can develop new ways to prevent the disease. The same techniques used in the latest study will now be used to tease apart how alcohol, obesity and other factors also increase a person\u2019s cancer risk.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a message here for people who are occasional or social smokers who think it doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Alexandrov. \u201cIf you smoke four to five packs of cigarettes in your lifetime it doesn\u2019t sound that much, but you still get several mutations in every cell in your lungs and these are permanent, they do not go away. There are a lot of things that do revert back when you stop smoking, and this shouldn\u2019t discourage people from giving up, but the specific mutations in the lung cells are like scars. If you stop smoking, they\u2019ll still be there.\u201d</p>",

She then spent at least three weeks waiting for the crossing in a \u201ccamp\u201d run by traffickers either in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, or Misrata, the port, before embarking to Lampedusa.</p> <p>The route, known locally as \u201cthe back way\u201d, is followed by thousands of Gambians every year. It is extremely dangerous, with many perishing in the Sahara, or during the hazardous sea crossing.</p> <p>Jawara, who travelled with a 19-year-old friend who also died in the shipwreck, had left Gambia without telling her family or team-mates of her plans.</p> <p>\u201cShe was always quiet and very determined on and off the pitch.

She saved a penalty in a friendly last year in Scotland, gaining accolades there and at home.</p> <p>\u201cFatim was like many other young footballers here.

That\u2019s why we made You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/youvebeentrumpedtoo/\">available free</a> to all voters in America on Thursday night ahead of its UK release. This is the film he doesn\u2019t want you to see. And here\u2019s why we think you should see it \u2026</p> <p>Ten years ago, when several residents whose homes are located on the picturesque sand dunes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/23/donald-trump-faces-wall-of-opposition-as-he-returns-to-scotland\">Balmedie in Scotland</a> refused to sell their land to Trump for his new luxury golf course resort, the billionaire began a campaign of bullying and intimidation that continues to this day. Most well-known among these residents is farmer Michael Forbes, whose modest croft sits right in the middle of where Trump wanted to build \u201cthe greatest golf course in the world\u201d. Michael\u2019s mother Molly (now aged 92) lives in a caravan across the farmyard from her son. The home has a handmade carved sign on it, reading \u201cParadise\u201d. That was, until Trump arrived.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s first attempt at being a great neighbour was to go on national television and slam the state of Michael Forbes\u2019s farm. The farm was \u201ca slum\u201d, and Michael \u201clived like a pig\u201d, fumed Trump. How could he possibly build his hotel for millionaires if the windows were to look out over \u201cthis horrible, horrible slum\u201d?</p> <p>The hotel was part of Trump\u2019s master plan for the Menie estate\u2019s shifting sand dunes that would create \u201c6,000 jobs\u201d, see the building of 1,500 houses and the construction of a skyscraper hotel. Trump promised to get \u201cAberdeen booming\u201d. His claims were lapped up by local politicians, eager to find an economic wand to wave for when North Sea oil runs dry. No problem if the residents refused to sell. Next up was his threat of eminent domain \u2013 or under UK law, compulsory purchase.</p> <p>So concerned was I at the lack of scrutiny of Trump\u2019s plan and the devastating effect it would have on people and the rare sand dunes where he wanted to build his gated golf resort that I began making my film, You\u2019ve Been Trumped.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his salmon-fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water. Trump\u2019s workers had apparently cut through a pipe leading from the spring that serves the Forbes\u2019s well. The result was that Michael, his wife Sheila and Michael\u2019s mother, Molly, were without running water. This had been going on for a week. And what had Trump done about it? Nothing, according to the Forbes.</p> <p>I went immediately to speak to the man in charge of Trump\u2019s building work at the time to get the other side of the story. He confirmed that there was nobody trying to sort the problem out. He explained they had to \u201cassess it first\u201d so that it \u201cwould be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It\u2019ll be the best water system he\u2019s ever had\u201d.</p> <p>A short time later I was arrested along with my producer Richard Phinney, and we were thrown into an Aberdeen police cell. There we sat for hours while the police \u2013 apparently acting as a private security force for Trump \u2013 dreamed up some ludicrous charge. The charges were eventually dropped, and the police issued an apology. But still the Forbes\u2019s water supply ran dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/03/the-view-from-middletown-whoever-wins-election-needs-to-address-the-rage-out-there\">'Whoever wins the US election needs to address the rage out there': the view from Middletown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the years that followed I went back to the Forbes\u2019s house. I made another film in 2014 called <a href=\"http://www.adangerousgamemovie.com/#watch-now\">A Dangerous Game</a>, for which Trump granted me an on-camera interview about the residents\u2019 plight. When I filmed that interview in early 2013, I had no idea that Molly was still without a proper working water supply. She is a private person, a former land girl (member of the Women\u2019s Land Army) during the second world war, and used to hardship.</p> <p>Throughout this extraordinary presidential campaign, countless articles have been written about the outrageous things that Donald Trump has said. But lesser known is what he has done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to get You\u2019ve Been Trumped Too out to US voters. It is a rare document of the impact on the lives of ordinary people of Trump\u2019s actions.</p> <p>Mexico-style border walls? Check. Mistreatment of women? Check. Failure to deliver on promises? Check. And as for the Forbes\u2019s water? When Trump announced he was running for the presidency in the summer of 2015, I was dumbfounded to discover Molly was still collecting water from a nearby stream because her water supply wasn\u2019t working \u201call because of Trump\u201d.

  "<p>The justice secretary, Elizabeth Truss, has been warned by her Conservative predecessor Ken Clarke that her major prison reform programme will be \u201cimpossible to achieve\u201d unless she addresses the \u201cprison works\u201d sentencing policies of the past 20 years that have doubled the jail population to a record 85,000 in England and Wales.</p> <p>Clarke welcomed the justice secretary\u2019s new prison plan but told MPs she needed to \u201ctake the courageous decision to start addressing some of the sentencing policies of the 1990s/2000s, which accidentally doubled the prison population in those overcrowded slums and actually make sure our prisons are for serious criminals who need punishment\u201d.</p> <p>His warning came after the Prison Governors Association welcomed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prisons-in-england-and-wales-given-boost-of-2500-new-staff-to-tackle-violence\">Truss\u2019s decision to recruit an extra 2,500 prison officers</a> to \u201chelp halt the staggering rise in prison violence\u201d but said her package will not have an immediate impact \u201cas the real challenge now is actually getting staff through the gates\u201d. The justice secretary acknowledged that there are serious recruitment problems in London and the south-east.</p> <p>In the Commons, Truss confirmed that a prison safety and reform bill would be introduced into parliament in the new year to increase freedoms for governors, improve education opportunities for offenders and close old and inefficient jails as part of the biggest overhaul of the prison system for a generation.</p> <p>She rejected, however, Clarke\u2019s warning of the need to tackle the inflation in sentencing that was introduced under Michael Howard\u2019s punitive \u201cprison works\u201d policy and which has seen the jail population in England and Wales jump from 42,000 in 1990 to more than 85,000 this week. Truss said she was not in favour of such \u201carbitrary reductions\u201d in the prison population.</p> <p>The detailed white paper published on Thursday, Prison Safety and Reform, confirms the plans for a new anti-drugs strategy, to devolve budgets to governors and to introduce a system of league tables and a new trigger for the justice secretary to intervene in failing prisons.</p> <p>It discloses that the prison authorities intend to tackle deliveries of drugs and other contraband by drone with trials to detect and block them. They are also talking to the drone industry about the potential to programme the GPS coordinates of prison no-fly zones into the majority of drones on the market so they are blocked from overflying jails.</p> <p>The white paper confirms the plans to open the next \u201csupersized\u201d 1,000 plus-inmate jail at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and says a planning application will also be submitted to build a new prison at Glen Parva in Leicestershire.</p> <p>It also discloses plans to open five new \u201ccommunity prisons\u201d for women as part of a \u00a31.3bn programme to provide 10,000 modern prison places by 2020.</p> <p>The white paper also confirms the commitment to a \u201cmajor programme of closures\u201d of the \u201coldest and most inadequate\u201d prisons over the next five years including a plan to reconfigure the estate, which has a surplus of 10,500 local prison places and a shortage of 14,400 resettlement and training places. </p> <p>Truss says that former prisons at Dover and Haslar, Portsmouth, which have recently been immigration removal centres, will not be reopened as prisons. The white paper doesn\u2019t name Pentonville, the Victorian jail dubbed the \u201cgrimmest of the grim\u201d and which Michael Gove identified as a candidate for closure. But it does mention another Victorian London jail, Wandsworth, which is supposed to be a remand prison and yet only a third of its 1,600 population is awaiting trial or sentence.</p> <p>The white paper also confirms that the prison service intends to press ahead with anti-extremism plans to set up a network of separate specialist units to house \u201cthe most subversive individuals\u201d in the prison system despite a recent French decision to abandon a similar system.</p> <p>Truss said that the recruitment of an extra 2,500 staff, including 400 she announced at the Tory party conference, would enable a new system of dedicated officers with each responsible for six inmates. She acknowledged that there were particular recruitment difficulties in London and the south-east but said she hoped new recruits would come from the armed forces among others. A prison officer apprenticeship scheme to be introduced next year will provide 1,000 new officers and a graduate scheme will provided 40 more a year.</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, criticised the package as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s 2,500 extra [officers], after over 6,000 fewer on the frontline. Will the secretary of state now admit that there is a Conservative cuts-created crisis in safety in our prisons? </p> <p>\u201cThe root cause of this prison crisis is the political decision to cut our prison service back to the bone. Today\u2019s announcement feels a lot like too little, too late,\u201d he said.</p>",

Aside from an outbreak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/ladies-resist-hardmen-ukip-brexit\" title=\"\">infighting (literally) among Ukip MEPs</a>, the party has been crippled by a falling membership, financial problems, the resignation of its latest leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\" title=\"\">Diane James</a>, after only 18 days, and lingering disputes between Nigel Farage and his internal critics \u2013 namely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/douglas-carswell-im-having-far-too-much-fun-lo-leave-ukip\" title=\"\">Douglas Carswell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/29/suzanne-evans-gaping-hole-in-british-politics-for-ukip\" title=\"\">Suzanne Evans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/ukip-group-neil-hamilton-elected-lead-welsh-assembly-wales\" title=\"\">Neil Hamilton</a>.

There is no doubt that much will depend on whoever is elected to become its new leader. The party is currently in the midst of a fresh leadership election which, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/31/raheem-kassam-pulls-out-of-ukip-leadership-contest\" title=\"\">withdrawal of Farage\u2019s former chief of staff</a>, Raheem Kassam, is now essentially between two figures \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/ukip-paul-nuttall-suzanne-evans-stand-for-leadership\" title=\"\">Paul Nuttall and Evans</a>. Peter Whittle, Ukip\u2019s member of the London Assembly, is also standing and is respected among activists \u2013 but his chances of victory are considered slim.</p> <p>Nuttall and Evans represent different wings of the party and would each take Ukip down a very different path. Evans is seen by some in Ukip and the media as a competent performer but she lacks widespread support among grassroots members and, given her southern focus and general style, is unlikely to widen Ukip\u2019s appeal in those all-important northern Labour areas. Furthermore, her path to the leadership will be made more difficult by her party critics, who claim that Evans has repeatedly plotted against Farage and wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties. They have a point. In the age of Brexit, it is difficult to imagine a centre-leaning Ukip picking up many votes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Should Nuttall win, then he will turn Ukip\u2019s cannons toward the 44 Labour seats where his party is in second place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This leaves Nuttall, an MEP from the north-west, a Liverpudlian, political historian and long-term ally of Farage who, for many years, was groomed to become his successor. Nuttall was one of the first in Ukip to talk about the electoral potential that lay hidden in Labour seats, and trudged through the streets of Oldham with Farage during a parliamentary byelection in 2011 when the two hatched a plan to take Labour areas more seriously. This was actually an important moment in the history of British politics. Ukip finished in fourth place, saving its deposit, and placing ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/bnp\" title=\"\">the BNP</a>, which was still occupying minds.</p> <p>The result convinced the two men of the need to throw more effort into Labour territory, a decision that would have a real impact over the next five years, on Labour and Britain more generally. But Nuttall has also assiduously cultivated his networks among local Ukip branches and former leaders. It is telling, for instance, that during the current contest he has received endorsements from both the original generation of Ukippers \u2013 including former leader Jeffrey Titford \u2013 as well as much of the current group of Ukip MEPs. He is generally seen as a safe pair of hands, and is a strong speaker and a competent media performer, though some wonder whether he can match the charisma and political instincts of his mentor.</p> <p>Should Nuttall win, then it could be argued that Ukip has a chance to sustain its presence on the political landscape. Despite its severe internal problems, in the <a href=\"http://www.ukpolitical.info/General_election_polls.htm\" title=\"\">national opinion polls</a> the party continues to average over 10%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/general-election-labour-crisis-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>\u2019s dismal ratings, combined with rising anxiety among leavers over the direction of Brexit, also offer clear opportunities to a radical populist party that defines itself as against the London establishment. Such openings are magnified by new research which suggests that at least 67% of the leave vote consists of voters who in <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-impact/are-leave-voters-mainly-ukip-by-jonathan-mellon-and-geoffrey-evans/#.WBoxTZOLSi4\" title=\"\">recent years flirted with supporting Ukip</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57394802f3687aa077f050e525f90ff6cd2c70f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57394802f3687aa077f050e525f90ff6cd2c70f8/38_21_4522_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Suzanne Evans\u2019s critics claim she wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Suzanne Evans\u2019s critics claim she wants to abandon Ukip\u2019s position as a genuinely radical alternative to the Westminster parties.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such statistics appear to support those like Banks and Kassam who argue that Ukip\u2019s future should not be as a moderate centrist alternative, but rather a Westminster-bashing, anti-immigration and Brexit-focused populist revolt. Throw in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/inflation-rise-uk-living-standards\" title=\"\">increased inflation</a> next year and the possibility of a fresh economic crisis, and it is possible to see other openings around the issue of social and economic inequality, especially among those white, working-class and left-behind Britons who are already aware of the Ukip brand.</p> <p>Yet while there will remain demand, much will depend upon supply, and whether or not the party can finally resolve its seemingly endless internal problems. Should Nuttall win the contest, as the betting markets expect, then he will undoubtedly turn Ukip\u2019s cannons directly toward the 44 Labour seats where his party is currently nestled in second place. A fresh set of local elections in the spring of 2017 also offer opportunities to gun after Labour votes in Wales, as well as try to sustain a strong presence in those southern Conservative heartlands (although given the posturing of Theresa May, this side of the Ukip coalition may be more difficult to retain).</p> <p>But Nuttall will also need to tread incredibly carefully. Despite Nuttall framing himself as the \u201cunity candidate\u201d, both Banks and younger activists like Kassam say he remains too closely aligned to Farage\u2019s critics, notably Hamilton. They want to see him purge those who have fallen out with their leader.</p> <p>Should Nuttall refuse, then he may find that he is unable to keep Banks, Kassam and, ultimately, Farage on side, and thus be prevented from using all of the resources that have essentially motored Ukip forwards. Should he agree, then he may find himself reigniting the infighting that has already caused so much turmoil. Either way, while there remains clear space for Ukip, or a party like Ukip, whoever is elected leader will almost certainly face a baptism of fire as they struggle to keep the various factions satisfied.</p>",

  "<p>A momentous constitutional decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\">was taken by the high court</a> of England and Wales this morning. A prime minister\u2019s absolute power to do what they like, when they like, regardless of laws and treaties, was struck down. Theresa May cannot tear up our right to be EU citizens without the authority of parliament. Those rights were bestowed by parliamentary votes in a series of treaties.

  "<p>Norman Sherry, who has died aged 91, was a tireless literary sleuth whose three-volume biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/classics.grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> consumed him for 30 years. After naming Sherry as his official biographer in 1974, Greene followed the slow progress of the project with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, warning his devoted chronicler: \u201cI will live to see your first volume, but not your second. And you will not live to see the third.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of laughing this off as another example of his subject\u2019s dark humour, Sherry became haunted by the threat. After Greene did indeed live to see the first volume in 1989, but not the second five years later \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-obit.html\" title=\"\">dying in 1991</a> \u2013 Sherry worried that his own doom was sealed. Yet so much was his book the great passion of his life that he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of dying before all volumes were published. Just before submitting his third and final volume in 2004, he came up with an extraordinary trick to undercut Greene\u2019s prophecy.</p> <p>\u201cI have out of fear,\u201d he confessed to bewildered interviewers, \u201cleft the last sentence incomplete.\u201d</p> <p>This superstitious ploy couldn\u2019t protect the biographer from the critics, however, many of whom had grown weary of his obsession after generally heaping praise on the first two volumes. \u201cToo much Sherry,\u201d one complained, objecting to his increasing tendency to put himself at the forefront of Greene\u2019s story as he pursued the novelist\u2019s literary trail from Asia to Africa. \u201cThis book is not about Graham Greene,\u201d<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/books/graham-greene-biography-heavy-on-sex-draws-some-outrage.html?_r=0\" title=\"\"> charged the novelist\u2019s son and literary executor, Francis</a>, \u201cbut about Sherry.\u201d</p> <p>Defiant, the biographer responded: \u201cI was the nearest thing to being a son to him as could possibly be.\u201d</p> <p>In truth, they were polar opposites. A Balliol graduate, Greene was tall and worldly, a polished, literary man who moved with ease and confidence from the exclusive heights of the rich and well connected to the sordid depths of opium parlours and brothels. By contrast, Sherry was short and full of nervous energy, an earnest academic whose periodic excursions into Greeneland left him bruised and battered from a series of afflictions, including gangrene, tropical diabetes and temporary blindness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e501b6b3c29c964aadf4e416f362965346bbcf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e501b6b3c29c964aadf4e416f362965346bbcf8/0_275_2576_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Greene in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Greene in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What drew Greene to Sherry was the scholar\u2019s early work on Joseph Conrad. No matter how obscure the reference in Lord Jim or Heart of Darkness, Sherry tracked it down and shed light on Conrad\u2019s original sources for these novels and others. \u201cFollow me to the end of my life,\u201d Greene commanded his biographer after they met at the Savile Club in London, in 1974, and from that moment Sherry devoted himself to Greene\u2019s life and work with the same intensity he had shown with Conrad.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Norman was the son of Michael and Sarah Sherry. He studied English at King\u2019s College Durham (then part of Durham University, now Newcastle University) and spent a long career teaching literature at the University of Lancaster before moving to <a href=\"https://new.trinity.edu\" title=\"\">Trinity University of San Antonio</a>, Texas, in 1983, where he was a distinguished professor until his retirement in 2010. Like most things in his life after Greene came into it, his move to the US was prompted by his research interests, with an eye towards exploring Mexico and the literary archives of the <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu\" title=\"\">University of Texas at Austin</a>.</p> <p>Visiting Greene in 1985, the author David Lodge found that the older novelist enjoyed hearing stories of Sherry\u2019s travels and took a \u201cmischievous glee\u201d from knowing that the biographer was dutifully pursuing leads in even the most obscure parts of Liberia and Haiti. Of course, it was next to impossible to find much evidence of Greene\u2019s time in these places long after the novelist had visited them, but nothing could keep Sherry off the trail.</p> <p>One story begins with the researcher arriving at a hotel in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and announcing in the local paper that: \u201cProfessor Sherry will be happy to entertain at breakfast anyone having knowledge of Graham Greene\u2019s stay in Freetown during the second world war.\u201d The next morning the professor was startled to learn that dozens of locals were waiting in the lobby for breakfast with him, many with dubious stories to tell of a time before they were born.</p> <p>Sherry did indeed uncover a great deal of new information about his subject, but usually it was discovered not in exotic places but in the quiet halls of academic libraries, where Greene\u2019s letters, diaries and other papers have ended up over the years. Sherry first ran afoul of Greene\u2019s family when he faithfully reported some of the sensational revelations in these documents in his second and third volumes.</p> <p>Even one of Greene\u2019s mistresses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/27/classics.grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Yvonne Cloetta</a>, thought that the biographer had delved too deeply into sexual matters, and wrote angrily to him in 1997: \u201cYou have betrayed Graham. You have betrayed me. You have betrayed your craft. We have nothing more to say to each other.\u201d But nothing could deter Sherry. He claimed that Greene himself had given him the exclusive rights to his story, citing a one-sentence agreement the novelist signed on his deathbed.</p> <p>In 1994, as <a href=\"http://www.mylibrary.britishcouncil.org/people-and-places/graham-greene-the-man-within\" title=\"\">Greene\u2019s unauthorised biographer</a>, I debated with Sherry at a couple of events, and with his typical fondness for exaggeration he attacked me as a \u201cliterary terrorist\u201d for daring to offer a critical portrait of his hero. Ten years later, despite his best efforts to serve that hero, he found that Greene\u2019s circle had turned on him as they had turned on me, the family and others insisting that no portrait of the novelist was acceptable until all the warts were safely airbrushed away.</p> <p>In the end I\u2019m not sure whether Sherry understood that his great obsession had blighted his life more than it had graced it. When he died in San Antonio, he had endured countless illnesses, and had been married three times (his last wife, Pat Villalon, died in 2012; the former two marriages, to the novelist Sylvia Sherry (nee Blunt), and Carmen Flores, a former student at Trinity, ended in divorce). And, perhaps most dismaying from Sherry\u2019s point of view, a scholar on good terms with Greene\u2019s family had recently announced that he was completing a \u201cnew authorised biography\u201d meant to supersede his three volumes.</p> <p>He is survived by two children from his marriage to Carmen, John Michael and Ileana, and by his twin brother, Alan.</p> <p>\u2022 Norman Sherry, biographer, born 6 July 1925; died 19 October 2016</p>",

I\u2019ve been to a lot of funerals of my friends. The drugs are so much stronger, people in their mid-30s with small children are now dying through recreational use. It\u2019s doubling and tripling and heroin is catching up with meth. There\u2019s a lack of resources in the community for mental health, counselling and healing.

In Mooreland, there used to be a little restaurant, post office, bank, garage and now there\u2019s just a post office open in the mornings, everything else has gone. People are living in the homes but if they own five acres, they work in town, they\u2019re not working in land. Investment bankers out of Chicago bought land at the last auction.

Collishaw has created a zoetrope sculpture of fluttering hummingbirds to illustrate the theory that early human beings evolved art for the same reason hummingbirds evolved gorgeous feathers and elaborate dances: to seduce the opposite sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bcb535e54fbfaa66b91d33faa016aa9d39bd76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bcb535e54fbfaa66b91d33faa016aa9d39bd76a/0_0_5533_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saint Benedict Orders Saint Maurus to the Rescue of Saint Placidus, 1445, by Fra Filippo Lippi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"575\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saint Benedict Orders Saint Maurus to the Rescue of Saint Placidus, circa 1445/1450, by Fra Filippo Lippi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is art simply a preening display to attract mates and carry out the biological imperatives identified by Charles Darwin? There are a couple of anecdotal reasons to find this idea plausible. One is that artists from <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Fra_Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_with_the_Child_and_Scenes_from_the_Life_of_St_Anne_%28detail%29_-_WGA13239.jpg\">Fra Filippo Lippi</a>, a friar and religious artist who eloped with a nun he had seduced while painting her in 15th-century Florence, to Lucian Freud, have often been very good at finding sexual partners. And after all, so many people choose art galleries for dates.<br></p> <p>But I can think of a problem with this idea. In speculating on why art originated it is first necessary to decide when that happened. How far back in evolution does art go? Should we regard the symmetry of handaxes made before the appearance of homo sapiens as art or even, as the British Museum\u2019s current show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/26/south-africa-the-art-of-a-nation-review-apartheid-british-museum\">South Africa: The Art of a Nation</a> suggests, a stone resembling a face that was picked up by an Australopithecine?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c67b29aee80ea47b74c1acca98f0e6dc3cc7c69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c67b29aee80ea47b74c1acca98f0e6dc3cc7c69/0_0_4305_4871/884.jpg\" alt=\"The earliest recorded human made artistic object: a pebble resembling a human face, from Makapansgat, South Africa, ca. 3,000,000 BC.\" width=\"884\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The earliest-recorded human-made artistic object: a pebble resembling a human face, from Makapansgat, South Africa, circa 3,000,000 BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such stirrings of art are significant. Yet for me, the first true art is cave painting. Even if we concede that handaxes have sculptural qualities, the leap forward when homo sapiens started painting and drawing animals on the walls of caves in Spain and France during the ice age is astounding, and it is difficult to see how cave art could be sexual display. The sublime charcoal portraits of bisons that I recently saw in <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Niaux#/media/File%3ANiaux%2C_bisons.JPG\">Niaux cave</a> in the Pyrenees are located far underground in a vast natural vault: it is hard to picture a cave artist leading a girlfriend or boyfriend this deep underground by the light of a flickering torch in order to have sex in the cold and damp. \u201cCome and see my etchings. They\u2019re a mile underground.\u201d</p> <p>On the contrary. The deliberate mystery and estranging subterranean location of cave paintings suggests that the origins of art have much more to do with religion than sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c8f5652df2bc003a3db77a6976b7d61f8826df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c8f5652df2bc003a3db77a6976b7d61f8826df1/0_0_3624_5177/700.jpg\" alt=\"Handaxes from the Middle Palaeolithic era, circa 70,000 BC.\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Handaxes from the Middle Palaeolithic era, circa 70,000 BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Interfoto/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sexual display theory is advanced in the Mona exhibition by one of its four curators, the psychologist <a href=\"https://mona.net.au/museum/exhibitions/on-the-origin-of-art/geoffrey-miller\">Geoffrey Miller</a>. The other scientist-curators suggest similarly audacious explanations for the existence of art. <a href=\"https://mona.net.au/museum/exhibitions/on-the-origin-of-art/steven-pinker\">Steven Pinker</a>, author of books such as The Blank Slate, shares a hard-headed Darwinian perspective. He suggests that art evolved as a byproduct of other human skills and needs, including conspicuous consumption, and that aesthetic pleasure originates in our practical appreciation of \u201ccues to understandable, safe, productive, nutritious or fertile things in the world\u201d. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mona.net.au/museum/exhibitions/on-the-origin-of-art/brian-boyd\">Brian Boyd</a>, like Miller, thinks art has grown out of the signalling systems that all animals use in mating and the avoidance of danger, while <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mona.net.au/museum/exhibitions/on-the-origin-of-art/mark-changizi\">Mark Changizi</a> suggests it reflects our capacity to mimic nature.</p> <p>It\u2019s fascinating stuff, but such theorising needs to be set against a firm history of how and when art actually did evolve. This story is becoming ever clearer. Some of its milestones can be seen, far from Tasmania, in the British Museum\u2019s South Africa show. It is dangerous to confuse decorative instincts, or even the sense of beauty, which handaxes suggest evolved very early in the human story, with the higher, more complex activity that is art as we know it. The art in ice age caves such as those in Niaux has the same qualities as the art of Rembrandt, Da Vinci and Picasso, and is as hard to reduce to a simple biological urge or obvious evolutionary need. At its point of origin in dark caves deep in the Earth, art is enigmatic, poetic, profound and dreamlike. It is born sublime. You can\u2019t explain it until you can also explain Mark Rothko\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/dec/07/artsfeatures\">Seagram murals</a>.</p> <p>Darwin had <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/home-of-charles-darwin-down-house/\">Raphael prints in his bedroom</a>, but I doubt if he thought they were as susceptible to logic as the honeycombs in his beehives.<br></p>",
  "<p>The closing pages of Margaret Drabble\u2019s previous novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/01/pure-gold-baby-margaret-drabble-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Pure Gold Baby</em></a>, contained a brief though significant aside concerning Maroussia Darling, a classical actor and grand dame of the north London enclave in which many of Drabble\u2019s novels have been set: \u201cWe are old now and I heard this week from Maroussia that she has to have what she discreetly calls major surgery, and the prognosis is not good. She has had to pull out from the National. This is very sad news. We are dying off, one by one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/29/margaret-drabble-not-afraid-death-worry-about-living\">Margaret Drabble: \u2018I am not afraid of death. I worry about living\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maroussia was only a marginal figure, though the rumours about her health proved to be portentous. In the new novel, two old friends book tickets to see her buried to the waist in Samuel Beckett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/21/samuel-beckett-happy-days-half-buried-woman\" title=\"\"><em>Happy Days</em></a>. It turns out to be a farewell performance in the bleakest sense. Once the curtain falls she sends a few final emails before taking a fatal overdose: \u201cIt will serve Beckett right. She has served him well and loyally and she deserves a grand finale at his&#xa0;expense. He has set it up for her.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca Stubbs is furious with herself for wasting what seems to be a&#xa0;pointless and uncomfortable evening in the theatre. But she is horribly aware that Beckett\u2019s awful tragedy of stasis and decrepitude could soon become her own. Fran is \u201calready too old to&#xa0;die&#xa0;young and too old to avoid bunions and arthritis, moles and blebs, weakening wrists, incipient but not yet&#xa0;treatable cataracts and encroaching weariness\u201d. She staves off retirement by traversing the motorways of Britain as an inspector of care homes inhabited by clients only slightly more advanced in years than herself. Her oldest friend Josephine, meanwhile, is a retired academic who has opted to live in faux-collegiate sheltered accommodation. \u201cAlthough in excellent health, [Josephine] has met Old Age half way and is determined to make friends with&#xa0;her. La Vieillesse, that is what she sometimes calls Old Age, after the title of a terrifying book on the subject by Simone de Beauvoir.\u201d</p> <p>De Beauvoir wrote her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1972/mar/15/mainsection.fromthearchive\" title=\"\">classic study of the ageing process</a> in 1970, in terms that now appear to be prophetic: \u201cThe paradox of our time is that the aged enjoy better health than they used to and that they remain \u2018young\u2019 longer. This makes their idleness all the harder to bear. Those who live on must be given some reason for living: mere survival is worse than death.\u201d</p> <p>Drabble\u2019s novel can perhaps best be understood as a fictional meditation hovering between the twin poles of De Beauvoir\u2019s essay and Beckett\u2019s play; in&#xa0;terms of conventional narrative development, very little happens. Fran&#xa0;checks into budget hotels up and down the country in order to inspect failing institutions whose inhabitants are more often than not left \u201csoftly wandering in their wits\u201d. Josephine teaches poetry to an adult education group and works on her tapestry, while&#xa0;the rest of the novel concerns the&#xa0;manner in which their wider circle of friends and acquaintances deal, or fail to deal, with the indignities and infirmity of old age.</p> <p>The compensation for the reader is&#xa0;that these characters are brilliantly drawn. Fran\u2019s industry is offset by the sedentary lifestyle of her ex-husband Claude, a retired surgeon who sits among the plump cushions of his Kensington mansion ingesting self-prescribed narcotics and listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/1997/may/05/maria-callas-far-from-perfect-terrence-mcnally\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a>. Yet even Claude\u2019s complacency pales in comparison to the titanic self-centredness of Sir Bennett Carpenter, a grand antiquarian caught in negative equity on a paradisal Canary island that seems slightly less paradisal once he suffers a fall. The twee environs of his retirement haven are summed up by the history of the islands he intends to write: \u201cThere had&#xa0;been betrayals and dispossessions, but&#xa0;they had been small in scale. The Canaries did not swim with spilt blood. Their dried mummies were very ancient and very dry.\u201d</p> <p>Yet beneath the apparently placid surface, Drabble\u2019s novel seethes with apocalyptic intent. The low-magnitude earthquake that shakes Sir Bennett off&#xa0;his feet is a portent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/canary-islands-volcano\" title=\"\">volcanic activity beneath the north Atlantic</a> that could yet have devastating consequences. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/04/spain.mainsection\" title=\"\">influx of Moroccan asylum seekers to the Canary Islands</a> is highlighted as one of the least reported of European refugee routes. In either case, the narrative is loaded with dire predictions of \u201cthe dark flood\u201d approaching.</p> <p>It would all be a bit much to take, were it not for the stoicism of Fran herself, a woman who chooses to live in a dodgy north London council block, secretly rather likes dining in Premier Inns and cannot refrain from watering pot plants in airport lounges and lavatories. It\u2019s hard to argue with her assessment of her job as \u201ca bit of a downer\u201d \u2013 and the same might be said of the novel itself. But you can\u2019t help feeling uplifted by her righteous indignation about the claim that the majority of us can now expect to spend the last six years of our lives suffering prolonged ill health: \u201cFran found this statistic, true or false, infuriating. Longevity has&#xa0;fucked up our pensions, our work-life balance, our health services, our housing, our happiness.

  "<p>Born in a Jordanian refugee camp to Palestinian parents, Asma Aradeh is stateless. The 36-year-old mother of six is one of more than 30,000 Palestinian exiles living for decades in legal limbo in Jordan\u2019s Jerash camp. But there is one silver lining to Aradeh\u2019s story: she is no longer jobless.</p> <p>Three years ago, Aradeh became one of 40 women to join a fledgling social enterprise called <a href=\"http://sep-jordan.myshopify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEP Jordan</a>, which manufactures contemporary design products based on traditional Palestinian embroidery.

There are no firm working times, although SEP doesn\u2019t allow women to work more than four hours a day, to protect their eyesight.<br></p> <p>Embroidery is labour-intensive. A tablecloth takes eight months to complete on average. At the women\u2019s request, payment is calculated by the amount of thread used rather than hours worked. Ventura insists the approach ensures a dignified wage, although incomes vary according to how much work each woman chooses to do. \u201cThe monthly income for the artists can vary from as little as 5 Jordanian dinar (\u00a35.77) to as much as 400 Jordanian dinar (\u00a3461), which compares to a minimum wage of 190 dinar in Jordan\u2019s garment sector,\u201d she says.</p> <p>SEP is operating in an environment where employment opportunities are highly restricted. Refugees in Jordan are not permitted to work as teachers, civil servants or any other state-supported job, with the tourism business closed to them as well. So, too, is free schooling after grade 9 (aged 16), which denies most the chance to get their high school diploma \u2013 a ticket into the formal labour market.</p> <p>Running a viable business in a refugee camp is no easy task, Ventura concedes. For many women in the camp, simply persuading their husbands to allow them to work can represent a cultural challenge. Technological literacy is also low, so SEP\u2019s inventory and production processes remain largely un-computerised. </p> <p>An even bigger headache is red tape. All the fabric needed has to be imported but customs clearance procedures are \u201cbeyond nightmarish\u201d, says Venture. On top of that, courier companies frequently refuse to transport goods to and from the camp, deeming it too dangerous for their drivers. <br> </p> <p>Three years in and SEP\u2019s field team of five full-time staff plus a small management team in Geneva (which includes Ventura and her husband) have more or less navigated through the production challenges. Now Ventura\u2019s focus is shifting to boosting sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7de5e57231bdb16ac69e5f53d2ef7cad785a16d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7de5e57231bdb16ac69e5f53d2ef7cad785a16d/0_0_1280_854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidering material\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All the fabric needed has to be imported.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manal Sehaimat/CIIN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At present, its embroidered products \u2013 which range from clutches and linen shawls to Kuffyieh scarfs and tablecloths \u2013 can be found in boutiques in Paris, London, Geneva, Beirut, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Amman.

Hannah, a journalist, returns to Lebanon after a long exile, no longer certain if she will ever recapture the sense of belonging that Beirut once awarded her. </p> <p>These characters are not always sure what is missing from their lives, but they helped me understand that home can have different meanings for those of us who, at one time or another, are deprived of it. </p> <p><strong>1.<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/americanah.html\"> Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a></strong><br>The possibility that one can feel doubly exiled is at the centre of this novel. Ifemelu is an educated young woman who moves from her native Nigeria to the US, where she discovers that race continues to influence social status and compromise one\u2019s rights as a citizen. Not news to most of us, perhaps, but while Adichie\u2019s message is undoubtedly political, it is her focus on Ifemelu\u2019s day-to-day life in exile that makes this novel so compelling. At a dinner party in New York, Ifemelu tells a group of liberal intellectuals that her race had never been an issue in Nigeria, concluding: \u201cI only became black when I came to this country.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"http://www.saqibooks.co.uk/book/mai-ghoussoub/\">Selected Writings by Mai Ghoussoub</a></strong><br>If exile is an art form, then the late Mai Ghoussoub was its embodiment. Artist, writer, performer and publisher, Ghoussoub left Lebanon in 1979 after being injured while volunteering with an ambulance service during the civil war. Showcasing her musings on politics, war, exile and the arts, on Lebanon and the despair of its people, this collection is testament to a woman whose perspective was always led by her compassion and humour, by an enduring sense of wonder that makes her observations of people in the Middle East and Europe intensely valuable.<br></p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brooklyn-336804.html\">Brooklyn by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn</a></strong><br>Beset by homesickness as an Irish immigrant to the US, Eilis Lacey manages to fashion a new and more sophisticated version of herself there which, once she returns home for a visit, is impossible to shake. This is a haunting depiction of what it means to reinvent oneself and permanently suffer the loss of belonging. T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s writing is austere and seemingly effortless, and is evocative of the depth of loneliness plaguing his characters, no matter where they happen to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/top-10-refugees-stories\">Top 10 refugees' stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/portrait-of-a-lady-11.html\">The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James</a></strong><br>Isabel Archer and her suitor Gilbert Osmond are Americans living in Europe. While Isabel, a spirited, outspoken and innocent young heiress, can never be tainted by European decadence, Osmond is portrayed as the personification of old-world guile, cynicism and self-interest. Realising the truth about Osmond only after they are married, Isabel nonetheless remains true to character and chooses to honour her commitment to him. The desolation she consequently feels is not merely at being away from home, but is in the absence in her life of love and ultimately of any meaning. My favourite James novel.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/snow-13.html\">Snow by Orhan Pamuk</a> (translated by Maureen Freely)</strong><br>Great writers perfectly mirror the historical concerns of nations in their fiction, making Snow essential reading for anyone wishing to truly understand modern-day Turkey. Tackling religion, secularism, dissent and women in Islam, this intensely beautiful novel is also a story of love and sacrifice. The poet Ka returns to a virtually unrecognisable Istanbul after 12 years as a political exile in Germany, and decides to travel to the remote city of Kars to try to recapture memories of the Turkey he once knew. While investigating the rise of Islamic extremism and the bafflingly high suicide rates among young women there, he encounters a long-lost love and discovers that the notion of home he had harboured was illusory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31fbc7c1833b7ffd00ea384c71a3f4353e130801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31fbc7c1833b7ffd00ea384c71a3f4353e130801/0_46_2046_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Kidman as Isabel Archer in Jane Campion\u2019s film of The Portrait of a Lady.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Divided life \u2026 Nicole Kidman as Isabel Archer in Jane Campion\u2019s film of The Portrait of a Lady.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview32\">I Saw Ramallah by Mourid Barghouti</a> (translated by Ahdaf Soueif)</strong><br>Barghouti returned to Ramallah after 30 years in exile, initially to Cairo in 1967 following Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, then to Eastern Europe 10 years later when he was expelled from Egypt. A poet and diplomat, Barghouti made the emotional journey back home only to discover how much it had changed, to conclude that Israel\u2019s occupation had \u201ccreated generations without a place \u2026 had succeeded in changing us from children of Palestine to children of the idea of Palestine\u201d. Lyrical and deeply moving, this memoir explores the human consequences of enforced exile, the hopelessness, the suffering endured.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unaccustomed-earth.html\">Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri</a></strong><br>These stories are so beautifully written that one would be forgiven for thinking there was a romantic aspect to exile. First-generation Americans coping with double lives, Lahiri\u2019s characters are inextricably tied to their parents\u2019 India yet are not quite western enough to integrate completely. Images of their daily lives are poignant; a relentless dislocation making any semblance of continuity an illusion to which they will always aspire. Heartbreaking and wonderful.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cciEJsZG59U\">Arab in America by Toufic El Rassi</a></strong><br>The attacks in September 2001 had enormous repercussions on life in the US, among them the intensification of discrimination against Arabs and Americans of Arab descent. Exposing the brutal consequences of racism and fearmongering, El Rassi\u2019s graphic novel is fittingly illustrated in black and white and offers a unique perspective on the prejudices that still divide our world.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/me-talk-pretty-one-day.html\">Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris</a></strong><br>Sedaris\u2019s hilarious reflections on what it means to be an American expat in Europe reveal the lighter side of the exile experience. The second half of Me Talk Pretty One Day is devoted to the years Sedaris spent in Paris trying to learn the language and adapt to the culture and, as a result, finding out what the rest of the world really thinks about his country.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/brennanc/poetry/wanderer.html\">The Wanderer by Christopher Brennan</a></strong><br>On a plaque on the walkway leading to the Sydney Opera House is a quote that, when I first read it, perfectly expressed my own despair at ever achieving a sense of belonging. In this stunning collection of poems, Brennan, the son of Irish immigrants to Australia, reflects on the repercussions of emotional and spiritual exile, suggesting that its consequences are profound even when it is self-imposed and is not tied to place. The plaque reads:</p> <p><em>I know I am the wanderer of the ways of all the worlds,<br></em><em>to whom the sunshine and the rain are one<br></em><em>and one to stay or hasten, because he knows<br></em><em>no ending of the way, no home, no goal</em></p> <p>\u2022 An Unsafe Haven by Nada Awar Jarrar is published by Borough Press, priced \u00a312.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unsafe-haven.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop, priced \u00a310.65</a>.<br></p>",

  "<p>I realised it only after having done it. On Tuesday I was watching my kids playing with other children in a London park. I was about to call out to them when I intuitively caught myself. Having lived here for most of their life, my children speak flawless English. I, however, have a clear Dutch accent.

This was genuinely important work for genuinely needy people \u2013 and yet it was often disrupted by the corruption of the political class, who would, one way or another, find a way of getting their hands on the money. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9c2f164649feb99fd4a15d6e3deca958c5215dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9c2f164649feb99fd4a15d6e3deca958c5215dc/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Kyrgyz man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide electricity, mainly for light bulbs and radios, Wakhan, Afghanistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kyrgyz man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide electricity, mainly for light bulbs and radios, Wakhan, Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthieu Paley/Getty Images/National Geographic Magazines</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And where was the money was coming from? It came from the pockets of the taxpayers in EU, UK, US, Canada, and Australia.</p> <p>I have since left Afghanistan, but I was recently reminded of my former life when European leaders gathered in Brussels to give $3bn (\u00a32.45bn) to Afghanistan. The UK alone announced \u00a3750m in aid for the coming three years. As a former government official, and a former UN staffer in Afghanistan, I have concerns about how this money will be spent. What safeguards are in place to ensure that the money benefits Afghans? Will a farmer in a remote village benefit from these donations after they seep through various corrupted layers of government? Will it help a deported asylum seeker to build a new life? I worry that Europe has given the Afghan government a blank cheque.</p> <p>The current political elite in Afghanistan took power 15 years ago after international coalition forces toppled the Taliban regime. Since then, the world has poured hundreds of billions of dollars to Afghanistan. Most of what was pledged was meant to bring peace, stability, build and rebuild institutions that would work for all Afghans after so many years of wars and devastation. Instead, much of that money has been wasted. You could even argue that the dangers posed by Isis and the Taliban, who now control more land than at any point since the <a>2001 western</a> intervention, are ultimately less damaging than the country\u2019s corruption.</p> <p>Afghanistan was ranked 166 out of 168 countries on <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015\">Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception 2015 index</a>. Government has often become a self-serving means of enriching the political class. Several politicians have built up business empires that overshadow any attempts to bring about positive change to people\u2019s lives. The political elites have ethnocentric agendas, exacerbate tribal rivalries and political intolerance, erode political will, and increase impunity for the powerful.</p> <p>The donor community has allowed this dynamic to emerge. Donors do highlight Afghanistan\u2019s corruption epidemic. But they never link their aid to any kind of genuinely effective scrutiny, and as result they have ultimately failed to hold the Afghan government to account for how they spend the donors\u2019 money.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/kabul-bank-afghanistan-financial-scandal\">Kabul Bank scandal </a>was an obvious example. It saw $850m (\u00a3700m) lost to fraud at Afghanistan\u2019s biggest bank, and was described by US officials as \u201cthe biggest per capita fraud in history\u201d. The bank\u2019s shareholders were mostly from the country\u2019s political elite, and included cabinet ministers, MPs, and warlords. The bank\u2019s executives spent $160m (\u00a3130m) alone on 35 luxury villas in Dubai, many of which were registered in the names of shareholders. But those to blame for this massive money laundering have ultimately proved untouchable. Khalilullah Ferozi, the former executive of the bank, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21666689\">sentenced</a> to five years in prison. But last year he was released in order to sign a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/afghan-government-signs-huge-property-deal-shamed-ex-banker\">multimillion property deal</a> with the Afghan government. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59ff97997291c7a927f7d2fc04b65d906f22784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59ff97997291c7a927f7d2fc04b65d906f22784/0_0_3381_2476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan man prepares tea for refugees displaced by Kunduz fighting between Afghan forces and Taliban insurgents, at a makeshift camp in the outskirts of Kabul.

Since corruption goes unpunished Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders, and insurgents have fed off this disappointment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This kind of corruption indirectly exacerbates Afghanistan\u2019s conflict. Since corruption consistently goes unpunished, Afghans feel betrayed by their leaders \u2013 and insurgents have in turn fed off this widespread sense of disappointment. The enemy sees a vacuum to fill. Just last week, Taliban insurgents attacked Kunduz \u2013 the last stronghold lost by the Taliban in 2001. This is the second time in two months that the Taliban have attacked Kunduz \u2013 they first briefly seized it last August.</p> <p>Despite all this, Europe\u2019s aid is only conditional on Afghanistan agreeing to re-admit all refugees deported from Europe. This is a condition that will do nothing to stop corruption, and do everything to endanger ordinary Afghans, who will be sent back to a war zone. According to the recent <a href=\"http://unama.unmissions.org/afghanistan-record-level-civilian-casualties-sustained-first-half-2016-un-report\">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> report on Afghanistan, 5,166 civilians were killed during just the first six months of this year. And between 2009 and June 2016, civilian casualties reached 63,934. Another report shows that half of Afghanistan\u2019s territory experiences war and violence on a daily basis.</p> <p>So shouldn\u2019t Europe\u2019s aid be conditional on something other than deportations? The money will definitely be wasted unless donor countries encourage the Afghan government to implement a real anti-corruption strategy that is supported by law. It must be conditional on fighting corruption \u2013 and the Afghan government should also show the political will to end impunity for corrupt officials. In order to create an effective and transparent government in Kabul, the donors who pledge their taxpayers\u2019 money should draw specific red lines for spending this pledged money. Otherwise, these cheques will be as blank as they have been in the past.</p>",
  "<p>Democracy is often on a collision course with economic elites, sometimes in less subtle ways than others. Spain\u2019s current plight is one such example. Last month, the country\u2019s Socialist leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/pedro-sanchez-resigns-as-leader-of-spains-socialist-party\">Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a> was toppled in a party coup, paving the way for his fellow MPs to abstain in a vote to allow the conservative Mariano Rajoy to resume office. For many traditional Socialist voters, Rajoy\u2019s Popular party is the political wing of a venal, corrupt right-wing establishment: allowing them to form a minority government was an act of betrayal. But S\u00e1nchez\u2019s subsequent revelations exposed the machinations of powerful Spanish interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/what-happened-spain-socialist-workers-party-like-labour\">What\u2019s happened to Spain\u2019s socialist party?

His ambition had been to form a government alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\">Podemos</a> \u2013 a recently formed party that emerged from movements protesting against cuts that have devastated Spanish society \u2013 and backed by Catalan nationalists.</p> <p>But this week, S\u00e1nchez revealed that he was blocked by powerful corporations, including banks and Spanish telecoms giant Telef\u00f3nica. These interests run El Pa\u00eds, the country\u2019s largest newspaper. Unless S\u00e1nchez allowed Rajoy to return to power, or accepted a new round of elections, El Pa\u00eds would launch a vicious campaign against S\u00e1nchez. A coalition with Podemos was simply intolerable.</p> <p>Here was direct interference in Spanish democracy by unaccountable vested interests to stop a progressive government taking power. \u201cS\u00e1nchez has recognised the pressure of the oligarchic powers and that it was a mistake not seeking an agreement with us,\u201d says Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52b5b187bf4c1807ecc28dabdbf8a54e6cede2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b5b187bf4c1807ecc28dabdbf8a54e6cede2ce/0_66_4460_2676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro S\u00e1nchez: \u2018A man riven with regret.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro S\u00e1nchez: \u2018A man riven with regret.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, S\u00e1nchez is a man riven with regret. He had attempted to form an alliance with the centre-right Citizens\u2019 party \u2013 another beneficiary of the implosion of the two-party system. But it was all a ruse: Podemos was asked to back such an alliance, even though it meant signing up to rightwing economic policies that would have been impossible to accept. It was nothing more than an attempt to blame Podemos for preventing Rajoy\u2019s return to power.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s Socialists are now in a terrible situation. Their grassroots are alienated, while the triumphant conservatives know they can coerce the Socialists to back their regressive budgets, threatening a snap election that would decimate their rivals if they refused. The Spanish Socialists were already halfway to suffering the fate of their Greek sister party, Pasok, which so alienated its natural supporters that they defected en masse to Syriza. The Catalan socialists are enraged by the party leadership\u2019s actions, and could even split. Podemos can now position itself as the real opposition. But that is of little comfort to Podemos\u2019 base, who could now endure years more of a conservative government that they had every hope of overturning.</p> <p>What is happening in Spain is revealing about events far beyond the country\u2019s borders. In Britain, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s internal opponents quite legitimately point to the Labour party\u2019s abysmal poll ratings. It says much about the state of European social democracy that Labour\u2019s polling is higher than almost all of its sister parties across the Channel. When Tony Blair won his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/08/uk.electionspast\">landslide 1997 victory</a>, social democrats were on the march across the European continent, including in Germany, France, Italy and Scandinavia.</p> <p>Today\u2019s social democratic parties are haemorrhaging support to the new left, the populist right and civic nationalism. The German social democratic leadership may be committed to the sort of \u201cthird way\u201d politics some would like Labour to adopt, but in the latest poll they languish at 22%. The French Socialists face being beaten by the far-right Front National in the first round of next year\u2019s presidential elections. Sweden\u2019s social democrats hang on to power by their fingernails, while their Nordic allies are exiled from power. Italy\u2019s centre left is a rare exception, but its only hold on power is precarious and challenged by the rise of the populist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\">Five Star Movement</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9811f74123743d410703718916455994252608f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9811f74123743d410703718916455994252608f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May 2012: demonstrators in Barcelona mark the anniversary of the beginning of the \u2018indignados\u2019 movement in Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May 2012: demonstrators in Barcelona mark the anniversary of the beginning of the \u2018indignados\u2019 movement in Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The core base of European social democratic parties has fragmented: between younger and older voters; university-educated and working-class voters in small towns; between those hostile to immigration and those who are not. The fury exchanged between centre-left and radical left forces across Europe is, all too often, a deflection from an uncomfortable truth: that neither has so far produced a convincing answer to how these multiple divisions can be straddled, and how a viable electoral coalition can be produced that would win power.</p> <p>It is frustration at unaccountable elites that produced Podemos in the first place: its whole narrative has been vindicated. Five years ago, millions of Spaniards who were disillusioned with the political establishment and determined to make it pay for a crisis not of their making mobilised across the country. Without these so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/15/spain-15-m-movement-activism\"><em>indignados</em></a>, Podemos and its allies would never have emerged as mass political forces. Podemos has much to teach other European leftists about how to communicate beyond traditional comfort zones. But Podemos\u2019 results in June\u2019s elections were disappointing: it had expected to eclipse the Socialists as the second party, and was traumatised when it failed to do so. In other local elections it routinely underperforms its opinion poll ratings. The party is now engaged in profound soul-searching, debating how to democratise the party\u2019s own internal structures to re-engage with the mass movements that produced it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/europe-centre-left-spain-socialist-party-leader-coup\">If Europe's centre-left clings to discredited ideas, it will die | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Podemos capitalises both on disillusionment with the Socialists and the Popular party, it could provide an example for the left across Europe. If it fails to do so, there could be terrible consequences across the continent. Rightwing populism is on the march, and it is making considerable inroads into working-class communities that traditionally opted for the left. If discontent continues to sweep the western world \u2013 or if there is another crash \u2013 then the populist right will be well placed to gain.</p> <p>The old social democratic model is crumbling, but there is no guarantee that progressive forces will fill the vacuum it leaves. In Poland, the left has effectively ceased to exist: politics is a debate between David Cameron-style liberal conservatives and rightwing populism. If the left fails, Polandisation beckons for European politics. No pressure, Spain: but Europe\u2019s future may depend on you.</p>",

Legal and ethics experts contacted by the Associated Press said the government lobbyist should be subject to the same ethics rules as rank-and-file state employees, which generally prohibit such double-dipping. A separate prohibition against moonlighting bans Indiana state employees from accepting outside employment or undertaking activities that are not compatible with their public duties, would impair their independence or judgment, or pose a likely conflict of interest.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said Pitcock is exempt from most such rules because the Pence administration treats Pitcock as an independent contractor. It considers his contract for \u201cprofessional services\u201d different than contracts for \u201cpersonal\u201d services, which treat contractors as employees.</p> <p>Pence defended the arrangement late Wednesday. \u201cThe arrangement that the state of Indiana has with a firm in Washington DC has been a great, great success for our state,\u201d he told television station KDVR in Denver in an interview. \u201cThat individual and his team have worked very effectively advocating Indiana\u2019s interest. But it\u2019s an individual firm, an individual contractor.\u201d</p> <p>Pence said there was no conflict of interest. \u201cHe\u2019s not a state employee and so he\u2019s entitled to have other clients and I\u2019m grateful to have his support and assistance for the state of Indiana,\u201d he said in the interview.</p> <p>Pitcock continues to collect monthly lobbying fees \u2013 a total of nearly $1m since Pence won election in 2012 and took office in 2013. Since August, after Pitcock also began working as Pence\u2019s policy director for the election, Trump\u2019s campaign has paid Pitcock\u2019s firm $32,374 for event consulting, according to the latest financial records from the Federal Election Commission. Pitcock told AP that he refunded to Trump\u2019s campaign $15,612, which he described as an overpayment caused by an accounting error.</p> <p>Pitcock said he was working diligently for both his employers and there was no conflict or violation of state employment rules.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy firm has a contract with the state of Indiana to perform certain duties related to federal affairs, including lobbying,\u201d Pitcock said in a statement. \u201cThose duties have been and continue to be performed fully and completely. I am not a state employee. My firm\u2019s contract with the state does not preclude working with other clients.</p> <p>\u201cThe Donald J Trump for President campaign engaged my firm for services related to federal policy for the vice-presidential nominee. There is no conflict in performing services for both clients.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581aa0c7e4b0d073c27d0e50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-03T02:28:37.238Z\">2.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Perhaps the Trump hotels are all booked out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/793999972840521728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump campaign announces they&#39;ll hold &quot;victory party&quot; on election night at...

An <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average of six different polls</a> shows that Clinton is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But there\u2019s still a lot of variation \u2013 one poll finds that Clinton is three points ahead, another finds that she is six points <em>behind </em>Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to Clinton\u2019s emails, before which her lead was already shrinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b2cb4ef2ea7948f9e4f887bec8e8776aa309df/0_101_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polling station worker helps a woman as she votes during early voting in Chicago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That variation between polls isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For example, the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national support, includes one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html\">19-year-old black male</a> respondent who consistently said he\u2019ll vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jun/01/political-polls-bad-for-democracy-heres-why-video\">weighting</a> (where one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of voters).</p> <p>So, are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election day? Historically, the answer is \u201cnot bad\u201d, although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 November rather than now. Clinton\u2019s email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an \u201c<a href=\"http://politicaldictionary.com/words/october-surprise/\">October surprise</a>\u201d, a last-minute news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/october-surprises-dont-necessarily-sway-elections-or-occur-in-october.html\">which have included Lyndon Johnson\u2019s announcement of a halt in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1968, and the news of a drunk-driving charge for George W Bush in 2000</a> \u2013 typically don\u2019t affect final outcomes all that much though, as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome.</p> <p>The only snag is the electoral college system. In 2000, it wasn\u2019t just ABC and the Washington Post that predicted a Bush win \u2013 polling averages also showed the Republican <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-october-surprises-move-the-polls/\">three points</a> ahead of Al Gore. Though both candidates ended up with 48% of the popular vote, that\u2019s only after rounding. The actual result was Gore-Bush, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&amp;year=2000\">48.4%-47.9%</a>. Bush ultimately became president because the distribution of those votes worked in his favour \u2013 he collected 271 of the 538 electoral college votes (270 are needed to win).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/election-polls-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-october-surprise\">Clinton's 'October surprise' helps Trump in polls \u2013 but will it affect election day?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a672ce4b07ceadb3a1cbb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicky-woolf\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T22:23:12.872Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A white nationalist has apologized for robocalls in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah\">Utah</a> calling independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin a \u201ccloset homosexual\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbaf826e0a147ea78e74a9ab5880fa57afb67f7c/0_0_4800_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan McMullin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evan McMullin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>William Daniel Johnson is a Los Angeles-based lawyer and self-described white nationalist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">originally meant to be a delegate for Donald Trump</a> at the Republican national convention.</p> <p>On Monday, Johnson announced that he was putting out an automated call to Utah voters attacking McMullin, an independent conservative candidate who has become the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/independent-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-leads-in-utah--new-poll.html\">unexpected frontrunner</a> in the heavily Mormon state, according to recent polls.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is William Johnson.

The set is minimal and the direction, by Leonard Foglia, almost invisible. Interstitial sound and video give Smith just enough time to don a blazer or a pair of waders and vanish into the next character. </p> <p>This is one of Smith\u2019s particular gifts, to disappear into the people she plays, to take an assemblage of interviews and recorded talks, and bring them to astonishing and visceral life onstage. She finds a distinct voice for each. Where other performers might edit out the pauses, digressions and paralinguistic utterances (the uhs and ums), she uses them to call forth the speaker. </p> <p>Her passionately argued point is that schools and institutions should provide support, encouragement and proper counseling to children, rather than typecasting their behavior as criminal and leaving the underlying issues (poverty, abuse, learning disabilities) unaddressed. </p> <p>Smith\u2019s greatest works, Fires in the Mirror and Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, use a multitude of voices with differing opinions to help artist and audience come to terms with one particular event. But Notes From the Field more resembles Smith\u2019s last work, Let Me Down Easy, as it is less divisive and less cohesive than it might be. </p> <p> Here, too many of the voices are of the same opinion, the exception being a discipline-minded and unsympathetic Student Concerns Specialist, who tellingly used to work in a prison. Perhaps those who favor punitive measures wouldn\u2019t speak to Smith, but the absence is felt, the conclusion to side against them too foregone. And Smith sometimes gets distracted, particularly by the death of Freddie Gray. At least one of the pieces related to Gray is almost impossibly moving, but his story relates tangentially, at best, to the pipeline theme. </p> <p> Smith isn\u2019t usually in the business of supplying answers. Her pieces more typically help audiences to ask better questions \u2013 about equality, about justice, about how we ought to treat one another. But here, she offers a remedy: \u201cSay something nice to just one kid.\u201d</p> <p> This call to empathy is perhaps a too simple solution, but especially when suggested with such hortatory force, it\u2019s worth a try.</p>",
