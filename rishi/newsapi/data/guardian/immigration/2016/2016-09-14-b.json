But what will define our country is not Pauline Hanson but what the rest of us do.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Caputo, the chairman of the Federation of Ethnic Communities\u2019 Councils of Australia, Joe Caputo, told Guardian Australia the speech was offensive, unfair, and unfactual. He cited the low proportion of the population who are Muslim to rebut Hanson\u2019s claim other Australians are \u201cswamped by Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>Caputo said migrants and others made a huge contribution to Australia\u2019s economic wellbeing, including international students consuming billions of dollars of education services.</p> <p>\u201cThe speech was populist, it was designed to rally people that are fearful, people that haven\u2019t got the [economic] means.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel that they have been left out of the changes that have come so far.

  "<p>First of all, I would like to welcome everyone in this house and thank you for your attendance. It is very much appreciated. When I cast my mind back to the last day on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1998, just prior to the election, I called out across the chamber, \u201cI will be back!\u201d Those around me cried out, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u2019\u201d </p> <p>My electorate boundaries were changed, forcing me to stand for the new seat of Blair. Also, with the introduction of full preferential voting, this cost me the seat. Although I polled 36% of the primary vote, this was not enough against the Liberals\u2019 21% and Labor\u2019s preferences, delivering them the seat.</p> <p>It has taken numerous elections, countless legal battles and doing a stint in maximum security on trumped-up charges \u2013 of which former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop stated I was Australia\u2019s first political prisoner \u2013 to find myself here. Some call it persistence and tenacity. My daughter describes it as a Johnny Farnham comeback. I call it standing up and fighting for what you believe in and not allowing the bastards to grind you down. So, to all my peers in this place and those from the past, I have two words for you: I\u2019m back \u2013 but not alone.</p> <p>I cannot begin to express the pride and honour I have in being joined in this place by three of my colleagues \u2013 Senator Malcolm Roberts, also representing Queensland; New South Wales senator Brian Burston; and Western Australian senator Rod Culleton \u2013 elected under Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. As a strong, united team I guarantee we will make a difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/comprehending-pauline-is-not-the-challenge-engaging-constructively-with-hansonism-is\">Comprehending Pauline is not the challenge. Engaging constructively with Hansonism is | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been 20 years and four days since I last delivered my first speech in this house, a speech that shook a nation, woke up many Australians and gave hope to those who thought no one was listening. That speech was relevant then and it is still relevant today. The problem is we have not had leaders with the foresight or the intestinal fortitude to cast aside political correctness. They have failed to discard old treaties and agreements that are not in our best interest and have signed new ones giving away our sovereignty, rights, jobs and democracy. Their push for globalisation, economic rationalism, free trade and ethnic diversity has seen our country\u2019s decline. This is due to foreign takeover of our land and assets, out-of-control debt, failing infrastructure, high unemployment or underemployment and the destruction of our farming sector. Indiscriminate immigration and aggressive multiculturalism have caused crime to escalate and trust and social cohesion to decline. Too many Australians are afraid to walk alone at night in their neighbourhoods. Too many of us live in fear of terrorism.</p> <p>In my first speech in 1996 I said we were in danger of being swamped by Asians. This was not said out of disrespect for Asians but was meant as a slap in the face to both the Liberal and Labor governments who opened the floodgates to immigration, targeting cultures purely for the vote, as expressed by former Labor minister Barry Jones \u2013 to such an extent that society changed too rapidly due to migrants coming in the front door but also the back door, via New Zealand. Now we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims, who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own.</p> <p>I love my country, culture and way of life. My pride and patriotism were instilled in me from an early age when I watched the Australian flag raised every morning at school and sang the national anthem; watching our athletes compete on the world stage, proud to salute the Australian flag being raised to honour them as they took their place on podiums. It is about belonging, respect and commitment to fight for Australia. This will never be traded or given up for the mantras of diversity or tolerance. Australia had a national identity before federation, and it had nothing to do with diversity and everything to do with belonging. Tolerance has to be shown by those who come to this country for a new way of life. If you are not prepared to become Australian and give this country your undivided loyalty, obey our laws, respect our culture and way of life, then I suggest you go back where you came from. If it would be any help, I will take you to the airport and wave you goodbye with sincere best wishes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/10/pauline-hanson-is-back-and-its-still-just-as-hard-to-counter-her-rhetoric-with-facts\">Pauline Hanson is back, and it's still just as hard to counter her rhetoric with facts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is predominantly a Christian country, but our government is secular. Our Constitution prevents governments from imposing religious rule and teachings. The separation of church and state has become an essential component of our way of life, and anything that threatens that separation threatens our freedom. Australia has embraced migrants from all different races, making us one of the most multiracial nations on earth. Most have assimilated and are proud to call themselves Australians, accepting our culture, beliefs and laws. I welcome them from the bottom of my heart. As they integrate and assimilate, the disruption caused by diversity diminishes.</p> <p>Why then has Islam and its teachings had such an impact on Australia like no other religion? Islam sees itself as a theocracy. Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion. It regulates Muslims\u2019 social and domestic life, their legal system and politics \u2013 their total life.</p> <p>Australia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominantly Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalise inmates. Muslims are imprisoned at almost three times the average rate. The rate of unemployed and public dependency is two to three times greater than the national average. Muslims are prominent in organised crime, with associated violence and drug dealing. Antisocial behaviour is rampant, fuelled by hyper-masculine and misogynist culture. Multiple social surveys find that neighbourhoods of Muslim settlement are suffering from collapsing social cohesion and fear of crime. Australians, in general, are more fearful.</p> <p>Not only is terrorism seen around the world but it is now part of our society, with Muslim refugees involved in the Lindt cafe siege, the Curtis Cheng murder in Sydney and the stabbing of the two police officers in Melbourne. The grand mufti and other Muslim leaders are deafening with their silence, or lack of sympathy. Radicalisation is happening on our streets, in our suburbs and mosques. Yet, our leaders continue to tell us to be tolerant and embrace the good Muslims. But how should we tell the difference? There is no sign saying \u201cgood Muslim\u201d or \u201cbad Muslim\u201d. How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?</p> <p>Many more Australian Muslims have volunteered, or have tried to volunteer, to fight for Isis than we have in our own defence force. Asio has over 509 terrorist suspects under surveillance. Civil tension is on the rise across the country, led by Australians feeling the impact of Islam in their lives and a distaste for its beliefs. Their tolerance to our customs has seen Christmas carols no longer sung at some schools and Bibles not to be found in most hospitals. Some public swimming baths have times set aside for Muslim women only, and drivers licences are obtained by Muslim women wearing the burqa and niqab. Prayer rooms are now provided in universities, hospitals, schools, airports and shopping centres to accommodate Muslims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/forget-one-nation-cory-bernardi-is-the-politician-to-watch\">Cory Bernardi is more dangerous than One Nation \u2013 his party is in power | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halal certification tax has been forced upon us, costing Australians approximately $10m a year. Halal certification is not a religious requirement but a moneymaking racket, and certification is unnecessary for Muslims\u2019 welfare because non-halal products can be consumed, provided the word \u201cBismillah\u201d is said over the food and a prayer is recited. Muslims want to see sharia law introduced in Australia. This law is a totalitarian civil code which prescribes harsh feudal rules imposed on everything, firstly for Muslims, later for everyone. As long as Islam is considered a religion, sharia conflicts with our secular state.</p> <p>Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular and cohesive society. Never before in Australia\u2019s history have we seen civil unrest and terror associated with a so-called religion, or from followers of that faith. We have seen the destruction that it is causing around the world. If we do not make changes now, there will be no hope in the future. Have no doubt that we will be living under sharia law and treated as second-class citizens with second-class rights if we keep heading down the path with the attitude, \u2018She\u2019ll be right, mate.\u2019</p> <p>Therefore, I call for stopping further Muslim immigration and banning the burqa, as they have done in many countries around the world. Burqas are not a religious requirement. Most Australians find them confronting, as did two of our former prime ministers. I am sure a lot of the women forced to wear them would love to cast them aside but live in fear to do so. In addition, no more mosques or schools should be built, and those that already exist should be monitored with regard to what they are teaching until the present crisis is over. Sharia law should not be acknowledged or allowed. And Australian companies should be banned from paying for halal certification.</p> <p>Australians have never been permitted to vote on immigration and multiculturalism. When have we been asked or consulted about our population? We reached a population of 24 million this year, 17 years ahead of prediction. Governments have continually brought in high levels of immigration, so they say, to stimulate the economy. This is rubbish. The economy is stimulated by funding infrastructure projects, creating employment. What major projects have we had in this country for the past 30 years? How many dams have we built in the past 50 years? </p> <p>The only stimulation that is happening is welfare handouts \u2013 many going to migrants unable to get jobs. At present, our immigration intake is 190,000 a year. High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business, seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation. The unemployment queues grow longer \u2013 and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants.</p> <p>Our city roads have become parking lots. Schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves. And many cities and towns struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope, due to a lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments, both state and federal, have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. I call for a halt to further immigration and for government to first look after our aged, the sick and the helpless.</p> <p>Foreign investment and foreign ownership are great concerns. The government finally released its register of foreign ownership, which reveals that foreign interests owned 13.6% of Australia\u2019s farmland. That is 52m hectares. It includes 30% of the Northern Territory\u2019s farmland and 22% of Tasmania\u2019s. The register fails to show the quality of the foreign-owned land. Is it the jewels in the nation\u2019s agricultural crown? Let\u2019s have a register on all land owned by foreigners, including non-agricultural land and housing. </p> <p>And why is there no information on who owns our country\u2019s vital irrigation and water assets, despite this being promised? The registry is a disgrace. It makes me wonder whose interests this government is serving. Australia needs a national government, not a corporate one, not a union one, and not an alternative lifestyle one. Any foreign ownership is regrettable, but why are we allowing the Chinese government, an oppressive communist regime, to own our land and assets? Why are we allowing our ports, utilities, services, agricultural land and industries, to be acquired by foreigners of any nationality?</p> <p>It is foolhardy to sell our water, agricultural land \u2013 our food source \u2013 essential services and ports. This is not in Australia\u2019s national or security interests. This foreign takeover is destroying small towns across the nation. A farm once the home of an Australian family is now run by a manager. People move, less money is spent, schools lose students and then the town starts to die. Now these foreign-owned properties become food bowls for their own countries. Tax is avoided, or very little paid, because they go straight from paddock to plate. Transfer pricing, which involves minimising taxation by artificially charging high prices or operating costs to subsidiaries in Australia, and other forms of tax minimisation, are a certainty.</p> <p>Housing is beyond the dreams of ordinary Australians. Why? Because they cannot afford to buy, due to foreign investors driving up prices. Officially, foreigners can only buy new housing, but this is not policed. If the Liberal party wants a pat on the back for having reduced the purchase price to $15m before it has to go to the foreign investment review board, they will not get it from me. I intend to give them a kick up the backside. Australians have given their lives protecting this great land from foreign takeover. I can guarantee most did not want to go to war but knew it was their duty to ensure their loved ones lived in peace. But, more importantly, they fought for freedom.</p> <p>I want Australian land, houses and companies to remain locally owned, and I believe I speak for the majority of Australians. Our land and assets are not for sale. Governments are only caretakers of our assets. No contract has been signed giving them permission to sell them. If they cannot rein in the budget with overpaid public servants \u2013 one being the head of Australia Post, who is on $4.8m per year \u2013 foreign aid, welfare fraud, politicians lurks and perks, including former prime ministers, and backroom deals for government jobs, then get out of the job of running this country. I warn this government and future governments: you never miss the water till the well runs dry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/its-good-to-catch-up-pauline-hanson-and-tony-abbott-bury-the-hatchet\">'It's good to catch up': Pauline Hanson and Tony Abbott bury the hatchet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia\u2019s federal gross debt is currently $499bn. Our interest payments are over $43.5m a day. Out-of-control government spending, mismanagement of taxpayers\u2019 dollars, multinationals not paying their fair share of tax and welfare that was introduced to provide for the aged and sick, or as a helping hand for those going through tough times, has now become a way of life for some and is abused and rorted by others. Welfare costs the Australian taxpayer approximately $158bn a year and this is expected to rise to $191bn by 2019-20. Nearly one half of our budget is spent on welfare. This is out of control and must be reined in.</p> <p>Farmers are screaming out for workers and small businesses have difficulty in finding people who want to work. Welfare is not a right, unless you are aged or sick. It is a privilege paid for by hard-working Australians. I support the government in wanting to stop school leavers going immediately on to welfare. What message are we sending them? Teach them how to apply for a job, rather than encouraging them to become dependent on money they have neither earned nor worked for. Then we have the single mums having more children just to maintain their welfare payments, and Muslim men marrying multiple wives, under their laws, then having multiple children at our expense while they collect thousands of dollars a week from the taxpayer. How many have ever held a job? Why would anyone want to work when welfare is so very lucrative? If people bring children into the world, it is their responsibility not the taxpayers\u2019. Therefore, I propose that if a woman has a child, the taxpayer will support the first child, but, if they have more, there will be no increase to the welfare payment. Get a job and start taking responsibility for your own actions.</p> <p>Not only are we facing a crisis with welfare but also with our health budget. It also is being scammed, abused and rorted and is costing taxpayers billions. The healthcare card has no identification on it, just a name and number. Anyone can, and does, take another person\u2019s card when visiting a doctor, especially those who bulk bill. Prescriptions are collected at a cost to the taxpayer, if the cardholder is on welfare. Overseas tourists, illegals and those not entitled to Medicare use their family\u2019s card or a friend\u2019s card. Let me give an example. When one tourist visiting family fell sick, he went to the doctor and used his cousin\u2019s Medicare card. He ended up in hospital and died. The owner of the card had to admit it was not he. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask. Well, he just had to pay the hospital bill.<br></p> <p>We have to stop the rorts, mismanagement and abuse of our taxpayer-funded services, whether it be welfare, health or education. If you want to access these services then apply for an Australian identity card. You must prove you are entitled to apply for the card on a points system. There should not be any complaints because applying for a $30 phone plan is the same. So I will not accept do gooders complaining about people\u2019s privacy. The card will have an identification chip, a photo and electronic fingerprint. If we are ever going to pull back our deficit we must stop the thieves. If you are not prepared to apply for the card, that is your choice, but expect to pay full price for doctors and prescriptions, and no more welfare handouts will be coming your way.</p> <p>Family law would be the most discriminatory, biased and unworkable policy in this country. I referred to it in my maiden speech 20 years ago and still nothing has changed \u2013 if anything, it is worse. As a nation, we should hang our heads in shame when, on average, three men, and occasionally a woman, suicide a day due to family breakdowns. The whole system is unworkable and is in desperate need of change. Children are used as pawns in custody battles where women make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to the children. Children have two parents and, until we treat mums and dads with the same courtesy and rights, we will continue to see murders due to sheer frustration and depression and mental illness caused by this unworkable system. Suicide is the only way out for those who feel there is no hope after facing years of costly legal battles. Their lives having been destroyed and the pain of missing their children are the reasons many end up in a state of depression caused by the trauma and in some cases the blatant vindictiveness from former partners.</p> <p>Child support is another contentious issue and should be revised. Some parents are left caring and providing for children without any financial help from the other parent. Others refuse to work so they do not have to pay child support. The system needs to be balanced, taking in the age of the child on a sliding scale and both parents\u2019 incomes should be taken into account. Non-custodial parents find it hard to restart their lives, with excessive child support payments that see their former partners live a very comfortable life. Make it fair with both custody and child support and most parents will gladly take on their responsibility.</p> <p>I ask all parents: is it worth the pain and anguish to deny your child the love they so deserve from both parents? They are only children for such a short time and all children need both parents. Please put your differences aside, make your peace and come to agreements outside of law courts. The only ones to gain are the legal professions, who are rubbing their hands together watching the thousands of dollars coming their way. Is it worth losing the family home? Is it worth the grief it brings not only to you but also to your extended families, not to mention the children? At the end of the day, the answer is no. I speak from experience not only as a mum myself but also as a grandmother.</p> <p>I am not going to do a Derryn Hinch and speak for 45 minutes \u2013 oh, he\u2019s still awake! I have a lot more to say but I have six years in this place \u2013 Derryn, sorry, you only have three \u2013 so there will be plenty of time. Oh, I can feel the Greens cringing \u2013 no, they have left \u2013 and squirming in their seats at the thought that I could possibly be here for six years.</p> <p>In closing, I will finish on this note: very few of us ever travel a journey alone and nor should we. Our loved ones and friends we have accumulated along the way are an integral part of who we are. Three of my children are here today. They have been with me every step of the way sharing my triumphs and battles, my high points and the lowest in my life. I did not know my life was going to be such a rollercoaster of a ride. I love you with all my heart. But I hate to tell you guys: it\u2019s not over yet; buckle up.</p> <p>There are those who kept the political party I launched in 1997 alive for 13 years after I left in 2002 till I came back in November 2014. Special thanks to Ian Nelsen for never giving up and for asking me to come back and lead the party. James Ashby is a man I have the utmost respect and admiration for. Like myself, the establishment has also kicked him about unfairly. Your dedication and hard work beside me added up to the clincher that not only saw me win my seat but also saw the other senators win their seats. With deep appreciation and sincerity, thank you.</p> <p>Thanks to Sarah Beric. You took on a task unbeknown to you, from performing as a professional violinist to running a political office and campaigns. You have been invaluable. A couple of strangers came along at the right time, helped me spread my wings and gave me the support and assistance I needed that now see me standing on this floor today. These people are no longer strangers but dear friends, welcome at home any time for another lamb roast. Thank you, Bill and Renatta.</p> <p>As I said earlier, I was imprisoned in 2003 for three years, held in maximum security on electoral fraud charges. My sentence was quashed on appeal after 11 weeks. If it were not for my sister Judy and brother Peter fighting for my freedom and justice \u2013and Alan Jones, along with approximately 90% of Australians who believed I was wrongly imprisoned \u2013 I would have been behind bars for three years. My father always said, \u201cPolitics is a dirty game.\u201d </p> <p>I was one of seven children and the quiet one of the family \u2013 believe it or not! Believe me: you are lucky to have me here and not the rest of the Seccombe clan. We come from a breed of Australians who were taught values, morals, honesty, work ethic and common sense \u2013 things very much lacking today.</p> <p>I will never take my position as a senator in this place for granted and nor should I. To the people of Queensland and Australia who voted for me and my party: thank you. You have given me a great honour. Now it is up to me to prove my worth to you. I can guarantee Pauline Hanson is a name that carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability \u2013 things the Chinese can never buy. Also, halal snack packs are never provided \u2013 isn\u2019t that right, Sam?</p> <p>Mr President and my fellow senators: thank you for your indulgence. We may not agree on everything but we need to work together for the future of our country and its people. I look forward to working with each and every one of you, including the Greens, if you are prepared to see this country prosper rather than shut down.</p>",
  "<p>Balancing symbolism and substance has long accompanied the European project. The EU\u2019s star-studded flag as well as its choice of anthem (Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy) point to an era when federalist views once held sway. That era is gone. This week\u2019s informal summit in Bratislava \u2013 preceded, today, by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-16-3043_en.htm\" title=\"\">state of the union speech</a> before MEPs \u2013 is likely to be remembered for realism rather than idealism. Europe is struggling with so many crises that it is hard to dispute the need to get back to some basics \u2013 which means restoring public confidence in the EU\u2019s ability to deliver for citizens.</p> <p>Today\u2019s symbolism is crude enough: on Friday, just six months away from the ceremonies due to mark the 60th anniversary of the treaty of Rome, all but one of the EU\u2019s leaders will gather in Bratislava to take a long, hard look into the future. Not invited is the UK. The message, with regret, is that Europe is going one way, Britain is going another.</p> <p>For the EU 27 there are many unknowns \u2013 not least because losing Britain is a big blow. So it is no surprise Mr Juncker tried to boost morale by saying \u201cthe EU is not at risk since Brexit\u201d. But if the message is that Europe must not be written off, there is still the challenge of making sure it gets heard outside the offices of EU institutions and in the average citizen\u2019s home.</p> <p>Mr Juncker\u2019s proposals are wide-ranging, from a near doubling of an EU-wide investment plan, to deploying more border guards and enhancing anti-terrorism cooperation, as well as efforts towards common EU defence policies (which UK membership of the club has long impeded). It is unlikely any of this will lead to any significant announcements in Bratislava \u2013 if only because forging consensus takes time.</p> <p>Mr Juncker and others want to frame a more positive narrative for the EU, at a time when it is under severe attack from populist forces that have been buoyed by Brexit. It was striking that he insisted that nothing Europe does is meant to erode the nation state, nor is it meant to blend separate identities into a single homogeneous bloc.</p> <p>This may read like an overture to Poland\u2019s nationalist government, which had been criticised for backsliding on democratic norms. But it is not. Mr Juncker\u2019s point was about trying to bridge the differences that emerged last year over the vexed issue of refugee quotas. Next month Hungary is set to vote in a referendum on the quota scheme. A resounding <em>nem</em> is expected. That Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister has just suggested Hungary should be kicked out of the EU for its refugee policies will have done nothing to help restore a sense of unity.</p> <p>Some simplistically see Europe\u2019s dividing lines reduced to an east-west clash. The wider picture is that populist forces are on the upsurge almost everywhere, exerting significant pressure in the Netherlands, France and Germany, where key elections will be held next year. With this backdrop, there are now increasing calls for a more social Europe to emerge.</p> <p>Mr Juncker made that case, reminding Poland and other new member states along the way how much they benefit from EU funds sent to poorer regions. Increased investment plans are meant to favour growth and jobs. This is a welcome development and recognition that European economics are not just about deficits and austerity. There is backing from EU civil society, parts of which want to go further. <a href=\"http://www.youthforum.org/assets/2016/09/Common-statement-A-new-Europe-for-people-planet-and-Prosperity-for-all.pdf\" title=\"\">A group of 177 European NGOs and trade unions</a> wants more \u201csocial and sustainable\u201d policies aimed at defusing far-right politics. Adopting a degree of flexibility in interpreting eurozone deficit rules for Portugal and Spain helps cast Europe as pro-growth. Similar leniency should be considered to deal with looming problems in Greece and Italy.</p> <p>What Europe\u2019s annus horribilis \u2013 which ran from the refugee crisis to Brexit \u2013 has shown is the need for citizens to see the benefits they can draw from the EU. The question must be asked why political leaders do not highlight Europe\u2019s fight on behalf of ordinary citizens \u2013 for example, as when the commission forced Apple to repay a record-breaking \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) in back taxes. Instead, as Mr Juncker put it, all too often \u201csuccess is national, and failure European\u201d. Social and economic factors, along with security and a better sense of collective control in the face of globalisation, must surely be a key part of the EU\u2019s survival strategy.</p> <p>While Europe stares ahead, Britain remains entangled in our own uncertainties; outside but looking in.</p>",
  "<p>When the BBC decided two years ago to move the Great British Bake Off from BBC2 to BBC1, the programme\u2019s co-creator was not, initially, very keen. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Richard McKerrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/12/benefits-street-richard-mckerrow-channel-4\">told the Guardian</a> at the time, \u201cso my first instinct was \u2013 why do we have to move?\u201d</p> <p>Transferring to BBC1 did not, self-evidently, break <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\">Bake Off</a>, which instead rose perfectly to become the most beloved programme on British television.

While negotiations have been ongoing with the BBC over a new contract for more than a year, the relationship between the corporation and the production company has been strained for some years, following <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/secret-legal-row-damaged-the-bbc-talks-to-keep-great-british-bake-off-2016-9\">a dispute over a BBC production</a> called Hair in 2014, a contest to find the nation\u2019s best amateur hairdresser. </p> <p>Love accused the corporation of copying the Bake Off format and threatened to sue; the BBC swiftly conceded before proceedings were even issued and paid a settlement to the producer. </p> <p>A year later, Love accused the broadcaster of doing the same with The Big Painting Challenge, and specialist mediators had to be appointed to resolve the dispute.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to establish trust when this is happening to you,\u201d a source close to Love said on Wednesday, referring to \u201cthree years of bad blood\u201d, which culminated in a catastrophic relationship breakdown. Insiders insisted McKerrow and Beattie wanted to keep Bake Off at the BBC and fully expected to make the deal work. \u201cThey are very upright and very ethical,\u201d said the source. \u201cWhat they are used to is fantastic audiences and adulation and I think they are finding this very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first brush with controversy for McKerrow and Beattie, who set up Love Productions in 2004. After building a documentary and \u201cstructured reality\u201d roster that included Britain\u2019s Youngest Grannies, Famous, Rich and Homeless and Tower Block of Commons, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/12/benefits-street-review-kingston-road-chipping-norton\">sparked a furore in January 2014 with Benefits Street</a>, which portrayed life on a street where 90% of residents claimed benefits, but which was condemned by some as \u201cpoverty porn\u201d.</p> <p>A subsequent series, Immigration Street, was cut to one episode after Love\u2019s crew were confronted by protesters during filming.</p> <p>McKerrow told the Guardian at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I am actively looking to be controversial because I\u2019m not but I slightly think if you are not doing something that gets attention, then why do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRichard and Love have been one of the UK\u2019s most dynamic factual entertainment producers for well over a decade now,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.pact.co.uk/about-us/our-team.html\">John McVay, chief executive of Pact</a>, the trade body representing independent TV production companies. \u201cI think he has a real feel for getting under the skin of quite important topics, that engage and entertain. And if you look at Bake Off on the face of it is a cookery show but, like all television, it\u2019s about people.\u201d</p> <p>The couple met in 1999 while both were Channel 4 executives working on the first episode of Grand Designs. \u201cI looked at it and said this is a piece of crap,\u201d McKerrow has said. \u201cShe said \u2018it\u2019s not very good at the moment, but it could be brilliant\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> McKerrow, 53, is a former print journalist who also worked for the Nation in New York and Yorkshire Television. Beattie, five years younger, started her career as a runner with LWT and worked on Location, Location, Location and Ten Years Younger before co-founding Love, where, according to her biography, she has \u201cparticular responsibility for ideas\u201d.</p> <p>The Great British Bake Off, inspired, they have said, by the generosity of bakers at village fetes, was far from a hit at first, taking four years of persuasion (it was reportedly initially offered to Channel 4) before BBC2 finally took a bite. But the spectacular growth of the programme, particularly since its promotion to BBC1 in 2014, has vastly boosted the couple\u2019s fortunes. </p> <p>Later that year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/21/bskyb-purchase-great-british-bake-off-love-productions\">BSkyB bought a 70% stake in the firm</a> for a sum thought to be around \u00a325m. The couple still each own a 13.59% stake in the company, earning dividends of more than \u00a3466,000 each in the year to 2015, according to the company\u2019s accounts. An \u201cearn-out\u201d clause in the Sky deal is likely to yield significant payout in 2019, greatly enhanced by a multimillion-pound deal with Channel 4. </p> <p>McVay, who advised Love in the negotiations, said that independents often had no choice but to ask for greatly inflated fees from broadcasters, thanks to the spiralling cost of talent in a successful show \u2013 after successive pay rises, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/mary-berry\">Mary Berry</a> and Paul Hollywood are reportedly paid \u00a3600,000 each. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s all about a producer looking to make shitloads of money, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case. They were probably looking to cover some of their massively increased costs, and also to make a bit of a margin, and why not? They are a business not a charity.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Sooner or later it had to happen. A UK policymaker would find a way of comparing Britain\u2019s departure from the EU to a game of cricket.</p> <p>The only surprise was the source of the metaphor. Theresa May is a self-confessed cricket fan and cites Geoff Boycott as one of her heroes. John Major loved to slope off to the Oval whenever he had the chance. Mervyn King would lovingly drop a reference to cricket in his opening statements at inflation report press conferences.</p> <p>Instead, it fell to King\u2019s successor, Mark Carney, to draw the parallel between Brexit and the sound of leather on willow. An ice hockey goalie in his youth, and a keen runner to this day, the present boss at Threadneedle Street has taken a while to warm to the subtle nuances of cricket. Indeed, one of his early decisions was to axe the cricket game at the Bank\u2019s annual sports day because it was deemed too exclusive.</p> <p>But faced with the task of welcoming the West Indian legend Michael Holding to a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/onebank/seminars/2016/140916.aspx\">seminar at the Bank</a>, Carney was well padded-up. He knew Holding was known in his pomp as \u201cwhispering death\u201d and was part of a WI team that dominated the game in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br></p> <p>What\u2019s more, he found a new way of describing the process by which Britain would leave the EU. It was possible, Carney said, to think of the protracted negotiations as a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d. But in the end he had decided the cliche was not really appropriate. \u201cWe thought about that and actually you\u2019re more exhausted after the marathon than after the sprint so this is the wrong metaphor,\u201d Carney said. </p> <p>A more appropriate comparison, the governor averred, was between two forms of cricket: the Twenty20 format in which matches are won and lost within three hours, and a Test series in which games are scheduled to last for five days and can still end in a stalemate.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not T20,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThere\u2019s a narrative to this, it takes time, it takes strategy, it takes everyone in order to be as successful as possible to fulfill our mission to promote the good of the people of the UK and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>With that, Carney departed the crease, leaving the Bank\u2019s Yorkshire-born chief economist, Andy Haldane, to provide Holding with a few gentle long hops.</p>",

  "<p>An Old Bailey jury hearing allegations that a Birmingham man was trying to smuggle himself out of the UK to join Islamic State fighters in Syria is hearing secret evidence from a counter-terrorism officer.</p> <p>More than a week into the trial of Anas Abdalla, the court was told by the judge, Richard Marks QC, that the evidence being heard behind closed doors \u201cwill touch on matters of extreme sensitivity and of a confidential nature\u201d.</p> <p>The jury had been listening to DC Brett Bambury of the West Midlands police counter-terrorism unit, who was explaining how Abdalla was discovered in the back of a lorry in Dover last year when the case went \u201cin camera\u201d, excluding the media and public.</p> <p>The court has already heard that an attempt was allegedly made in January 2013 by MI5 to recruit Abdalla. He believed that if he did not respond positively, his life would be very difficult, the prosecutor, Duncan Atkinson QC, has told the jury.</p> <p>The secret evidence session relates to the defendant\u2019s defence. Abdalla, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, claims he was fleeing Britain because he was being \u201charassed and subject to oppressive treatment\u201d by MI5.</p> <p>The 26-year-old was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and first came to the UK as an asylum seeker. He denies the charge of preparing acts of terrorism under section 5(1) of the 2006 Terrorism Act.</p> <p>When Abdalla was discovered in the back of a lorry, he was hiding with three other men. One of the other men detained, Gabriel Rasmus, 29, from Lozells, Birmingham, has already pleaded guilty, the court heard, to preparing acts of terrorism.</p> <p>The court has heard that an undercover officer infiltrated a group of Isis supporters attempting to smuggle themselves out of the UK to Syria.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the jury was told that Abdalla had repeatedly been held by police officers at Birmingham airport and Dover ferry terminal under schedule 7 port stops over the course of several years. On some occasions, he had missed his flight because he was being detained and interviewed. </p> <p>The jury has previously been told by the prosecution that Abdalla and Rasmus were planning to travel to Syria via Bulgaria and Turkey \u201cto join forces with so-called Islamic State and to offer their services, with their lives if necessary, to engage in acts of terrorism\u201d. </p> <p>Rasmus had been under police investigation for some time, particularly through meetings conducted by an undercover officer known by the pseudonym \u201cMuhamed\u201d who was gathering information about alleged terrorist activity.</p> <p>Muhamed also met Abdalla, who told him that \u201cEurope held nothing for him\u201d and that he loathed his work in IT because he had to associate with non-Muslims, the jury heard. \u201cHe said he had been called on to go to Syria to fight and wanted to do so,\u201d Atkinson said. Abdalla, it is alleged, expressed support for Isis.</p> <p>One of the other men detained in the back of the lorry was Mahamuud Diini. He, the court was told, had been trying to leave the country covertly. Diini, however, has been prosecuted previously for seeking to travel to Syria but was acquitted.</p> <p>The prosecution has challenged Abdalla\u2019s claim that he was fleeing from security force harassment and argued that difficulties in his life were due to other causes. Abdalla, the court was told, had failed many of the modules of his computer technology course at Wolverhampton University and been required to leave due to his poor academic record.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019re a fan of Louis CK, there\u2019s a fair chance you\u2019ll also be a fan of Pamela Adlon. Their comic collaboration has stretched across two decades: first in CK\u2019s short-lived anti-sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/04/lucky-louie-box-set-review\">Lucky Louie,</a> where Adlon played Kim, the deadpan wife to CK\u2019s schlub husband, then in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/louie-louis-ck-season-five-premiere\">the dizzyingly adventurous sad-com Louie</a>, where she was Pamela, a caustic single mum who acted as the title character\u2019s best friend and lust object. In both shows, Adlon was the perfect comic foil for CK: bawdy, blunt and vaguely infuriated by the modern world, not to mention very funny.</p> <p>Still, as excellent as Adlon was, she was very much given second billing. Now, though, their roles have reversed. Better Things, a new comedy airing on FX, marks the latest chapter in the pair\u2019s collaboration, but this time it\u2019s CK in the supporting role and Adlon who\u2019s the lead. \u201cI wanted to tell a story about being a single mom, middle-aged, living in Los Angeles,\u201d she says over the phone in her recognisably gravelly voice.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s an important story to tell.\u201d</p> <p>Better Things stars Adlon as single parent Sam Fox. A former child star turned jobbing actor, her career has long since become ancillary to the more urgent task of looking after her three daughters. Outwardly her life has all the trappings of comfortability \u2013 shabby-chic mansion, a social life spent in the bars and restaurants of the Hollywood Hills. But she\u2019s also paying the lion\u2019s share of a recent divorce settlement and, with plum acting roles drying up due to her age, is subsisting on bit parts and voiceover work.</p> <p>This might sound familiar if you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on Adlon\u2019s own career. Also a child actor, her adult career has largely been made up of supporting roles (such as acid-tongued Marcy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/13/david-duchovny-californication-box-set\">Californication</a>) and voiceover work (Bobby in King of the Hill). And like Sam, Adlon has three daughters aged around 16, 12 and 5, and recently got divorced. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15747bae593776d9363179545c248c562fbee1e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15747bae593776d9363179545c248c562fbee1e7/0_34_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I rarely see anybody like me and my friends represented on television\u2019 \u2026 Adlon as Pam with Mikey Madison as Max in Better Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I rarely see anybody like me and my friends represented on television\u2019 \u2026 Adlon as Pam with Mikey Madison as Max in Better Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was originally trying to think of alternatives to fictionalise myself,\u201d says Adlon. \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018maybe I have a daughter adopted from China, or maybe I\u2019m a lesbian, maybe I this, maybe I that\u2019. But it just seemed better to use my real life as the bones for the show.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a great call. Better Things\u2019 vision of family life feels rounded and detailed in a way most TV could only dream of. Adlon says she wants the show \u201cto elevate the mundane\u201d, and each episode is full of tiny but profound observations that could only come from someone who\u2019s lived them \u2013 futile battles with smoke alarms, wordless but telling meals with teens.</p> <p>It\u2019s refreshing: after all, it\u2019s usually men like CK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/jun/15/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm-most-famous-character-himself\">Larry David</a> who get their own self-referential series. Hollywood tends to quietly nudge female actors into the background when they reach Adlon\u2019s age, a fate that is befalling Sam in the show. One standout episode sees a production team scrutinise her eligibility for a role in a new sitcom. \u201cWe\u2019ve got sexy, so why don\u2019t we get funny?\u201d, one of the showrunners suggests. They opt for Rachel McAdams instead.</p> <p>\u201cI think this happens all the time. Certainly to me,\u201d says Adlon when I bring up the scene. She thinks the entertainment industry is becoming slightly more inclusive, but she still rarely sees \u201canybody like me and my friends represented on television. So I wanted to tell stories about the friends in my world and things that happen ... these aren\u2019t really big, crazy, extraordinary things. It\u2019s just regular life.\u201d</p> <p>Regular life it may be, but Better Things never feels humdrum or safe. Its first few episodes feature Sam stealing one of her daughter\u2019s condoms, violent diarrhoea, and a deeply uncomfortable scene where Sam brings a black colleague (played by Lenny Kravitz) home for dinner with her daughters and her mother, who is weirded out by his presence. \u201cShe\u2019s not racist, she\u2019s over 70. You warn people over 70 that a black person is coming round,\u201d Kravitz\u2019s character tells Sam sagely.</p> <p>Intriguingly Sam\u2019s mum is British, played by Celia Imre with a plummy received-pronunciation accent. It\u2019s a piece of casting that mirrors reality; Adlon\u2019s mother is also British. \u201cI thought the only person who could do this part in the world is Maggie Smith,\u201d says Adlon. \u201cThen my casting director told me to meet with Celia. She\u2019s younger than I wanted and really gorgeous. The first day she had a wardrobe fitting I was like \u2018ok, she looks like Annie Hall with giant tits, and she\u2019s way sexier than any of my friends or me. Go make her into an old fluff\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f97db6c9b4a0dc13478b40a6aad5c39a104800e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f97db6c9b4a0dc13478b40a6aad5c39a104800e0/0_58_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Louis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible\u2019 \u2026 Louis CK and Adlon in Lucky Louie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Louis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible\u2019 \u2026 Louis CK and Adlon in Lucky Louie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Imre\u2019s clipped tones jar so strongly with Adlon\u2019s drawl that it almost feels she\u2019s been teleported in from another sitcom.

After all, Louie loved nothing more than to disrupt its observational comic plots with bursts of surrealism \u2013 a date escaping via helicopter, a homeless man getting decapitated. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2016/09/pamela_adlon_s_better_things_on_fx_reviewed.html\">Early reviews for the show</a> have been raves, drawing favourable comparisons with CK\u2019s earlier work. <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/atlanta-better-things-tv-review.html\">Vulture critic Matt Zoller-Seitz wrote</a> that Better Things \u201ctook CK\u2019s refinements to a new level\u201d, and called it a \u201chigh-water mark for half-hour, auteur-driven TV comedy\u201d. But Adlon is at pains to underline the distinctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different show to Louie,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a similarity in the way we talk and write dialogue. But in terms of the realistic nature of my show and delving deeper into the characters and situations, it\u2019s very different.\u201d</p> <p>But what of the pair\u2019s other show? Adlon, who also produces and writes for Louie, is unsure when the series, currently on \u201c<a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/louie-c-k-louie-extended-hiatus-1201559159/\">extended hiatus</a>\u201d, will return. \u201cI think they\u2019re keeping it on ice, like Curb Your Enthusiasm maybe,\u201d she suggests. \u201cLouis and I used to talk about revisiting Lucky Louie, so anything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>For now, she\u2019s focused on Better Things. \u201cRegular real normal life is an amazing story to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd three girls at different stages developmentally, it\u2019s just unbelievable fodder.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI hate to use the cliche, but it\u2019s all about learning moments,\u201d she adds. \u201cEverywhere, all up my butt, all day long.\u201d<br></p>",

He was going: \u201cOh my watch, oh my hair!\u201d </p> <p><strong>On the recording you can hear fellow guests Status Quo going \u201cYou\u2019re mad, you are.\u201d </strong><strong> </strong></p> <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with being mad. I met Richard again years later and he said: \u201cWhat a prat I was.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>When the hits eventually dried up, you made some unlikely records: disco, funk covers and such. </strong></p> <p>I was trying to find my way really. It\u2019s healthy for artists to move on. I didn\u2019t have a manager that would come up with ideas, so I did stuff like [the Detroit Emeralds\u2019] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsBiimYAAHg\">Feel the Need in Me</a> and [the Supremes\u2019] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pK8MeaZY84\">Come See About Me</a>.

  "<p>The backlash against Colin Kaepernick \u2013 and all of his colleagues who are refusing to stand for the national anthem \u2013 is growing. His protest against racism and police brutality is being widely panned as unpatriotic, and some have gone as far as to call him a traitor. I would say the backlash is puzzling, except it\u2019s not. I have long recognized that this is a common response to black protest \u2013 one I witnessed as far back as the civil rights movement. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-fundamentally-american\">Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest is fundamentally American | Ijeoma Oluo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within the context of sports protest, the raised black-gloved fists of protest by John Carlos and Tommie Smith at the 1968 Mexico Olympics comes immediately to mind. Less noticed than their dramatically raised fists was the fact that both athletes wore black socks and no shoes when they accepted their medals. This was to represent the poverty of African Americans in the United States. They suffered insult and abuse when they returned home. Time magazine wrote: \u201cFaster, Higher, Stronger\u201d is the motto of the Olympic Games. \u201c\u2018Angrier, nastier, uglier\u2019 better describes the scene in Mexico City last week\u201d.</p> <p>Most Americans opposed the sit-ins when they erupted in 1960; and opposed the Freedom Rides when they took place in 1961. Young black people were pushing too hard, demanding too much too soon was the typical charge. The country was changing; give it time. Most black people it should be said here were not engaged in sit-ins or Freedom Rides for there was risk, sometimes great risk, involved in public protest. But it also must be said that the country changed because of aggressive pushing against segregation and white supremacy and the silence that supported it.</p> <p>Protest will always make someone uncomfortable, or governments uncomfortable. It is, however, the American way \u2013 a liberty for which blood has been shed at home and overseas. The civil rights movement of the 1960s, for example, was not only a struggle for civil rights, but for civil liberties \u2013 the right to speak and to engage in public protest. </p> <p>And yet, to this day, some forms of protest are more criticized than others. I cannot help but notice that the public rage being directed at Kaepernick and those emulating him is disproportionate. Compare Kaepernick\u2019s \u201ccrime\u201d with that of the Bundy brothers and their group, which orchestrated an armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. While Kaepernick has been called unpatriotic, the Bundy brothers and the rest of the so-called Citizens for Constitutional Freedom were never labeled that way. </p> <p>Those behind the takeover of the wildlife refuge felt that they were acting to assert an American way of life they felt was under assault. Yet Kaepernick and his colleagues feel that their lives are under assault too, that they do not matter, to borrow from a slogan currently rising in prominence politically. As these football field protests have grown from a single act to actions by a growing number, so too has the backlash.</p> <p>And, while I draw the line at violent protest such as the armed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/12/oregon-militia-standoff-final-holdouts-plead-not-guilty-surrender-malheur-national-wildlife-refuge\">Malheur national wildlife refuge protest</a> or Ku Klux Klan terrorism that plagued the country for a century after the civil war, I do not make a distinction between good protest and bad protest. </p> <p>There are protests that reflect what I agree with or what I believe in and those that do not. But that issue is not fundamental to their legitimacy. The protesting athletes are simply trying to push the country to live up to its professed ideals. To accuse them of being unpatriotic \u2013 now that is what seems un-American to me. <br></p>",

That is why Jeremy Corbyn won today, handsomely. Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, and her point about \u201cselection by house price\u201d is a good one, but Corbyn successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn\u2019t provide an answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was how little support May was getting from her own side. That\u2019s not because Tory MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it\u2019s because many of them have serious reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today\u2019s PMQs, and judging by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education matter (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/14/pmqs-corbyn-may-brexit-cannot-have-a-la-carte-access-to-single-market-eu-chief-says-politics-live?page=with:block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5#block-57d932e7e4b0e813b694cea5\"> 12.26pm)</a>, the chances of May\u2019s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially amended, must be quite high.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T12:13:07.732Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d93845e4b067ad300879bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:49:34.468Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My PMQs coverage normally leaves out <strong>Angus Robertson</strong>, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I\u2019m writing my snap verdict.

He asked May:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish government who want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in Europe?</p> </blockquote> <p>May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn\u2019t want to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it\u2019s the q of the EU referendum, the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he\u2019ll get a different answer.

Again, he challenged the PM over the lack of support for the plan and, again, he won the exchange because he had the best arguments. He was not flash (he never is), but his fourth question, where he spoke passionately about how wrong it was to separate children at 11, was powerful, and it was telling that towards the end Theresa May resorted to having to change the subject. Unlike last week May restricted her jokes to her final answer, but even her pay-off soundbite did not quite work. It was premised on the idea that this might be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs. But, of course, no one believes that ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d9318ae4b0e813b694cea0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T11:22:13.471Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says his policy is not about pulling up ladders. It is about offering ladders to everyone. He quotes someone saying there is something hopeless about grammar schools, and the idea only some pupils can benefit. It was Cameron, he says, who said this.</p> <p>May says she wants a diversity of good provision. Good school places are important. Corbyn has still not welcomed the employment figures, she say. Labour would offer more taxation for working families.</p> <p>Corbyn welcomes anyone who can get a job. But there are now almost 1m people on zero-hours contracts. She quotes Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools. He said the idea the poor will benefit from grammar schools is \u201ctosh and nonsense\u201d. The Tory green paper addresses none of the problems in education, he says. Isn\u2019t this the case of a government heading backwards, to segregated schooling and second-class schooling for the many.</p> <p>May says some of Corbyn\u2019s facts were wrong. There are more teachers in schools. Corbyn has opposed all measures to improve schools, such as those on parent choice, and free schools. This may be Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs, she says. So she will recap some of the things Corbyn has introduced. He wants coal mines without mining them, submarines without weapons, and to be a leader without leading. </p> <p><strong>John Bercow </strong>intervenes. Progress has been absurdly slow, he says.</p> <p>But he will get down the list.

She says Corbyn went to a grammar school. She went to one to. That is what got them to where they are.</p> <p>Corbyn says she and May can both remember the 1950s and going to a grammar school. We don\u2019t need to and never should divide children at the age of 11. Can May confirm whether existing grammar schools will have to widen their existing admission?</p> <p>May says she wants all grammar schools to educate a wide range of pupils. She wants a good education for every child. There are 1.25m children who are in schools that are not good or outstanding. She believes in the education that is right for every child. Labour has stifled opportunity.

Can she name any educational experts that back her grammar school plans?</p> <p>May also pays tribute to the police constable stabbed. As home secretary she looked forward to going to the policy bravery awards, she says.</p> <p>On education she says 1.4m more children are in good and outstanding schools. That is because of the government\u2019s reforms, which Corbyn opposes. She wants more good school places, she says.</p> <p>Corbyn says he asked if May could name any experts who backed the policy. She could not. He quotes John, a teacher, asking why all schools cannot be funded properly. In Kent 27% of pupils on free school meals get five good GCSEs. In London it is 45%.</p> <p>May says Corbyn should stop casting his mind back to the 1950s. She will be ensuring that the government provides good school places for the 1.25m pupils in schools that are failing or that need improvement.</p> <p>In grammar schools the attainment gap is virtually zero, she says.

It posed as a quasi-judicial body with the right to impose criminal punishments, yet followed none of the usual rules of law and fair process.

It means censure or, to put it colloquially, a severe bollocking.</p> <p>If MPs are found to have broken parliament\u2019s rules, they can be suspended. Back in the eighteenth century parliament also had the power to imprison members of the public found to be in contempt (often reporters publishing reports that offended MPs). But that power is deemed to have lapsed.</p> <p>MPs could in theory summon someone to attend the Bar of the House of Commons (the bit marking the formal entrance to the chamber, not the place where they serve drinks) to be reprimanded in person. This happened to John Junor in 1957 when he was editor of the Sunday Express. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Junor\">Junor had written an article criticising MPs for their use of petrol allowances </a>(rationing still applied) and, although he apologised for the contempt, he did so without retracting his comment.</p> <p>In today\u2019s report the privileges committee said it considered summoning Myler and Crone to the Bar of the House. But it has not recommended that step - probably because the 1957 episode was seen at the time as a bit of a farce, and something that did not reflect well on MPs. It is also not clear what would happen if someone were summoned but refused to turn up.</p> <p>Instead what will happen is that MPs will debate the motion proposed by the privileges committee.

Associated correspondence and evidence is published on the internet.</p> <p> The report follows the referral to the Committee by the House of the Eleventh Report of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (Session 2010-12) which concluded that it has been misled by witnesses during its inquiries into phone-hacking. Based on the evidence and applying the standard of proof that the allegations must be significantly more likely than not to be true, the Committee of Privileges has found that:</p> <p> a) Mr Colin Myler misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p>b) Mr Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee in 2009 by giving a counter impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement.</p> <p>c) Tom Crone misled the CMS Committee by \u201canswering questions falsely about [his] knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing\u201d.</p> <p> The Committee therefore finds Mr Myler (former editor of the News of the World) and Mr Crone (former legal manager at News International) to have been in contempt of the House.</p> <p> The Committee also found that:</p> <p> d) There is insufficient evidence to find that Tom Crone sought to mislead the CMS Committee about the commissioning of surveillance.</p> <p>e) The allegation that Les Hinton sought to mislead the CMS Committee as to the extent of the pay\u2010off to Clive Goodman and his own role in authorising the payments is not significantly more likely than not to be true.</p> <p>f) The evidence that Les Hinton misled the CMS Committee about the extent of his knowledge of allegations that phone\u2010hacking extended beyond Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to others at the News of the World does not meet the standard of proof set for a finding of contempt.</p> <p>g) While the Culture, Media and Sport Committee was sceptical about Mr Hinton\u2019s memory, there is no evidence that he misled the Committee in relation to his role in the payment of legal fees or the fact that he authorised the payments to Mr Goodman to settle his Employment Tribunal claim.</p> <p>h) There is insufficient evidence of a breach of Parliamentary privilege on the part of NI (now News UK). NOTW was not a corporate body. As such, the Committee does not consider NI to have committed a contempt.</p> <p> The Committee recommends that the House be invited to agree a motion in the following terms:</p> <p> That this House\u2014</p> <p> i) approves the First Report from the Committee of Privileges;</p> <p> ii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Colin Myler, considers that Mr Myler misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct; and</p> <p> iii) having regard to the conclusions of the Committee in respect of Mr Tom Crone, considers that Mr Crone misled the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by giving a counter\u2010impression of the significance of confidentiality in the Gordon Taylor settlement and by answering questions falsely about his knowledge of evidence that other News of the World employees had been involved in phone\u2010hacking and other wrongdoing, and therefore formally admonishes him for his conduct.</p> <p> The Committee also recommends that the Leader of the House take steps as soon as possible to address the issues identified by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 2013, particularly in respect of the penal powers of the House and select committees and contempt.</p> <p> The Government is expected to find an early date for debate on the Committee\u2019s report.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what it means.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Two very senior former News International executives, the former News of the World editor Colin Myler and the former News International legal manager Tom Crone, have been censured for misleading MPs when they gave evidence to the phone-hacking inquiry.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A third executive, Les Hinton, the former News International chairman, has been cleared of misleading MPs - but only because the evidence did not meet a relatively high burden of proof.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to pass a motion censuring Myler and Crone.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>News International \u201cas a corporate body\u201d has not been found guilty of lying.</strong></li> <li><strong>The privileges committee is calling for an investigation into what can be done to punish witnesses who lie to select committees.

  "<p>In the wake of a victory that at once seemed extraordinary and inevitable, the Slovenian Football Association chief, Aleksander Ceferin, could not have been more matter-of-fact about the reasons behind his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/uefa-president-election-backroom-talks-michel-platini\" title=\"\">remarkable rise from relative obscurity</a> to one of the most powerful roles in football in less than six months.</p> <p>\u201cIt was my decision to run for presidency,\u201d he said, unsmiling but not nervous at facing the world\u2019s media following his 42-13 triumph over the far more experienced Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag. \u201cWhen I have seen there was so much support, it was much easier. For a new face to come to lead Uefa, it was the right time now.\u201d</p> <p>The official version of the 48-year-old\u2019s vertiginous rise begins with small gatherings of around 15 federations in eastern Europe in March at which they sought a candidate who could represent their interests, followed by a series of meetings on the fringes of the Fifa congress in Mexico City in May.</p> <p>Fearful of the power of the biggest European clubs and their lobbying strength, and concerned the Uefa executive committee did not always represent their interests, they swung behind Ceferin. As momentum grew, he also soon gathered the support of many of the Scandinavian countries, plus Italy, Germany and Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/slovenian-federation-leader-aleksander-ceferin-elected-uefa-president\">New Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin vows to review Champions League deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Uefa insiders said his success in winning them over was partly down to dissatisfaction with the other two candidates in the race \u2013 Van Praag and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/13/uefa-fifa-angel-villar-llona-2018-investigation\" title=\"\">controversial Spanish FA chief</a>, \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona, who withdrew this month \u2013 but also because he caught a prevailing mood.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, some wondered whether there were other factors in the patronage of Russia and the alleged support of Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, who insisted publicly he would be prepared to work with either candidate and after the vote railed that the idea he lobbied on Ceferin\u2019s behalf was an \u201cinsult\u201d to the voting members.</p> <p>Nor has it gone unnoticed that Tomaz Vesel, the new chair of Fifa\u2019s independent audit and compliance committee, is also a Slovenian who turned out for the same football team as Ceferin (who is, by all accounts, a decent&#xa0;player).</p> <p>Uefa, overseen for nine years by one of the greatest and most charismatic footballers of all time in Michel Platini, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/michel-platini-declares-clear-conscience-uefa-congress-speech\" title=\"\">who crashed to earth in a spectacular display of hubris</a>, has now turned to a little-known lawyer to lead it at one of the most turbulent periods in its history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/14/uefa-new-president-fifa-michel-platini-congress\">Uefa\u2019s new broom more reminiscent of Fifa\u2019s new dawn than a revolution | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even those who have spent time with him in Uefa meeting rooms \u2013 he is vice-chairman of the legal committee \u2013 say he is relatively sparing with his words. Initially, he plans to remain in Ljubljana, where his law firm is based, rather than moving to the smooth glass offices of Uefa on the shores of Lake Geneva.</p> <p>Ceferin has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011 and local journalists say he is well regarded at home, not least for opening a new National Football Centre this year. The married father of three eventually became irritated with suggestions he was a nobody. \u201cI was never behind the scenes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should ask somebody behind the scenes. People trust me. Nobody behind the scenes can have 42 votes from all parts of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Ceferin has just a two-and-a-half-year mandate, owing to the untimely fall from grace of his predecessor, but insisted he would not be afraid to fight for the interests of smaller federations. All of which should make for an interesting dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cSome people may have said I\u2019m not a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can say that I\u2019m young and inexperienced but I honestly think it\u2019s disrespectful to all the presidents of small- and medium-sized federations who every year have to do more with less.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I know is that I\u2019m a team player, a man of conviction, a passionate man and a man of his word. I am not a showman and I\u2019m not a man of unrealistic promises.\u201d</p> <p>If true, that will mark him out as unusual in a world where talk is cheap but meaningful action is rare. While the Uefa members patted themselves on the back and politicked on the Athens riviera, inside their bubble there is still too little realisation of the low esteem in which they are held by the wider world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the questions over his speedy ascent up the greasy pole will only multiply. Ceferin, a black belt in karate who has traversed the Sahara five times (four by car and once on a motorbike), hinted he would employ the same tactics that had got him here to win re-election.</p> <p>Among other things, he vowed to stand up for the little guys by toughening up financial fair play rules and looking again at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/europe-top-four-leagues-guaranteed-four-automatic-champions-league-places\" title=\"\">new Champions League deal that favours Europe\u2019s aristocracy</a>. But he also insisted he would deliver greater transparency, term limits and a new compliance committee.</p> <p>As he did so, it was impossible not to think of the countless times those buzzwords had been tossed from podiums down the years by Sepp Blatter, Platini, Infantino and all those who had gone before and conclude that Uefa\u2019s new accidental leader could be judged only by his actions.</p>",

The Guardian\u2019s voices are raised in the week that Oliver Stone\u2019s film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/snowden\">Snowden</a>, is released in the US and that a coalition of groups including the ACLU and Amnesty International launch a new campaign for a presidential pardon before Obama steps down. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Membership callout\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;

Similar calls are made by public intellectuals including Noam Chomsky, Cornel West and Sanders\u2019 former Democratic presidential rival and Harvard law professor, Lawrence Lessig. </p> <p>Not everyone writing in the Guardian today is empathetic towards the whistleblower. The former director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, says Snowden should face \u201cthe full force of the law\u201d were he to come home. Stewart Baker, also latterly of the NSA, argues that Snowden\u2019s leak caused harm to US national interests \u2013 a contention that is strongly disputed by many of the other people writing here.<br></p> <h2><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></h2> <p><strong>US senator for Vermont and Democratic presidential runner-up</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8411674cdf13150cce04d3736ba9def43076d4ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8411674cdf13150cce04d3736ba9def43076d4ce/0_196_3936_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Bernie Sanders in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Groll/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/edward-snowden-why-barack-obama-should-grant-me-a-pardon\">Edward Snowden makes 'moral' case for presidential pardon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The information disclosed by Edward Snowden has allowed Congress and the American people to understand the degree to which the NSA has abused its authority and violated our constitutional rights. </p> <p>Now we must learn from the troubling revelations Mr Snowden brought to light.

They should remove the indictment, pardon him if that\u2019s the way to do it, so that he is no longer facing prison.</p> <p>The NSA and US government have revealed no evidence that the information Ed Snowden released has caused any harm. Inconvenience, yes, embarrassment certainly, but what has truly been revealed is that the NSA itself was unquestionably committing international, domestic and constitutional crimes. </p> <p>Were the government to have any evidence that Snowden revealed information that should have been protected, I think he should be judged by a jury. I was the first person to be tried for a leak under the Espionage Act, and I certainly didn\u2019t object to my case being weighed by a jury, although it never came to that. But there has to be a public interest defense, which doesn\u2019t exist in US law now.</p> <p>As things stand, I think the chance that this or any president will pardon Snowden is zero. They wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge the intelligence community that remains so hostile to him. Nor does Snowden have any chance of a fair trial under the Espionage Act, any more than I did. </p> <p>So nothing would be gained by him coming back and standing trial unless the Espionage Act were changed to permit that public interest defense. He\u2019s said to me that he\u2019s willing to come back and serve one, two or conceivably three years as a result of a plea bargain arranged beforehand, but they haven\u2019t offered him one as far as I\u2019m aware. </p> <h2>Terry Gilliam</h2> <p><strong>Film director and former Monty Python star</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60136e7fa03778ac602e758934501c8a39f2ade1/296_166_1306_783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Gilliam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Gilliam: \u2018What Edward Snowden\u2019s prize should be, I don\u2019t know, perhaps something as unglamorous and hard to display on his mantelpiece as a presidential pardon.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think anyone helping to strengthen the workings of democracy should be rewarded.

Then he would be able to mount his defense. I would not be supportive of a public interest defense, however, because the American people declare some things to be legal and some things to be illegal, and don\u2019t anoint the individual citizen to decide whether that\u2019s a good or a bad idea.</p> <p>If Snowden really claims that his actions amounted to genuine civil disobedience, he should go to some English language bookstore in Moscow and get a copy of Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Civil Disobedience. Thoreau points out clearly that civil disobedience gets its moral authority by the willingness to suffer the penalties from disobeying a law, even if you think that law is unjust.</p> <p>It would be incredibly unwise for this president to offer a pardon. President Obama and his successors are dependent on the 100,000-plus people inside the American intelligence community \u2013 the people Edward Snowden betrayed. For any president to align himself with Snowden\u2019s approach in this controversy would carry an incredible cost to the spirit and morale of the intelligence community.</p> <h2>Malkia Cyril</h2> <p><strong>Executive director of the Center for Media Justice and a Black Lives Matter activist</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1597a716e0fbb8f290cbb9faae186dc02074c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1597a716e0fbb8f290cbb9faae186dc02074c90/0_58_2100_1261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"malkia cyril\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malkia Cyril: \u2018Black movements for peace and freedom demand that out of the darkness of empire, truth-tellers emerge to sound the alarm.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Center for Media Justice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right now, Black Lives Matter activists protesting deadly police and other forms of state violence who have not been accused of any crime are being spied on with Stingray cellphone interceptors, tracked through biometric facial recognition software and license-plate readers, among other things.

How many black people right now are wearing electronic monitors? Are in databases we can\u2019t get off? Are on the no-fly list? Are living in communities that are so over-policed they have been turned into open-air prisons?</p> <p>This is why Edward Snowden must be pardoned \u2013 because the ability of black communities to organize for our collective liberation depends, in part, on whistleblowers like him. Black movements for peace and freedom demand that out of the darkness of empire, truth-tellers emerge to sound the alarm. </p> <p>His revelations directly challenged the commonly held belief that media, phone and technology corporations must always give into state interests to target and harass the public.

Apart from exceptional circumstances, citizens have every right to know what their government is doing, in particular what it is doing to them \u2013 in the present case, as Snowden revealed to us, keeping citizens under extensive and deeply intrusive surveillance. </p> <p>No case has been made that relevant exceptional circumstances prevail. As well known, initial claims about prevention of terrorist actions collapsed under investigation, and no credible case has been made that the massive invasion of privacy, arguably in violation of constitutional rights, is warranted. Snowden made every effort to follow established procedures for bringing this crucial information to the general public. When these failed, he took the courageous and honorable step of transmitting the information through the medium of careful and highly reliable and experienced journalists, who, along with him, carefully vetted the material to ensure that no possible harm would be caused to individuals or to security. </p> <p>Citizens of the United States \u2013 and indeed the world, considering the extraordinary range of the operations that have been revealed \u2013 are very much in Snowden\u2019s debt. He should certainly not be punished in any way for the services that he has performed in the interests of democracy and civil rights. At the very least, he should be granted the full freedom to return home without fear of prosecution, and, I very much hope, to be welcomed with the respect that he richly deserves.</p> <h2>Thurston Moore</h2> <p><strong>Singer-songwriter of Sonic Youth</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a084a8518a912f6400fb72447e56d74a383cfb9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a084a8518a912f6400fb72447e56d74a383cfb9f/0_126_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"thurston moore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thurston Moore: \u2018It has become normal to witness the uncovering of classified information over time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the perspective of someone born in the friendly \u201950s in the USA, it has become normal to witness the uncovering of classified information over time ...</p> <p>Living in <em>this</em> day in age one would imagine that we \u2013 so connected now \u2013 could\u2019ve found a way to share resources in a more socially responsible way.

Programs concealed from the citizenry have been declared unconstitutional by federal courts.

Surely in a democracy, the people have a <em>need</em> to know.</p> <p>That today we do know, that today we are able to engage in this critical conversation about how properly to govern ourselves, is almost entirely due to the conscience and courage of one man: Edward Snowden.

His actions have long since been vindicated, and there is a general consensus that what he did was absolutely right.

I can think of two ways to make that happen.</p> <p>First, President Obama could pardon Snowden at the end of his last term, in the way other outgoing presidents have done in the past. Second, Snowden could be awarded the Nobel peace prize, which would bestow him a certain degree of immunity in the US even if he isn\u2019t pardoned: during the cold war, for example, we saw that Soviet Union was unwilling to prosecute people who had been awarded with such an internationally recognised honour.</p> <p>The key to both of these solutions doesn\u2019t lie in our hands, but there is something we all can do. Like Oliver Stone\u2019s new film, we can try to help emphasise that there is another side to Snowden\u2019s story than the one that prevails in the US media: that this is a man with a lot of integrity, who did a great merit for the civil rights and privacy for the mankind and who knew what he was doing when making a extremely risky decision.</p> <h2>Cindy Cohn</h2> <p><strong>Executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong></p> <p>Whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures provided powerful confirmation that the NSA was spying on the digital lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people, undermining digital security and attacking American companies. The leaks caused a sea change in policy and secrecy related to government spying that led to the first piece of legislation to rein in the NSA in over 30 years, reform to the secret Fisa court, and significant, long-overdue public releases of critical information by the government about its spying on innocent Americans as well as millions of others around the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His motivations ... were clearly to benefit the public and restore privacy and security to the internet.</p> <footer> <cite>Cindy Cohn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The information he revealed was critical to starting a conversation about realigning a broken relationship between the intelligence community and the public. His motivations \u2013 and the impact of the leaks \u2013 were clearly to benefit the public and restore privacy and security to the internet.</p> <p>The heavy price that the government seeks to exact \u2013 indicting him under the Espionage Act as if he had sold secrets to an enemy with no chance of explaining the broader public benefit \u2013 is wrong. Snowden\u2019s behavior both before and after he brought this information to the media is that of a whistleblower who brought necessary public attention to a corrupt surveillance system still in need of further reform. </p> <h2>Mark Udall</h2> <p><strong>Former US senator for Colorado and member of the select committee on intelligence</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7994cbb10d50910f507355ddf4bdeef97b4ec335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7994cbb10d50910f507355ddf4bdeef97b4ec335/0_46_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mark udall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Mark Udall: \u2018Snowden broke an oath he willingly took to protect our national security and classified secrets.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Dempsey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strong oversight of our intelligence agencies is essential so the American people trust what they are doing to keep us safe.

So the longer he stays away the more he becomes, in reality and in perception, simply one of Putin\u2019s tools. And a willing tool to boot, one suspects.

  "<p>In terms of global domination, Coca-Cola is definitely the real thing. In Britain, we spend \u00a31.15bn a year on the company\u2019s products. It is our&#xa0;biggest grocery brand.</p> <p>Even if you want to, it may be impossible to shake off the influence of this corporate behemoth. In 2004, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, attempted to explain why Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi, despite Pepsi proving more popular in blind taste-tests (the famous \u201cPepsi challenge\u201d). Using MRI brain scans, they found that, in blind tests, people focused solely on flavour. However, when the subjects knew they were drinking Coke, that information triggered sophisticated brain activity involving memory. This poses a tantalising possibility: has decades of&#xa0;iconic Coca-Cola advertising \u2013 all&#xa0;those celebrations of world peace, racial harmony and hot builders taking their tops off \u2013 hardwired a love of&#xa0;Coca-Cola in all of us?

After years of stuttering growth globally, in which Coca-Cola has arguably failed to adjust to a new healthier era, could it face years of slow decline? In the UK, 55% of its sales are still in mainline, high-sugar Coca-Cola.</p> <p>Certainly there are newcomers to the market, such as Karma Cola, which uses kola nuts (4x250ml, \u00a33.95, Waitrose; as a control, I\u2019d give this 7/10) and Fentimans Curiosity Cola (275ml, \u00a31.19, Waitrose, 8/10), which are expensive and acquired tastes, but offer more complex flavours than classic Coke (1.75l, \u00a31.70-\u00a32, 5/10).

I would introduce myself as a social activist or a human rights activist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI am pursuing values that the UK supports: democracy, a democratic government, a democratic society, an inclusive open and fair society. This is the goal of the umbrella movement. If you are not [supportive] of defenders who also pursue these kinds of values then are you really upholding these values? I have doubts.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not routinely comment on individual applications. Each application is considered on its individual merits based on the evidence provided and in line with the immigration rules\u201d.</p> <p>Chow said: \u201c[The British government portrays itself] as a country which values human rights, democracy and liberty a lot. But, when it comes to advocating human rights, it doesn\u2019t seem as active as they proclaim. If the UK claims it is the friend of human rights [it should not deny activists visas].\u201d</p>",

She will also appeal to their sense of social responsibility at a time when the economy is flourishing.</p> <p>They are expected to tell her, however, that they are hampered by obstacles such as refugees\u2019 struggle to learn German, and a lack of certainty over the status of those waiting to hear when and whether their asylum applications will be accepted or not. Other hurdles include complicated bureaucratic procedures, the inability of some refugees to be able to prove their qualifications and sometimes even their identities.</p> <p>The bosses of some of the top DAX-listed companies, including Siemens, Daimler and Bosch, will exchange ideas with Merkel as to how they can recruit more newcomers.</p> <p>Deutsche Post DHL, the German postal service, employs just over 100 refugees, mostly in its sorting and delivery departments, and is expected to take on a further 75 as apprentices this year.</p> <p>\u201cRight now we have 102 refugees including people from Rwanda, Eritrea, Togo and Syria,\u201d Deutsch Post\u2019s CEO, Frank Appel, said before the meeting. More than half of those had completed a period of work experience before being taken on by the company, he said. Deutsche Post started its refugee initiative a year ago. \u201cAs a company which is at home in Germany and the rest of the world, we wanted to do our bit towards helping the refugees to integrate,\u201d Appel said.</p> <p>The company said it had tried to adapt itself to the needs of the asylum seekers, offering them jobs that did not involve too much knowledge of German and were not too technical.</p> <p>Airline and financial industries have voiced their concerns that with many asylum seekers unable to prove their identities, it makes it difficult to take them on because they could not carry out enough security checks on them.</p> <p>Around 80% of asylum seekers are not qualified beyond primary or secondary school level. Many cannot read or write, let alone speak German.</p> <p>Most German companies want to take a longer-term approach to future employees, ensuring that if they take someone onto their highly-structured apprenticeship programmes, which can last for up to four years, they have a long-term perspective of staying in Germany.</p> <p>Some companies, such as Mercedes, Siemens and Daimler, have offered refugees pre-training programmes that would prepare them for entry at the apprenticeship level.</p> <p>The anti-refugee Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party has been making considerable gains in elections over voters\u2019 fears that Merkel\u2019s refugee policy is a threat to German stability.

And that is a decent educational opportunity for all kids, regardless of race, regardless of class, regardless of geography. That\u2019s become a more elusive goal.\u201d</p> <p>The plaintiffs include students from five of the lowest-performing schools in the city\u2019s system, which recently was overhauled before the start of the new year, after state lawmakers passed <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cac6a5b4764540c49282c66bb7c26782/qa-michigan-passes-617-million-revamp-detroit-schools\">a $617m plan to restructure the district</a> and shed its long-term debt. Teachers this year have waged large-scale protests over the prospect of working without pay and in subpar working conditions, though officials have <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/08/29/district-school-buildings/89532882/\">recently touted improvements in building repairs</a>.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office said it doesn\u2019t comment on pending lawsuits. A spokesperson for Detroit\u2019s school system said the district\u2019s legal team hasn\u2019t had time to review the case.</p> <p>The lawsuit describes a public school system in Detroit that has experienced a precipitous decline under state oversight. Since 1999, Michigan has implemented various measures to restructure the governance of the system, including a string of appointed emergency managers tasked with overseeing the district\u2019s finances. But in that timeframe, the lawsuit says, the state has \u201cnot addressed the root causes of its failures [with literacy] in any systematic or meaningful way\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit cites a list of complaints that have fostered the current environment in Detroit: the proliferation of charter schools, vast schools closures, and \u2013 as part of the overhaul this summer of the district \u2013 a new provision that authorizes the hiring of non-credentialed teachers. Insufficient staff poses additional challenges, too, the suit states.</p> <p>At one school, co-counsel Kathryn Eidmann said an eighth0grade student handled teaching a seventh- and eighth-grade math class for a month because no teacher was available \u2013 a situation reported to the legal team by \u201cnumerous\u201d teachers. And this week, Eidmann said she spoke with a student who started his school year with two classes that don\u2019t have a teacher.</p> <p>\u201cDuring that period, he sits with a substitute in the ROTC classroom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Eidmann said the case is the first in federal court to argue there is a right to access literacy under the US constitution\u2019s 14th amendment. In 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan <a href=\"http://www.aclumich.org/article/right-read\">filed a class-action lawsuit</a> in state court on behalf of students in the city of Highland Park\u2019s school system. That suit asserted Michigan had a constitutional obligation to educate students in Highland Park, which borders Detroit. A Michigan court of appeals panel, in 2014, rejected the claims in a 2-1 vote, and the state\u2019s high court <a href=\"http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-supreme-court-won-t-take-right-read-case-against-state-highland-park-schools\">refused to hear the case</a>.</p> <p>While the federal case over Detroit\u2019s public schools is the first to argue literacy is constitutionally protected, Eidmann said it\u2019s \u201cvery well grounded\u201d in US supreme court precedent. In the 1982 decision of Plyler v Doe, the justices struck down a Texas statute that excluded undocumented immigrant children from public education, and said a state may not \u201cdeny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders\u201d.</p> <p>Detroit students, predominately low-income and children of color, meet the criteria of a \u201cdiscrete class\u201d, the lawsuit claims, and \u201chave been excluded from the access to literacy that public education provides to other students in the state of Michigan\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese are schools in name only,\u201d Eidmann said, \u201cwhere students are sitting in the classrooms often with no books, often where there\u2019s no teachers, often where there\u2019s no pretense of literacy taking place. In that sense, they\u2019re being denied a basic education.\u201d</p> <p>Though Rosenbaum\u2019s other case in Highland Park failed at the state level, Tribe said the federal court system is a more appropriate vehicle to address the litany of issues cited in the lawsuit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/detroit-public-schools-sickout-lawmakers-plan\">How Detroit's teacher 'sickout' cast a spotlight on unsafe school conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that a life-tenured federal judge is likely to be much more comfortable with and willing to think through in great detail,\u201d Tribe said.</p> <p>Tribe also believed the lawsuit makes a sound use of the Plyler decision.</p> <p>\u201cWhether it is kids who through no fault of their own were brought to Texas as undocumented aliens at the age of two, or kids through no fault of their own were born and are growing up in Detroit,\u201d he said, \u201cthe idea that saying, by the luck of the draw, you will never be equipped by society with the tools you need to achieve something that resembles the American Dream of upward mobility, that\u2019s a fundamental departure from constitutional principle.\u201d </p> <p>The suit asks the federal court to provide relief that includes evidence-based literacy instruction in every grade level, along with addressing physical school conditions.</p> <p>The five-count complaint names Michigan\u2019s governor, Rick Snyder, as well as several state education officials, as defendants.

When a mosque opened on the site of a former pub several years ago, it was daubed with graffiti and a demonstration had taken place, he said.</p> <p>Weeks ago, Piradeepan had found a man trying to get into his garden early in the morning. \u201cWe spotted them and they started arguing with us and at one point they said, \u2018This is English country, go back to your country,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Muslim Council of Britain condemned the attack. Harun Khan, its secretary general, said: \u201cAs a father of three young daughters, I am completely shocked and saddened to hear of such a horrific and cowardly attack on a vulnerable woman in our society today. My thoughts and prayers are with both the victims, especially for the lady, who has now lost a child as a result of hatred and xenophobia.</p> <p>\u201cWe need strong action now from the authorities to show that they are taking all hate crimes seriously, including Islamophobia, which findings show has increased in recent times, especially post-Brexit.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

  "<p>Can access to water and sanitation be secured now for future generations? We don\u2019t have a choice; sustainability must be at the heart of all efforts to deliver these services.</p> <p>This was the central message of a panel discussion hosted by the Guardian at the annual World Water Week conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The panel was organised in association with the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and supported by Fundaci\u00f3n Femsa, which works to create programmes around conservation and the sustainable use of water.</p> <p>The sustainable development goals (SDGs) \u2013 an ambitious agenda for social, environmental and economic change \u2013 were adopted by world leaders at the United Nations general assembly in September 2015. The agenda sets a target of \u201censuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\u201d by 2030.</p> <p>Around the world, 650 million people lack access to safe water and 2.3 billion people live without adequate sanitation.

The real challenge, the panel agreed, is how to deliver them more efficiently. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to do things better and faster,\u201d said Alejandro Jim\u00e9nez, water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) specialist at SIWI. \u201cFaster, because we will not achieve access for all at this rate of implementation. And better, because at present we cannot keep services functional once they are constructed.\u201d</p> <p>Sergio Campos, chief of the water and sanitation division at the Inter-American Development Bank, agreed. In Latin America and the Caribbean, he said, the challenge is not reaching the 30 million people who lack access to safe water and the 100 million people who don\u2019t have adequate sanitation, but ensuring a sustainable and continuous service. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/06/capturing-rain-save-mexico-city-water-crisis\">How capturing rain could save Mexico City from a water crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAround 90% of people in our region live in urban areas and we haven\u2019t been able to cope with population growth and rapid urbanisation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaintenance of the existing infrastructure has been systematically deferred and 35 to 60% of potable water is lost through leakages.\u201d </p> <p>Investing in the social, as well as the physical, infrastructure is one way of securing water and sanitation over the long term, said Mariano Montero, director of Fundaci\u00f3n Femsa. \u201cBy social infrastructure we mean empowering people to own the project,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t just give a community a solution that we think is best.

We went from a 42% to 89% acceptance rate, as soon as people had information on the treatment processes,\u201d said Iyengar. The same survey also found that more people are supportive of the term \u201cpurified water\u201d than \u201crecycled\u201d or \u201creclaimed water\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/08/live-qa-114bn-a-year-needed-for-water-and-toilets-where-will-it-come-from\">Live Q&amp;A: $114bn a year needed for water and toilets \u2013 where will it come from?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But any programme of change needs funding. The millennium development goal (MDG) on water sought to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation between 2000 and 2015. Annual expenditure to meet this goal was $35bn (\u00a326.5bn). By contrast, $115bn (\u00a387bn) will be needed per year to meet the SDG \u2013 sustainable and equitable access for all.</p> <p>Where will this money come from? \u201cThe starting point is a complete change in mindset,\u201d said Bill Kingdom, global lead for water supply and sanitation at the World Bank\u2019s Water Global Practice. \u201cMany of our clients are dependent on money coming from above. They spend it and then they stop [programmes] because there\u2019s no more money.\u201d </p> <p>Instead, said Kingdom, budget holders must find ways to allocate money more efficiently. </p> <h2>Making water affordable</h2> <p>Both Montero and Kingdom agreed that financial sustainability is critical for water and sanitation access to be secured indefinitely. \u201cI feel that we\u2019re not doing our jobs unless clients can move to self-financing over the long-term,\u201d said Kingdom. In the US, for example, the water service is publicly managed and provided but 100% privately financed. \u201cIt is decades down the road, but that\u2019s where I feel we should be moving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eec785b0df097dcb15b9ce283cc6a196675a8c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eec785b0df097dcb15b9ce283cc6a196675a8c4/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman is shown how to fetch water from one of the ATM-style water dispensers in the Mathare slums in Nairobi, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman is shown how to fetch water from one of the ATM-style water dispensers in the Mathare slums in Nairobi, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tariffs are one way a water utility could become self-financing and afford service improvements, but many people don\u2019t pay water bills because their service is bad.

We need these five organisational changes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The panel agreed that strong governance is critical for countries to ensure sustainable access to water and sanitation for all. The success of countries like Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia in achieving the MDGs on water and sanitation has been attributed to the fact that their heads of state were fully supportive of the notion of universal access. Effective leadership can also attract the investment needed to provide sustainable access. \u201cIn terms of a financial borrowing entity, water companies look pretty impressive,\u201d said Kingdom. \u201cThey have a natural monopoly on a product that is essential for life. That\u2019s a pretty good business case for lending money, as long as the governance is improved.\u201d </p> <p>But ensuring access to water and sanitation does not need to be done in traditional ways. In cities around the world, millions of people rely on an intermittent piped supply or are not connected to a water or sewerage network at all. Instead, they will often buy water from informal vendors and pay to have their sewerage removed from pit latrines. </p> <p>\u201cHow can the water sector integrate these informal vendors into the formal system, to make sure that the service provided is up to the standard people deserve?\u201d asked one audience member. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand what all parts of the sector are doing and map out who is doing what,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to provide a whole sewerage network for the city, for example, when 10% of it is covered by informal providers \u2026 We should see what existing providers can do and try to make a mix of services that can be progressively improved and help deliver solutions to all,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Hardest to reach</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273194189854a7aa0dc5b0b41c389c091d40a08c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273194189854a7aa0dc5b0b41c389c091d40a08c/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man from the indigenous community of Pacayita collects water to irrigate a papaya field in Masaya, Nicaragua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man from the indigenous community of Pacayita collects water to irrigate a papaya field in Masaya, Nicaragua.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oswaldo Rivas/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The panel also addressed the different levels of water and sanitation coverage between urban and rural areas. Data published by the WHO/Unicef joint monitoring programme at the end of the MDG period revealed that eight out of 10 people without access to an improved drinking water source live in rural areas, and only 51% of the global rural population have access to an improved sanitation facility (one that hygienically separates human waste from human contact), compared to 82% of the world\u2019s city-dwellers.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at rural areas of Latin America, people have the same level of coverage today that urban areas had 25 years ago,\u201d said Campos. </p> <p>\u201cInvestment in basic infrastructure has been concentrated in major capitals. Now we need to invest in small towns and medium-to-large cities so that people there have access.\u201d</p> <p>The panel also agreed that the hardest to reach \u2013 including people living in rural areas, the poorest and most vulnerable, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples \u2013 should be prioritised in this new era of ensuring sustainable access to water and sanitation. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge problem with discrimination and cultural understanding of different values,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez.

  "<p>The World Cup of Hockey is fun. Along with the Olympics, it\u2019s the only true best-on-best tournament on the international hockey landscape. It\u2019s played on NHL rinks under NHL rules, so there\u2019s less of an adjustment for the league\u2019s fans. And it doesn\u2019t even interrupt the season. All in all, it\u2019s a pretty hard concept not to like.</p> <p>But as we\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jun/01/nhl-stanley-cup-final-sharks-penguins-how-to-be-hockey-fan\">explained in the past</a>, not liking things is what hockey fans do. It\u2019s kind of our thing. So with the 2016 World Cup officially getting under way this weekend in Toronto, we\u2019d better start digging for something to complain about. </p> <p>To get you started, here are a half-dozen reasons to be irrationally annoyed with the World Cup.</p> <h2>The teams are all weird this year</h2> <p>The World Cup evolved from the Canada Cup, a tournament that began in 1976 and ran five times through 1991. All of those tournaments were six-team affairs, and with one exception they all featured the Big Six of international hockey: Canada, Russia, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Finland and the USA. (West Germany replaced Finland at one tournament, in 1984). When the World Cup debuted in 1996, the format expanded to eight, with Czechoslovakia splitting into a Czech team and a Slovak squad and Germany being added to round out the field.</p> <p>You may notice something about those teams: they\u2019re all countries. That\u2019s because the World Cup has always been an international tournament, one that pits teams representing individual countries against each other to determine world supremacy, or at least bragging rights. This might sound familiar, since it\u2019s the standard format across all international sports and is just kind of taken for granted. It\u2019s simple, it works, and you\u2019d think it would be reasonably tough to screw up.</p> <p>Enter the NHL. This year, the league decided to get creative, keeping the Big Six and then adding two new teams to the World Cup that don\u2019t represent actual counties. The first is Team Europe, made up of players from countries like Slovakia, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark. It\u2019s an unusual approach, but you can kind of see where the NHL is thinking here. None of those countries have enough talent to contend on their own, but combining them into one team at least gives fans a chance to see stars like Anze Kopitar (Slovenia), Zdeno Chara (Slovakia) and Roman Josi (Switzerland), who\u2019d otherwise be excluded from the action.</p> <p>But for the final team, the NHL just dropped any pretense of this being an international competition and let the marketing department take over. They came up with something called Team North America, which will feature players from Canada and the US who are 23 and younger, in a transparent attempt to highlight some of the league\u2019s up-and-coming stars while trying to appeal to younger fans. The team has <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/the-world-cup-team-jerseys-have-been-revealed-lets-rank-them/\">scary uniforms</a> and just enough skill and speed to at least be vaguely threatening, and if you focus on that you might even manage to forget that the entire thing <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/sports/breakaway_blog/2015/01/nhl-is-messing-up-the-world-cup-and-an-angry-mailbag.html\">doesn\u2019t make any sense</a>.</p> <p>You have to at least hand the NHL some credit for thinking outside the box here, given the league\u2019s traditional aversion to ever trying anything new. But what we\u2019re left is an international tournament that features eight teams, only six of which are actual countries, all because the NHL decided it had to come up with a weird solution to a problem that didn\u2019t exist.</p> <h2>They\u2019ve put ads on the jerseys</h2> <p>As part of the traditional build-up to any international hockey event, every team unveiled newly designed uniforms that everyone immediately pretended not to like. But this year, that was overshadowed by another uniform-related controversy: the NHL snuck ads onto them.</p> <p>Well, \u201csnuck\u201d may not be the right word, since the NHL didn\u2019t exactly try to <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/jersey-ads-coming-to-world-cup-nhl-has-sold-sponsorships-on-the-shoulders/\">hide what it was doing</a>. And the ads themselves turned out not to be all that big or even all that noticeable \u2013 they\u2019re just <a href=\"http://www.thescore.com/news/1079733\">small patches on the shoulder</a>. </p> <p>So you might imagine that this isn\u2019t an especially big deal. But then you\u2019d remember that we\u2019re dealing with hockey fans here, and as it turns out, a lot of hockey fans have very strong feelings about ads on jerseys. And those feelings can basically be summed up as: \u201cSacrilege!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7e7c70277237336d2a180e9f13eccd56601478b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7e7c70277237336d2a180e9f13eccd56601478b/0_0_3482_2321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"See those ads on the jerseys?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">See those ads on the jerseys?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Doster/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s because everyone assumes that this is the first step towards ads on the jerseys of all 31 NHL teams. The NBA has <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15559477/philadelphia-76ers-sell-first-nba-jersey-advertisement-stubhub\">already started down this road</a>, and hockey fans have long known that the NHL would eventually follow. In a league obsessed with revenue growth, jersey ads are free money, so it\u2019s always seemed inevitable that we\u2019d get there some day. That day appears to be here.</p> <p>And this simply cannot stand, because hockey jerseys, you see, are sacred spaces. Never mind that the NHL has already plastered ads all over the ice, the boards, the scoreboards, and every other blank space they could find short of the head coach\u2019s forehead. And never mind that those sacred jerseys have been subjected to all sorts of marketing nonsense over the years, from <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/news/sabres-jerseys/c62acp8xlfto1kapf1yftkgxb\">endless redesigns</a> to <a href=\"https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4731359/tumblr_n2lafhJF7d1rp9726o1_500.0.jpg\">jarringly weird throwbacks</a> to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5843301/15-seasons-later-the-blues-would-be-third-jerseys-are-still-the-worst-ever\">whatever the hell this was</a>. Many hockey fans just do not want ads on jerseys, period, and they will be happy to tell you this, very loudly.</p> <p>And you can see where they\u2019re coming from, given how ridiculous hockey uniforms can look when you take the whole concept to the extreme, <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5007b2ea84aef6ab9cd08134/t/545c5587e4b0ccac6b4ff070/1415337351340/\">like they do in European</a> leagues. If that\u2019s what the NHL has in mind, then you can see why hockey fans would be gathering torches and pitchforks.</p> <p>But so far, it\u2019s just a shoulder patch, and the league seems to be <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2016/08/25/q-and-a-with-nhl-commissioner-gary-bettman.html\">hedging on even doing that much</a> (maybe due to <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/talent/nhl-nhlpa-yet-to-sell-corporate-ads-for-world-cup-uniforms-1.440368\">a decidedly lukewarm response</a> from sponsors). You probably won\u2019t even notice them when you\u2019re watching the games. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be angry about them.</p> <h2>The whole thing is messing up NHL training camps</h2> <p>Unlike the Olympics, which take place in February and force the entire NHL regular season to grind to a halt for a few weeks, the World Cup happens in September. On the surface, that seems like a good thing. But give it a few weeks, and you\u2019ll find that somebody somewhere is complaining about how the tournament disrupted training camps and ruined some team\u2019s season before it even began.</p> <p>Just wait. By the end of October, any team that\u2019s off to a disappointing start will be grumbling about it all being the World Cup\u2019s fault. They couldn\u2019t build up team chemistry or hammer out their game plan properly because key players were off playing in the tournament instead of working with their NHL teammates. This will be especially true if the team had lots of players participating. And if the head coach was also off working with a World Cup team, even better. NHL teams love nothing more than ready-made excuses.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the near certainty that at some point during the World Cup, somebody will get hurt, with history telling us there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a superstar who goes down. At the 1991 Canada Cup, Gary Suter\u2019s cheap shot on Wayne Gretzky messed up the Great One\u2019s back for years. At the 2006 Olympics, Dominik Hasek suffered a torn abductor that Senators fans still insist cost them the Stanley Cup. The last time we had a best-on-best tournament, at the 2014 Olympics, Islanders franchise player John Tavares tore up his knee and missed the rest of the season.</p> <p>At some point over the next few weeks, an NHL star is going to be helped off the ice while everyone holds their breath and hopes it isn\u2019t as bad as it looked. And if it turns out to be serious, then fans are going to start howling over how terrible the World Cup is and how it\u2019s ruined their entire season before it even began.</p> <p>(Meanwhile, some other NHL star will get hurt during a meaningless NHL pre-season game and everyone will just shrug and say that\u2019s hockey.)</p> <h2>The winner gets an ugly trophy</h2> <p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://sports-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/09/02/down-goes-browns-grab-bag-give-that-ugly-world-cup-trophy-to-the-tournaments-worst-team-1472834155.jpg?crop=1xw:0.993103448275862xh;0xw,0xh&amp;resize=900:*&amp;output-quality=75\">look at this thing</a>. Would you even want to win that? It\u2019s awful.</p> <p>And yet the NHL is bringing it back, despite having had 12 years to come up with something better. So we\u2019re apparently stuck with it, at least until my <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/down-goes-browns-grab-bag-give-that-ugly-world-cup-trophy-to-the-tournaments-worst-team\">\u201cgive the trophy to the last place team\u201d</a> idea catches on. They should have Gary Bettman come out to present it, just to see if they can establish a new world record for the loudest continuous booing.</p> <h2>The World Cup could spell the end of the Olympics</h2> <p>Remember how we said the World Cup was one of only two best-on-best hockey tournaments in the world? As it turns out, there may only be room for one.</p> <p>The World Cup and its Canada Cup predecessor used to run every three-to-five years, but that ended in 1996. Two years later, the NHL began sending players to the Olympics, and since that happened we\u2019ve only seen one World Cup played in two decades, that one coming back in 2004. (And that tournament coincided with the big NHL lockout, so it was viewed as much as a cash cow and preemptive apology to fans as anything.) </p> <p>So really, the two best-on-best tournaments have never truly coincided for any length of time. In theory, that\u2019s about to change, with the NHL signaling that they\u2019d like the World Cup to once again become a regular thing. But the league has yet to confirm that they\u2019ll continue participating in the Olympics, and recently it\u2019s been looking <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl-participation-at-2018-olympics-in-doubt-1.477086\">less and less likely</a> that they\u2019ll go to Pyeongchang in 2018. </p> <p>Given all that, it\u2019s not hard to fit the pieces into place here. If the NHL really had soured on the Olympics, they\u2019d want a successful tournament of their own as a replacement, especially one where they controlled the rules and pocketed all the profits. If this year\u2019s World Cup is a big hit with fans and sponsors, that gives the NHL some serious leverage to play hardball on the Olympics, or walk away all together.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good news for fans, most of whom enjoy both tournaments. But this is the NHL, so that may not matter much. A successful World Cup might just be the death knell for pro players at the Olympics, because we can\u2019t have nice things.</p> <h2>We already know who the best team is</h2> <p>The appeal of these sorts of tournaments, in any sport, is that in theory they tell us which country is the best at a given moment in history. But when it comes to hockey, we already know. Canada has the most talent, and it\u2019s not close.</p> <p>None of this is new. Despite occasional ebbs and flows where it\u2019s at least looked like other countries were catching up, Canada has been dominating best-on-best competition for decades. Between the World Cup, Canada Cup and the Olympics, there have been a total of twelve major international tournaments in hockey history, and Canada has won eight, including four of the last five. Nobody else has won more than one.</p> <p>This year, Canada is sending its usual stacked roster, one that\u2019s made them <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reporterchris/status/770329956903587840\">heavy favorites among oddsmakers</a>. They\u2019ll also have home-ice advantage, with all the tournament\u2019s games being played in Toronto.</p> <p>This being hockey, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019ll win. One hot goaltender can negate all the talent in the world, and is a single elimination tournament the best team won\u2019t always win. But even if someone pulls off a shocker, or Canada crashes and burns completely, it won\u2019t tell us anything about which country is hockey\u2019s best, because we already know.</p> <p>Besides, that won\u2019t happen. Canada is going to win, and will probably run the table in the process. There\u2019s really no suspense here. It\u2019s already a done deal.</p> <p>(Note to editors: come back and delete this entire section in a few weeks if I turn out to be wrong.)</p>",
  "<p>Arctic sea ice cover could be confirmed within days as the second lowest ever recorded, the latest data suggests.</p> <p>According to the US national snow and ice data centre (NSIDC) the ice which forms and disperses annually has been close to its minimum extent for the year for several days and has begun to grow again as autumn sets in.</p> <p>It was measured by satellite as 4.169m sq km on 12 September, a slight increase on the 4.139m sq km on 11 September.

Some of this ice divergence likely led to fragmented ice being transported into warmer ocean waters, hastening the melt.

  "<p>Britain should have taken far more extensive and decisive action in Libya to prevent the country sliding into chaos after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, the former chief of the defence staff has said, following the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\">release of a damning report</a> into the UK\u2019s intervention.</p> <p>Lord Richards, who sat on the national security council when the decision was taken to protect Benghazi from advancing Libyan forces controlled by Gaddafi, said it was debatable whether intervention had been in the UK\u2019s national interest.<br></p> <p>\u201cI would have done it much more comprehensively, with forces on the ground. It\u2019s the only way to do it and I would have done it as you know in Syria,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. </p> <p>\u201cThe result of failing to act can be much more catastrophic for us all than the worry about acting. Acting in a timorous and tentative way is the worst of all ways.\u201d</p> <p>Richards said the claim by the foreign affairs select committee report that the aim to protect Benghazi had been achieved within 24 hours was \u201ca little bit overoptimistic. We had to stabilise the military situation, so there was always a chance that Gaddafi would buy time and come back into Benghazi\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is: was there a strong case for regime change? I think that\u2019s where the issues were,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4221781721ad47a6ab0933ead8edac541d5264a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4221781721ad47a6ab0933ead8edac541d5264a3/0_124_1021_1276/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Richards\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former chief of the defence staff Lord Richards said it was debatable whether intervening was in the UK\u2019s national interest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report, which said the failure was ultimately the responsibility of the then prime minister David Cameron, said what started as a \u201climited intervention to protect civilians drifted into an opportunist policy of regime change by military means\u201d.</p> <p>Richards said he had raised doubts over whether regime change was the desired outcome during national security council meetings, but in practice, there was little that defence or intelligence chiefs could do within the structure at the time to force the prime minister to change his mind.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect the prime minister will come into the committee having made his mind up broadly what should happen and then we tweak at the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we probably need a more rigorous analysis in committee in order to make sure that initial analysis is right.\u201d</p> <p>The report was scathing about the extent of the intelligence analysis carried out before the intervention and said the UK had switched its goal from humanitarian intervention to regime change, without committing to help rebuild the country after the fall of Gaddafi.</p> <p>Libya is currently in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/libya-civil-war-future-dark-fate-government-sealed-uk-cameron\">state of near civil war</a>, with little nationwide recognition of the administration in Tripoli. The report argued that it should have been foreseen that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/isis-libya-united-nations-gaddafi-sirte-nationalistic-narrative\">militant groups would take advantage</a> of a power vacuum, because many Libyan nationals had joined the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>The Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, who chairs the committee, said there was \u201cno proper appreciation of what was going to happen in the event of regime change, no proper understanding of Libya and no proper plan for the consequences\u201d.</p> <p>Blunt criticised the British government for not taking advantage of connections with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who had studied at the London School of Economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s relationship with Muammar Gaddafi. \u201cNo one then said \u2018let\u2019s run this, let\u2019s keep this line of communication open\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is a possibility of a political strategy to have avoided what turned out to be a calamity, would it have been a sensible idea to have at least tried it?\u201d</p> <p>The SNP MP Stephen Gethins, a member of the committee, said it was clear that many lessons that should have been learned in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq invasion had not been fully heeded. The UK had a long-term responsibility to stabilise Libya, he added. </p> <p>\u201cLibya is now a failed state on Europe\u2019s doorstep,\u201d Gethins said. \u201cThat has been a catastrophe for the people of that country, who have paid the price for the failure to make long-term plans in the event of an intervention like this. And this has also contributed greatly to the refugee crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIn taking military action, the UK government should have been aware of its consequences. We must now focus our efforts on stabilising the country and investing in its development and the wellbeing of its citizens. The UK must have a long-term responsibility in that.\u201d<br></p> <p>The former foreign office minister Alastair Burt said the report was \u201ca very harsh judgment on David Cameron\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou had an instant situation to deal with,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIf you want to look at a situation where a dictator stays in place and is able to conduct war against his people, just look at Syria, still unresolved, with half a million killed, the population displaced. </p> <p>\u201cThe truth is there are no right answers, every option has a bad outcome and what you do is try to mitigate the bad outcome. You can equally say the rise of Isis in Syria arises from the failure to protect the people and there is blame attached to that for not doing something.\u201d</p>",

She said the unemployment rate, the prison population, and organised crime rates were higher among Muslim populations. \u201cAustralians in general are more fearful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIslam sees itself as a theocracy, Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is now seeing changes in suburbs predominately Muslim. Tolerance towards other Australians is no longer the case. Our law courts are disrespected and our prisons have become breeding grounds for Muslims to radicalise inmates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuslims are imprisoned at almost three times the average rate. The rate of unemployed and public dependency is two to three times greater than the national average. Muslims are prominent in organised crime with associated violence and drug dealing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnti-social behaviour is rampant, fuelled by hyper-masculine and misogynist culture. Multiple social surveys find that neighbours of Muslim settlements are suffering from collapsing social cohesion and fear of crime.\u201d</p> <p>If Muslim immigration continued then Australians would find themselves living under Sharia law, Hanson said.</p> <p>The One Nation leader said no further mosques or Islamic schools should be built until the current \u201csecurity challenges\u201d passed \u2013 meaning incidences of terrorism. Hanson said Islamic facilities already established in the country should be subject to monitoring.</p> <p>Addressing multiculturalism more broadly, Hanson said Australians had never been permitted to vote on whether we became a multi-racial society. Hanson claimed the Australian economy wasn\u2019t stimulated by immigration \u2013 an orthodoxy considered central to economic thinking \u2013 it was stimulated by government infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Hanson contended \u2013 again, without supporting evidence \u2013 that high immigration only benefited the banks and multinationals. She argued that immigration was placing intolerable strain on essential services, like hospitals and schools, which she said were \u201cbursting at the seams\u201d.</p> <p>Hanson said foreign investment was a source of regret, particularly when it came from China and its communist government.

I need to go and stick my eyeballs in a glass of water and my spirit in a decompression chamber. </p> <p>Today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill - agreed on by the Coalition and Labor - passed through the lower house but not without protests from Greens MP Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie. Fellow crossbenchers Cathy McGowan and Bob Katter joined them to oppose the bill. There appeared to be some funny business going on around the $800m put back into the renewable energy agency Arena (which was going to lose $1.3bn). It remains a net loss.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Malcolm Turnbull introduced the same sex marriage plebiscite bill. Bill Shorten let it be known that he would recommend blocking the bill. But we don\u2019t have it from his mouth because he jetted off to meet Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. There is some suggestion via Paul Karp that a Coalition briefing note suggests conscientious objectors in the non-religious sphere may achieve protections of some sort. </strong>B<strong>lessed are the cakemakers. </strong><strong>Stay tuned for that one.</strong><br></li> <li><strong>The government announced a national amnesty for illegal guns.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition has referred a number of matters from the last election to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (Jscem). They include political donations, funding political parties, electronic voting and foreign political donations. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Eighteen years after her first first speech, Pauline Hanson used her second first speech to move her targets from Indigenous people and Asian people to Asian people and Muslim people. She wants a ban on all immigration, a ban on new mosques, Muslim migration if she can\u2019t get the full ban, burkas, Islamic schools, mosques. She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but without the growing tax base from migration. Like the government, Hanson wants to make kids out of schools wait for welfare and instead teach them to get a job. Even where there are no jobs. And so it went.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy followed her with a speech talking about her Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage and her long path to the senate. She contrasted with Hanson to say she was in the senate for all people, Indigenous and non, from all around the world. Underline. She said she understood the trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition again was difficult. She wants reforms for the Northern Territory, perhaps including moving to becoming the seventh state and increasing the representation numbers for the territory. At the end, Hanson congratulated her, lingered and gave her a hug. Cameras whirled.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Tomorrow, Shorten will still be hanging with his new bestie, <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong>. It will be the final day of the sitting week. Thanks to <strong>Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy </strong>and<strong> Greg Jericho</strong>. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>\u2019 pictures were outstanding.

High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation, the unemployment queues grow longer, and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants. Our city roads have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope due to lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments both state and federal have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. <strong>I call for a halt to further immigration and look after our aged, sick and helpless first.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:43:34.724Z\">at 9.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90901e4b0e813b694cdae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:23:47.454Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"338a213f43f20c69ef90c60df9373e24f83cb2da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/338a213f43f20c69ef90c60df9373e24f83cb2da/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Western Australian senator Pat Dodson greets NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Western Australian senator Pat Dodson greets NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:25:05.111Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90801e4b0e813b694cda9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:21:49.533Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c9200a56c808bbdf06833ec2835da4e516d6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c9200a56c808bbdf06833ec2835da4e516d6c7/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queensland senator Pauline Hanson greets Northern Territory Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland senator Pauline Hanson greets Northern Territory Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a57b9e90707155bb42cf3b3f9ca1e5ada330407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a57b9e90707155bb42cf3b3f9ca1e5ada330407/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanson hugs McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanson hugs McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:25:53.496Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90778e4b05caf65ecd098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:17:24.302Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"961a5bfacf32244f1e4d8a46a9185793ef279f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/961a5bfacf32244f1e4d8a46a9185793ef279f39/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Malarndirri McCarthy delivers her first speech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Malarndirri McCarthy delivers her first speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:26:08.852Z\">at 9.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90650e4b0e813b694cda5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:14:55.429Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, I have located that final quote from <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can guarantee the name Pauline Hanson carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability.

In case you missed it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/one-year-on-malcolm-turnbulls-brutal-reality-is-theres-no-time-like-the-present\"><strong>Katharine Murphy</strong> wrote about it last Friday</a> \u2013 which could be characterised as no time like the present. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turnbull has been acting like a prime minister with time on his hands \u2013 time to recover from an election setback, time to plug in to the great geopolitical developments of our age, time to play a part, time to determine a new agenda for a new parliament, time to do some good on a range of fronts, time to fight on and live another day, another week, another month, another term.</p> <p>Perhaps he\u2019s acutely aware of the difficulties he\u2019s in, yet he\u2019s seemed slow to grasp the harsh political realities of his post-election position \u2013 landmines everywhere, contingency everywhere.</p> <p>Here is the brutal reality facing Malcolm Turnbull as he faces his first anniversary in the job he\u2019d always wanted.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t have time.</p> <p>He has now, and he wastes now at his peril.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/malcolm-turnbull--a-year-in-charge-of-the-office-of-wicked-problems-20160912-grew85#ixzz4KBOHTf3L\">Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review</a> has written a piece today that takes a different tack. She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want.</p> <p>On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations.</p> <p>But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum.</p> <p>As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy.</p> <p>Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Discuss.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:57:25.318Z\">at 12.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d88e46e4b067ad3008770e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:44:59.757Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together.

  "<p>The European Union is facing an existential crisis, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will say on Wednesday, as he announces a raft of economic and security plans in the search for common ground in the wake of the British vote to leave.</p> <p>In his annual state of the union address to the European parliament, Juncker will say commonality between EU member states has never been so low, with governments everywhere quicker to say what they don\u2019t want from Brussels rather than work together.<br></p> <p>The EU executive hopes to find the elusive common ground with a plan to boost the EU\u2019s infrastructure fund by increasing its value to \u20ac500bn (\u00a3425bn). Juncker will also press for speedy implementation of a recently agreed law to create an EU border and coastguard to ensure better control of migrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/expel-hungary-from-eu-for-hostility-to-refugees-says-luxembourg\">a poisonous diplomatic spat between Luxembourg and Hungary</a> over the treatment of asylum seekers underlined just how difficult it will be to find agreement on the migration crisis. At least 3,169 people died or went missing in an attempt to reach Europe during the first eight months of the year.<br></p> <p>Juncker\u2019s speech, which was still getting the finishing touches on Tuesday night, comes just two days before EU leaders meet in Bratislava for a summit without Britain, aimed at charting a way forward for the EU after Brexit.<br></p> <p>Neither event is expected to result in detailed discussions on the EU27 strategy for dealing with the UK as it heads towards the EU exit.</p> <p>Juncker will, however, refer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">the murder of a Polish factory worker</a> in Harlow, Essex, as he speaks out against violence and discrimination.</p> <p>EU officials are increasingly resigned to the likelihood that the UK is unlikely to trigger article 50 in the near future, a fact that causes varying degrees of angst.</p> <p>Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, who will meet Theresa May in London next week, called on the British government to trigger article 50 by the end of the year to provide clarity and avoid \u201cweakening\u201d the EU. \u201cTo wait more than a year is completely counter-productive,\u201d he told the Guardian and five continental papers. </p> <p>He dismissed the argument \u2013 advanced by some British government sources \u2013 that it would be better to wait until French and German elections are over, before triggering article 50 in late 2017. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not an acceptable argument. There are always elections in the European Union in some member states.\u201d Waiting until after Germany\u2019s elections in autumn 2017 could mean the UK would still be an EU member during the next round of European elections, throwing up complications for all sides. But the British government is unlikely to be face immediate pressure from other governments to trigger exit talks. </p> <p>In a letter to the 27 governments sent before the meeting, the man organising the summit, European council president, Donald Tusk, said it would be \u201ca fatal error to assume that the negative result in the UK referendum represents a specifically British issue\u201d.</p> <p>He writes that \u201cit is true that the leave campaign was full of false arguments and unacceptable generalisations\u201d, but the Brexit vote was also \u201ca desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily\u201d, citing border control and the fight against terrorism.<br></p> <p>\u201cPeople in Europe want to know if the political elites are capable of restoring control over events and processes which overwhelm, disorientate, and sometimes terrify them. Today many people, not only in the UK, think that being part of the European Union stands in the way of stability and security.\u201d</p> <p>The EU institutions are converging on the idea that Europe needs to concentrate on practical policies; both the nuts and bolts of deepening the single market and extending it to the internet through a digital single market will feature in Juncker\u2019s speech.<br></p> <p>Brussels insiders share frustration that national governments are reluctant to defend EU policies and complain that ministers lack EU knowledge, sometimes unaware when they say \u201csomething must be done\u201d, that a policy already exists, or is being discussed.</p> <p>According to Schulz, too many governments want to cherry pick the bits of the EU they liked, such as generous European funding for poorer regions, while ignoring the bits they don\u2019t. If countries continued to take the advantages without fulfilling their duties, this would end in \u201cdestroying the European Union\u201d he said. </p> <p>In his speech, Juncker will also mount a defence of trade policy, amid ongoing doubts about whether the controversial transatlantic trade deal (TTIP) can ever be agreed, as well as questions over ratifying the EU-Canada trade deal, which was seven years in the making.</p> <p>Tusk echoes this qualified defence of trade deal. \u201cFailing to reach trade agreements ... will inevitably create an impression that Brexit has sparked a process of eliminating us from the global game,\u201d he said. But future trade agreements can only work by restoring trust of workers, consumers and entrepreneurs.<br></p>",

Research suggests that children start forming money habits from the age of seven, whereas parents leave discussing saving until their kids are nine.\u201d<br></p> <p>Zivoder says the future of pocket money is digital. \u201cIn 2015, more than half of UK transactions were cashless. </p> <p>\u201cToday, one in 10 people use their smartphone to check their spending each day.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Parental control</h2> <p>Mother-of-four, Angela Davies, lives with husband Neill in the Hampshire village of Sway. \u201cMy youngest is 14 and two have left home now, but we\u2019ve used goHenry since 2012. Often I\u2019d forget to get cash out for pocket money,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy kids were too young for bank accounts \u2013 and the nearest branch is four miles away anyway.\u201d<br></p> <p>Davies says goHenry has provided a convenient way to make weekly pocket money payments from her bank account on to a goHenry debit card, while setting individual purchase and weekly spending limits. \u201cMy daughter can tag items of clothing \u2013 she loves Jack Wills \u2013 then she can see her pocket money building up until she can afford to buy them.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was also able to list tasks, so they could automatically earn more by doing household chores, such as washing the car. When your kids buy things you get a notification, too. It sounds more Big Brother than I mean it to,\u201d she smiles.</p> <p>However, while it is useful for parents to know how their child is spending their cash, is this level of parental monitoring and control is really necessary? </p> <p>After all, children learn by making mistakes.<em> \u201c</em>Our customers see it differently to controlling their kids,\u201d says Zivoder. \u201cThe rules enable parents to feel confident handing over freedom and independence to their kids to manage money, allowing them to learn by doing it within a safe environment.\u201d</p> <h2>Growth ambitions</h2> <p>Zivoder, a London-based father of two, has worked in e-commerce since 2006 when he launched Expedia in France. \u201cI joined goHenry from lynda.com, an online learning platform sold to LinkedIn for $1.5bn in May 2015. My specialty is scaling consumer web businesses.\u201d <br><br>He says the biggest challenge they have faced is creating the market. Because it\u2019s a new product, parents weren\u2019t necessarily searching for it on Google. However, more than 300,000 people now use goHenry, says Zivoder. <br></p> <h2>Niche focus<br></h2> <p>Warren Mead, banking partner at professional services firm <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/uk/en/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">KPMG</a>, believes there\u2019s plenty of room for new entrants in niche areas within the UK banking sector. \u201cThe strategy of some startups and small firms is to partner with large banks. Others are taking market share by targeting profitable niche areas, such as specialist lending and international payments. Many are growing quickly as a result. We\u2019ve seen a wave of digital-only and mobile-only banking entrants, but they\u2019re at an early stage, so it\u2019s difficult to assess their success.\u201d<br></p> <p> Mead says a key challenge that startups and smaller firms face in the banking sector is winning customers, because of high levels of inertia. \u201cJust 2% of banking customers switch current accounts each year, while 30% switch their car insurance,\u201d he explains. \u201cSignificant investment is also required, usually, and you must have a genuinely appealing idea, of course. But it can be done, especially if a large organisation backs you.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

This has been at the heart of the research work commissioned and funded by the PTES and BHPS.</p> <p>For urban hedgehogs the problems are fairly obvious, but exacerbated by the recently discovered need for them to have a much larger home range that expected. A viable population of hedgehogs requires, in the best possible habitat (imagine a large park with plenty of interconnected gardens surrounding it) at least 90 hectares of unfragmented habitat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/hegehogs-disappearing-fast-need-champions\">Hedgehogs are disappearing fast \u2013 gardeners to the rescue | Patrick Barkham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This gets to the heart of the hedgehogs\u2019 problem. Their habitat is fragmented into pieces that are too small to sustain a population. So hedgehogs will still be present, but numbers may be dwindling even as we enjoy their company on a balmy evening.</p> <p>To deal with this <a href=\"http://www.hedgehogstreet.org\">Hedgehog Street</a> was launched. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/22/hegehogs-disappearing-fast-need-champions\">plan is simple</a>: people love having wildlife in their gardens and thrill at the birds, bees, bats and butterflies that make use of the ecologically sensitive planting \u2013 but they forget that not all wildlife has wings. So, we make a hole in the fence (talk to your neighbour first of course) and get them to do the same and on to the next \u2013 spreading hedgehog love along the street.</p> <p>The success has been a delight, 40,000 households are now signed up. And there are bigger projects using the same idea \u2013 in Oxford, Stockport, Chester, Solihull and Ipswich. People are reaching out beyond just their streets and into the wider community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07dc7482a89a051f8cd477e4e89d22a6cdedb0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07dc7482a89a051f8cd477e4e89d22a6cdedb0d/0_279_4496_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hedgehog in garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hedgehogs give us all a chance to getting really close, nose-to-nose, with a wild animal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Bowler/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fences are not the only obstacles, of course. Hedgehogs have a much-mocked relationship with cars and roads \u2013 and it is likely that at least 100,000 are killed each year (probably more than 10% of the population). Keeping hedgehogs off roads is never going to be easy, better that motorists drive at night with a little more care for wildlife.</p> <p>Our rural hedgehogs have been suffering an even more dramatic population decline and here the reasons become a little contentious. There is no escaping the fact that where there are more badgers there are fewer hedgehogs. But as <a href=\"http://www.countryfile.com/blog/hedgehog-decline-are-badgers-blame\">I have argued before</a>, to blame badgers for this state of affairs is ecologically illiterate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2015/nov/07/hedgehogs-sow-grow-repeat-gardening-podcast\">Hedgehogs: Sow, Grow, Repeat Autumn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Badgers and hedgehogs have coexisted in this country since at least the retreat of the last ice sheet some 10,000 years ago. They are species that compete for the same food \u2013 macroinvertebrates such as worms. What has changed in recent years is industrial agriculture and its massive impact on the amount of this food in the soil, affecting both hedgehogs and badgers alike. Badgers have the advantage in that they can predate hedgehogs. They also create a climate of fear, in effect fragmenting the landscape for the hedgehogs as effectively as a busy road.</p> <p>What can we do for rural hedgehogs? Ensure that there is sufficient food and shelter for them. They are not called hedgehogs on a whim, they really do hog the hedges, and these need to be hedges with enough density to allow them to shelter away from badgers. Food will return to the field margins if farmers can be encouraged to not strip-mine the life out of the land.</p> <p>Hedgehog numbers throughout Britain have declined because of us; because of the way we use and abuse the land. Yet hedgehogs are an important species to us \u2013 we regularly vote it as <a href=\"http://www.discoverwildlife.com/british-wildlife/britains-national-species-revealed\">our favourite animal</a>. But I believe their importance runs deeper.</p> <p>Hedgehogs give us all a chance to getting really close, nose-to-nose, with a wild animal. They have no flight or fight response; they roll into a ball when bothered. So you can wait, quietly, for them to relax. As they do, you get to see their bright beady eyes and just possibly you might open your heart to them a little more. Which is good for all wildlife. Hedgehogs are like a gateway drug for falling in love with the natural world.</p>",

  "<p>Persuading councils to accommodate more refugees is a delicate art, but it is one that David Simmonds \u2013 who has overseen a successful drive to get councils to find homes for 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees \u2013 has begun to master.</p> <p>Earlier this month the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-anniversary-of-government-commitment-to-resettle-20000-syrian-refugees\" title=\"\">government announced that homes had been found for all the Syrian refugees the UK had committed to house</a>, and about 2,800 had arrived. Simmonds, who chairs the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, describes this (with understated satisfaction) as a \u201cgood achievement\u201d and \u201cone of the success stories\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/child-refugees-theresa-may-yvette-cooper\">Child refugees: Theresa May should be ashamed, says Yvette Cooper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he is doubtful about whether a parallel commitment to give sanctuary to an unspecified number of unaccompanied refugee children can be achieved with the same speed, unless the government allocates more money to help councils across the UK to meet the \u201cstonkingly huge\u201d cost of caring for&#xa0;them.</p> <p>As deputy leader of Hillingdon council, in west London, since 2002, the 40-year-old Conservative councillor has had plenty of experience of accommodating lone refugee children, who, even before the start of the refugee crisis last year, often arrived at Heathrow, in his area. In his job with the LGA\u2019s asylum taskforce, he has watched the numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children double to 4,000 last year, and seen some councils (particularly Kent, with its port at Dover) struggle to cope.</p> <p>He believes that councils have the capacity to help many more children, and is sympathetic to the argument that Britain has a responsibility to help other European nations to share the burden of finding homes for the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-minors-idUKKCN0XT15M\" title=\"\">estimated 85,000 asylum-seeking children travelling alone</a>. This was the argument made by the Kindertransport refugee and Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/alf-dubs-antisemitism-islamophobia-racism\" title=\"\">Alf Dubs</a>, as he successfully pushed the government into a U-turn on its child migrant policy. The Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act committed the UK to taking a share of these children. Yet, since the legislation was passed,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\" title=\"\"> no child has been brought to the UK</a>.

There are no protests saying they shouldn\u2019t be here. Even Ukip has been quite balanced about it,\u201d he says, during an interview at the LGA\u2019s Westminster headquarters. \u201cImmigration is a hugely polarising debate. Opinion polls show the country is pretty divided, but I\u2019ve been struck by the willingness of councils to help.\u201d</p> <p>This was partly because the call for council cooperation came in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\" title=\"\">the death of Alan Kurdi</a>, the Syrian three-year-old who drowned as he fled the war a year ago, at a time when public opinion had firmly accepted the moral need to give sanctuary to more refugees from Syria.</p> <p>More crucially, it was because the government allocated clear funding to councils, to help meet the cost of housing refugee families, so that services for local residents would not be affected. About \u00a38,000 per individual for the first year, dropping to a smaller sum by 2020, has been put aside by the government to help subsidise the considerable costs involved in setting families up in the UK. Until there is similar clarity, indicating that the \u201cgovernment is genuinely committed to funding and supporting the children\u201d, councils will remain cautious about agreeing to accommodate more refugee children who have travelled across Europe alone, says Simmonds. \u201cIt is no good saying sentimentally: \u2018Yes, we want to help,\u2019 unless you are also willing to say what this means in practice.\u201d</p> <p>At present, councils get central government funding for the first year the child is with them, but after that the funding arrangements are still unclear. Given that a foster care placement can cost up to \u00a3140,000, this is a difficult cost to meet without help.</p> <p>\u201cCouncils are saying, \u2018If you want us to start taking on large numbers of children, there has to be evidence that it will be properly resourced.\u2019 If children are in the care of a council, that council will be responsible until they are 25; there could be university costs. There is a very big bill potentially attached to that. No council wants to be in a position where, having taken people in, they are then having to say we can\u2019t afford to support them\u2026 Our concern for the Dubs amendment was that it didn\u2019t envisage what was the long-term plan for all these children.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/may/19/kindertransport-survivors-todays-child-refugees-nicholas-winton\">Kindertransport survivors on today's child refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The success of the Syrian refugee commitment was in part due to the fact that a dedicated minister for settling Syrian refugees was appointed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-office-minister-with-responsibility-for-syrian-refugees-appointed\" title=\"\">Richard Harrington \u2013 </a>who set up a team to implement the pledge, and worked closely with councils to establish how best to help.

Harrington\u2019s job no longer exists, and there has been no team created for child refugees. \u201cIf we want to bring in significant numbers of children, then you need a similar team focused on that task, which we don\u2019t have,\u201d says&#xa0;Simmonds.</p> <p>But he is broadly optimistic about the capacity for refugees to be a force for good for local communities, if the process of finding them the right homes is sensitively handled. He understands why some councils have offered to take many families, while others, particularly in London and the south-east, have not committed themselves to housing any. This geographical division has been described as \u201casylum apartheid\u201d, but Simmonds says it is only logical that areas with available housing will be more ready to help.</p> <p>\u201cIn London, the south-east and Bristol, councils have been struggling to keep up with a massive expansion in the population, so understandably they are not rushing to be at the front of the queue. But there are other parts of the country, including some of the rural areas, where the population has been declining, and actually that has put different pressures on services \u2013 how do you run a school if all your classrooms are half empty?\u201d In many of these areas, he argues that the arrival of refugees will help the local economy.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be that for the first couple of years, they may need councils to find them somewhere to live and they may be claiming benefits, but once they are settled they can be an important part of the UK economy.

  "<p>There have been numerous brilliant documentaries made since 9/11, about the day nearly 3,000 people were killed in the largest ever terrorist attack on US soil, and its aftermath. Fifteen years on, if broadcasters had an ounce of courage or grace they would just rerun the best of them to mark each passing anniversary. Instead, we have <strong>9/11: Truth, Lies and Conspiracies </strong>(ITV) which, while not as bad as it could have been, nevertheless marks the year the sound of barrel-scraping began to drown out the sound of history.</p> <p>The film gave airtime to three kinds of believers. First there were the \u201ctruthers\u201d, such as multimillionaire venture capitalist Jimmy Walter who remains convinced that explosives were used to blow up the towers to provide a pretext for the US government to take the country to war and boost the military-industrial complex. Then came the cover-up theorists who insist that government agencies are refusing to admit the mistakes they made, and that 9/11 could have been averted. Lastly were the conspiracy theorists, who claim that successive governments have lied about Saudi Arabian involvement in the attacks to protect national business interests.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/donald-trump-9-11-comments-since-2001\">Donald Trump and 9/11: the lies, exaggerations and eye-popping claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There wasn\u2019t enough information, though, to allow viewers to assess the value or likely truth (or \u201ctruth\u201d) of competing claims.

  "<p>Systemically, 2016 has been a tragic time for women in the criminal justice system. A combination of political, legal and social factors has contributed to the now 2,876 female prisoners in Australia, with the number rising at an unprecedented rate, twice as fast as for men.<br></p> <p>Is this the result of ice-crazed women rampaging our streets committing heinous acts? No, it\u2019s not. Crime in our community has in fact decreased and for the most part women are being convicted for minor, non-violent offences.</p> <p>Having once been there myself, and now working to support those in the system, I can assure you that it\u2019s a terrible and deteriorating climate. My experiences are significantly different to those of my clients only because I broke the same laws in a different era. In truth, the system has never been completely fair, but somewhere along the way we allowed it to worsen. We allowed our policies to ostracise and stigmatise our community\u2019s most vulnerable and traumatised women. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly\">Why we should close women's prisons and treat their crimes more fairly | Mirko Bagaric</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I manage the Women in Prison Advocacy Network (WIPAN), an organisation dedicated to advancing the prospects and wellbeing of women affected by the criminal justice system.

It\u2019s not our vast range of academic qualifications that crowned us with this title, although we have them; this job requires respect, trust and mutual understanding.</p> <p>Who I once was made me the person I am today, and who I am today makes me the kind of worker capable of delivering a compassionate and acutely aware service, underpinned by a complete absence of judgment. It is this grassroots approach that transforms lives and proves that we can indeed turn the prison numbers around.</p> <p>My clients present to me the kind of torture that is the spitting image of my past. I was addicted to heroin, back when heroin was the equivalent of ice. I met all the appalling stereotypes. My value for life deteriorated so dramatically that pondering my departure from this world was the only time I felt a sense of peace and relief. I carelessly flirted with death for two and a half years and for some unknown reason I woke up after every overdose still alive and kicking. I wasted hundreds of dollars a day just to feel normal \u2013 not high, just well enough to walk. Every day I was faced with my Catch 22 \u2013 find the money and risk being caught, or don\u2019t find the money and endure the torture. Sure enough, I got caught. </p> <p>To me, I was an extremely ill young woman who eventually became a criminal. According to our law, I was <em>just</em> a criminal. Denied bail, I was thrown some green clothes and on the butcher truck I went. Fortunately, this happened in an era that afforded me something our current policies now forbid, and that was to re-apply for bail a few days later. </p> <p>I was released from prison to engage in a community diversionary program, one that would allow me to have a real crack at rehabilitation. It was an awfully intense, confronting battle and it required more courage and hard work than sitting in a cell for twelve months, but had I not been granted that opportunity I would not be the contributing member of society that I am today. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to me, simultaneous to my self-medicating behaviours, history was being made overseas as UK Labour MP, Baroness Jean Corston led a <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/corston-report-march-2007.pdf\">review into the many injustices</a> affecting women in the UK. The Corston Report was evidence-based and written by a woman of significance and credibility. It was a recipe for immediate change. Forty-one of her 43 recommendations were implemented in the UK and slowly, but surely, the number of women in UK prisons began to drop. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/suicide-california-womens-prison-mental-health\">'The system failed her': behind a suicide spike at a California women's prison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baroness Corston will visit Australia this week.

Through changes in government, cuts in funding, and other factors, it seems much of Corston\u2019s great work has come undone and we must learn from this. We must ensure any replications of Corston\u2019s work are sustainable. </p> <p>Let us strive to emulate the good work in the UK and ensure that here in Australia, changes to current policy determine our future rather than just offering us a place in history.</p> <p>I can confidently say that I will never again touch drugs or engage in crime. I hope in future years many more women will be able to say the same, and that our collective lessons learned will help us break this tragic cycle.</p>",

He said that climate change was a \u201cscam\u201d and implied that it was some sort of conspiracy between all the major international research agencies. \u201c ... there is no data proving human use of hydro-carbon fuels affects climate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Most news outlets had stopped covering the views of climate science deniers in regular reporting. There is a clear scientific consensus that the world is warming and that human carbon emissions have caused it, so reporting the views of a few non-experts who push fanciful theories with no credible evidence is seen as \u201cfalse balance\u201d.</p> <p>But journalists are in a different position when someone in an important office holds such views.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/qa-brian-cox-brings-graphs-malcolm-roberts\">Q&amp;A smackdown: Brian Cox brings graphs to grapple with Malcolm Roberts</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Discussing whether the Guardian would publish letters from climate change deniers, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/27/publishing-letters-climate-change-deniers\">readers\u2019 editor wrote in 2013</a>: \u201cSometimes the identity of a person expressing an opinion is as interesting as the thing being expressed.

But as a senator his views may affect legislation and the terms of the debate that influence it. So those views are newsworthy, particularly in the early part of his term when many Australians will be becoming aware of him for the first time. Guardian Australia will report them when that is warranted on grounds of public policy debate.</p> <p> But to avoid repeatedly having to debunk Roberts\u2019 views, we have produced a handy reference list of his main arguments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/16/qa-brian-cox-brings-graphs-malcolm-roberts\">as outlined on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on 15 August</a>.

Superimposed over global warming, that variability can speed up or slow down the warming trend we see.</p> <p>Short periods of slower cooling are expected as a result of weather events such as La Ni\u00f1a.</p> <p>This probably happened between 1998 and about 2013 (although some scientists have controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/global-warming-hasnt-paused-study-finds\">suggested it may not have happened at all</a>). 1998 was a record hot year, and if you look only at the 15 years that followed, temperatures didn\u2019t increase much. </p> <p>Of course, choosing a record hot year as your starting point is cheating \u2013 just as choosing a record cold year would be.

The first is to deny there is a warming trend, or that it is unusual, as in the \u201chiatus\u201d claim.</p> <p>When scientists point out that the data contradicts the claim, climate change deniers sometimes resort to conspiracy theories. In this case, Roberts argues that all the major science organisations around the world have collaborated, manipulating climate data to suppress temperatures in the 30s and 40s, thereby making today\u2019s temperatures look unusual.</p> <p>The weird thing here is that Roberts isn\u2019t even getting the conspiracy theory right. The theory he is thinking of \u2013 which even most climate change deniers now reject \u2013 is not that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s, but that specifically temperatures just in the US were higher than today.</p> <p>Climate scientists used to believe that was the case. Even then, they knew the world as a whole was warming, so the scientific discussion revolved around trying to explain the spatial variation \u2013 why temperatures in the US were different.

More than 15 years ago, Nasa\u2019s method of doing so resulted in the conclusion that US temperatures were unusually high in the 30s and 40s.</p> <p>Then Nasa expanded the data set it used to include information about ocean temperatures and corrected for the then well-documented <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/terra/news/heat-islands.html\">\u201curban heat island\u201d effect</a>.</p> <p>The changes didn\u2019t alter the trend much but did mean that the hottest year on record in the US became 1998 rather than 1934. As data and understanding improved, further adjustments were made by Nasa in 2011, which revealed more of a warming trend across the US.</p> <p>All the changes <a href=\"http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ha02300a.html\">were discussed by Nasa</a> at <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/GHCNM-v3.2.0-FAQ.pdf\">the time</a> but more than a decade later climate deniers picked this up and claimed it was a conspiracy.</p> <p>There is no such thing as meaningful raw data when it comes to historical temperature records \u2013 they must be interpreted. With more data and better understanding, that interpretation will change. And since several different organisations around the world do their own interpretations of the data and agree on the outcome, confidence in their results can be high.</p> <p>In any case, Roberts\u2019 claim that global temperatures were higher in the 30s and 40s is not even a conspiracy theory that is held by anyone. And the claim that Nasa secretly manipulated data to hide the fact that those decades were warmer than today in the US is plainly false.<br></p> <p>Even if temperatures in the US were higher then than they were recently \u2013 as scientists thought in 1999 \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t change the global picture, which for a long time has clearly shown increasing temperatures.</p> <h2>Trashing the models</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The models have already been proven wrong, hopelessly wrong. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>The truth is that climate models have been shown to work remarkably well.</p> <p> Models predict trends in climate, not particular events.

And so editors might be drawn to ignore his claims. But as discussed above, his views could now have relevance and importance \u2013 not because they are potentially true, but because they could influence the workings of parliament.</p> <p>On the other hand there can be the opposite drive too. His views can be such good fodder for headlines, that there is a temptation to cover everything he says. But taking that path allows politicians to manipulate the media, driving them to say even more outrageous things to garner even more headlines.</p> <p>Roberts\u2019 views should simply be reported when they are newsworthy, no more and no less. Of course this can be a tricky thing to judge, but newsrooms should be experienced at making such decisions.</p>",
  "<p>In the safe, sanitised world of the multiplex, where product placement and brand partnerships reign supreme, it\u2019s rare to see a mainstream film with the guts to double as a takedown of a multi-billion dollar company. But, after watching Peter Berg\u2019s surprisingly yet deservedly angry restaging of the 2010 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">Deepwater Horizon disaster</a>, which caused 11 deaths and the biggest oil spill in history, it\u2019ll take a minor PR miracle to restore the average moviegoer\u2019s faith in BP.</p> <p>On paper, Berg is a poor choice for the material. His last film at sea was Battleship, a soulless, swaggering Transformers knock-off based on a board game, and his last with star Mark Wahlberg was the viscerally effective but heavy-handed Navy Seals drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/30/lone-survivor-review\">Lone Survivor</a>. He also tried and failed to make something resembling an issues movie with the forgettable Saudi-set actioner The Kingdom. But for the most part in this effective disaster thriller, he keeps the flag-waving jingoism to a minimum, to focus on the devastating tragedy at hand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/17/mark-wahlberg-hustling-entire-life\">Mark Wahlberg: 'I've been hustling my entire life'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wahlberg stars as Mike Williams, an engineer who heads off to sea, leaving his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter at home. It seems like business as usual as he makes his way to Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, but once aboard, there is uncomfortable tension. His senior, a gruff Kurt Russell, is warring with visiting BP execs, who insist a drilling operation go ahead despite safety concerns. The most ruthless suit, a drawling John Malkovich, appears unmoved by complaints about faulty equipment and unfinished checks. </p> <p>When the work begins, under protest, it soon becomes clear there are major problems at play, and soon men are fighting for their lives on a burning oil rig in the middle of the sea.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4tvej\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2480455\"            data-video-name=\"Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56fa83f6e4b0465523578dd3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/29/160329DeepwaterHorizon.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/29/deepwater-horizon-mark-wahlberg-in-disaster-movie-trailer-video\">Deepwater Horizon: Mark Wahlberg in disaster movie trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s no denying the harrowing nature of the story being told, but Berg is admirably, uncharacteristically restrained. Wahlberg\u2019s family dynamic is briskly yet believably constructed, and we\u2019re spared some of the more cliched moments we\u2019d usually expect in this kind of film. There\u2019s no heavy signposting or emotional goodbye when he sets off for the rig. And once we\u2019re at sea, the dialogue is terse, tense and delivers often complex technical minutiae clearly, without anything feeling as if it has been dumbed down. </p> <p>The film also squarely, and quite rightly, places the blame for the disaster at BP\u2019s door. Without turning them into moustache-twirling villains, we see its representatives callously place profits over potential loss of human life and environmental damage. I can\u2019t recall a film that\u2019s been quite so brave or clear in its untainted bile for one particular company (\u201cmoney-hungry sonsabitches\u201d). </p> <p>When all hell breaks loose, Berg stages the action horribly well, capturing the panic and gruesome mayhem without the film ever feeling exploitative. It\u2019s spectacularly constructed, yet it doesn\u2019t forget about the loss of life, ensuring that, despite thin characterisation, the impact is felt. Sentiment is kept at bay, and it\u2019s only a treacly country song at the end, over an otherwise powerful photographic tribute, that feels a bit clumsy. </p> <p>Wahlberg, again, makes for a solid everyman, and there\u2019s a nice decision, late in the film, to focus on his shock back on land rather than a sugary reunion with his family. Russell and Malkovich riff on types they\u2019ve played before, but with predictable skill, while Jane the Virgin breakout Gina Rodriguez makes the most of a small role as a young worker who calls for help.</p> <p>Deepwater Horizon is a gruelling disaster movie and a reminder of one company\u2019s catastrophic oversights, and it stands as a worthy tribute to the brave men involved.</p>",
