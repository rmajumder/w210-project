Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign should be concerned,\u201d said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm\u2019s analysis suggests a \u201cstrong final showing for the Clinton campaign\u201d in early voting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91724e6b48fd50b00e50d62c383c3cb298c8139a/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she\u2019ll probably be the next president.</p> <p>Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting.</p> <p>While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October.</p> <p>Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she\u2019ll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama.</p> <p>In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast.</p> <p>In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent.</p> <p>By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district.</p> <p>There\u2019s more where that came from. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/8aeeaf8ed917469da03b1381cbe13d47/Early-voting:-Democrats-show-strength-in-key-battlegrounds\">Read further here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580a3eb8e4b055209adaff6f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T17:14:13.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton to meet with Black Lives Matter activists</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In advance of her rally in Cleveland, Ohio, this afternoon, Hillary Clinton will meet with Movement for Black Lives activists Brittany Packnett and DeRay Mckesson, her campaign reports.

I mean, when Michelle, you know, she had her own sort of professional life, and she was very committed, as she is now, to the kids. And so there was this understanding between them before he ran for president that you know, that was his career. She would be as supportive as she could, but she wasn\u2019t really involved. You know, she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t campaign terribly much for him in 2004 when he ran for the Senate, for example, a campaign that I was involved in.

It has a handful of allies in the House and states.</p> <p>From the Panama Canal to the Tea Party, from Phyllis Schlafly to Sarah Palin, the conservative intellectual has viewed the New Right as a sometimes annoying but ultimately worthy friend. New Right activists supplied the institutions, dollars and votes that helped the conservative intellectual reform tax, crime, welfare, and legal policy. But that is no longer the case.

Carney cut his teeth as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where the credo tends to be kill or be killed rather than turn the other cheek. Publicly, he will shrug the attacks off. Those who know him say that in private he would not have been so relaxed. \u201cHe will have have been furious, absolutely livid,\u201d said one. </p> <p>Carney could get his own back. He was lured to Britain by Osborne to take charge at Threadneedle Street in 2013 on an \u00a3800,000-a-year salary. The then-chancellor wanted the Canadian to serve for eight years but Carney said he would only stay for five. The implication was that he had political ambitions back in Canada and did not want to tie himself down in the UK for too long.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau\u2019s</a> election victory means there is not likely to be a vacancy as prime minister at any time soon. Other options have also been closed off. Carney might be considered a good bet to run the International Monetary Fund, but Christine Lagarde has just been given a second five-year term.</p> <p>As a result, the attractions of staying on at the Bank for eight years have increased over time. Having been committed to leaving in 2018, Carney has been keeping his options open and has said he will make a final decision by the end of the year.</p> <p>But is Carney ready to walk? If the governor thought that he had lost the confidence of the prime minister and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the answer would be yes. As it is, a charm offensive is being mounted to persuade him to stay.<br></p> <p>The Treasury says there is no \u201cGet Carney\u201d campaign being mounted in Whitehall. On the contrary, Hammond went out of his way in New York earlier this month to say he wanted the governor to stay on until 2021. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>For her part, May took immediate steps to smooth things over with the Bank as soon as it became clear that her comments were being interpreted as an attack on the governor. Downing Street called Threadneedle Street on the morning after the speech to say sorry. The Bank accepted the apology and says it was a cock-up rather than a conspiracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/criticising-mark-carney-tory-hobby-bank-england-governor\">How criticising Mark Carney became the new Tory sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The backdrop to the debate about the governor\u2019s future is the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Sterling has fallen sharply on the foreign exchanges, the economy is slowing and the Treasury is planning to announce higher borrowing in the autumn statement next month. Former members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee say this is not a good time to be questioning Threadneedle Street\u2019s independence or to be pushing the governor towards the exit.</p> <p>Former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Carney should go. To remove him in a way that looks political would be really, really unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Another former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, thinks there is an argument for changing the Bank\u2019s inflation target in order to make life easier for savers and pensioners, but added: \u201cThe government has got so much on its plate with Brexit that it does not want to go and pick a fight with the Bank of England.\u201d</p> <p>Those who know the governor say the decision is finely poised but won\u2019t be affected by what is written about him.

  "<p>Not since Delia Smith retired from TV cookery has an era of British baking come to such a dramatic and nationally-mourned close. On Wednesday night, the BBC will broadcast its final ever episode of the Great British Bake Off, the show that over seven seasons has become nothing short of an institution and elevated its former contestants to television royalty.</p> <p>The tensest battle in baking will be fought between PE teacher Candice Brown, jet engine engineer Andrew Smyth and garden designer Jane Beedle, who, over seven weeks, have had regular audiences of more than 10 million gripped with sagas of leaking fish pies, collapsed meringues and flat yorkshire puddings.</p> <p>The end of the BBC era of Bake Off means the revered title of Bake Off winner comes with added sentimental value this year. After negotiations between the show\u2019s creator, Love Productions, and the BBC broke down last month, it was announced that the series would be moving to Channel 4, who had agreed a \u00a325m-a-year deal.</p> <p>It was a decision that proved controversial and costly for Bake Off. The show\u2019s beloved presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc swiftly announced they would not be \u201cfollowing the dough\u201d, and their departure was mirrored by judge Mary Berry, who said her allegiance was with the BBC. Of the original Bake Off line-up only Paul Hollywood will be appearing in its new incarnation on Channel 4 in 2018.</p> <p>Yet one thing remains certain, a lucrative future lies ahead for whoever is crowned the Bake Off winner on Wednesday night, and even possibly for the two runners-up. </p> <p>Bake Off\u2019s greatest celebrity so far has been Nadiya Hussain, the 2015 winner whose popularity has grown from strength to strength. After signing a reported \u00a31m book deal, her recipe book has sold almost 25,000 copies since its release in June, while her children\u2019s cookbook has hit the hardback non-fiction top 20 twice already, and she has a three-book fiction deal with Harlequin in the works.</p> <p>Hussain was also the subject of a BBC documentary, The Chronicles of Nadiya, and has proved so valuable to the corporation that they have recently given her a contract to make the BBC her home for good.</p> <p>She was not alone in being in demand. Frances Quinn, who won Bake Off in 2014 \u2013 the year before it moved to BBC One and \u201creally exploded\u201d \u2013 recalled the clamour by publishers and agents to sign her up immediately. \u201cAgents were telling me they\u2019d had publishers already on the phone asking if they had signed me because they were so keen to publish my book,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I know there was a really hungry appetite for people to collaborate and create the book for me. It was more a case of not grabbing them all unthinkingly and picking ones that wouldn\u2019t just be a 15-minute flash in the pan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f50f18570b63621c3242c05c45a13d35fbdb7a21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50f18570b63621c3242c05c45a13d35fbdb7a21/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great British Bake Off Winner Frances Quinn with Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great British Bake Off Winner Frances Quinn with Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is not just recipe book offers that the next cohort of Bake Off contestants can expect. John Whaite, who won in 2013, was made the resident chef on ITV\u2019s Lorraine and is filming his own ITV cooking show, Chopping Block, as well as releasing two very successful recipe books. Jo Wheatley, winner of the second series, started up her own cookery school after winning and 2014 runner-up Ruby Tandoh and 2015 runner-up Tamal Ray both landed newspaper columns after the show. Ray, who returned to life as a doctor after his stint on Bake Off, will also be hosting Channel 4 show Be Your Own Doctor, which starts this week.</p> <p>Already a 2016 contestant, Selasi Gbormittah, who was eliminated this week, has voiced plans to open a bakery in west London and release his own recipe book off the back of his Bake Off popularity.</p> <p>Yet when Edd Kimber won the first series, such fame was not a guarantee. His book, The Boy Who Bakes, became a bestseller but not without some personal risk \u2013 and it took three months for him to get a book deal.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFor me, it was nothing like the phenomenon that it is now; there was no frenzy to get me to sign a book deal. But I was 25 and I had nothing to lose. I quit my job the day I won the show and a couple of months later I moved to London with no money and slept on a friend\u2019s couch. Thankfully, a month later I got a book deal and haven\u2019t really looked back.\u201d</p> <p>Bea Carvalho, cookery book buyer at Waterstones, said that some of their biggest-selling recipe books over the past few years had been by Bake Off contestants, and cited Hussain, Tandoh\u2019s Crumb and runner-up James Morton\u2019s bread book as the most popular.</p> <p>\u201cBy far the most successful Bake Off book so far has been Nadiya\u2019s, it\u2019s blown the others out of the water in terms of popularity,\u201d said Carvalho. \u201cIt\u2019s still in our top 10 cookbooks having been out since June, which is just incredible sales.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThere have been some fantastic books coming out of the series. Being on Bake Off does give them a terrific platform but, beyond those first-week sales, it does still depend on the quality and the book has to speak for itself. And that\u2019s where Nadiya\u2019s has really succeeded, first because she had such an incredible following and she gained a status of celebrity like none before her, but also that it\u2019s a fantastic recipe book and didn\u2019t rely on her status as a Bake Off winner. She\u2019s become a food personality in her own right.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Wednesday finale, it is still unknown what the future format of the Great British Bake Off will look like once it jumps ship to Channel 4. Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French have described the rumours they will be the next hosts as \u201ccomplete bullshit\u201d and comedian Richard Ayoade told the Guardian there was \u201cno truth\u201d to the rumours he was also in the running.</p> <p>But for Quinn, the departure of Perkins, Giedroyc and Berry means \u201cthe end of the vintage Bake Off family \u2013 it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re going to have second cousins once removed once it goes over to Channel 4.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b30cd4364c8b012f3957307fc19f27ed77cb8ed3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b30cd4364c8b012f3957307fc19f27ed77cb8ed3/0_0_4282_2855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Perkins, and Mel Giedroyc.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Perkins, and Mel Giedroyc.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Love Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quinn added: \u201cMel and Sue are absolutely instrumental to that show and it\u2019s almost like the key ingredients have all been taken apart. A lot of dough has obviously been chucked into the mix and you can\u2019t create a cake with what feels like the ingredients for making bread. It seems to me like it can only be a very different show now.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>2016 Finalists</strong></h2> <p>Candice Brown, a secondary school PE teacher from Bedfordshire, has won star baker three times. Brown\u2019s series high came in the quarter-final with her flamboyant peacock showstopper cake, while her series low was an uncooked bread loaf in episode three.</p> <p>Andrew Smyth, an engineer from Northern Ireland, has won star baker twice. His greatest success was his ice cream mousse cakes in dessert week, which made up for his disappointing cake in botanical week.</p> <p>Jane Beedle, a garden designer from London, has won star baker once. Beedle\u2019s best week came with her botanical showstopper cake, while she had a low point when she rolled her roulade.</p>",
  "<p>American football\u2019s expansion into the UK will take a major step forward when the New York Giants and the Los Angeles Rams descend on Twickenham.</p> <p>The match will be the first fixture in the National Football League (NFL), the most valuable sports league in the world, to be played in the UK outside Wembley stadium.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl\">NFL</a> started playing matches at Wembley in 2007.

Its plans were heavily backed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/02/george-osborne-nfl-american-football-team-london\">George Osborne, the former chancellor, who publicly courted the NFL and talked up the prospects of a permanent team in London.</a></p> <p>The NFL agreed a deal to play at Twickenham, the home of English rugby, as a stepping stone to expanding further in the UK and potentially establishing a permanent London-based franchise. Other scheduled events at Wembley mean it could not expand the number of matches played there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/tottenham-could-one-day-hosy-a-nfl-franchise-says-chairman-daneil-levy\">The organisation has also struck a deal to play at least two matches a year for a decade at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new stadium from 2018</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to work our way through, in a disciplined way, the issues of putting a team here so you can look everybody in the eye and show them you have done the due diligence,\u201d Waller said. \u201cTo me, the big issue for us putting a team here is that team has to be competitive.\u201d</p> <p>Waller said that the NFL\u2019s progress in the UK was ahead of their expectations and that the NFL highlight shows on the BBC are \u201cbringing in literally the youngest demographic of any show on the BBC\u201d.</p> <p>The NFL will also play a game in Mexico this year and is looking to expand in Canada, Germany and China. However, Waller insisted that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU would not change the NFL\u2019s strategy and could actually help the sport.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we have to manage that,\u201d Waller said when asked whether Brexit changed anything. \u201cOne of things you learn in an international business is that you can\u2019t control any of the environments that you operate in so you have to be agile and adept at managing changing circumstances. I don\u2019t think anybody yet knows what the implications of Brexit will be and they will be different to what we currently anticipate them to be I am sure.

While English football clubs are effectively free to spend as they wish, the NFL has a salary cap, a draft system that means the worst team in the league gets the first pick of the best college graduates, and shares the money generated from television, ticket and merchandise sales between all the teams. The NFL is effectively a socialist system in the biggest free market economy in the world.</p> <p>\u201cI think the beauty of our model is that its socially equitable and economically allows all teams to be more or less equal,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThat is the heart of what being a fan is about \u2013 the belief that any team can win on any day.

Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, thin-skinned billionaire who trades in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" title=\"\">racism</a> and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate. His jibes revealed a&#xa0;man out of his depth. His answer was to plunge down deeper. By disgracefully refusing to rule out calling this a rigged election he gave up a fight he had by then lost.</p> <p>Americans should vote for Secretary Clinton as an able and proven politician. A Trump presidency would be bad for America and dangerous for the world, so a vote for Secretary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Mr Trump has been exposed for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">questionable tax arrangements</a>, outrageous business practices and irregularities at his charity. The billionaire is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\" title=\"\">grabber and kisser</a> of women who he presumed gave consent because he was famous. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-tenth-woman-accuser\" title=\"\">numerous allegations</a> of sexual assault by Mr Trump. He has demonstrated that he has neither the conscience, training nor sense of history \u2013 and the desire to be judged well by it \u2013 to occupy the White House. Secretary Clinton possesses such attributes. She has a serious and sustained commitment on issues like education, healthcare and equality, and she has stood consistently for the rights of women, ethnic minorities, children and the disabled through her long career.</p> <p>However, there are fewer reasons to vote for Secretary Clinton than one would have hoped. For more than two decades she has been part of a political establishment that shaped a dysfunctional country. She has been unable to escape being tarnished by the most damaging policies \u2013 notably around <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36020717\" title=\"\">criminal justice</a> \u2013 of&#xa0;her husband\u2019s administration. There are well-founded concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\" title=\"\">highlighted by transcripts of her speeches</a>, that she is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on&#xa0;its excesses if&#xa0;elected.</p> <h2>The mood for change</h2> <p>Even so, as the first female president she would represent a symbolic transformative change in American politics. In some ways what Secretary Clinton has had to deal with are ingrained cultural attitudes about what success and leadership look like. These were exposed by the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">finding that Mr Trump would win if only men voted</a> and Secretary Clinton would win if only women voted. That most men favor Mr&#xa0;Trump over Secretary Clinton demonstrates at some level a more insidious sexism than the one Mr Trump peddles: that centred on the mind, not the body. It is a hostility \u2013 deeply embedded but rarely conceded \u2013 against seeing women as genuinely equal.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the 2016 presidential campaign has been one of the most confrontational contests of the modern era. The mood for change has been more pervasive and volatile, and has been supercharged by Mr Trump, a braggart with tyrannical instincts. The backdrop to this election has been genuine and understandable public anger about economic insecurity, growing inequality and frustration with elites. Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left have reflected that mood in their very different ways. That is not going to disappear after 8 November. The election has also raised real questions about the crisis of American democracy. Mr Trump encouraged violence against opponents and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">threatened to jail Secretary Clinton</a> if he took office.</p> <p>The civility that has marked out US democracy as ordered and restrained appears dead. The next president will have to resurrect it. The political topography of a polarized and resentful nation has been obscured by the preternatural equanimity of Barack Obama. Mr Trump has in some ways skilfully exploited these divisions. On social security he has moved to the left on the campaign trail, telling jobless Americans that he would <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2016/08/08/social-security-where-clinton-and-trump-stand/#6dbc02aa4f40\" title=\"\">not touch their benefits</a>. Mr Trump also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the landmark measure that increases health coverage for low-wage workers and benefits <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/health/immigrants-the-poor-and-minorities-gain-sharply-under-health-act.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">large numbers of immigrants and minorities</a>. This contrasts with the real estate magnate\u2019s offer to expand the US health programme for the elderly \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20161020/clinton-trump-tangle-on-preserving-medicare\" title=\"\">Medicare</a> \u2013 which benefits overwhelmingly older, whiter voters.</p> <p>These dog whistles have been part of American politics for decades. But they come at a time when there is a sense that there are too many losers from economic growth in the country. Driving discontent in the US is a system that no longer defuses high levels of inequality with opportunities for all. The&#xa0;middle classes <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/u-s-poverty-rate-falls-to-post-recession-low-as-incomes-gain\" title=\"\">are poorer today than in 2000</a>. Since the Great Recession the top <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/u-s-top-one-percent-of-income-earners-hit-new-high-in-2015-amid-strong-economic-growth/\" title=\"\">1% of families in the US have captured 52% of the income growth</a>. There\u2019s understandable anger that the wealthy were bailed out while ordinary Americans were hollowed out. Voters rage that, in the current incarnation of globalization, jobs that disappeared when the US decided to import rather than manufacture did not come back \u2013 they simply popped up elsewhere, usually in China.</p> <h2>The Sanders effect</h2> <p>Nowhere has this fury been more keenly felt than in the country\u2019s former manufacturing heartlands, tapping into America\u2019s long history of resistance to free trade and making protectionism a potent political force once again. The politician who has shaped the politics of the country and accounted for populist anger is Senator Sanders. The man from Vermont understood, earlier than most, that voters see the economy as rigged against them by a political system that has been corrupted by big money. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/03/the-democrats-generation-gap/\" title=\"\">His campaign was backed three to one by millennials in the Democratic primaries</a>. This month his favorability ratings in opinion polls <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/cx4orjzwhb/econTabReport.pdf\" title=\"\">are only bettered by Michelle&#xa0;Obama</a>.</p> <p>Senator Sanders\u2019 insurgent campaign has transformed Democratic politics \u2013 forcing Secretary Clinton to adopt, albeit sotto voce, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-election-democrats-sanders-commentary-idUSKCN0Y90C9\" title=\"\">key planks of his program</a> such as a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour, tuition-free public college and opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 President Obama\u2019s big trade deal. Until this week, Secretary Clinton failed to outline enough of a bold reform program. Tellingly, she offered signs of one in the final televised debate, making unprompted promises to push immigration reforms, a key Sanders point, within the first 100 days of her presidency.</p> <p>Although domestic politics has framed the campaign, Secretary Clinton\u2019s election would be greeted with relief and optimism in most world capitals other than Moscow and Damascus. Despite her <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/\" title=\"\">hawkish outlook</a>, she will have no alternative but to recognize that the 21st century no longer always looks to the United States as an indispensable hegemon, whether benign or threatening. Secretary Clinton should focus on US soft, not hard, power \u2013 dealing with climate change and working out fairer global trade arrangements.</p> <p>If Secretary Clinton is elected she must recognize the mood without pandering to its demons. She needs to bring the bold ambition about the role of government to this era that Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt each did in earlier times. She has the intelligence, the seriousness and the experience to do this. The&#xa0;US presidency is hugely powerful: 10% of all posts in federal government are allocated on the basis of political patronage. Secretary Clinton offers the best chance of ensuring those jobs go to competent people. Her choice of Treasury secretary in the aftermath of the banking crisis will be watched with special care, as will an olive branch appointment to Senator Sanders of the kind that president Obama made to her in 2008. She offers the greatest hope that the supreme court defends abortion rights and looks again at issues like campaign finance as well as background checks on gun owners. Yet America will soon find itself weakened at home and abroad if the new president is as badly served by congress as Mr Obama has been for most of his tenure.</p> <p>There is a danger, if Mrs Clinton wins, that&#xa0;the Republicans will relapse into the Hillary-hatred that has marked them for a quarter century. The tragedy of this election is&#xa0;that, to become president, Secretary Clinton has had to talk more radically than she actually felt; to be an effective president she may be compelled to act more conservatively than she&#xa0;now says she wants to do.</p>",

Let\u2019s check their teeth\u2019.\u201d By lunchtime Davies\u2019 dental test had been <a href=\"https://www.bda.org/news-centre/press-releases/dentists-welcome-clarity-as-home-office-rules-out-xrays-for-asylum-seekers\">condemned by the British Dental Association</a> as \u201cinaccurate ... inappropriate and unethical\u201d, and ruled out by the Home Office. At dinner time, when he is finishing up this interview someone from Channel 4 News spots him, and frogmarches him off to another TV studio and another appalled presenter.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get a word in edgeways with them,\u201d Davies blinks in bemusement. \u201cMy phone\u2019s been going all day. This must be what it\u2019s like to be a minister. I don\u2019t like it at all.\u201d</p> <p>While unconvinced that he does find the attention unwelcome, I do not doubt his bewilderment. For the life of him, Davies can\u2019t see why his dental test idea has set the cat among the pigeons. Most of his tweets and comments pass, as he says, unnoticed, although he caught a bit of flak for his recent suggestion that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">temporary disappearance of Marmite from some supermarket shelves</a> was a calculated bit of Bremoaning by Unilever, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidTCDavies/status/786492752959799296\">and that we should all therefore buy Vegemite instead</a>. Now, not for the first time, the backbencher is in the headlines, and wondering: what did he say that was so bad?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75e56f0f2fbd8c475cd8258e780d29dc8e533fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e56f0f2fbd8c475cd8258e780d29dc8e533fdd/107_60_2108_1266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Morgan attacked Davies for what he called the \u2018demonisation\u2019 of child refugees on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piers Morgan attacked Davies for what he called the \u2018demonisation\u2019 of child refugees on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Good Morning Britain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It quickly becomes clear \u2013 if not to Davies \u2013 that what he said was actually based on a complete misunderstanding. He tells me 12 times in the first 15 minutes that the dental test is \u201calready being used by the government\u201d. In February, he explains, he heard about a court case in his constituency involving a young Afghan man accused of assault, who claimed to be a teenager but looked older. Davies duly tabled parliamentary questions, asking <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2016-02-19/27499/\">what proportion of asylum seekers had been suspected of making fraudulent claims to be under 18</a>. Of the 500-1,000 subjected to an age assessment each year, came the written answer, between half and two thirds were judged to be over 18.</p> <p>Now Davies gets out his iPad to show me a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257462/assessing-age.pdf\">gov.uk document about how to assess an asylum seeker\u2019s age</a>, which mentions that teeth can be X-rayed \u2013 or, alternatively, wrist bones. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think we can deny the test exists!\u201d Has the dental test been conducted on the Afghan in his constituency? \u201cNo. But look.\u201d He points at the webpage. \u201cIt\u2019s a test that\u2019s already used. And written answers to my questions appear to demonstrate that the test is being used in the UK on about 500 people a year. So I\u2019m not suggesting something new.\u201d</p> <p>He is simply suggesting that we X\u2013ray the teeth of all asylum seekers in Calais who look \u201csignificantly\u201d over 18. \u201cI mean, of course, if they say they\u2019re 17 and the X-ray says 19, we\u2019d give them the benefit of the doubt.\u201d The tests would be conducted by \u201cwhoever does it at the moment. It\u2019s already being done at the moment.\u201d But the BDA, I point out, says dentists cannot perform X-rays for non-medical purposes. \u201cThat\u2019s what they are saying \u2013 but it\u2019s my understanding that it\u2019s already in use.\u201d So dentists are already doing this? \u201cEither that,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cor they\u2019re doing the wrist test.\u201d</p> <p>Disconcerted by my doubt, he presses: \u201cWould you not say that is the implication of what I\u2019ve got here?\u201d I read the gov.uk webpage closely. It comes at the very bottom of a 17-page list of non-medical methods typically used to determine an asylum seeker\u2019s age, and states that \u201cin some instances\u201d an applicant may choose to challenge the findings of those methods by submitting dental X-rays. There is no suggestion here, nor in anything else he shows me on his iPad, that X-ray dental tests can or ever have been imposed on anyone in this country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/21/david-davies-gay-marriage-interview\">David Davies, Conservative MP: 'I may well be wrong'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Davies looks taken aback. \u201cOh. Oh that\u2019s interesting. You could be right there.\u201d He leans in to study the text on his screen. \u201cMmmm. You could be right.\u201d</p> <p>After 11 years in parliament, the Welshman retains an amateurishly naive air that is both likable and troubling. He reminds me a lot of Alan Partridge. When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/21/david-davies-gay-marriage-interview\">first interviewed him four years ago</a>, he had just called gay marriage \u201cbarking mad\u201d on Radio Wales, and was astonished by the exception taken to his assertion that \u201cmost parents would prefer their children not to be gay\u201d. Now, as then, the cold certainties of his rightwing pronouncements are difficult to square with their tentative, self-effacing delivery. But if he had seemed out of his depth in 2012, his guilelessness today feels more like the self-belief of someone who knows that even if people still don\u2019t like what he says, now they have to listen.</p> <p>Notwithstanding his misreading of current practice, if a dental test is such an innocuous idea, why does he think it has caused uproar? He considers this in silence for eight seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to ask your readers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be the first to get angry about it.\u201d Some critics have suggested a dental test evokes slave traders examining teeth in order to determine a slave\u2019s market value. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d Then there are its echoes of concentration camps where Nazis plundered Jews\u2019 teeth for their gold. Davies looks amazed. \u201cI just don\u2019t see this at all. I think some people are trying to make a rather tortuous analogy here. I just don\u2019t get that at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecb971beef8f32b4f813e19eccb77b1cd61d4527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecb971beef8f32b4f813e19eccb77b1cd61d4527/24_291_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young refugee who arrived from the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp in Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young refugee who arrived from the \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp in Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he brightens. \u201cShould I try to say, \u2018If dental tests are causing an issue and the wrist test is accurate, let\u2019s go with the wrist one\u2019? I don\u2019t really mind. I can\u2019t really see the analogy with slavery or concentration camps \u2013 but if that is the main sticking point here, fine, let\u2019s do wrists! I don\u2019t mind me being tested, by the way. No, no, no. Bring it on. If someone thinks this is outrageous, well I\u2019ll be the first to volunteer. Come and X-ray my wrist! Have a look at my teeth! People are saying this is a really intrusive thing to do \u2013 well, I don\u2019t feel intruded upon. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p> <p>Davies talks as if oblivious to any connection between how refugees are discussed in Westminster and treated in public. The purpose of a dental test, he keeps saying, is not to \u201ckeep people out\u201d but to ensure that provision intended for migrant children is not misappropriated by sharp-elbowed adults. But however good his intentions, or pragmatic his proposal, does he not see that talk of mandatory dental tests dehumanises refugees? That when discussing the most vulnerable of youngsters, tone matters as much as logic?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m slightly concerned that this argument is being used to stifle debate, and that stifling of debate is likely to cause anger. I saw it when people said the Leave campaign might not have encouraged hate crime, but that there\u2019s a correlation between the Leavers and hate crimes. And I refute this.\u201d He sees no causal link between the referendum and the dramatic spike in hate crimes? \u201cNo. I think it\u2019s a case of people who lost the referendum trying to use the allegation that their opponents have caused totally unacceptable crimes to shut down debate. And I sense this happening again now. I worry slightly that anyone who raises any kind of concern at all about this is immediately sort of likened to a Nazi slave trader or to someone who supports violence. For the record,\u201d he adds, channelling pure Partridge, \u201cI\u2019m totally and utterly opposed to hate crimes of any sort.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/hate-surged-after-eu-referendum-police-figures-show\">He doesn\u2019t think hate crimes have gone up at all</a>. \u201cThe government has just made them easier to report.\u201d</p> <p>Before entering parliament, Davies had been a Territorial Army soldier, a special constable and a lorry driver for his father\u2019s haulage company. His approach to a debate is anecdotal rather than academic, with a tendency to fixate upon individual sources or details that risks making him come across as rather credulous. Someone told him that an asylum seeker in Wales with grey hair had claimed to be 17, and he references this constantly. He believes our courts use dental tests because \u201can MP who\u2019s a lawyer told me\u201d, and when I ask for examples of British \u201chospitality being abused\u201d, he reverts back to the case of the Afghan asylum seeker in Monmouthshire. The sexual significance of owning Erasure albums had preoccupied him greatly during our previous interview about gay marriage, and now he appears to have inferred an awful lot from one gesture a migrant made to him during a recent visit to \u201cthe Jungle\u201d camp in Calais.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b42ff2ccf3a230f151bd79e351af43f0edd58520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b42ff2ccf3a230f151bd79e351af43f0edd58520/234_497_6325_3796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Davies addressing the Welsh Conservatives spring conference earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davies addressing the Welsh Conservatives spring conference earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI asked one person why he came, and he made a gesture to suggest he would find it easier here to find cash-in-hand.\u201d Davies also saw a caravan that displayed a sign offering to coach asylum seekers in what to say to UK immigration officers. \u201cSo, it\u2019s obvious that people are looking for ways to circumvent the rules. They want to come to the UK for a better standard of living.

I used to go out and then head up to the mountainside in my uniform and sit there on my own all day.</p> </blockquote> <p>As with many man-made disasters, the bereaved then faced a battle with the authorities to get the true nature of what happened recognised. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/21/aberfan-survivors-mark-50th-anniversary-of-disaster\">As my colleague Steven Morris wrote today</a>, one father stood up during an inquest after the cause of his child\u2019s death had been given as asphyxia and multiple injuries and declared: \u201cNo, sir, buried alive by the National Coal Board.

It is simply too large and too centralised, for example patients shouldn't need to travel to a central hospital for an ultrasound; patients and their families shouldn't need to explain the same symptoms/history at every shift change to all the new staff. While emergency care is amazing the primary care can be completely patchy depending on where you're unlucky to be ill. In many European countries private capacity is incorporated into health services and it works remarkably well without fears of money grabbing or lousy service. The problem with the Tory approach is that privatisation never really works in the UK, because making profits becomes paramount and share ownership promoted as a virtuous ideal - there are scant examples of real value and improvements being delivered by privatisation. So the problem is a psychological British one: why can't we do privatisation to actually improve service? Other countries do.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809dda3e4b0cd26ff71f73c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/guardian-readers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T13:42:26.068Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are baby boxes on the way for Scotland?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another conversation our team of moderators found particularly interesting this week (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/oct/21/baby-boxes-the-nhs-join-our-live-look-at-the-week-to-discuss?page=with:block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c#block-5809dccfe4b055209adafd6c\">see 13:35</a>) was around this article on baby boxes in Scotland.

It is scary to suddenly come across part of the British population who must have had a simmering anti-foreign sentiment for a long time. I've lived here longer than I lived in my native country and if someone is asking me now if I wanted to become British to make my life here secure, I think I would have to be nearly desperate to do so as this country is split, with nationalism raising its ugly head. Having read plenty of blogs, I can't but help that many of the people having voted BREXIT have done so because they felt left behind and unheard and are under the impression that they will get back what the lost over the last 40 or so years. What they want back cannot be got back as what they want is for globalisation to go away, as the world is so meshed up now that you can't have control as one has to compromise in this globalised world. If people think that foreign people undercut their own wages, ask if something produced or service rendered more expensive than created or done by people in another country will not be left unbought, making it unproductive so that said UK worker will be out of a job soon, never mind if the competition is working within the UK or in another country.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think?

  "<p>It had been a long, long, Thursday evening at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-awkward-eu-meeting-sees-little-progress-on-brexit\">European council summit</a> for Theresa May. First she had had to listen to loads of boring speeches about things she wasn\u2019t very interested in and then she had got stuck next to a French bloke who\u2019d insisted on talking to her in French. What was wrong with the EU these days? Back in David Cameron\u2019s time, everyone used to speak in English.</p> <p>Eventually her frustration had got the better of her and she had turned to the Frenchman to ask why her speech was only number 15 on the agenda.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas </em>16 items<em> sur</em> the agenda,\u201d the Frenchman had said, while swigging another tumbler of merlot.</p> <p>The time passed slowly. Ten o\u2019clock came and went. Eleven o\u2019clock came and went. Midnight came and went. Just after 1am, a steward tapped her on the shoulder to let her know there was a spare five minutes if she had anything she wanted to get off her chest while the few remaining people still awake finished their coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you all about Brexit,\u201d Theresa had begun.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Parlez \u00e0 la main</em>,\u201d shouted a lone Belgian, before falling off his chair.</p> <p>Theresa continued, determined not to be distracted. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that Brexit means Brexit and that the UK remains committed to getting whatever deal with the EU we can manage to negotiate once we\u2019ve got some sort of a clue what it is we really want. <em>Merci</em>, <em>danke</em>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/brexit-a-linguistic-guide-for-theresa-may\">Le Brexit: a linguistic guide for Theresa May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Silence.

The <em>\u00e9paule</em> had never seemed so <em>froide</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI think that went quite well on the whole,\u201d Theresa said later to one of her advisers.</p> <p>\u201cEr, yes ...\u201d the adviser replied, guardedly. \u201cI suppose you were at least invited to this summit. We only got to hear about the last one in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/bratislava-summit-donald-tusk-urges-eu-leaders-not-to-waste-brexit-crisis\">Bratislava</a> after it had finished.\u201d</p> <p>Things didn\u2019t really pick up that much the following morning. On her way into the meeting, she had heard the European commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/15/brexit-vote-years-of-lies-eu-jean-claude-juncker\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, whisper he wasn\u2019t interested in doing Britain any favours and the frosty reception she had got in the room suggested that was a sentiment shared by other EU leaders.</p> <p>\u201cCan we talk about Brexit?\u201d she begged.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Non</em>.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I need to be able to tell people back home something. Can I just say we\u2019ve agreed to start preliminary trade deals?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<em>Nous</em> will say <em>rien</em> until you invoke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">article 50</a>.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t know what I want unless we have some discussions before I trigger article 50.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<em>Parlez en fran\u00e7ais</em>,\u201d sniggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/uk-heading-for-hard-brexit-say-european-diplomats\">Michel Barnier</a>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Mon fran\u00e7ais n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s bon</em>.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<em>C\u2019est meilleur que votre position de n\u00e9gociation!</em>\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-uk-centre-of-european-decision-making-until-brexit\">May: UK will remain at centre of EU decision-making until Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe is right,\u201d said Juncker. \u201cBesides, <em>nous</em> want to talk about Russia, not <em>vous</em>.\u201d<br></p> <p>The meeting ended with Theresa sulking and saying nothing as the Lithuanian president sent her email links to YouTube footage of Russian warships sailing up the English channel.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for your press conference,\u201d her adviser reminded her, shortly after 1.30am. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to sound really upbeat and tell everyone this summit has been a huge personal success.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis summit has been a huge personal success, and Britain remains a confident, outward-looking and enthusiastic member of Europe,\u201d said a hollow-eyed, flatlining Theresa, sounding diffident and introverted. \u201cWe talked a bit about Russia and immigration and I am sure we can make a success of Brexit so long as people stop making it difficult for me. Now, does anyone have any questions?\u201d</p> <p>Theresa looked up, hoping that just this once no one did. No such luck. Did she really expect 27 countries to listen to us when we\u2019re leaving? Wasn\u2019t the EU out to embarrass us and make things difficult for us? How come she had made such a complete balls-up over the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/14/dame-lowell-goddard-child-abuse-inquiry-racism-claims-totally-false\">Dame Lowell Goddard</a> to the child sex abuse inquiry?</p> <p>\u201cUm ... er ... people really are listening to us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve just a funny way of showing it. Now is there anyone from the overseas media here?\u201d</p> <p>A hand shot up. Theresa fell on it gratefully, relieved to be able to show the whole world that at least one other country was listening to her. The hand turned out to belong to another UK journalist who was usually ignored and was trying to blag a question. There really was no one else out there listening to her after all. Theresa had never felt quite so alone.</p>",

The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement.

Nick Davies, head of residential development at Stirling Ackroyd, says the slowdown in sales is due to a shortage of homes coming onto the market.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the demand for homes continues to grow and interest rates are at a record low, the lack of properties available is reducing sales and driving up house prices. If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. </p> <p>In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u2019s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers. Reducing Stamp Duty rates would provide a greater incentive to move home, increasing the flow of properties onto the market and ensuring house prices remained stable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809fbf4e4b055209adafe26\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:31:01.723Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Burberry shares jump on Coach merger report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Burberry shares have jumped more than 5% to \u00a315.27 after financial blog Betaville (citing sources) reported that US rival Coach was working with investment bank Evercore on a potential merger with Burberry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75/0_188_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry at Castleford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burberry at Castleford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:32:23.844Z\">at 12.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5809f7f8e4b005f21833bc79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:24:18.417Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Property conference MIPIM UK, a three-day event (the UK offshoot of the annual Cannes conference) draws to a close today.

According to an indeterminate number of internet users, and now the front page of the Sun, this renders Lineker unsuitable to anchor the Premier League highlights.</p> <p>This is the kind of episode of outrage&#xa0;culture that makes me think I have some kind of essential lobe missing, physiologically preventing me from being able to \u201cget it\u201d.

On that occasion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/14/premier-league-richard-scudamore\" title=\"\">I wrote</a> not one but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/21/richard-scudamore-email-debacle-excessive-moral-outrage\" title=\"\">two</a> columns on the subject (yes, yes \u2013 slow couple of weeks), both of which declared the outrage wildly out of proportion, and were of the firm opinion&#xa0;that he should not be sacked. And me a bird and everything.</p> <p>As for why I didn\u2019t demand Richard\u2019s head on a plate \u2026 how to put this mildly? I do not warm to Scudamore, as much of my prior and subsequent output would attest. I do not warm to many aspects of the way in which he has&#xa0;run the Premier League, and I certainly do not warm to boring little inadequates who josh about \u201cgash\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Are we going to sack or fine everyone who dares to have a view \u2013 a nation of Violet Elizabeth Botts?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But so what? Because you know what really and truly and gets my goat? People who scream that those people should be sacked if they do it in their private emails. People who actually think the mere failure of Scudamore to tell his friend not to say gash, in a private email conversation, is something he should lose his entire job for. I can barely imagine anything more babyish than thinking he should \u2013 except perhaps the notion that Lineker can\u2019t analyse Leicester-Crystal Palace tomorrow. (Did you know he supports Leicester? Just sayin\u2019.) Yet the twits that think this stuff are inheriting the Earth.</p> <p>Anyone who believes in a free press and other equally vital yet threatened freedoms should believe in Lineker\u2019s right to commit relatively benign infractions of the self-interested tabloid code. Furthermore, there is no more absurd suspension of disbelief than the pretence that BBC presenters are Fritz Lang automatons devoid of opinions. We live in a social media age. Are we going to grow up about this, or are we going to proceed further down the road to cultural infantilisation, and sack or fine everyone who dares to have a view \u2013 a nation of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUczkXl_uVU\" title=\"\">Violet Elizabeth Botts</a> thcweaming and thcweaming and&#xa0;thcweaming until we\u2019re sick?</p> <p>PS: If I ever end up writing about the&#xa0;BBC, in the interests of full disclosure I always mention that my husband works there, though I\u2019m running out of ways to take the piss out of him in a way that causes him to put his head in his hands and groan NOOOOOOOOOO by about the fourth paragraph. Today is easy, though: you should definitely scream for him to be sacked on the basis I\u2019ve written this.</p>",
  "<p>She had kept it to herself. \u201cBuried it\u201d and moved on. But when an audio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">tape</a> emerged 7 October of presidential candidate Donald Trump boasting in 2005 about habitually getting away with being a sexual predator, Shannon Coulter couldn\u2019t ignore her reaction.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a feeling of recoiling. It was emotional, visceral. Then I had a pounding headache for a few days. I was filled with nausea,\u201d said the technology and media marketing specialist based in the Bay Area. </p> <p>Like many <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sexual-assault-diane-rehm_us_58054af6e4b0dd54ce34b83b\">women</a> who have watched sexual harassment allegations against Trump unfold, Coulter was reminded of her own experience. \u201cI was in an office belonging to a firm I was working for in Silicon Valley and my boss\u2019s boss came breezing through. Suddenly he came up behind me and pressed himself right up against me and said \u2018Why is it you always look so good?\u2019 He had a colleague with him and it was so humiliating,\u201d Coulter recalled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa154e5dacb45ff8515b2410b6cd42317441b0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa154e5dacb45ff8515b2410b6cd42317441b0f/0_360_2667_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"shannon coulter ivanka trump boycott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Coulter, a tech and media marketing specialist who is boycotting the Ivanka Trump Collection fashion line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Casey Fatchett photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd when I heard Donald Trump talking on that tape, I recognized in his words the same feeling that I had that day \u2013 of being nothing more than an object. No matter how smart you are or how hard you work, they can do that to us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now Coulter is taking action. But instead of targeting Donald, she\u2019s going after his daughter, calling for the boycott on the clothing, jewelry, shoes, handbags and perfume that are branded as part of the widely sold Ivanka Trump Collection. She is also calling on the retailers that carry them \u2013 including Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Amazon, Lord &amp; Taylor, Marshalls and Zappos \u2013 to stop selling them.</p> <p>For Coulter, it\u2019s unacceptable that Ivanka Trump continues to support her father, despite mounting evidence that he denigrates women. \u201cIf Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her. But something changed for me when that tape was released,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Ivanka Trump has since called her father\u2019s comments on the tape \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">inappropriate and offensive</a>\u201d. But she has made excuses for his misogynist comments in the past and has enjoyed a high profile in his campaign, speaking at the Republican national convention. A recent <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063963/behind-the-brand/ivanka-trump-doesnt-flinch\">article</a> reported that sales revenue from her clothing line exceeded $100m last year and is growing strongly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter how smart you are or how hard you work, they can do that to us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 11 October, Coulter created the hashtag #GrabYourWallet on Twitter \u2013 a call for shoppers to vote with their wallet, as well as a pointed echo of Donald Trump\u2019s bragging on tape about being able to approach women uninvited and \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d, which he subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-forced-into-apology-as-sex-boast-tape-horrifies-republicans\">apologized</a> for but also sought to dismiss as \u201clocker room talk\u201d.</p> <p>More than a million people have viewed her posts in the last 10 days and she is receiving 200 direct replies on Twitter per day and hundreds of retweets, according to a review of the relevant social media activity.</p> <p>Coulter estimated that more than 50,000 respondents have expressed support for her campaign and at least 2,000 have said they will participate.</p> <p>Susan Rhodes, who lives in Palm Beach, the Florida location of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, said she joined the boycott after seeing #GrabYourWallet on Twitter, despite having previously bought a \u201cvery tasteful\u201d pair of $400 Ivanka Trump boots from Amazon for her daughter last year. </p> <p>\u201cI remember working as a female banker in Florida 30 years ago and being surrounded by men saying \u2018I can\u2019t talk to you today because your boobs are staring me in the face so I can\u2019t focus\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She said Donald Trump\u2019s vulgarities hit a raw nerve, and now Ivanka needed to take a stand. </p> <p>Coulter researched which stores stocked any items in Ivanka Trump\u2019s line of clothing, shoes, perfume or accessories. The list also includes TJ Maxx, DSW, Dillards, Carson\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, Saks Off Fifth, Stein Mart and Belk.</p> <p>The retailers on the list and Ivanka Trump were asked to comment on the boycott campaign but most did not respond to the request on Thursday. Zappos.com, Amazon, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Neiman Marcus stated that they would decline to comment. Nordstrom sent this statement: \u201cWe have heard from some customers about this. We don\u2019t currently have any plans to stop offering this collection.\u201d</p> <p>Ivanka Trump\u2019s chief brand manager Abigail Klem did not directly address the news of a boycott campaign, but sent the following statement to the Guardian: \u201cWe are proud that our business is growing rapidly and that our brand resonates strongly with women who are inspired by our messaging and excited about the polished and chic solution-oriented products that we offer.\u201d</p> <p>She added that the brand had experienced \u201csignificant year over year revenue growth\u201d, though without any details.</p> <p>Lindsey Ledford, 29, from College Park, Maryland, who is studying full time for a degree in cybersecurity, has joined the campaign. She said she normally shopped at the bargain stores Marshalls or TJ Maxx two or three times a week, but now she would avoid them unless they stopped selling Ivanka Trump products.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t spoken out. The Donald Trump brand and the Ivanka Trump brand \u2013 ultimately it\u2019s all the same thing and in good conscience, I cannot buy that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame her for being supportive to her family. But the way she has positioned herself with her website, the one-stop shop for women who work and female empowerment, then acting as a surrogate for the most hateful, racist, sexist campaign \u2013 you can\u2019t pick and choose like that,\u201d she said, referring to Ivanka\u2019s Women Who Work lifestyle brand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Coulter said she has encouraged consumers supporting her campaign to call the customer service numbers of the retailers and protest their selling Ivanka Trump products.</p> <p>She said that when she had called, the phones had always been answered by women who listened sympathetically and often said they would take the point up with management.</p> <p>Macy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/macys-fires-donald-trump-mexico\">stopped</a> selling Donald Trump\u2019s clothing line in 2015 after he made offensive comments about Mexico \u201csending\u201d rapists to the US. But so far, Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand is still on sale at the outlets on Coulter\u2019s hit list.</p> <p>\u201cIf she were not campaigning for Donald Trump, I would be very happy for her business and proud of her success. But I think she is being used to whitewash the candidate and make him more palatable,\u201d Coulter said.</p> <p>\u201cThe boycott is actually a mark of respect for her,\u201d she added.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cPfff,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, shrugging his shoulders dismissively.</p> <p>That was how the European commission president replied to a journalist asking about Theresa May\u2019s Brexit comments during her first European council meeting. </p> <p>There was no special event, he added, and he was right. </p> <p>The prime minister was given just five minutes to set out her view on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU at 1am, after a six-hour session in which the European leaders ate pan-fried scallops, crown of lamb with roast figs, and iced vanilla parfait, while discussing the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria. </p> <p>Her \u201cclear message\u201d that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point was met with silence, before the group moved on to a short final discussion on housekeeping issues about how the summit is organised. </p> <p>Juncker\u2019s spluttered response may have been a momentary reaction to an issue he did not want to address; but more likely it was a deliberate attempt to offer broadcasters an enduring image of Britain being sidelined.</p> <p>And it highlighted how for May the European council, like other events with her counterparts on the continent since the EU referendum, provided a somewhat awkward encounter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1e89a8f719250508f43311fdd50da11d7cfd16/0_262_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said the behaviour of the British government was creating a lot of anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EU summits are an unusual environment for leaders, as they haggle over texts during dinner meetings without back-up from their advisers. </p> <p>But one government source said the Brexit decision had put May in \u201ca very odd position\u201d at the summit, far removed from the experience of her predecessors. \u201cIt is a very different personal experience from the one Cameron or Brown or Blair or Major had \u2026 She is on her way out and we are on our way out.\u201d</p> <p>And that is why, in Brussels, Brits feel increasingly like pariahs in the room.</p> <p>Despite claims from other leaders that the UK would remain a full and involved member of the EU until article 50 is triggered, May\u2019s own irritation at being cut out of a meeting of the other 27 leaders in Bratislava last month was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-uk-centre-of-european-decision-making-until-brexit\">quickly slapped down by European politicians.</a> </p> <p>Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cWhen somebody wants to leave a club, it is not normal that such a member wants to decide about the future of this club. That is really creating a lot of anger about the behaviour of the British government.\u201d</p> <p>The kindest interpretation of May\u2019s short offering on Brexit is that Europe\u2019s leaders have more important things to discuss as the migration crisis balloons and Russia\u2019s actions in Syria demand a response. </p> <p>Besides, what is there to discuss, ask diplomats on the fringes of the summit, given that Britain has not yet offered any proposals?</p> <p>As the European parliament president, Martin Schulz, stressed in a speech to the 28 leaders, there is a \u201cprinciple of no negotiation without notification\u201d in the EU.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56cdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2784418\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f78d10e4b0e4aaeaa8ce42\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/07/161007HollandeBrexit_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And yet there has been plenty of room for the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to promise that Brexit negotiations would be \u201chard\u201d and for his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, to say it would be \u201crough\u201d. </p> <p>There was also space for European figures to push back against what they regard as an uncompromising speech at the Tory party conference. May\u2019s promise that Britain will control immigration while keeping maximum economic access was given short shrift. \u201cThe fundamental freedoms are inseparable,\u201d said Schulz.</p> <p>But the Tory MEP leader, Syed Kamall, hit back, telling journalists in the huge media room of the Justus Lipsius building, headquarters of the European council, that it was just posturing.</p> <p>No 10 sources stressed that May was a central part of discussions about the atrocities in Syria, working closely with her French and German counterparts. </p> <p>Behind closed doors, she did receive a warmer welcome. With Taavi R\u00f5ivas, Estonia\u2019s prime minister, she discussed a strong defence relationship between the two countries. A source at No 10 claimed the leader even stressed that Brexit brought some opportunities.</p> <p>With Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, the focus was on cooperation on counter-terrorism. Both he and R\u00f5ivas insisted they wanted a close relationship with the UK, and May said her hope was to guarantee the rights of their citizens already in Britain, if the same could be promised for Britons in their countries.</p> <p>But British officials are advising May to be cautious about what she can negotiate in bilateral meetings, which can be warm, informal and easy to misinterpret. National leaders often rely on the EU institutions to deliver tough messages on their red lines that they prefer not to deliver in a one-to-one chat.</p>",
  "<p>I arrived in the UK when I was just 13 years old and was completely alone. </p> <p>I spent a year travelling through 10 countries, was sent to jail, had my face burnt with chemicals and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/oct/18/70-of-migrants-to-europe-from-north-africa-trafficked-or-exploited-un-united-nations-survey\">almost died in the Mediterranean</a>. </p> <p>Three weeks after all this was finally over, I found myself in front of five strangers who were tasked with assessing my age. They were so careless they didn\u2019t bother to spell my name right or get the month and day of my birth correct on their form. They were in charge of my future.</p> <p>I grew up in eastern Afghanistan along with four brothers and two sisters. My father was a doctor and my mother was a housewife and midwife. We had a good life. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/the_war_in_afghanistan\">when the US invaded Afghanistan</a>, our province became a war zone. We often had to run for our lives to escape the bombs and rocket attacks.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/child-refugees-will-have-ages-verified-if-necessary-minister-says\">Child refugees will have ages verified if necessary, minister says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the war officially ended, we were still caught between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/taliban-afghanistan-secret-talks-qatar\">Taliban and the government</a>. My father had been killed by US forces, so the Taliban tried to recruit me and my older brother to fight in their \u201choly war\u201d. I was only about 10 or 11, but the option they gave us was fight or die. The government, meanwhile, wanted us to be informants.<br></p> <p>Instead, my mother took the decision to send us away. She saved me but she also lost me, because 10 years later I am not the same Gulwali she knew. We said goodbye in Peshawar, Pakistan, and she handed me and my brother over to traffickers, telling us to stay together and keep hold of each other\u2019s hands.<br></p> <p>Almost immediately the agents separated us. I did not see my brother again for 14 months. We travelled on every form of transport; walking through the night, often hungry and thirsty, sometimes sleeping in bunkers or chicken coops. The traffickers didn\u2019t treat us like humans; we were just commodities. The worst point was crossing the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece. I had never seen the sea before, but I was on a boat built for 20 people loaded with 120 people. We were on it for 50 hours with no food and water, and by the time we were rescued it was sinking.<br></p> <p>The journey was like snakes and ladders. I was arrested and sent to jail in Bulgaria before being sent back to Turkey. In Iran I had to run away from a police prison. What kept me going was faith and the hope of finding my brother. I came to England because I had heard that was where he was heading. It took me more than 100 attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/travel-chaos-warning-as-french-farmers-and-truckers-plan-calais-camp-protest\">get on a lorry in Calais</a>.

We survived because the refrigerator wasn\u2019t turned on. I finally got to the UK. After being arrested and sent to an immigration centre I had my age assessment. They asked me questions about my family background, my journey \u2013 even silly questions about the province I came from in Afghanistan. After three or four hours they announced I was not 13 but 16-and-a-half.<br></p> <p>They said I couldn\u2019t have travelled so far when I was still so young, and that I was too smart to be 13. I know I looked older than I was \u2013 I still do, but I grew up in a harsh, mountain environment and had been through a long, hard journey. They tried to give me a new date of birth. I was so angry. I felt they were worse than the smugglers \u2013 they had been heartless, but they hadn\u2019t tried to change my identity. I was so angry I ripped up the paper the assessors gave me, in front of them.<br></p> <p>In fact they refused to believe I was even from Afghanistan, although they never told me where else they thought my home was. It was stressful and distressing: I didn\u2019t know why they were saying all this. Now I know it is because the Home Office have to put you in school and in foster care and give you the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/pdf/refugee_children_guidelines_on_protection_and_care.pdf\">legal rights of a child</a> if you are under 16.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/refugees-teeth-britain-children-calais-europe\">As a nation would we ever sink so low as to check refugees\u2019 teeth? | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead they put me in a independent living centre with adult asylum seekers and told me when I was in 18 (which, according to them, was in a year and a half) I would be deported back to Afghanistan. After that, I felt broken inside. I felt hopeless that I had come all this way, through so much hardship, and now people were saying I was a liar; it was so bad that I tried to kill myself twice in the months that followed. Last year they sent 4,000 former unaccompanied minors back, even though there is fighting in 30 out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan. <br></p> <p>Finally, by chance, I found my brother. He was visiting London and met some people from my centre, who told him they knew someone who looked just like him. I moved up to Bolton to be with him as soon as I could. There I found an education centre for migrant children called <a href=\"http://www.bolton.gov.uk/website/pages/SupportforfamiliesnewtotheUK.aspx\">Starting Point</a>. The headteacher there said a few small words that changed my life. She said she believed me. It meant everything.<br></p> <p>The teachers at the school fought on my behalf, and I also took matters into my own hands. I went to the Afghan embassy and got a birth certificate and a passport; I went to a specialist doctor to confirm my age. Eventually because I also had my Home Office card with my real name on it, the Home Office had to accept I was telling the truth.<br></p> <p>From then on I was put into foster care and allowed to go to school. I got 10 GCSEs and five A levels, and I have just graduated with a degree from Manchester University. Along the way I have written a book, spoken at the UN and carried the Olympic torch. All of those things happened because I was able to get the support and help I needed.<br></p> <p>But it is also why it hurts so much when I read the news reports claiming the young people being brought over from Calais under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/child-refugees-in-limbo-in-calais-because-of-home-office-delays\">the Dubs amendment</a> are lying. Why do we have this attitude of suspicion towards refugees? These young people have been through trauma and hardship. They are humans. They don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. Media reports like this just create hatred against refugees and politicians should be ashamed for jumping on the bandwagon.<br></p> <p>When I go into schools now I often see 16-year-olds who, to me, look 14, because people from different parts of the world look different. People in the UK are brought up in peace and security, with no responsibility, but these young people may have seen their homes burnt and their families killed.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/oct/21/refugee-children-uk-bureaucracy-social-work\">Refugee children arriving in the UK need support \u2013 not bureaucracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If these young people are older than they say, even then they should not be shamed like this, with their <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/child-refugee-front-pages-see-british-media-taken-to-task-by-twitter-users_uk_5805f0cce4b0dcd0298fb183\">pictures splashed across newspapers</a>. Could you blame them for being scared the Home Office will deport them back to a war zone if they are over 18? I just wish the authorities could be left to deal with them honestly and respectfully.

We should be proud that we are reuniting young people with their families.<br></p> <p>Since I got travel documents I have been to Calais six or seven times to take food and aid and to show some solidarity with the refugees there. After 10 years I think the world has not got better; things are worse. It\u2019s so hard to see the lack of compassion, the lack of action. I was hoping no other children would ever go through what I did, but in Calais I met children even younger than I was when I arrived there.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Novi, Michigan, on Friday had a guest that caught many observers by surprise. Hovering behind Trump\u2019s head in the fourth row, was a man in a white turban and the traditional dress of a Shia Muslim cleric. </p> <p>The man was later identified as Lebanese sheikh Mohamed El-Hajj Hassan, who has since received a barrage of criticism for attending the rally given Trump\u2019s inflammatory language toward Muslims, including his call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the country.</p> <p>Before the rally in Novi, Trump met with Hassan and members of the <a href=\"http://amctrump.org/\">American MidEast Coalition for Trump</a> \u2013 a group working to build support for Trump in Middle Eastern communities \u2013 at an event organized by his foreign policy adviser and Fox News pundit Walid Phares.</p> <p>Hassan was previously a part of Hezbollah, the Shia militant and political group that has been listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department since 1997. He broke off from the group shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/ten-years-after-hariri-assassination-lebanon-needs-moderation\">2005 assassination</a> of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and formed the Free Shia Movement, a splinter group that has gained little to no traction in Lebanon since.</p> <p><strong></strong>Hassan has since maintained his position as a vocal opponent of Hezbollah; even appearing on <a href=\"http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/4937.htm\">a TV show</a> last year referring to the group as hooligans.</p> <p>His attendance at the Trump rally last week drew the ire of a range of onlookers online. </p> <p>\u201cEvery commentator (who isn\u2019t a member of a political party) that I\u2019ve seen comment on this was just confused,\u201d said Joey Ayoub, Lebanese blogger at Hummus For Thought and MENA editor at Global Voices Online. Ayoub added that Hassan\u2019s anti-Hezbollah stance does not gel with Trump\u2019s tacit support for Vladimir Putin, as the Russian president supports Hezbollah in Syria. </p> <p>However, Hassan said Trump told him he likes Muslims and he has no problem with them, <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/01/area-middle-eastern-leaders-got-face-time-trump-novi/91357724/\">according to the Detroit Free Press</a>. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Guardian\u2019s multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>Michigan is home to the largest Arab American population in the country. Trump probably hoped that Hassan and the dozen other religious leaders he met with at the American Mideast Coalition for Trump event, would help mend his image among Arab Americans.</p> <p>\u201cTrump obviously benefits from the optics of having a visibly Muslim Arab at his rally,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior non-resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council. But he added, \u201cit will mean harsh questions for Hassan from the larger Arab and Muslim communities in the United States, and probably in Lebanon too.\u201d </p> <p>The meeting with Trump was orchestrated by Phares, a controversial figure in Trump\u2019s campaign. The news of his appointment as foreign policy adviser to Trump in March 2015<strong> </strong>was met with a wave of backlash. </p> <p>Phares is reported to have been a member of the Phalangist militia, a Christian Maronite force, during Lebanon\u2019s sectarian civil war that spanned 1975-1990. According to a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/walid-phares-mitt-romney-lebanese-forces\">2011 Mother Jones investigation</a>, Phares was in charge of the ideological training of militia troops and even advocated for the creation of a Christian enclave within Lebanon, a hardline position in the multi-confessional state. There is no indication that Phares personally carried out any acts of violence or war crimes. </p> <p>The 15-year-long Lebanese conflict was brutal, with atrocities committed on all sides. The Phalangist militia itself, which was allied with the occupying Israeli army, was responsible for one of the war\u2019s lowest points: the 1982 massacre of hundreds of civilians at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. </p> <p>Phares ultimately fled Lebanon during the civil war and relocated to the US where he then became an academic. Over the next two decades, Phares published several books and espoused a hardline approach to Islam and the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cHe began to endear himself to neocons after 9/11, with his books and studies about radical Islam,\u201d said Mohamad Bazzi, a New York University professor in journalism. </p> <p>According to Bazzi, he lumped all Islamist movements together \u2013 non-violent and violent \u2013 and heightened fears and suspicions around Islam. Phares became a regular \u201cexpert\u201d guest on NBC and later Fox News, even though several terrorism experts, such as Andrew Exum, have <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/96519/romney-walid-phares-sharia-caucus-iowa-pawlenty\">discredited</a> his work.</p> <p>In 2011, the former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney appointed him to his campaign as a foreign policy adviser, the same role he now fulfills for Trump.</p> <p>The appointment was met by a backlash from the Council of American-Islamic Relations and a variety of Islamic scholars who said that Phares had no credibility.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be akin to turning to [former KKK member] David Duke to get advice on race relations,\u201d Omid Safi, currently director of Duke University\u2019s Islamic Studies Center, told <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/12/mitt-romney-s-new-adviser-sparks-islamic-uproar.html\">the Daily Beast</a> at the time.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016 to remove a reference to Martha Crenshaw discrediting Phares\u2019 work.<br></p>",

  "<p>Intellectual capital has not featured prominently in the UK\u2019s Brexit debate. Media outlets and commentators have instead concentrated on UK trade and capital flows. Yet, as a key input for innovation and productivity, intellectual capital matters for maintaining the UK\u2019s prosperity and potential to grow. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/hard-brexit\">A hard Brexit</a> that prioritises immigration controls over access to the single market poses several risks to the free flow of intellectual capital, in our view. This threatens to erode the competitive edge the UK has gained in key sectors intensive in science and technology. </p> <p>Intellectual capital is about people \u2013 their education, expertise and skills. But importantly, it encompasses <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-intangible-investment-and-growth\">intangible assets, such as software, research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities</a>, as well as networks connecting universities, research partners and the corporate sector; it also includes property rights, such as patents and trademarks, which protect innovative products. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/12/uk-scientists-dropped-from-eu-projects-because-of-post-brexit-funding-fears\">UK scientists dropped from EU projects because of post-Brexit funding fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because it is largely intangible, measuring intellectual capital is difficult, yet it is crucial for a country\u2019s ability to innovate and become more productive. It generates new ideas and creative output methods, as well as the know-how to solve problems. It is also important for gaining and maintaining a nation\u2019s competitive edge, particularly for economies oriented to services and reliant on processing big data and information. Intellectual capital is key for the sort of innovation needed to improve the efficiency with which people and capital interact to produce output. </p> <p>Depending on the terms the UK negotiates, a hard Brexit may carry negative implications for the UK\u2019s wealth of intellectual capital, particularly in the area of research. The UK\u2019s business spend on R&amp;D is skewed towards hi-tech manufacturing (46%) and knowledge-intensive services (23%). This has given the country a competitive advantage in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, aerospace, transport equipment, information and communication technology, as well as business and financial services. </p> <p>This competitive advantage could be put at risk if Brexit reduces the UK economy\u2019s openness, particularly if it restricts the free movement of intellectual capital and investment associated with new technology and specialisation.</p> <p>The problem is not so much funding. While it is well known that the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, readers may be surprised to know that the UK is a net recipient of EU research funds. </p> <p>Remarkably, the UK is the country that receives the most EU funds allocated on a competitive basis (on par with the Netherlands and measured as a share of GDP), a testament to the excellence of the UK\u2019s research abilities. But these funds are small: net receipts represent only 0.2% of GDP. And even if no longer accessible in the future, depending on exit negotiations, they could conceivably be replaced by government funds or venture capital. A sizeable portion of the UK\u2019s R&amp;D funding is already financed by the private corporate sector. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/uk-will-get-a-hard-brexit-if-may-pursues-tough-approach-hollande\">Merkel and Hollande warn May that UK faces 'rough' ride with hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps a greater challenge is that the UK\u2019s ability to influence the direction of EU funding research could wane. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/norwegian-model-realities-brexit-norway-uk-eu\">If it negotiates the status of an \u201cassociated country\u201d, such as Norway, for example</a>, it would still be able to participate in EU-funded projects, but without steering them and possibly subject to conditions (as in the case of Switzerland, which has a \u201cpartially associated country\u201d status). </p> <p>The biggest threat, in our view, comes from the prospective migration restrictions, which could impede international collaboration and erode the UK\u2019s ability to attract talent. <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/science/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-20725345.htm\">International collaboration is key to academic and corporate sector research</a>: it creates synergies, builds on the best expertise, provides access to equipment, reduces costs and facilitates the sharing of new ideas. </p> <p>With a hard Brexit, the UK\u2019s attractiveness to students, academic staff and researchers could diminish over time.

Children under the age of 13, and the most vulnerable, are being prioritised as they come to the UK to be with their families, Goodwill said.</p> <p>The issue of the age of refugees has blown up into a huge controversy, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\">number of rightwing newspapers supporting the position of the Tory MPs</a>.

Mark Lewis, the lawyer responsible for many of the phone-hacking claims, says legal actions by his clients, which have yet to be lodged, will lodge claims for \u00a3800m - although in reality settlements will be lower.</p> <p>Yet, if there is any sense of embarrassment at the newspaper group, the publisher is not prepared to admit it. Mahmood may have worked at Murdoch titles for more than 25 years but the mood is very different from the summer of 2011 when the phone-hacking scandal erupted. That led to four turbulent and expensive years that began with the closure of the News of the World as well as the arrest, trial and later acquittal of Rebekah Brooks, who is now back in charge at the publishing empire.</p> <p>Insiders say Mahmood\u2019s conviction was a surprise but that it would fight civil claims robustly. \u201cIf we were about to be hit for \u00a3800m, we would have to file a statement to the US securities and exchange commission,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Lewis is undeterred. \u201cThey can be as relaxed as they wish but the magnitude of this is much, much bigger than phone hacking. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had calls from people from all walks of life that he deliberately set up.

Anderson was arrested after the Sun published a story claiming he dealt \u00a3300-worth of cocaine and MDMA during what was a dry run for the Tulisa sting.</p> <p>Judge Alistair McCreath, who also threw out Contostavlos\u2019s trial, dismissed the case after prosecutors said Mahmood was not reliable. </p> <p>The crown offered no evidence in the case of a doctor, Majeed Ridha and pharmacist Murtaza Gulamhusein, who were accused of illegally supplying an abortion drug during an undercover investigation for the Sunday Times. </p> <p>In January last year, prosecutors dropped the case against 13 footballers investigated over alleged match-fixing. </p> <p>The CPS said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction\u201d in light of what happened in the Tulisa trial. </p> <p>The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has confirmed it has, in the past fortnight, added two more cases to the list of six \u201cMahmood related convictions\u201d it was reviewing for possible referral to the court of appeal. </p> <p>Five years ago it got the conviction of an Albanian, branded a bogus asylum seeker and a \u201cdrug-pushing pimp\u201d, reversed following a sting by Mahmood in which he was persuaded to obtain cocaine and forged ID documents, claiming it would increase his chance of employment.</p> <p>Among the eight cases being reviewed by the CCRC is that of Alford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/07/maybe-judge-will-listen-now-says-former-tv-actor-stung-by-mazher-mahmood\">who told the Guardian he was \u201cthe happiest man alive\u201d</a> following the reporter\u2019s conviction for conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ea93a5882ba4675ac137cb4d8558f1718d01e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea93a5882ba4675ac137cb4d8558f1718d01e90/3_202_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"John Alford\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Alford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Cawthra/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The actor fell foul of a similar cocaine string as Contostavlos and ended up in jail.

And by the way, it doesn\u2019t matter whose data you use (NASA, NOAA, JMA, Hadley Centre) the results are the same. 2016 is going to blow 2015 out of the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e9b060435fd1c22437d835492ad0137a68b50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e9b060435fd1c22437d835492ad0137a68b50c/0_0_1601_961/1000.png\" alt=\"Average global surface temperatures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average global surface temperatures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: NASA GISS, adapted by John Abraham.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few things to note. First, these temperatures are surface temperatures that are taken across the globe. But, you can measure temperatures elsewhere and see the same result. Most importantly, measurements in the oceans, where 93% of the extra heat is stored are the best proof of global warming. I recently coauthored an open-access paper on this very topic which interested readers can get <a href=\"http://www.ocean-sci.net/12/925/2016/\">here</a>.</p> <p>You can measure sea level rise as the heated water expands, you can measure ice loss across the globe, you can measure temperatures in the lower part of the atmosphere. It doesn\u2019t matter where; the story is the same.</p> <p>What is the big deal? Well first of all, 2016 blows away 2015 which was previously the hottest year ever and that had beaten 2014 as the hottest year ever \u2013 call this a three-peat. Three records in a row and the last two are by large margins. Does this mean global warming all of a sudden has gotten worse? <br></p> <p>No, surface temperatures fluctuate a lot \u2013 you can see that in the figure. Temperatures will go up or down from year to year without apparent reason. This is why we are interested in the long term trends. This is also why we are interested in looking at other measures of warming (especially in the oceans). All of our measurements agree with each other \u2013 we know the Earth was warming long before this set of records began falling in 2014.</p> <p>One thing these temperatures can do is enable us to compare computer models with measurements. We\u2019ve seen that models have done an excellent job of correctly predicting the rate of heating of the Earth. My own research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/27/climate-models-are-accurately-predicting-ocean-and-global-warming\">in the oceans, the models are slightly under-predicting the rate of heating</a>. </p> <p>To compare models and measurements at the Earth\u2019s surface, I\u2019ve borrowed a figure from Dr. Gavin Schmidt of Nasa and I\u2019ve overlaid the 2016 surface temperatures. A star shows where 2016 will be. The star should be compared to the three heavy dashed lines in the figure. The upper and lower dashed lines show the uncertainty in the models and the middle dashed line shows the average. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4da0c24030ad4ae70822c845d9d35c95ddd97e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da0c24030ad4ae70822c845d9d35c95ddd97e81/0_0_2031_1857/1000.png\" alt=\"Global surface temperature observations vs. CMIP5 model simulations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global surface temperature observations vs. CMIP5 model simulations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gavin Schmidt, modified by John Abraham.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is the 2016 data within the upper and lower lines? Yes it is. </p> <p>Is the 2016 data close to the middle dashed line? Yes again. In fact, the 2016 temperatures are above the average which means the models under-predicted the temperature of 2016. <br></p> <p>Before we get too anxious, it is almost certain that 2017 will be cooler than 2016. In fact, we may not set another record for a few years. But just as a few hot years doesn\u2019t prove global warming, a few cooler years wont disprove it. The long-term trend is clearer upwards through and the models are spot on.</p> <p>All this aside, there are still things we can do to bend the arc of this curve. There are actions we can take as individuals and as collectives to reduce our emissions and our dependence on polluting fuels. That message is, and continues to be, the most important one. <br></p> <p>But one thing we cannot do is deny facts.</p>",

  "<p>Across bone dry Arizona, voters and pollsters have begun to ask openly about a change that seemed nearly impossible not so long ago: could Democrats take the American west?</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s allies charged across the region this week, led by Michelle Obama, who spoke on Thursday of hope, joy and possibility in this, the greatest country on earth. She told the screaming supporters packed into the Phoenix Convention Center that Clinton knows \u201cour country is powerful and vibrant and strong, big enough to have a place for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Then she got down to business. Arizona business. The kind that has political experts eyeing the Copper State and many of its neighbors and thinking that maybe 2016 could be different. </p> <p>Four years ago, Obama said: \u201cBarack lost Arizona, this state, by 200,008 votes,\u201d as the sheepish crowd rumbled. \u201cWhen you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state is only about 63 votes per precinct.

This has proven difficult with already strained resources in our country, but we understand that truly helping refugees must involve empowering them by giving them jobs.

  "<p>\u201cIt was literally like being let out of prison,\u201d says Sebastian Barry of his new novel <em>Days Without End</em>, an astonishing portrait of mid-19th century America as seen through the eyes of a young Irish emigrant.

Thomas and John are just \u201ctwo wood-shavings of humanity in a rough world\u201d, but Barry sets down the horrors of the American Indian wars and civil war and the hardships of frontier life in a blaze of vivid observations that combine stoical matter-of-factness with new-minted wonder.</p> <p>The novel follows a rich decade for the Irish writer, with two novels shortlisted for the Man Booker prize: 2005\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/03/fiction.bookerprize2005\"><em>A Long Long Way</em></a>, about Irish soldiers fighting for the crown in the first world war, and 2008\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/24/fiction1\"><em>The Secret Scripture</em></a>, in which an old woman looks back on the rigid social mores that saw her confined to an asylum. <em>The Secret Scripture</em> also took the Costa book of the year, and has now been made into a film, released in the UK this month; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/20/on-canaans-side-sebastian-barry-review\"><em>On Canaan\u2019s Side</em></a> was longlisted for the Man Booker in 2011, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/29/temporary-gentleman-review-sebastian-barry-novel\"><em>The Temporary Gentleman</em></a> followed in 2014.</p> <p>But, Barry says, \u201cyou do get imprisoned in a kind of style, especially after 40 years.

The sheer excitement of it!\u201d</p> <p>From the very beginnings of Barry\u2019s career, in poems, short stories and plays, he was inspired by the family stories he heard as a child from his mother Joan O\u2019Hara, one of Ireland\u2019s most popular actors. His 1995 breakthrough play, <em>The Steward of Christendom,</em> was a reckoning with his great-grandfather Thomas Dunne, the Catholic head of the Dublin Metropolitan police, a servant of the crown who in the wake of independence was considered a traitor to his new country. His 2002 novel <em>Annie Dunne</em> was named after Thomas\u2019s daughter; <em>A Long Long Way</em> featured Thomas\u2019s soldier son, Willie; and <em>On Canaan\u2019s Side</em> followed his daughter Lily. <em>The Secret Scripture</em> was sparked by the revelation of a great aunt who had been put into an asylum and erased, like so many women, from family history; <em>The Temporary Gentleman</em> is based on the drink-soaked, destructive marriage of Barry\u2019s grandfather, who early on disowned Barry for exposing the family\u2019s dirty laundry.</p> <p>What\u2019s new in <em>Days Without End</em> is that Barry is following the family tree back into a hazy pre-history. There was an ancestor called Thomas, but \u201call my grandfather ever said about him was that his great-uncle had been in the Indian wars. That\u2019s it. That was exceptionally freeing.\u201d An early version of Thomas appears in the 1992 play <em>White Woman Street</em>, and there\u2019s a reference in <em>The Temporary Gentleman</em> to \u201cmy great uncle Thomas McNulty, who was scalped by a band of Comanches in the central grasslands of Texas\u201d. So does a scalping lie in store for young Thomas? Barry considers it. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Though characters and details recur across his interrelated works, \u201cit\u2019s when books contradict each other that gives me the most joy. That to me sounds more human. In later generations, everything is a story. History is surmises and good sentences.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Irish famine survivors got off the boats in America very, very angry. They were essentially terrorising the population</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the clashes between Native American tribes and the Europeans trying to clear them from the land, Barry found a \u201crather Irish story\u201d; like the impoverished Irish during the famine years, Native Americans were \u201csupported by government and therefore made destitute, living in white man\u2019s rags\u201d. \u201cWhat is an Irish person, except a culturally appropriated creature? Thomas has that perspective \u2013 how Cromwell tried to clear us off and create a beautiful new land minus this dreadful people called the Irish.\u201d The book also explores the \u201cutter violence\u201d of early Irish American history. Famine survivors \u201cquite understandably got off the boats in north America very, very, very angry. These were people in the prime of life, essentially terrorising the population.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of <em>Days Without End</em> is Thomas\u2019s love affair with John Cole, and the family unit they create with a Native American girl, Winona. Before puberty takes its toll, the young Thomas and John make a few dollars dressing up as girls and dancing for miners starved of female company; later, Thomas finds he\u2019s more comfortable in women\u2019s clothing. He describes all this with brisk matter-of-factness; like the air he breathes, it is almost too fundamental to mention. Barry points out that it \u201cwasn\u2019t until the 1880s or 90s when psychiatry was being born that doctors started to put names on these things. Up to that point there was no verbalising of it.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship was inspired in part by his son Toby, to whom the book is dedicated and on whose behalf Barry wrote an open letter supporting the yes vote in last year\u2019s same-sex marriage referendum. \u201cMy beautiful son came into our bedroom one morning when he was 16, and said, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m gay.\u2019 I said \u2018Oh, thank God, because now you can go around all that ghastly heterosexual thing that we\u2019ve been struggling with all our lives.\u2019 It just seemed like freedom.\u201d Barry looked at Toby\u2019s relationship with his boyfriend and saw something very different from his own \u201cbonkers\u201d early love affairs. \u201cThere\u2019s an area of wonderment that I didn\u2019t expect. They were kids but they knew something that I didn\u2019t know. It was the beginning of thinking, well, we\u2019re being asked as straight people to be tolerant towards gay people but maybe that\u2019s wrong, maybe what we should be is envious.\u201d</p> <p>Gender fluidity is a hot topic at the moment \u2013 though \u201cnot in the Wicklow mountains\u201d, quips Barry. \u201cOne of my son\u2019s great fascinations is in drag, we watch <em>RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race</em> together, so I realise that\u2019s a very important part of the landscape. But I\u2019ll have to be issued with some sort of dispensation because I am just a mountainy Wicklow man writing about these things. In a way the novel is the art of getting everything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The book is also imprinted with the memories of his own 17-year-old self, when he hitched 4,500 miles around the US. After studying English and Latin at Trinity College Dublin, in his 20s Barry set to wandering some more, pursuing the penniless writer\u2019s life in Europe. In Paris he kept away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett\">Samuel Beckett</a>, Ireland\u2019s most famous expatriate, believing that \u201cyou had to not pay court to anybody. These enabling weird arrogances are very important to a young writer.\u201d He did put a dinner with friends of Beckett into a piece of writing, much to their chagrin; on reading it, Beckett remarked, \u201cyou should never write about friends or family\u201d. \u201cI did think that was a little bit ironic when you later read Deirdre Bair\u2019s biography and that\u2019s all he\u2019d done himself, but he\u2019d hidden it better!\u201d</p> <p>Barry took the comment as \u201ca great lesson of some sort, because then I wrote very experimentally \u2026 I thought you had to continue on from Beckett; you couldn\u2019t just go on in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/william-trevor\">William Trevor</a> direction.\u201d The mid-80s saw the transition between experimentalism and Barry\u2019s mature work. After writing <em>The Engine of Owl Light</em>, six intertwined stories \u201ca la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/davidmitchell\">David Mitchell</a>. I don\u2019t think it sold three copies\u201d, he was all set to abandon Ireland for good, but a week before leaving for Amsterdam he met his wife, the actor Alison Deegan, through a mutual friend, in the course of trying to borrow a fiver from her. \u201cHow else are you supposed to do it if you\u2019re not particularly gifted in human matters?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I was then obliged to be an Irish person in Ireland with an Irish partner, which was interesting in itself. Also she was Presbyterian, which I knew nothing about. A lot of those plays and some of the books were about those states of otherness and what that meant \u2013 after independence, to be told you\u2019re not really Irish.\u201d This was the point at which he was \u201cstolen away by the theatre\u201d, though \u201cI\u2019m not sure I ever wrote a proper play, as such. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney\">Seamus Heaney</a> went to see <em>Prayers of Sherkin</em>, and he said, \u2018That lyric thing is risky, isn\u2019t it? But I think you got away with it.\u2019 I wrote 12 or 13 plays \u2013 maybe a third of the time I got away with it.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he was approaching 40, says Barry, that \u201cI found my so-called voice, because that\u2019s when I understood something better.\u201d Traumatic aspects of his childhood, ignored when he was young through \u201can effort of creative will\u201d, now came into focus \u2013 though it\u2019s not something he can address explicitly. \u201cThere\u2019s no document I can produce that will not sound like an accusation or revealing something irresponsibly, or just self serving. What can you say \u2013 it\u2019s almost a common experience, but it\u2019s the thing that hurt me into trying to put something back in its place. To set up a thousand kingdoms to heal that one blasted site that has nothing on it.\u201d</p> <p>When <em>The Secret Scripture</em> was pipped to the Man Booker prize in 2008, the chair of judges Michael Portillo described it as \u201canother book about Ireland\u201d. Since then there\u2019s been an extraordinary renaissance in Irish literature, and Barry has found the new wave \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/eimear-mcbride\">Eimear McBride</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/donal-ryan\">Donal Ryan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevin-barry\">Kevin Barry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lisa-mcinerney\">Lisa McInerney</a> and many more \u2013 inspirational. \u201cI think that\u2019s partly why I was able to \u2013 in my terms \u2013 start afresh. There\u2019s a licence, a freedom. Some of these writers are so good that they\u2019re actually revivifying, like an elixir.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53b43192d0fa0f168ccb2313fa87b7d73e333cd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b43192d0fa0f168ccb2313fa87b7d73e333cd2/0_209_2669_1602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Scripture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooney Mara and Jack Reynor in film adaptation of <em>The Secret Scripture.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Voltage Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now after two decades living in the Wicklow mountains bringing up their three children, he and Alison have moved temporarily to Harlesden, north London.

The film makes major changes to plot and setting, and Barry felt \u201csad, and to be honest disappointed\u201d, to discover that \u201cthere aren\u2019t three words from the book in the film. I\u2019m not seeing anything that I wrote.\u201d As a theatre person, he explains, \u201cmy fealty is to actors. I think Vanessa Redgrave is really wonderful in it.

Along the way, she behaves monstrously, meets people who are inexplicably even more monstrous than her and murders dozens of fish.</p> <p>The biggest reference point here, happily, seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/103373/napoleon.dynamite\">Napoleon Dynamite</a>. Sings and her family live in a small, unkept bungalow in an unidentified corner of small-town America where the ground is flat and the skies are huge, all interiors are the colour of Australian cigarette packets and the only source of entertainment is the singles night at the local church. Every haircut is slightly wonky, every garment made from flammable-looking manmade fibres. If it wasn\u2019t for the presence of YouTube, there would be no way of telling when the show is meant to be set.</p> <p>How well you\u2019ll do with the show probably depends on your tolerance for shouting. Everyone shouts here, almost all the time. Sings herself is uniquely atonal, with a speaking voice that sounds like an exploding sinus. But her supporting cast aren\u2019t much quieter. Her uncle Jim, played with unnerving dedication by Steve Little, honks and roars whenever necessary. Her pastor, Chaz Lamar Shepherd, is a violently expressive showboater. Even her mother, played by the usually restrained Angela Kinsey, has moments of shrieking meltdown.</p> <p>A point will come during this series where you\u2019ll wonder whether any of this shouting has a purpose. Thankfully, it does. Unable to sustain this wild energy for the entire duration, later episodes start to intentionally collapse in on themselves to the point where the finale is legitimately morose. It\u2019s a nice sign that Miranda Sings isn\u2019t quite as one-note as she makes out, and also a perfect setup for future episodes.</p> <p>As great as Haters Back Off is \u2013 and it is great, once you\u2019ve attuned yourself to its quirks \u2013 you nevertheless hope that it isn\u2019t the start of a trend. Ballinger deserves her own show. Someone like PewDiePie, probably less so.</p> <p><strong>Length:</strong> Eight half-hour episodes, all up now on Netflix.</p> <p><strong>Stand-out episode:</strong> The pilot. It\u2019s just about as full-on as Haters Back Off gets, and a pretty good bellwether of how easily you can stomach it.</p> <p><strong>If you liked Haters Back Off, watch: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Awkward-Season-1/dp/B00ET0IP9K\">Awkward</a> (Amazon), <a href=\"http://www.netflixreleases.com/smosh-the-movie-2015/\">Smosh: The Movie</a> (Netflix).</p>",

Social workers are well aware that decision-making is often done out of expediency rather than a careful matching of need and resource. </p> <p>Unaccompanied children rarely arrive in the UK with identity papers. This statelessness exacerbates their vulnerability. They are vulnerable to trafficking, child labour and sexual exploitation. Their statelessless also makes the process of accessing social protection systems almost impossible at times, and they become invisible in the shadows of our society. </p> <p>Simply placing two children in each local authority throughout England and Wales is a bureaucratic decision that fails the test of meeting needs, managing risk, and balancing competing human rights. In this sense, it fails to assess children\u2019s need for relationships or take into account the relationships they may have already built. </p> <p>There is a significant amount of research from around the world, and solutions from other countries, which demonstrate what works and what adds to the harm they\u2019ve already experienced.</p> <p>The children do not come from one homogeneous group but from different cultures and traditions and speak different languages. They are without their families, and isolation is a huge emotional and psychological part of their recent experience. </p> <p>They may, or may not have, made peer relationships that have substituted for family relationships. They have been living in unhealthy, dangerous, unhygienic camps and have survived. They will have encountered some trustworthy adults but may have been abused or harmed by others.</p> <p>Many countries have been significantly more active in meeting the needs of these children than has the UK. For example, Germany, Greece and Thailand have set up reception centres for six to eight young people at a time to provide safety, security and stability for a period to help with their adjustment to a different culture, climate and language. This provides them some space for recovery. </p> <p>Other counties have also done research into what works, much of which points to combating isolation and the importance of peer relationships. Peer relationships are formed more often before relationships with adults \u2013 mixed messages from adults seen as \u201cin control\u201d perpetuate confusion and mistrust. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/aug/23/child-migrants-denied-essential-services\">EU states are denying child migrants essential services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know that relationships are key to recovery and achieving positive change.

  "<p>In the runup to the EU referendum there was much debate on the impact of the single market on business, jobs, workers, services and standards, but its value to consumers was hardly mentioned.</p> <p>The main consumer issue raised was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/03/what-has-the-eu-ever-done-for-my-mobile-phone\" title=\"\">mobile-phone roaming</a>, which is quite important to younger voters and to those who regularly travel overseas but does not resonate with many older voters, those on lower incomes and those in less affluent areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/20/public-turning-against-brexit-theresa-may-immigration\">The public are already turning against Brexit.

It is correct to assert that, post-Brexit, a new relationship between the UK and the rest of the EU\u2019s single market is needed but this is not a simple \u201cleave\u201d or \u201cstay\u201d decision. It requires sophisticated consideration and a multi-layered approach.</p> <p>The single market is not just about tariff-free trade. There is also a plethora of networks for practical cooperation that have been built up over the past 40 years.</p> <p>Last month in Ware, Hertfordshire, I saw lifesaving asthma inhalers rolling off the production line. The manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, has just invested \u00a374m in additional capacity at the factory. Their number-one ask, post-Brexit, is to keep close UK/EU cooperation on approvals for medical devices so that innovations can come to market faster.</p> <p>At the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, MPs from all over the UK visited the Cancer Research UK stand to pledge their support. Clinical trials for those with rare cancers are increasingly run across borders as larger numbers of participants give more meaningful results. The charity\u2019s top priority post-Brexit is to make it easy for British patients, especially children, to take part in joint clinical trials run across many EU countries so that they can access the latest treatment. The common approach across the single market to the sharing of medical data and tissue samples enables these trials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a30807a403ab7284df129d2623e7b6e87792d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a30807a403ab7284df129d2623e7b6e87792d8f/56_0_3387_2033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Patient safety today is supported by an internal market information sharing system.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Patient safety today is supported by an internal market information sharing system.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Patient safety today is also supported by an internal market information sharing system. This enables the UK\u2019s General Medical Council to easily verify the qualifications of doctors from other countries, and check whether they have ever been barred. We are the largest sharer of information on this system. In Brussels, we are looking at using the same system to share information on applications for firearms certificates.</p> <p>Important for children is the Rapex (rapid exchange of information) alert system. If a dangerous toy is spotted in one market, this system is used to alert trading standards officials all across Europe so that recalls can be made across the supply chain. A common declaration system for imports helped customs authorities seize more than 40m counterfeit goods last year \u2013 not just illegal cigarettes but fake medicines, toys and household electrical goods too. Our port operators warn that if full customs declarations are needed for goods moving between the UK and EU this could lead to huge delays at ports and airports. HMRC estimates that the number of customs declarations would increase from 100 million a year to 350 million, and authorities in other EU countries will face similar paperwork on the goods that we currently export to them. If the Conservative government is really committed to preventing unnecessary red tape, then we must look for simpler options.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having free movement of goods across the single market has given consumers greater choice and diversity and lower prices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of these single market networks are used only by the 28 EU countries; others are also accessed by EEA (European Economic Area) members, Switzerland or other neighbours. Just as we will need to agree new relationships for sharing information for security, counter-terror and defence post-Brexit, so we should consider whether we wish to retain links to market networks and which ones. Practical consideration on issues such as this will enable both the UK and other EU countries to identify areas where it is mutually beneficial for cooperation to continue.</p> <p>Politicians across the world have worked for years to tear down barriers to trade but we now risk tipping into a new era fuelled by protectionism. Public support for trade agreements will not be regained if politicians focus only on the small minority of elite consumers who shop across borders. The vast majority of people consume in their local area. Decisions on what a new relationship between the UK and EU should be or what trade agreements we should make with other parts of the world need to be made from the viewpoint of the ordinary consumer.</p> <p>Having free movement of goods across the single market has on the whole given consumers greater choice, greater diversity and lower prices \u2013 despite the propensity for the European political left to add extra costs into the supply chain or ban certain products.</p> <p>Import prices matter to consumers, and trade deals with other parts of the world will bring new opportunities in the longer term, but currently more than 50% of the products that we import into the UK come from other EU countries. If we have to rely on a World Trade Organisation backstop for these products, then British consumer products will face expensive tariffs, especially on food, and negotiating a new free-trade agreement with Brussels to rectify this could take many years of uncertainty.</p> <p>So before we walk away from our entire relationship with the single market, it is important to seriously consider strategies to maintain substantial portions of today\u2019s barrier-free trade with the EU. Some politicians in other EU countries may say no to an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d relationship for the UK, but when one examines the EU\u2019s own \u201csingle market scoreboard\u201d on the different approaches that individual countries within the EU sometimes take to implementing single market agreements, it is clear that some of those same countries already take quite an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d approach themselves.</p>",

The timeline to set up additional camps is extremely tight, finding suitable land is fraught with problems, and the funding is still insufficient.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a big chunk more funding to complete winter packages. We are short of $60m (\u00a349m) for heaters and kerosene alone. If people cannot keep warm they will get sick when temperatures fall.\u201d</p> <p>He warns that the consequences of failing to support a sufficient humanitarian response could be very serious. \u201cThe worry is that if the protection of civilians and the humanitarian response fall short, this may rekindle the grievances and suspicions that contributed to the takeover of Mosul by Islamic State in the first place. A successful military campaign to retake Mosul is necessary but not sufficient. The stakes are high, as much for the military as for the humanitarian workers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The UN is up to version 23 of its planning map of the camps</p> <footer> <cite>Alun Mcdonald, Save the Children in Iraq</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Preparations for the potential exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from Mosul have been underway since the summer as military plans to take the city back from Isis have progressed, with the UN working closely with other NGOs to coordinate the building of camps. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt has been a bit of a challenge because the locations and the directions that people are expected to flee to have kept changing,\u201d said Alun McDonald, spokesman for Save the Children in Iraq, referring to the difficulty of planning for such large-scale movement. \u201cThe UN is up to version 23 of its planning map of the camps.\u201d</p> <p>The preparations for people expected to flee Mosul come as Save the Children carries out emergency work to help Iraqis escaping other Isis-controlled areas. According to McDonald: \u201cEven though the Mosul offensive is just starting we have seen more than 100,000 people displaced in the past few months from several Isis-held areas in central Iraq. Iraq is an incredibly difficult country for us. <br></p> <p> \u201cWhen people are displaced they go through screening centres run by the Iraqi army so we deploy there immediately with food, water, blankets. They have been arriving in a pretty desperate state due to lack of water and some were walking barefoot for 36 hours on their journey.\u201d<br></p> <p>McDonald is concerned that the even larger numbers that could leave Mosul will potentially pose more complex challenges, such as families being split up.<br></p> <p>\u201cAt security screening centres men and boys are detained for long times, separated from mothers and sisters. We are particularly worried about this because of the large numbers that might move from Mosul. We are trying to work with the authorities to ensure families are reunited.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/iraq\">The UN is working to support more than 3 million Iraqis </a>who have been displaced by fighting across the country since 2014. Geddo warns that the multiple crises that NGOs are facing in Iraq are making it a very difficult environment to work in. \u201cIraq is very complicated,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have 3.3 million displaced as well as large numbers returning to their home cities after leaving during conflict. We are dealing with large-scale outflow from Mosul [and other cities] on top of that number. It makes it even more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald says that while people will want to go back, as with the millions living in camps and temporary homes across Iraq, there may be many obstacles to returning. \u201cPeople will want to go back but it just depends on how the offensive goes.

He made clear he would prefer the UK to remain in the union, while stressing he respected the decision of British voters.</p> <p>The question of whether Brexit was reversible or not was in British hands, he said. \u201cI\u2019d be the happiest one if it is reversible but now we have to start our formal works and negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>But the British prime minister and Conservative leader, who angered some EU leaders with her uncompromising party conference speech, received a frostier reception from Martin Schulz.<br></p> <p>The president of the European parliament used a speech to all 28 European leaders, including May, to warn that any restrictions on immigration would mean an economic cost for the UK.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI refuse to imagine a Europe where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens are not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Schulz argued it would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d for the European parliament to be treated as an obstacle rather than a partner in the Brexit process and said the \u201cprinciple of no negotiation\u201d until article 50 was triggered remained firm.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to underline to you a few points on which an overwhelming majority in the European parliament expects you to stand firm when designing the EU\u2019s future relationship with the UK,\u201d he told the leaders.</p> <p>\u201cFirstly, a very simple principle which must be the basis for all our subsequent work: the best possible deal with the EU is membership of the EU.

The prime minister had been expected to strike a firm but also conciliatory tone, insisting there would be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/theresa-may-to-tell-eus-other-leaders-there-will-be-no-second-referendum\">no rerun of Britain\u2019s EU referendum</a> while also making clear she did not want Brexit to weaken the bloc.</p> <p>She was expected to also tell partners they stood to benefit from an end to British demands for special deals. \u201cThat game is over, we are not going in for a new version of an even more special deal, we are out. We will have a different relationship and you can get on with your lives without us,\u201d May was slated to say. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been probably the most difficult partner inside the EU. We are not a brake on you.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the leader of the Conservative group in the European parliament warned against over-interpreting the interventions of Hollande and Schulz. \u201cThis is posturing,\u201d said Syed Kamall MEP.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast, Kamall admitted European colleagues had asked about the tough tone of the Conservative conference but insisted many understood May had been addressing her own political party.</p> <p>\u201cThere are always politicians like Hollande playing to a domestic audience and then they come here, sit in a room and get on with negotiations in an amicable way,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Kamall said there had been a mix of views from colleagues across Europe on how best to respond to Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the bloc. Some had told him they felt the UK was not likely to actually leave the EU. \u201cAnd that is why Theresa May keeps saying Brexit means Brexit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There were others who reacted bullishly, arguing they did not want to enter constructive talks, Kamall said. But he added that most politicians were prepared to have sensible discussions about reaching an outcome that would benefit both the EU and UK. </p> <p>In comments that placed the MEP at odds with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, he also said it was inevitable that Britain would withdraw from the customs union, suggesting it was necessary for Liam Fox\u2019s cabinet role to be worthwhile.</p> <p>\u201cBecause there would be no point in a department for international trade if we were to remain part of the customs union \u2026 If you are going to trade with the rest of the world, by definition you will not be part of the customs union,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He also said he was one of a number of figures in his party outraged by the suggestion at the Tory conference that companies should be made to list foreign workers. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Kamall said his response to the policy put forward by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, was to ask: \u201cWhere does this ridiculous idea come from? Was that her trying to prove how tough she was? Was that misreading the mood music of the referendum?\u201d </p> <p>He claimed that many Tories had expressed their anger directly to Rudd about the controversial policy, which has since been watered down. An initial suggestion that there would be \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d of companies has been withdrawn and figures will only be held privately by the government.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was really heartening was how many fellow Conservatives were outraged by that speech, and actually I know she has had a lot of representations from Conservatives \u2013 either associations or MPs or even other cabinet ministers \u2013 asking her what her intention was behind that speech. It is interesting that has not been repeated,\u201d Kamall added.</p> <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was also in Brussels meeting his party\u2019s MEPs, the Swedish prime minister and socialist counterparts from other countries. He said he was inviting leftwing leaders from across Europe to an alternative meeting on Brexit in London, arguing that he was disappointed by the lack of clarity from the government over Britain\u2019s plans.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach out to European leaders to say we want the closest possible relationship with Europe in the future while respecting the result of referendum,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe particularly want trade access, we particularly want to protect jobs in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>At 9.30am in Luxor\u2019s Valley of the Kings, the sun is high in the sky and inside the famed 63 tombs it\u2019s starting to get humid. This should be peak time for visitors, but there are few footprints in the dust leading to each tomb. About 50 tourists stroll in and out of the tombs, or fan themselves in the shade. \u201cThis is about as busy as it gets,\u201d said Aamer Ibrahim, a Luxor native who has worked in tourism all his professional life. He gestured at a spot about 200 metres from the entrance to the tomb of Ramses IV. \u201cPeople used to have to queue \u2013 the line would stretch to there.\u201d</p> <p>There is a guilty, selfish pleasure in standing alone in the tomb of Tutankhamun, or having the stars and hieroglyphs in the tomb of Ramses IV almost to myself. But for an industry reliant on E\u00a3100 (\u00a39) entry tickets to the Valley of the Kings (plus extra to see Tutankhamun\u2019s mummy and gilded sarcophagus), this is a disaster. Egyptian tourism is heavily pegged to its the political fortunes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76236edc6bca0b441051bc23e94482172034c404\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76236edc6bca0b441051bc23e94482172034c404/0_180_5396_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colossi of Ramses II at the entrance to Luxor Temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colossi of Ramses II at the entrance to Luxor Temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/02/egypt-revolution-turns-ugly\">revolution in early 2011</a>, a popularly backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/04/egypt-morsi-removed-army-live\">military coup in 2013</a>, and a series of high-profile airline disasters, beginning with the downing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/russian-plane-crashes-in-sinai-egyptian-pm-says\">Metrojet 7K9268 in Sharm el-Sheikh</a> in October 2015, have shattered an industry that made up 11.4% of Egypt\u2019s GDP in 2015. A slow drip of turmoil has ensured that any gains the industry made since the shock of 2011 have been reversed: figures released by Egypt\u2019s official statistics agency, Capmas, show that tourist numbers in July this year were down 41.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. Critics say that until Egypt is truly transparent about the reasons behind the Metrojet crash, as well as the crash of EgyptAir flight 804 in May this year, tourists won\u2019t return with confidence.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there are hopes that Russia could lift its flight ban on Egypt before the end of the year, and Germany recently restarted direct flights to the popular Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The town was previously the main generator of tourism for Egypt and a keystone for UK tour companies: luxury operator Kuoni told the Guardian it has seen \u201ca significant drop in holidays to Egypt in the past five years, and particularly since the suspension of flights into Sharm el-Sheikh\u201d.

The company has seen a 75% reduction in bookings to Egypt since 2011, with this year\u2019s figures a 20% drop on the already low booking figures of 2015. \u201cThe question [everyone is asking] is, is Egypt stable?

They say government pledges to resuscitate the industry to 15 million annual visitors haven\u2019t been backed by logistical or financial help for those actually working on the ground. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t care about tourists,\u201d said Ahmed Ramadan Boghdady, owner of the New Monaliza souvenir stall that sits close to the famed Hatshepsut temple. \u201cYou should care for people whose jobs depend on this \u2013 the guides, those guys selling water. They only care about us once we have money. Civil servants with a monthly wage don\u2019t care about tourists.\u201d</p> <p>For Boghdady, a day of sales used to be E\u00a3600 (\u00a355). Now, it\u2019s barely E\u00a3200 (\u00a318), or sometimes nothing at all. He points at the rows of carved sphinxes, busts of Nefertiti and various pharaohs that line the shop, themselves symbols of Egyptian industry: black granite from Aswan, sparkling white alabaster from Luxor, or stones from Sinai, Sohag and Minya, all carved by local artisans . Boghdady says that tourists spend less, now that a holiday to Egypt can be done on a smaller budget. \u201cYesterday, there was a bus full of tourists here, a big bus of 400 people. They spent [only] E\u00a3245 (\u00a322.50)! Eighty per cent of my artists aren\u2019t working \u2013 look at how many pieces we have here!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cLook, the rows are three deep; before it was one!\u201d</p> <p>For its part, Egypt\u2019s government has worked to reopen attractions such as the tombs of King Seti and Queen Nefertari earlier this year, as well as four tombs used to bury royal butlers which reopened in late 2015, but adding to the rich array of attractions has done little to get visitor numbers back to their previous highs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9a4a6b41a88e3c05045248f1c0031dadf046ff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9a4a6b41a88e3c05045248f1c0031dadf046ff1/0_55_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Areeka caf\u00e9, Luxor.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Areeka caf\u00e9, Luxor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Areeka caf\u00e9</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The economic ripples of this decline reach far beyond the well-known tourist spots. On Luxor\u2019s main Television Street downtown, rows of shoe and clothes shops stand to attention under fluorescent lights, but no one is buying. The Areeka cafe on Television Street could seat up to 100 people, who come to sip ice-cold fruit juice or puff on a shisha pipe, but there are few tables taken. Owner Emad El Nubi says \u201cthere is no comparison\u201d between a good day\u2019s business today and pre-2011.</p> <p>\u201cEverything slowed down. We have no income. Prices have gone up,\u201d he said. El Nubi\u2019s family has also been forced to close their business producing rice, honey and sugar because of a lack of hard currency. The low number of tourists has sent Egypt\u2019s economy on a continued downward spiral, even as the government insists that mega-projects, such as the second Suez Canal channel, would reverse the country\u2019s fortunes. Egypt recently accepted a $12bn loan from the IMF, requiring it to slice further into subsidies and, in all likelihood, devalue its currency for a second time in a year. The result has been price hikes for basic goods and services, not to mention the sudden introduction of VAT, that have hit ordinary Egyptians in the pocket from Aswan to Alexandria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"448517f35e5ed4f573f1eb4c1875592167799811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/448517f35e5ed4f573f1eb4c1875592167799811/0_31_507_304/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ramses VI\u2019s tomb in the Valley of the Kings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramses VI\u2019s tomb in the Valley of the Kings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenneth Garrett/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reduced numbers of tourists also mean a lack of funds. \u201cPer day, we get maybe 20 people now,\u201d said Samia Abdel Aziz, head of the Luxor Museum. The museum recently increased ticket prices to the equivalent of E\u00a3100 (\u00a39) from E\u00a380 (\u00a37.40), and added a special E\u00a350 (\u00a34.50) ticket for taking photos, without flash, of the exhibits. The revenue from ticket sales from the museum, as well as other historical sites around the country, are pooled and fed back to the Ministry of Antiquities, which maintains a separate budget from the rest of the government, funded in large part by these ticket sales. But decreased sales means less money for projects like the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum near Cairo, designed to draw in new visitors once it opens in 2018.</p> <p>A drop in visitor numbers is also tied to security. At the Karnak temple, an Egyptian guide gestures to a statue of Ramses II and his wife Nefertari as he conducts a tour in fluent Mandarin, while another leads a group in Russian. There is no shortage of trained guides, but safety remains a concern \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/egyptian-tourist-city-of-luxor-hit-by-suicide-bomb-attack\">Karnak witnessed a rare but troubling attack by a suicide bomber and two gunmen</a> in June last year.

When a burly American tourist with a GoPro strapped to his head and a camera atop a selfie-stick boards the train to the Hatshepsut temple, Ibrahim laughs with him and adds he should tell all his friends to come to Egypt. \u201cTell them yourself,\u201d he replies, pointing his camera at Ibrahim. \u201cPlease, please come to Egypt, we are waiting for you!\u201d Ibrahim jokingly pleads.</p> <p>But perhaps the solution to Egypt\u2019s tourism woes lies elsewhere. At the tomb of Horemheb, a ruler known for bringing stability back to the country, visitor Vinod Ramanathan from India said Egypt could easily become a top destination for Indians. \u201cIndians want to travel, as we have more disposable income now, and this is the place for that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to know about this country, and they don\u2019t right now ... you could have many Indians travelling here.\u201d</p> <h2>Other destinations in Egypt</h2> <h2>CAIRO</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba2ea6dce77b92fa424ef8c13112e1077daeb6a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2ea6dce77b92fa424ef8c13112e1077daeb6a4/0_542_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar at the Windsor Hotel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar at the Windsor Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cairo has never had any shortage of hotel rooms, and large hotel chains have continued a steady, if depreciated, flow of business since 2011, mostly from visitors from the Gulf.

Not to forget Andrew Bolt, who said the report proved that the ABC had <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/how-abc-stitched-up-nauru/news-story/3f02639207f007184cd64a97ad2b2912\">\u201cbecome as honest as a Socialist Alternative activist\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/21/why-i-spoke-to-four-corners-about-the-children-i-taught-on-nauru\">Why I spoke to Four Corners about the children I taught on Nauru | Tracey Donehue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Channel Nine\u2019s A Current Affair has joined the fray with a <a href=\"http://aca.nine.com.au/article/9175887/the-truth-about-nauru\">report on Wednesday\u2019s program</a>. ACA is apparently upset because Four Corners didn\u2019t pay due deference to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/a-current-affair-goes-to-nauru-refugees-facile-questions-and-lingering-shots-of-flatscreen-tvs\">own investigation</a> earlier this year. ACA was the second media outlet given access to the tiny island since the Australian\u2019s Chris Kenny reported from there with government sanction last year. The Nauruan government has routinely denied access to everyone else, demanding a non-refundable $8,000 fee just to process the application.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone knows that A Current Affair was granted unrestricted access,\u201d said the host of ACA, Tracy Grimshaw, before going on to complain that the ABC didn\u2019t use ACA\u2019s material or even acknowledge it. </p> <p>Reporter Caroline Marcus \u2013 who said <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/why-are-activists-so-afraid-of-the-truth-about-nauru/news-story/ee5cc5fb94e586e98f6f8d6e9a2daab3\">in a column in the Daily Telegraph</a> that the refugees on Nauru were \u201cwell-fed, most live in relative comfort and they\u2019re free to move around\u201d \u2013 was furious her \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d reporting had been overlooked by the ABC. Marcus contrasted claims made on the ABC with those made on ACA. For example, while the teachers on Nauru told Four Corners it was unsafe for children, the Nauruan officials told ACA it was a very safe community with a lower crime rate than Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carolinemarcus9/status/788627629347930112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We got plenty of footage and refugee accounts when we went to Nauru 4 mths ago but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4corners\">@4corners</a> didn&#39;t bother to acknowledge it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bairdjulia\">@bairdjulia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3m5Zqayy2n\">https://t.co/3m5Zqayy2n</a></p>&mdash; Caroline Marcus (@carolinemarcus9) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinemarcus9/status/788627629347930112\">October 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The ABC has returned fire, telling senators the program would not be investigated because \u201cwe don\u2019t launch inquiries into excellent pieces of journalism\u201d. </p> <p>The director of news, Gaven Morris, said claims by critics of inaccurate reporting were wrong and issued a detailed statement rebutting them. \u201cAs the Nauruan government routinely refuses journalists access to report on offshore processing, and charges prohibitive fees for media visas which are not refunded if the applications are refused, Four Corners relied on a range of sources for footage.\u201d</p> <h2>Herald Sun climate contrarians</h2> <p>Bolt and Mike Sheahan are both very popular Herald Sun columnists but they also hold opposing views on climate change.</p> <p>This week the AFL commentator used a column to make a gentle plea to Bolt to change his mind on climate change. \u201cBolt has greater reach than any current affairs commentator of my time,\u201d Sheahan wrote.</p> <p>\u201cHe is one of the few people politicians seem to read and listen to and he is bold enough to take on the heavyweights, from the prime minister down, and to lead causes, no matter how unpopular. I just wish he were as committed to the future of the reef \u2013 perhaps the planet \u2013 as he is to the downfall of Malcolm Turnbull \u2026 Come on, Andrew, jump on board. What\u2019s the downside? Only that more and more of us will like you. You will learn to live with that irritation. You might even grow to like it. Give it a try.\u201d</p> <h2>Courier-Mail\u2019s chunder club</h2> <p>Journalists are well known for being able to handle a few drinks so we were a little disappointed to hear about the performance of a couple of journalists from the Courier-Mail in Queensland who clearly had too much to drink too quickly. </p> <p>Weekly Beast heard about one young chap who unloaded the contents of his stomach in a ministerial office at an after-work party a few months back. Now this would be unremarkable were it not for the fact that a second Courier-Mail journalist has repeated the performance, leaving a big mess for the parliamentary cleaners to mop up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/08/abc-job-title-or-some-random-words-can-you-tell-the-difference\">ABC job title or some random words: can you tell the difference?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>ABC\u2019s title deed undone</strong><br></h2> <p>When the ABC restructured its five radio networks in April and added a layer of \u201cpreposterously named executives\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/08/abc-job-title-or-some-random-words-can-you-tell-the-difference\">we loved the ridiculous names so much we created a quiz</a> that asked readers to pick the ABC job title from a random set of words. New titles included \u201cideas network lead\u201d, \u201ccapital local lead\u201d, \u201chead spoken\u201d and \u201cclassical lead\u201d. Weekly Beast is happy to report that, after our gentle ribbing of radio management, the worst offenders have been changed to something resembling an actual job title. That is good news indeed for the Sydney Morning Herald editor, Judith Whelan, who would have been referred to as \u201cHead Spoken\u201d when she joined the ABC on 7 November had the title remained intact. The new recruit will now be known as the head of spoken content. Capital local lead has been changed to manager, capital city radio and ideas network lead has been changed to manager ideas network. A small win for language.</p> <h2>This means Warby </h2> <p>We reported in August that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/chris-mitchells-clangers-and-shouting-at-the-sky-while-googling-twitter\">SBS\u2019s dedicated women\u2019s sport site had been dumped</a> after just eight months, disappointing sports fans who were crying out for a serious treatment of women\u2019s sport. But when the managing director of SBS, Michael Ebeid, was questioned about it at Senate estimates this week he downplayed Zela\u2019s significance. He said the closure was not related to a funding cut, the site was poorly performing and women\u2019s sport had been incorporated into the main sports site again. What he didn\u2019t anticipate was that the former managing editor of Zela, Danielle Warby, would answer back. Warby disagreed with many of his comments and took to Twitter and later her blog to call him out. </p> <p>\u201cThere was funding allocated to Zela \u2013 approximately $125,000. It was obtained through an in-house \u2018shark tank\u2019-style process and given to the sports department to set up and run the site for six months. We stretched it to eight. That funding has since been exhausted.\u201d </p> <p>SBS refused to comment on the matter further when approached by Beast.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Ad industry\u2019s stubborn gender gap<br></h2> <p>A survey of the country\u2019s top advertising agencies \u2013 including Leo Burnett, Marketforce, M&amp;C Saatchi Group, McCann and Clemenger BBDO \u2013 has revealed that, at entry level, there is an even split between men and women but, by the time you reach the executive level in advertising, there is a ratio of 82 men to just 18 women. The inequality and lack of diversity in the industry is now being tackled by a national voluntary body committed to addressing the imbalance, the Agency Circle, which is made up of people from these agencies. Michele O\u2019Neill, the strategy director at agency VCCP and the cofounder of the Agency Circle, told Beast she was sick of all the talk and wanted to see action. \u201cWe have to stop hiring in our image,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cIt\u2019s what perpetuates this white, tight, straight, middle-class view of Australia because it\u2019s driven by ad agency people.\u201d</p>",
