  "<p>One of the few advantages of Brexit is that the unfolding debacle may be the trigger for the deep economic, political and constitutional reform that Britain so badly needs. It will only be by living through the searing events ahead that people will become convinced that the indulgent Eurosceptic untruths they have been fed are not only economically disastrous but open the way to forms of racism that most Britons, Leave voters included, instinctively find repellent. Brexit will force home some brutal realities.</p> <p>Leave voters in Sunderland \u2013 61% in favour \u2013 will have woken up on Friday to the news that Renault Nissan, the largest car plant in Europe and a crucial pillar of the local economy, employing 7,000 people, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/jaguar-land-rover-brexit-ralf-speth-eu-british-cars\" title=\"\">deferred all new investment</a> until the details of Brexit are clear. The chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, explained that it was not because the company did not value its Sunderland plant, its most efficient. Rather, as a major exporter to the EU, its profitability depends on the prevailing tariff regime, which promises to change sharply for the worse. \u201cImportant investment decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cwould not be made in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to fault Ghosn\u2019s reasoning. Gaining control of EU immigration is both a matter of personal conviction and a political necessity for Theresa May. But how can that be squared with ongoing membership of the customs union that defines the single market and which requires acceptance of free movement? Concessions can only be minimal without wrecking the EU\u2019s core structures. Moreover, the Tory hard Brexiters, wedded to the notion of a clean break from an EU they detest, are in the political ascendancy.</p> <p>One senior official tells me that a hard Brexit is inevitable: the best that can be hoped for is perhaps some agreement on the movement of skilled people, but beyond that the future is trading on the terms organised by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>If so, Renault Nissan will face up to 10% tariffs on the cars it ships to the EU. Unless the UK government is prepared to compensate it, a bill that could top \u00a3350m a year, it cannot make new investments. The Sunderland economy will be devastated. The same is true for the entire UK car industry. Last Wednesday, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-paris-jaguarlandrover-idUKKCN1201FK\" title=\"\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> made similar remarks: if the position had been more explicit and fairly reported rather than airily dismissed as Project Fear, the wafer-thin 3,800 majority for Leave in Birmingham might have switched their vote.</p> <p>Every part of our economy involved in selling into Europe will be affected both by the rise in tariffs and by the new necessity to guarantee that our products and services meet EU regulatory standards, the so-called passport. This doesn\u2019t only apply to the City where 5,500 UK registered firms turn out to hold the invaluable passport, but to tens of thousand of companies across the economy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain is now one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Brexiters insist the losses will be more than compensated for by the wave of trade deals now open to be signed, but trade deals take many years to negotiate. More crucially, there is no free-trade world out there; rather, there is a series of painstakingly constructed, reciprocal entries to markets, the biggest of which we are now abandoning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Liam Fox is delusional</a>, as former business minister, Anna Soubry, declares, to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>Nor do hard Brexiters confront the fact that alongside China and the US, Britain has accumulated a stunning $1tn-plus stock of foreign direct investment. Nearly 500 multinationals have regional or global headquarters here, more than twice the rest of Europe combined. They are here to take advantage of our ultra pro-business environment \u2013 so much for the Eurosceptic babble about being stifled by Brussels \u2013 and trade freely with the EU. Britain was becoming a combination of New York and California, with a whole continental hinterland in which to trade. Hard Brexit kills all that stone dead and puts phantoms in its place.</p> <p>The years ahead will be ones of economic dislocation and stagnation. But the impact goes well beyond the economic. Hard Brexit legitimises anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant sentiment. When Britain\u2019s flag outside the EU institutions is brought down and Messrs Farage, Davis, Johnson, Redwood, Fox et al delightedly hail the sovereignty and supremacy of Britishness, it could signal a new round of street-baiting of anybody who does not look and sound British: expect more attacks on Poles and Czechs from Essex to Yorkshire.</p> <p>Politicians of right and left are fighting shy of delivering the condemnation this deserves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\" title=\"\">Rachel Reeves</a>\u2019s remarks at the Labour fringe, warning of a social explosion if immigration were not immediately curbed, show how far the permissible discourse on immigration and race has changed. Britain has moved over the past 50 years from being one of the most equal countries in Europe to the most unequal. The result is rising social tension, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate. The hard-working immigrants who add so much vitality and energy to our society are blamed for ills that have deeper roots. Brexit has made this harder to say.</p> <p>This conjunction of the economically and socially noxious horrifies not only me but also many Tories. Scotland\u2019s Ruth Davidson, a bevy of ex-ministers, some in the cabinet and a large number of backbenchers are keenly aware of the slippery racist, culturally regressive and economically calamitous course their Brexiter colleagues are set on and are ready to fight for the soul of their party. George Osborne is positioning himself as their leader. It is an impending civil war, mirroring parallel feelings in the country at large.</p> <p>Beyond that, the referendum raised profound constitutional questions. In other democracies, treaty and constitutional changes require at least 60% majorities in either the legislature or in a referendum. Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution offers no such rules: a parliamentary majority confers monarchial power so a referendum can be called without any such framing. Article 50 is to be invoked without a parliamentary vote: a change of government in effect without a general election.</p> <p>In good times, the constitution interests only obsessives. Suddenly, Britain\u2019s constitutional vacuity is part of a deep national crisis. The economic and political structures, along with the biased media, that delivered this are rotten. The question is whether the will \u2013 and political coalitions \u2013 can be built to reform them. If not, Britain is sliding towards nasty, sectarian decline.</p>",

Last month he created the world\u2019s largest ecologically protected area when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\" title=\"\">expanded Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea</a>, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave \u201cmarine national monument\u201d status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast.</p> <p>Two years ago, DiCaprio \u2013 who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants \u2013 was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change.</p> <p>The White House screening of <em>Before the Flood</em>, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film\u2019s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month\u2019s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\" title=\"\">Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,\u201d Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are not necessarily climate deniers. They\u2019re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that\u2019s at the expense of all of us,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cAnd [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he\u2019s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.\u201d</p> <p>Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: \u201cWe cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.\u201d</p> <p><em>Before the Flood</em>\u2019s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen.

It\u2019s a simplistic message but it really is.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama\u2019s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one.</p> <p>He tells the film-makers: \u201cIn addition to the sadness I\u2019d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you\u2019ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified.</p> <p>The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,\u201d Narain tells DiCaprio. \u201cWe need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. \u201d</p> <p>DiCaprio responds that it\u2019s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. \u201cI would also argue that it\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because \u201crenewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem\u201d. But Narain shakes her head.</p> <p>The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s triptych <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> \u2013 which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio \u2013 to frame the progress of humankind\u2019s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch\u2019s final panel of darkness and ruin.</p> <p>How far off are we now, they wonder? \u201cWhat haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,\u201d DiCaprio muses. \u201cIf this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn\u2019t a movie and we can\u2019t pretend we know how this is going to end.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhat we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume \u2013 and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of <em>The Revenant,</em> when director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape.</p>",

Literally translated, it asks if immigrants should be sent to Hungary without parliament\u2019s approval. Essentially it\u2019s about whether Hungary should be forced to accept just 1,294 refugees stuck in Greece and Italy as part of a responsibility-sharing system agreed by EU countries this time last year. However small the numbers involved, the ramifications of this poll on the eastern edge of the European Union could be enormous.</p> <p>Within Hungary, critics argue that the referendum helps the government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n to distract from its domestic failures. Outside, analysts say a strong turnout will give the prime minister, perhaps the most influential far-right leader in European electoral politics, added momentum in his battle for the soul of the continent.</p> <p>A scuffle about 1,294 refugees is in fact a war over the role of the nation-state, and the nature of European democracy, argued Gerald Knaus, the director of thinktank European Stability Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s a performance that\u2019s not about results \u2013 he\u2019s not worried that any refugees will end up in Hungary,\u201d said Knaus, a major player within refugee-related politics in Europe. \u201cThe refugee issue for Orb\u00e1n is really just a means to an end \u2013 and that end is a cultural counter-revolution in Europe and an end to liberal Europe,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike populists such as Nigel Farage, Orb\u00e1n does not want to leave the EU.

To do so, his government has unleashed what research by <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org\">Transparency International</a> suggests is the largest advertising campaign in Hungarian history. Even in the countryside, voters are never far from a poster that warns: \u201cDon\u2019t put Hungary\u2019s future at risk!\u201d Of the roughly 20,000 outdoor advertising spots in the country, nearly 6,000 have been taken over by the government\u2019s campaign, TI\u2019s legal director, Mikl\u00f3s Ligeti, said.

Pardavi fears that stigmatisation of refugees could soon accelerate the alienation of other marginal groups in Hungary. \u201cRacism directed towards one group can easily be transferred towards other groups in society \u2013 and the seeds of this are being sown by the government through their taxpayer-funded campaign,\u201d said Pardavi. \u201cThis is what distinguishes Hungary from other European countries with hate speech \u2013 here it\u2019s the government that is funding it.\u201d</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics are suspicious about the timing of the referendum.

Welcoming people from the Middle East was simply a bad idea, said J\u00f3zsef Borsos, the mayor. \u201cIn our past we had a lot of experience with the Ottoman empire,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lived here for 150 years.

Hungary received 174,000 asylum applications (13% of Europe\u2019s asylum seekers) \u2013 but very few actually stayed. In August Orb\u00e1n announced that the country was planning to build a second fence to prevent refugees from crossing the border. It will stand next to its current 500km razor wire fence that runs alongside its border with Croatia and Serbia.

  "<p>It is December 1956 and I am in Margate among a number of adults seated on the floor at a meeting organised for Hungarian refugees of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/22/egypt.featuresreview\">failed uprising</a> the month before. I am only just eight and have no English, but my father, who does have some, is interpreting. A pretty English woman is about to speak when a young Hungarian puts his lighted cigarette to her stocking. She leaps up in pain. The man sniggers to his friend. The Hungarians are horrified that anyone should think they are represented by two such louts. They want them thrown out. They want to do something.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/hungarian-referendum-slam-door-migrants-new-era-europe\">Hungarian referendum decides whether to slam the door on migrants \u2013  and usher in a new era for Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And of course the young men are not representative of the refugees, it is just that we are a mixed bunch. We don\u2019t know each other, we come from everywhere in the country. Some are old, some young, some male, some female, some professional, some manual workers. Some are freed prisoners, some may be spies. Some are just louts. And some, like me, are children. More than 200,000 Hungarians have left the country and more than 20,000 have come to Britain. That\u2019s 2% of the population. Even now there are officially about 80,000 Hungarians living in the UK and there are stories that London is the fifth \u2013 some even claim the second \u2013 largest Hungarian city.</p> <p>In 1989, more than 30 years after the uprising, I spent nine months in Hungary as a British Council scholar. We arrived in January just as the old order began to crumble. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, who took over after 1956, was no longer in charge and the man nominally in charge after him, a party official called K\u00e1roly Gr\u00f3sz, was clearly failing. Day after day, events sped dizzily on, out of the ambit of the Soviet Union, out of state socialism as it was understood, towards a condition I felt liberating.</p> <p>My friends and acquaintances were the nicest, most intelligent people. Surely there must be enough of them. The warning of my parents that Hungary was a country that could never sit straight on a horse remained with me, but I suppressed the knowledge. Hungary had produced more than its fair share of prominent people: mathematicians, film-makers, photographers, writers, economists, scientists of all sorts. Surely it would make a success of its new independence. Surely it would sit straight on a political horse of some social democratic colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a44064a8477c021c0904e76fe4914602bf2cca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a44064a8477c021c0904e76fe4914602bf2cca/0_0_5302_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungarian refugees walk towards the Austrian border at Nickelsdorf in 1956.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungarian refugees walk towards the Austrian border at Nickelsdorf in 1956.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Parade/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1990 Hungary had elected its first free government in a multiparty election. You could describe it as centre-right in much the same terms as you might such parties in western Europe.</p> <p>We have come a long way since. On Sunday, Hungarians are invited by the government to vote in a referendum about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/08/uk-refugee-plan-comparison-european-countries\">migrant quotas (827 refugees for Hungary in 2015)</a> as laid down by the European Union.</p> <p>The Brexit referendum in the UK asked a very simple \u2013 far too simple \u2013 question: in or out? It got a simple answer, the complex repercussions of which are still far from clear. One effect has been a peak in verbal and physical attacks on immigrants, particularly from eastern Europe. The rhetoric leading to the decision invited hostility to foreigners and gave tacit approval to those who wanted something to kick. It was genteel approval, of course. Nobody \u201cmeant\u201d quite what has happened \u2013 they just made use of it.</p> <p>Hungary is not genteel, nor are the questions so simple. However phrased the referendum question, the rhetoric comes down to: do you want to be murdered in your beds? Do you want your town taken over by rabid Islamists? Do you want your women to be molested and raped? Do you want foreigners to take your jobs? And, of course \u2013 and here it chimes particularly well with our own referendum \u2013 do you want bureaucrats in Brussels telling you, the proud (Hungarian/British) people, what to do?</p> <p>The government desperately needs at least a 50% turnout so it can confront the EU with the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It also needs the EU\u2019s money, of course, but of that it does not speak.</p> <p>The \u201cpeople\u201d question hasn\u2019t just arisen. It has been carefully nurtured by Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party ever since they came to power in a landslide in 2010. That landslide enabled them to change the constitution in several crucial ways. It enabled Fidesz to fill public and semi-public offices with its own people. It has allowed Orb\u00e1n to restrict opposition by economic means, by strangling it. Its patriotic flavour was confirmed by its support for a clearly patriotic National Academy as opposed to the financially starved academy that actually represented the finest artists, writers, musicians and architects. It has waged a cultural war on what it considers to be internationalist, liberal, unpatriotic (often a codeword for \u201cJewish\u201d) filth. It has allowed the government to control the narrative about Hungary\u2019s role in the second world war, the Holocaust and its consequences. It has allowed the far right to reclaim its heroes as public figures. It has controlled the school syllabus. It has, in the process, allowed Fidesz grandees vastly to enrich themselves.</p> <p>There is clearly a project here that is not aimed solely at Europe but at Hungarians themselves. When the migrants and refugees first began to arrive, the government put up vast billboards declaring \u201cYou can\u2019t take Hungarian jobs\u201d. In Hungarian, of course, so no migrant could ever read it.</p> <p>That \u201cyou\u201d was a dog whistle to something in the Hungarian spirit, something that is available through its linguistic isolation and its wounded history. Pick at the wound, emphasise the splendour of the isolation. At the same time make overtures to Vladimir Putin. Look to establish a power base with other old iron curtain countries. Form a bloc to challenge the \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cdoomed\u201d liberal west.</p> <p>Let Orb\u00e1n be the leader of that bloc. He\u2019ll make one speech on the international forum and another in Hungarian for domestic consumption. By persuasion and force let him establish his illiberal democracy, ideally without a valid opposition. Why should he not be around as long as Putin? If you have control of the constitution you can do what you like.</p> <p>Now we have the barbed-wire fences, the vigilantes, the hate speech and the populist blend of flattery and demand: the customary far-right appeal to the tribe. Jobbik, the party to the right of Fidesz, is essentially a Hungarian Mosleyite pressure group in civvies. So far.</p> <p>There are natural fears, not all unfounded, about a sudden tide of foreign people, and in the light of violent events around Europe it is easy to amplify them. The liberal failure has been to ignore them entirely. The fears are there to be addressed. Those who fear should be convinced, not dismissed as racist rabble. The rabble is what they could become and are becoming.</p> <p>We were not all heroic freedom fighters in 1956. We were a miscellaneous bunch of resourceless people flung this way and that by history. The crowd of refugees and migrants I saw gathered last summer at the eastern rail terminus in Budapest included many young families, tired and sleeping very rough after a dangerous journey that had proved fatal for some. There might have been an agent or two among them. There may also have been a few louts willing to put out a burning cigarette on a woman\u2019s leg. But no. That is not what we were. How could we be? We were Hungarians.</p>",

Look at what happened to the moderate mainstream Republicans in America who didn\u2019t defend their views against a Tea Party-led lurch to the right \u2013 eventually they ended up with Donald Trump as their candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The pro-EU elements of the Tory party increasingly fear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/uk-heading-for-hard-brexit-say-european-diplomats\">May, Johnson, Davis and Fox are preparing for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a> \u2013 leaving the EU single market and accepting that as the price to be paid for curbing immigration and restoring control of UK borders. A group of Tory MPs and former cabinet ministers who want to leave the EU as soon as possible and quit the single market say that May must be prepared to walk away from formal Brexit negotiations under<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\"> article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty if the European commission and other EU leaders refuse swiftly to accept her terms.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em> on behalf of the group, which includes Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and Owen Paterson, the chair of the public administration select committee, Bernard Jenkin, says: \u201cA growing number of people support a speedy and clean break with the EU.\u201d He adds that May must be ready to play hardball with Brussels. \u201cWe need to be aware that article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots. So we must be prepared to leave without any formal agreement if necessary, or the commission has us over a barrel.\u201d</p> <p>A new \u201chard Brexit\u201d campaign group is to launch in Birmingham under the name Leave Means Leave, set up by businessman Richard Tice. The group issued a report on Saturday saying that May should trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> early next year and make a commitment to be out of the EU by early 2019. Former chairman of the British Chambers of Commerce John Longworth announced that he was joining the group as a co-chairman.</p> <p>The latest Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll puts the Tories on 38% and Labour on 31%, with Ukip on 16% and the Liberal Democrats on 5%. Theresa May is seen by 44% of voters as the best prime minister, as against 17% who say Jeremy Corbyn would do the best job.</p>",
  "<p>When David Cameron delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/06/david-cameron-speech-tory-conference\">his first party conference speech as prime minister in October 2010</a>, he mentioned the \u201cbig society\u201d 10 times and Europe hardly at all. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition was still young and he was full of praise for Nick Clegg. The word Brexit was not even in the lexicon, never mind the speech. A compassionate, pragmatic Conservatism was his central theme.</p> <p>Theresa May will open her first Conservative conference as PM in the same Birmingham arena but in a political world transformed. She will lead a session entitled Global Britain: Making a Success of Brexit. She will also announce plans for a great repeal bill that will remove the 1972 European Communities Act from the statute book on the day the UK leaves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">David Davis</a>, secretary of state for exiting the European Union, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\">who led the Leave campaign over the summer,</a> will also speak, along with international development secretary Priti Patel, another hardline Brexiter. One MP who campaigned to leave the EU predicted that the two-hour debate would be a \u201cBrexit fest\u201d with much \u201cwhooping and cheering\u201d from the Tory grassroots. Cameron and George Osborne, who fought tooth and nail to stay in the EU, are not expected to show their faces in Birmingham for the entire four days.</p> <p>The stage is therefore clear for May to make her mark, amid competing demands from rival wings of her party for more detail about how she plans to make Britain succeed outside the EU. Will the UK turn its back on the single market completely? Or will it negotiate a halfway house with some access for UK firms, and participation in some form in its rules on free movement of people? Whatever path she chooses, it will be strewn with Brexit mines.</p> <p>In what now seems like political prehistory, Cameron failed completely to shut down Tory arguments over the EU by imploring his MPs to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d. In the end he was pushed by his party and Ukip into pledging an in/out referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-downfall-european-tragedy\">that led the UK out of the EU and ended his premiership</a>. Now \u2013 after Brexit \u2013 May is also discovering that prime-ministerial words on Europe often fall on deaf Tory ears. Her attempt to reassure doubters by insisting that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, her vow not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on negotiations and now her pledge of a great repeal bill to do the inevitable and scrap European Communities Act will not silence the warring party. The vote to leave on 23 June has not ended the Conservative party\u2019s interminable division over Europe, just opened a new, more intense phase of combat between those on the right who want Brexit to be hard, fast and total, others on the pro-EU left who want something soft that keeps involvement in the single market, and middle-way pragmatists who want a solution somewhere in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before they set off for the Midlands, all sides in the Tory Brexit conflict were calling for more detail from May, as they tugged at her opposing sides.

Senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty, under which formal divorce talks will take place, is a potential trap. \u201cWe need to be aware that article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots.

Leaving without a formal withdrawal agreement would be messy, but a messy Brexit is what many have suggested the commission and much of the EU would like.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister should clarify soonest when she is serving Article 50</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Tice, Leave Means Leave</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These hardline anti-EU Tories have, over the years, become so weary of Brussels extending its powers, and cynical about the UK government\u2019s desire and ability to stop it, that they fear the spoils of referendum victory may still be denied them at the death. If ministers dither, they fear a Brexit fudge which will leave the UK little, if at all, freer than before.</p> <p>Impatience is growing, too, among Brexit-supporting business leaders, who will also use the Birmingham meeting to demand more clarity. Richard Tice, CEO of asset management company Quidnet Capital Partners, who helped fund the Leave.EU campaign, will be launching his new group Leave Means Leave in Birmingham. He told the <em>Observer</em> that what UK businesses need more than a speedy Brexit is certainty about when it will happen. But he does nonetheless want the UK out by early 2019. \u201cGlobal and domestic businesspeople want certainty around timing, so they can plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister should clarify soonest when she is serving article 50, which should be no later than the first quarter of 2017, and that we will leave no later than two years afterwards, with or without an EU deal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"108fe61130436659c0502e34accdbcbbbea7adba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108fe61130436659c0502e34accdbcbbbea7adba/0_71_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, pictured last week, is under pressure from left and right on Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, pictured last week, is under pressure from left and right on Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a report published on Sunday, Leave Means Leave urges ministers to fight for a zero-tariff free-trade deal (similar to that which Canada is set to sign at the end of October) with the EU once they have triggered article 50.</p> <p>The feeling among most Tory MPs and activists as the conference begins is that May, Davis, Johnson and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, are tending towards a hard Brexit along the lines Tice would like. Increasingly there is a realisation that because immigration was the main concern for most Leave voters, continued single market membership will be, as one minister put it, \u201cpolitically unsellable\u201d, as it would involve accepting EU free-movement rules. Jonathan Isaby, editor of a new website, <a href=\"http://brexitcentral.com\">Brexit Central</a>, set up by Matthew Elliott, the former chief executive of Vote Leave, said anything less than hard Brexit would be seen by the public as a betrayal. \u201cThe signals from the government are getting ever clearer that we will see a clean Brexit: restoring full sovereignty to Westminster, taking back control of our borders, and giving elected British politicians the power to negotiate our own trade deals around the globe. This clean Brexit is what the British public voted for in such large numbers at the referendum. Any deal that involved membership of the single market \u2013 which is being promoted by some Remain campaigners unwilling to accept the verdict of the British people \u2013 would be akin to a phoney Brexit and totally unacceptable.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Disaster\u2019</h2> <p>But the pro-EU Tory left, backed by serious and powerful pro-European business leaders and groups, will have none of it. They will be in Birmingham making precisely the opposite arguments. They accept that Brexit will happen, but say the UK will face serious economic harm unless it retains maximum access to the single market, even if this means accepting some freedom of movement. Some Tories, such as ex-minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\">Anna Soubry</a>, say an end to EU free movement would be a disaster for many UK firms, who will no longer be able to staff their operations.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/former-tory-ministers-demand-clear-brexit-plan-theresa-may\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan</a>, who was sacked by May in July, will take up a new role as chair of the pro-European Tory Mainstream group, and warn that a hard Brexit would not only be an act of economic self-harm, but also risk unleashing and legitimising bigotry. In a hard-hitting speech just hours after May\u2019s, Morgan will say: \u201cThere are already those for whom the referendum result is not enough \u2013 they want us to have a hard Brexit which cuts us off from the EU, turns our back on the single market and allows people to say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry. We should, and we will, ask questions about Brexit. There will be complex negotiations, and it would be wrong to throw away, without question, access to the single market simply because free movement is likely to be part of those negotiations too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39/0_0_4320_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheering her on will be former chancellor Kenneth Clarke and ex-minister Nick Herbert, as well as representatives from UK industry.

Ghosn said his firm would need \u201ccompensation\u201d for tax barriers that might result from Britain leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers, has now added his voice to those asking for a Brexit plan for business to use when looking to the future. \u201cThe current uncertainty is not conducive to attracting manufacturing investment to the UK. The government must do all it can to maintain the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector, which has been hugely successful in boosting exports, creating jobs and generating economic growth in recent years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Look at what happened to the moderate Republicans in America \u2013 they ended up with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Nicky Morgan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morgan, who has already criticised May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">plans for extending grammar schools</a>, sees a wider danger for the party from Brexit, fearing that it could instil a rightwing intolerant mentality and a desire to vacate the centre ground, which would have disastrous and ugly consequences. \u201cLook at what happened to the moderate mainstream Republicans in America who didn\u2019t defend their views against a Tea Party-led lurch to the right \u2013 eventually they ended up with Donald Trump as candidate,\u201d she will argue.</p> <p>May is working hard to show that her government, rather than being rightwing, hard-edged and Brexit-obsessed, is overall a sensitive and moderate one. On entering Downing Street she made clear that she wanted to govern for all and not just the \u201cprivileged few\u201d. She quickly ditched much of the Cameron and Obsorne agenda, and signalled an end to austerity, angering many of the Cameroons in the process. On Saturday the announcement by work and pension secretary Damian Green that tens of thousands of people claiming the main benefit for long-term sickness will no longer face repeated medical assessments to keep their payments, showed, Green said, that the government was \u201chard-headed not hard-hearted\u201d.</p> <p>At conference, some predict further measures for the less well-off, including a shift toward helping those in the rental sector who the Tories are often accused of ignoring. But hard as May tries to build her own programme, her first conference and her first term as prime minister will inevitably be dominated by the Brexit debate and Brexit divisions.</p> <p>So deep is the Tory divide on the issue, and so small is May\u2019s majority in parliament (17), that many MPs \u2013 across all main parties \u2013 believe she could still, despite her denials so far, call a general election in spring or autumn next year. With Labour on the floor, they argue, she could then win her own mandate for the kind of Brexit she wants and increase the Tory majority to much nearer 100. An Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll on Sunday has put the Tories (on 38%), seven points ahead of Labour (31%). Ukip is on 16% and the Lib Dems and SNP on 5% each.</p> <p>But even more encouragingly for those Tories who would like her to go to the country, more than twice as many members of the public (44%) think May would be the best prime minister than believe the same of Jeremy Corbyn (just 17%). While Brexit divisions will take centre stage in Birmingham, the issue of whether to call a snap election that could give her the power to govern despite them will probably be exercising May more than she will publicly admit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/1312_755_2999_3085/972.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke\" width=\"972\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The three groups \u2013 and their aims<br></h2> <p><strong>The hard Brexiters</strong> (Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis, Andrea Leadsom<em>) </em>Leave the single market and give up on a deal under which the EU accepts that British regulations have equal weight. This could lead to extra paperwork for businesses exporting to the EU, but it would see the UK government having free rein to curb free movement and establish trade deals with a host of other countries on its own terms.</p> <p><strong>The soft Brexiters</strong> (Anna Soubry, Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Michael Heseltine<em>) </em>Some see a reluctance within this group to even leave the EU, and it looks like they want another vote on the terms of Brexit once negotiated. If the UK is to leave, however, membership of the single market is seen as key - even if that leads to few restrictions on freedom of movement.</p> <p><strong>In the middle </strong>(Damian Green, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond<em>) </em>Access to the single market, rather than membership, is vital. The UK would not accept EU jurisdiction over standards of goods, but both parties would be willing to recognise as equally valid each other\u2019s regulations on the safety of widgets, for example. It is said that the UK could follow the model of Liechtenstein: access to the market for goods, but with some control of inward migration.</p>",

  "<p>When the NFL played its second fixture in London eight years ago there was anxiety behind the scenes. The novelty factor guaranteed the first game would always be a success but returning to Wembley a year later was viewed as a test of American football\u2019s sustainability in the UK. Was it a fad? Never mind expansion, could the sport\u2019s popularity be sustained? The game\u2019s backers need not have worried. London\u2019s appetite for gridiron has not been sated, it remains voracious.</p> <p>The bombastic bandwagon rolls back in to town on Sunday with Jacksonville Jaguars against Indianapolis Colts at Wembley, followed by another game at football\u2019s national stadium on 30&#xa0;October after Twickenham, the home of rugby union, holds its first fixture a week earlier. That will make it 17 regular season games in a decade and close to three-quarters of the 32 NFL teams will have appeared on these shores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/nfl-week-four-jaguars-colts-wembley\">NFL week four predictions: Jaguars' Wembley visit to end in another defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year, the six teams crossing the Atlantic are not quite box office but the sellout signs have long been up. So, unsurprisingly, further expansion is afoot. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/08/tottenham-nfl-matches-new-stadium-10-year-deal\" title=\"\">agreement with Tottenham Hotspur, </a>which takes effect on completion of the Premier League club\u2019s new ground in 2018, means a minimum of four regular season games in London during a 17-week season. The words permanent franchise continue to hover.</p> <p>Others have taken note of the NFL\u2019s groundbreaking success. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/05/argentina-australia-twickenham-rugby-championship\" title=\"\">Argentina and Australia</a> arrive for the first Rugby Championship game to be played away from one of the four participating southern hemisphere countries at Twickenham on Saturday, with Andy Marinos, the chief executive of Sanzar, telling the <em>Observer</em> they have taken notice of \u201cthe NFL and other disciplines bringing marquee events to London\u201d.</p> <p>Much more is to follow. The world athletics championships is being held at the London Stadium next year; the NBA have rudimentary plans to increase their output from the now annual game at the O2 in north Greenwich, where the ATP World Tour Finals have made their home since 2009; and the hockey world championships and Euro 2020 finals are coming a little further down the line.</p> <p>Sport held a prominent place when Sadiq Khan launched his riposte to the EU referendum result in July, the heavily marketed London is Open campaign. City Hall\u2019s determination to lure the world\u2019s biggest events to the capital is obvious and the crucial elements are all in situ \u2013 some of the world\u2019s best stadiums and arenas are ready for use, along with suitable transport facilities \u2013 but that is also the case in other European cities.</p> <p>So what else makes London stand out for the world\u2019s biggest sporting organisations?</p> <p>Alistair Kirkwood, the managing director of NFL UK, says they had three main reasons: the sport\u2019s relative success in Britain in the 1980s meant there was already a foundation support; the cultural similarities of America and Britain; and, most notably, the \u201cUK is the second largest sports rights market in the world, so there was a sense that to do well in this market we did not need to be No1 or No2 but the next level below that\u201d.</p> <p>Money is the endgame. Financial experts predict this year\u2019s three NFL fixtures will be worth close to \u00a350m to the local economy, not including the revenue generated by the three \u201chome\u201d franchises, Jacksonville, the LA Rams and Cincinnati.</p> <p>Little wonder Khan says he is committed to bringing an NFL team to London, even if hefty logistical hurdles remain. Aside from convincing one of the 32 franchises to relocate, Kirkwood says visa, immigration and taxation issues would need to be ironed out.</p> <p>If it does come to fruition, the smart money is on the Jaguars making the move. They are run by Shahid Khan, the owner of Championship side Fulham, and in 2012 made a 10-year commitment to playing here once a season, referring to it as a \u201cpart-time residency\u201d.</p> <p>Deloitte estimates full-time occupation in London would be worth more than \u00a3100m to the local economy and previous visits have equated to 15% of Jacksonville\u2019s annual revenue. For a franchise that has eight home games a year, it is a major commitment but the NFL is ready to move on to the next phase. \u201cThe first few years were about testing,\u201d Kirkwood says. \u201cThe next piece is about accelerating and working out what it can become.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor reopened discussions with Major League Baseball during a trip to New York last month about bringing a series involving the New York Mets to the London Stadium in 2018. It seems a case of when rather than if baseball\u2019s biggest league, who have played series in Sydney, enter the British market, so perhaps a more pertinent question would be why they have not already experimented when two of the other big three sports in the US have enjoyed such success.</p> <p>London is alluring beyond the US, too, illustrated by Argentina\u2019s decision to move a home fixture here. Sanzar\u2019s Andy Marinos, who was capped eight times by Wales in 2002-03, says: \u201cIt\u2019s coming off the back of a hugely successful World Cup for southern hemisphere nations,\u201d where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/argentina-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Wallabies defeated Argentina</a> in the semi-final at Twickenham. \u201cI think 2015 made rugby union a truly global sport.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/26/mlb-very-interested-in-playing-regular-season-game-in-london-in-2017\">MLB 'very interested' in playing regular-season game in London in 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are also big expat communities from all the southern hemisphere countries living in the UK. To take a Rugby Championship match is obviously of huge value and significance, especially for Argentina as they continue to grow their brand outside South America.\u201d</p> <p>That sentiment is echoed by the head of the Union Argentina de Rugby, Greg Peters, who says that if the game is a success they \u201cwould certainly look at this again in the future\u201d. Other locations were considered by the UAR but Twickenham was the standout option.</p> <p>Tickets are fairly priced, starting at \u00a320, and more than 50,000 are expected to turn out. That would make it the second-best attended fixture of this year\u2019s tournament, after Australia\u2019s hosting of New Zealand in August drew 65,328 to Sydney. Argentina\u2019s other home game, against South Africa in Salta, was watched by 19,000.</p> <p>There is a novelty factor about a southern hemisphere Test being played above the equator, but rugby is indigenous to Britain, a notable contrast to the US sports entering the market. In theory, that should make the imported games a harder sell but the opposite is true \u2013 especially when it comes to the NBA\u2019s visit to the O2.</p> <p>From Paul McCartney to half the Premier League, courtside becomes an A to Z of celebrity, more about the social event than the game, especially when several have been blowouts. Tickets for January\u2019s meeting between Indiana and Denver will go on sale this month. Prices have not been confirmed but such has been the popularity of recent matches prime tickets were trading on resale sites for more than \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Some members of the British Basketball League are privately miffed by the NBA\u2019s ability to charge exorbitant prices when selling out 18,000 seats at the 0<sub>2</sub> at a time when the average attendance in the domestic professional league is low three figures and government funding totals only \u00a310m.</p> <p>The chagrin is understandable considering a 2014 UK Sport survey indicated it was the second-best participated sport among teenagers, though the NBA have invested in school programmes here.</p> <p>While American football is somewhat different, not least because there is no professional setup in Britain, it is worth noting how Kirkwood describes the relationship between the NFL and domestic amateur teams. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-distant,\u201d he says, taking his time to choose the correct phrase. \u201cI think our role in that should stay narrow. We\u2019re not a governing body, so our role is to make the sport as desirable and exciting as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Yet if their plans to establish a franchise in Britain permanently comes to fruition, a structure to promote home-grown players would be required. Participation has grown 15% in the past year, close to 100 universities have teams and it can now be played in schools. \u201cThe credit for that would be for the volunteers,\u201d Kirkwood says, adding that their influence was indirect by \u201cputting the game in the shop window\u201d.</p> <p>Producing local talent for a London NFL team is a long way off, but in the meantime the city remains, as the mayor has repeated countless times, open for business. \u201cLondon has an outstanding track record in delivering major international sporting events with our world-class sporting venues and thousands of enthusiastic fans,\u201d Khan says, though it would be injudicious to suggest the endgame for now is anything more than money.</p>",

  "<p>Incidents of self-harm and depression among children in the Calais refugee camp are increasing as the mental health of unaccompanied minors deteriorates in advance of the site\u2019s demolition. Charities, volunteers and aid agencies say they were witnessing psychological collapse among many of the site\u2019s child refugees after President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande confirmed last week that the camp would be shut down.</p> <p>One senior official from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) warned that some child refugees had threatened to harm themselves if the camp was destroyed. Aid workers also said other unaccompanied minors, many of whom are eligible to claim asylum in the UK, had talked about killing themselves, such was their despair over the camp\u2019s future.</p> <p>Abdul Afzali, who works for the charity Refugee Youth Service and looks after unaccompanied minors inside the Calais camp, said: \u201cSome are burning themselves with cigarettes, one arm, then the other. Others have told me that they want to jump in front of a lorry and give up. Unfortunately, most have developed serious depression.\u201d</p> <p>There are at least 1,000 unaccompanied minors currently in the camp, and the British and French authorities have yet to develop a strategy to rehouse the vast majority of them after the site is destroyed later this year.</p> <p>The approach of the Home Office is under increasing scrutiny. Despite a commitment in May to take thousands of child refugees from across Europe, it has admitted that not a single unaccompanied minor has been accepted. A group of Tory MPs is understood to have written to the prime minister, Theresa May, to register their concern.</p> <p>Under a separate agreement designed to reunite child refugees with families living in the UK, only around 20 have been resettled since May and in these cases, charities say they have paid all the costs involved. The Home Office says it is committed to resettling \u201cvulnerable children\u201d.</p> <p>Within the Calais camp itself, Liz Clegg, who runs the site\u2019s unofficial women and children\u2019s centre, said that from her observations, as many as 80% of the site\u2019s unaccompanied minors exhibited mental health issues that would be flagged up as serious in an institution where normal child protection safeguards existed.</p> <p>\u201cThey would be flagged up as \u2018at risk\u2019 \u2013 some would be placed on suicide watch. There is self-harming, repetitive behaviour; many of them are stuck in a loop. We have nine-year-olds who are barely hanging on,\u201d said Clegg.</p> <p>Gr\u00e9goire Bonhomme of MSF, which has created a safe space for child refugees within the camp, said he too had heard of children threatening to hurt themselves when the camp was demolished. \u201cSome said they will harm themselves because they will be dismayed at this situation. It is creating a lot of tension.\u201d</p> <p>However, Bonhomme also said that there was also a refusal among a cohort of child refugees to believe that the camp, which currently has a record population of more than 10,000, would be demolished. He said: \u201cMany of them say: \u2018It won\u2019t happen, no one will arrest us, and if we want to go we\u2019ll find a way [to the UK].\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f6bd1863375e788ffef0b63c64012f5e320bcb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f6bd1863375e788ffef0b63c64012f5e320bcb6/118_277_1989_1989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young refugee in the Calais camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yemani, 15, from Eritrea, has been in the Calais camp for three months and is hoping to be reunited with his aunt, who lives in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Townsend/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander Simmons, a volunteer for charity Care4Calais, confirmed it was monitoring \u201cquite critical mental health issues\u201d among a number of child refugees in the camp and that the longer they spent in the camp, the more vulnerable they became. He also lamented the fact that there was no record of the extent of the problem. The camp is not officially recognised by the authorities and no official mental health assessments have been conducted among its children.</p> <p>Mary Jones, who runs Jungle Books for the camp\u2019s child refugees, revealed that she had repeatedly seen new arrivals gradually go from initial optimism to a depressed state; some youngsters lay in bed for days. Simmons said that on Thursday an Afghan boy was taken from the camp to hospital after spending 48 hours lying in bed, unable to move.</p> <p>On Saturday the charity Unicef became the latest organisation to criticise the Home Office over its approach to unaccompanied child refugees, demanding that the UK accelerate the transfer of vulnerable youngsters from Calais. Lily Caprani, Unicef UK\u2019s deputy executive director, said it was pushing for the children in the camp to be placed in appropriate accommodation before any demolition began and for them to have access to care and legal support to process their asylum and family reunion claims. \u201cThe children in Calais need to know they will be safe before the bulldozers arrive,\u201d said Caprani.</p> <p>Charities estimate there are more than 400 unaccompanied children inside the camp who are eligible to come to Britain, but say the Home Office has not sufficiently tried to identify the exact number. More than four months after the UK government announced that it would accept child refugees from across Europe, the charities point out, no official process appears to have even been put in place to facilitate their transfer.</p> <p>Josie Naughton, co-founder of the charity Help Refugees, said: \u201cCurrently no plan is in place as to how they will be protected and taken care of once the camp is demolished. We ask that the British and French authorities immediately put plans in place.\u201d</p> <p>Also on Saturday, French police fired teargas and water cannon at migrants and protesters who had gathered outside the camp in defiance of a ban, local authorities said. About 200 migrants and 50 activists assembled under a bridge to protest against living conditions. There were clashes as the police pushed the migrants back to the camp, and activists are reported to have thrown stones at the security forces. </p> <p>Another 150 protesters who left Paris on Saturday on four coaches were blocked by police at a toll road about 30 miles (48 km) short of the port.</p> <h2>Teenage voices from Calais: \u2018There is too much fighting\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Idrissa, 17, from Darfur, Sudan</strong><br></p> <p>Idrissa has been in the camp since February and is hoping to be reunited with his uncle in Birmingham.

Waiting in the Calais camp has been a grim and depressing experience. \u201cThere is too much violence here. We feel afraid,\u201d he says, gesturing to a group of unaccompanied youngsters nearby.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Yemani, 15, from Tsorona, Eritrea</strong></p> <p>Yemani has been in the Calais camp for three months and is hoping to be reunited with his aunt, who lives in London. He is travelling alone and says that life inside the camp scares him: \u201cThere is too much fighting, people hitting each other. Bigger people than me hit me.\u201d The teenager also says that the French police terrify him, pointing to a used teargas canister lying in the dirt outside a tent where some of the unaccompanied minors gather.</p> <p>\u201cThey hit us, and fire at us,\u201d he says, rubbing his eyes to mimic the pain.</p> <p><strong>Fadl, 17, from western Sudan<br></strong></p> <p>Fadl arrived in the Calais camp four weeks ago, the end of a journey from close to the Darfur border via Libya, across the Mediterranean and through Italy. His aim is to reach London and find a job as a mechanic. He says that he is petrified of the camp, especially at night, and has sought the protection of Sudanese elders to keep him safe. \u201cThere are big problems here, people fighting, coming to the tents and scaring us,\u201d he says.

  "<p>The<em> Daily Mail</em> might have compiled the far left\u2019s hitlist of Labour MPs. Seven of its apparent deselection targets are women: Angela Eagle, Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Louise Ellman, Anna Turley, Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth. Of these, Angela Eagle is an out lesbian and Louise Ellman, Ruth Smeeth and Luciana Berger are Jewish. Most are young by the standards of politicians and nasty old men have always enjoyed humiliating young women with ideas of their own.</p> <p>The Corbyn gun club does not only have women at the end of its firing range. A list of MPs Jeremy Corbyn claimed had been abusive towards him included many <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/09/jeremy-corbyn-ally-condemns-list-abusive-labour-mps\" title=\"\">men</a>. But when Labour activists talk of the men most likely to be deselected the list narrows to three: Neil Coyle, Wes Streeting and Peter Kyle. Wes Streeting and Peter Kyle are, since you mention it, gay.</p> <p>Should you mention it? There is a case for arguing you should forget about identity politics. A division as old as the foundation of the \u201cleft\u201d on the benches of the national assembly of revolutionary France now tears Labour apart: the division between Girondins and Jacobins, reformists and revolutionaries, social democrats and communists. Gender and ethnicity seem irrelevant. Either you are for \u201cJeremy\u201d \u2013 as his supporters insist on calling their Big Daddy \u2013 or against his revolution, whatever that might be.</p> <p>Yet if you believe people who call themselves left wing, gender and ethnicity have never been more relevant. They celebrate diversity, count the number of women in senior positions and rage against racism and male privilege. Given their complicity with Corbyn, I do not think they will be able to rage against the patriarchy in future without having their hypocrisy thrown in their faces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00f238e5554335657ad35f2a75ea8bbb5363b09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00f238e5554335657ad35f2a75ea8bbb5363b09d/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Eagle pulled out of the leadership race in July.

She has been subjected to homophobic and misogynist attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just look at them. Jess Phillips\u2019s file of online abuse contains Corbyn supporters photoshopping her head on to the body of a half-naked woman with a spear going through her heart. They tell her she is an \u201cugly cow\u201d and a \u201cpsycho bitch\u201d. Phillips is as tough as they come. She worked for Women\u2019s Aid and inevitably received abuse from \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d activists, who resented the protection she offered battered wives and girlfriends. The only difference between their insults and the insults of the Corbynistas, she tells me, is that the far left is \u201ca bit less rapey\u201d. When men\u2019s rights activists went for Phillips in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn defended her. Now that his own supporters are following suit, the Pilate-like Corbyn washes his hands and piously intones that local parties must decide whether to deselect<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/19/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-leaving-colleagues-hung-out-to-dry-by-o/\" title=\"\"> their MP </a>. He is just Labour\u2019s leader. These are just his followers. It is none of his business.</p> <p>After a Momentum activist denounced Ruth Smeeth, at the launch of Labour\u2019s sick joke of an \u201cinquiry\u201d into left antisemitism, she had to call in the police to investigate antisemitic <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/02/terror-police-probe-death-threat-and-antisemitic-and-homophobic/\" title=\"\">death threats</a>. Smeeth has fought the far right all her adult life. She never felt the need to hire a bodyguard, however, until she went to face the far left at this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/ruth-smeeth-to-have-bodyguard-at-labour-conference/\" title=\"\">Labour conference</a>. Peter Kyle took the Tory seat of Hove in 2015. Momentum wants to deselect the one candidate who could hold the marginal. Kyle does not receive much open homophobia, just constant complaints that he\u2019s \u201cnot one of us\u201d, which may mean he is gay or may mean he refuses to accord the Pilate of the left the tribute that is his due.</p> <p>Supporters of Angela Eagle allege her enemies referred to her as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/angela-eagle-was-target-of-homophobic-abuse-claim-labour-members\" title=\"\">Angie the Dyke\u201d </a>at a local party meeting. A rebuttal leaflet circulating in her Wallasey constituency inadvertently explains why so many on the left cannot acknowledge not just homophobia, but misogyny and racism too. The dyke charge was \u201ca politically motivated attack\u201d, it said, with a variant of what Jews call the <a href=\"https://engageonline.wordpress.com/2016/04/28/the-livingstone-formulation-david-hirsh/\" title=\"\">\u201cLivingstone formulation</a>\u201d. Allow me to explain. Just as it is commonplace in the rightwing press to say that Islamophobia and racism are <em>always</em> the invention of log-rolling special interests, so the Livingstone left accuses Jews of <em>always</em> raising fake claims of antisemitism to silence criticism of Israel. As so often, what happens to the Jews one day happens to everyone else the next. Women and gays are now hearing what Jews have heard for years: your complaints are just a cover to advance your sinister interests.</p> <p>The Labour conference made clear there is no point appealing to Corbyn\u2019s sense of decency. Stella Creasy found he did not have one after she followed the success of her campaign to curb the sharks of the payday <a href=\"http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/wfnews/11341229.Payday_loan_restrictions_should_go_further___Stella_Creasy/\" title=\"\">loan racket </a> with an equally urgent campaign to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-urged-to-back-urgent-child-refugee-policy\" title=\"\">child refugees.</a> She and Yvette Cooper asked Corbyn to support a motion at conference to advance the cause. Of course he wouldn\u2019t. Admirers of George Galloway and Islamist movements have overrun Creasy\u2019s local party. They call her a \u201cgirl guide\u201d and treat her with a condescension they would never afford to a male politician. Naturally, Corbyn prefers them to a Labour MP who has done what he has never managed to do and provided practical help to working-class Britain.</p> <p>I know from my experience of confronting left antisemitism that what Labour MPs will be looking for is a glimmer of comprehension among their opponents about what is at stake. If my past is a guide, they will not find it and a sliver of ice will enter their hearts.</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, Diane Abbott and the rest of Corbyn\u2019s prominent women supporters should be saying words to the effect of: \u201cI back Corbyn. But I am also a feminist and an anti-racist. Everyone in public life gets abused, but we are now going beyond abuse to deselecting MPs. Even though Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy are my opponents, it would be intolerable for them to lose their seats to misogynist enemies, just as it would be intolerable for antisemites to drive out Ruth Smeeth and other Jewish MPs. These are victories that are not worth having; victories that are built on the defeat of our ideals.\u201d</p> <p>They won\u2019t protest. Nor would anti-racist activists after <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/18/jeremy-corbyn-hired-and-fired-me-while-i-was-being-treated-for-c/\" title=\"\">Corbyn sacked Thangam Debbonaire</a> in such a contemptuous manner. Debbonaire\u2019s colleague Chi Onwurah, one of the few other BME women MPs, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/labour-mp-any-other-job-jeremy-corbyn-would-have-faced-industrial-tribunal\" title=\"\">said </a> he might have been up \u201cbefore an industrial tribunal for constructive dismissal\u201d, aggravated by racial discrimination, if he were a normal employer.</p> <p>From the Jacobins onwards, women\u2019s rights and every other right have been subjugated to the cause of the revolution.

  "<p>For chancellors of the exchequer, annual International Monetary Fund meetings have not always been the happiest of occasions. Heading there in early October 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/economy.gordonbrown\" title=\"\">Alistair Darling knew that the solvency of the UK banking system was hanging by a thread</a>. In 1992, Norman Lamont went to Washington with his economic strategy in tatters after Britain\u2019s departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. In 1976, on his way to Manila, Denis Healey only managed to get as far as London\u2019s Heathrow airport, such was the intensity of the sterling crisis. On that occasion, the chancellor did not need to go to the IMF: the IMF came to him.</p> <p>Compared with some of his predecessors, Philip Hammond has got off lightly. The IMF\u2019s belief \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">expressed repeatedly and forcefully</a> before the EU referendum on 23 June \u2013 was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> would be to 2016 what the collapse of Lehman Brothers was to 2008 \u2013 the trigger for a massive global economic shock. These fears have so far proved unfounded. The UK appears unlikely to plunge into the immediate recession confidently predicted by the IMF. House prices are not collapsing and there has been no stock-market crash. The impact on the rest of the global economy has so far been minimal.</p> <p>Yet it is safe to say that finance ministers and central bank governors are unlikely to be in celebratory mood when they jet in to Washington later this week. Even in the absence of an immediate meltdown, they will have plenty to talk about. Here are five topics likely to be on the agenda.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit and other threats to the global economy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cc4997a6e3776a3fa9b7a2761dc6fa3b950e697\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cc4997a6e3776a3fa9b7a2761dc6fa3b950e697/0_44_3375_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deutsche Bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The IMF will urge a clean-up of the problems besetting Deutsche Bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the IMF has revised upwards its short-term forecasts for the UK economy, it remains convinced that the long-term impact will be negative, particularly if Theresa May\u2019s government makes control of migration a higher priority than continued access to the single market.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, will urge the Bank of England and the Treasury to continue providing stimulus to the economy, with a warning that there could be fresh turbulence for both the UK and the rest of the EU when, with the triggering of article 50, divorce proceedings eventually start.</p> <p>Even so, having been a cheerleader for what Leave campaigners called Project Fear, Lagarde and her officials will have some explaining to do. Hammond is keen to talk up the prospects for the UK economy and will expect Lagarde to be less pessimistic than she was during the referendum campaign. The IMF can be expected to focus on other worries \u2013 and it has plenty of choice.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s global financial stability report is likely to highlight the problems of European banks hobbled by hundreds of billions of euros\u2019 worth of non-performing loans. It will be urging a speedy resolution of the problems besetting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\" title=\"\">Deutsche Bank</a>. It also fears that defeat for Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in the referendum on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\" title=\"\">reform of the senate</a> called for December would lead to a political and economic crisis that would have ramifications for the whole eurozone.</p> <p>Other countries being closely monitored by the IMF include the US \u2013 now set to grow more slowly in 2016 than was predicted six months ago \u2013 and China, where the government is trying to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on exports.</p> <h2>Adjusting to the \u2018new mediocre\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6/0_294_4992_2996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk past an electronics stock display at the window of a security company in Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor economic performance in Japan, as well as the US and Europe, means world growth is stuck at around 3%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ten years ago, the global economy was growing rapidly. Between 2003 and 2006, global growth averaged more than 5% a year \u2013 the strongest performance since the early 1970s. The IMF\u2019s flagship publication, the World Economic Outlook, could see no reason why the \u201cnew normal\u201d would come to an end and hailed the liberalisation of world financial markets as an unmitigated benefit.</p> <p>Times have changed. The new normal has become what Lagarde describes as the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d \u2013 in which growth remains stuck at barely more than 3% a year, thanks largely to the persistently poor performance of the developed nations: the US, Europe and Japan.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today, especially for advanced economies,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2016/09/27/am16-sp09282016-boosting-growth-adjusting-to-change\" title=\"\">she said in a speech last week</a>. \u201cAnd while there are some good signs, the overall growth outlook still remains subdued.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s concerns about Brexit stem, in part, from the knowledge that it would not take much for mediocre growth and low levels of inflation to turn into recession and deflation.</p> <h2><strong>Central banks are out of ammo</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Yellen federal reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global growth has been weak despite the best efforts of central banks.

But other central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013are moving in the opposite direction and providing additional stimulus.</p> <p>Lagarde has maintained a neutral position on a rise in US interest rates, but is known to fear the volatility a rate rise could bring \u2013 as money held in developing world banks, and even in London and Frankfurt, flows to the US in search of a safe return at a higher rate. She also thinks central banks are being asked to do too much, and that achieving higher levels of growth will require a three-pronged approach: monetary stimulus, tax cuts or spending increases from finance ministries, and structural reform.</p> <p>The IMF has urged countries which have the financial headroom to do so to spend money on growth-boosting public investment. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/09/27/AM16-SP09282016-Boosting-Growth-Adjusting-to-Change\" title=\"\">In a recent speech</a>, Lagarde singled out Canada, Germany and South Korea as ones with plenty of spare cash.

Since its creation at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the IMF has been at the forefront of attempts to reduce barriers to trade. It now views with alarm the ebb tide of globalisation, seen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\" title=\"\">anti free-trade rhetoric of Donald Trump</a>, the stalling of negotiations between Washington and Brussels on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</a> and the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The director general of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azev\u00eado, will join Lagarde in Washington this week to make the case for freer trade. The concern of both organisations is not just that there has been a gradual rise over the past four years in the number of protectionist measures introduced, but that there is a risk of an anti-trade narrative taking root, which says all the gains from openness are being captured by a tiny global elite.</p> <p>Lagarde says this mood is encouraged by growing inequality, and that tackling the divide between rich and poor would make it easier to negotiate trade deals and for governments to push for other structural reforms.</p> <h2><strong>A new debt crisis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1/0_120_2420_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in Luanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angola is one of the countries that has asked the IMF and World Bank for help as growth and commodity prices fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past decade, the activities of the IMF have overshadowed those of its sister organisation, the World Bank, which also holds its annual meeting this week.

Weak demand in the developed world has led to sharp falls in commodity prices and slower growth in developing countries. The World Bank expects growth in sub-Saharan Africa to be just 1.6% \u2013 the lowest in more than two decades.</p> <p>Angola, Kenya and Nigeria are among countries that have already turned to the IMF and the World Bank for help, and if growth remains weak others are likely to join them.</p> <p>The echoes of another age \u2013 one when the annual meetings were dominated by calls for debt relief \u2013 are getting louder.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Strauss was right when he said, upon arrival here after dark on Friday, that it had been \u201ca long journey physically and metaphorically\u201d. Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/dhaka-bangladesh-restaurant-attack-hostages\" title=\"\">Holey Artisan Bakery was stormed</a> by terrorists three months ago, with 20 hostages, including many foreigners, then killed, rarely has there been a cricket tour in the past decade subject to so much scrutiny.</p> <p>But the tour has begun, so out with the scrutiny and up the security. The influence of Reg Dickason, the hard-nosed Australian expert whose review declared Bangladesh fit for touring, is there for all to see. Strauss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team\" title=\"\">England\u2019s</a> director of cricket, spoke just after the players had been whisked through a VIP customs exit at the airport, before the team bus was escorted by heavily-armed police through crowds desperate for a glimpse.</p> <p>As the team manager, Phil Neale, and Bangladesh Cricket Board officials waited to gather the squad\u2019s myriad bags \u2013 so many that they need a private hold on the plane \u2013 in the arrivals\u2019 lounge, a growing crowd did their best to read the labels as the bags zipped round the conveyor belt. The sporting excitement regarding the cricket is multiplied due to the sheer gratitude at England\u2019s decision to tour. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/01/cricket-australia-poised-to-call-off-bangladesh-tour-amid-security-fears\" title=\"\">Australia cancelled a tour </a>and withdrew their under-19s from the World Cup even before the Dhaka attack; had England jilted them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bangladesh-cricket-team\" title=\"\">Bangladesh</a>\u2019s cricketers would likely have faced a nomadic existence.</p> <p>If that goodwill is palpable, so is the security at the team hotel. Staff say it is as heavy as it has ever been and is possible to be, with police at the gate, military on the door and watchful eyes patrolling each floor. The Bangladesh and Afghanistan teams \u2013 whose three-match ODI series ended on Saturday \u2013 are also staying here and the BCB have set up station in the lobby, giving it the sense of a little cricketing compound, tucked away beyond the crowds.</p> <p>The ring of steel has descended and it seems \u2013 even though members of the media have been running through the surrounding streets \u2013 England\u2019s cricketers will see little of Bangladesh except the view from the bus travelling to and from the ground when training begins on Sunday.</p> <p>Also travelling, alongside Strauss, is the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, Tom Harrison. The pair see their trip as a statement of intent and support for the team, are delighted with Dickason\u2019s work so far and happy to be here.</p> <p>Notably absent are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/eoin-morgan\" title=\"\">Eoin Morgan</a> and Alex Hales, but England are also without their coach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/trevor-bayliss\" title=\"\">Trevor Bayliss</a>, marooned in Sydney until next week with visa troubles. Mark Wood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jimmy-anderson\" title=\"\">Jimmy Anderson</a> will not be coming; concern appears to be growing that the latter\u2019s shoulder will prevent him travelling to India.</p> <p>What remains is a callow but scintillating set of players. Morgan, Hales and the rested Joe Root leave gaping holes at the top of the batting order, with the onus on Jason Roy, a relative veteran with 18 months\u2019 ODI cricket, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jos-buttler\" title=\"\">Jos Buttler</a> and Ben Stokes, the captain and vice-captain. The prospect of a debut \u2013 in both formats, but initially with Roy at the top of the ODI order \u2013 for Northamptonshire\u2019s Ben Duckett is particularly thrilling for those who have followed his progress, all 2,706 runs of it, this summer.</p> <p>In the past month Duckett claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/ben-duckett-england-northamptonshire\" title=\"\">a triptych of prestigious awards</a> (the Cricket Writers\u2019 Club Young Player of the Year and an unprecedented, peer-voted double at the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association awards), committed his future to Northants and smash his third and fourth Championship tons of the season, the smallest of the four, two of which became doubles, was 185, and embarked on his first full England tour.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have said to remember why I\u2019m here, not to shy away from it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times in the past I\u2019ve tried to be a player that I\u2019m not, which is why I haven\u2019t been successful.

At times that won\u2019t come off, but when it does, cash in and that has been the main thing for me this year.\u201d</p> <p>It seems unlikely, then, he will abandon his un-English relish for dismantling spin bowling, notably seen when he scored 220 and 163 (both unbeaten) against Pakistan and Sri Lanka\u2019s A teams for England Lions in July. If the weather holds \u2013 monsoon season is just ending but there is talk of rain next week \u2013 much fun lies ahead for Duckett and the rest.</p>",

It was supported by the American Indian Movement of Central Texas (AIMCTX), whose members have demonstrated against the Dakota pipeline outside the Dallas headquarters of Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind both schemes. </p> <p>The Standing Rock Sioux tribe fears that the Dakota pipeline could damage their water supply. \u201cThis has really opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes \u2013 pipelines everywhere \u2013 and has brought to life the number of pipelines that are bursting or leaking throughout the United States,\u201d said Blue Horse, of the AIMCTX.</p> <p>\u201cMy opinion is this \u2013 I think Kelcy Warren figures that my people, Native American people, are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to being a voice or being recognised at anything,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Warren is the billionaire CEO of Energy Transfer and he has amassed wealth and power as the mastermind of a vast pipeline network.

The 60-year-old was a major donor to the election campaign of Texas governor Greg Abbott. Last year, Abbott appointed Warren to a seat on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, the board of a state department whose <a href=\"http://tpwd.texas.gov/about/mission-philosophy\">mission</a> is \u201cto manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas\u201d.</p> <p>For the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, which is expected to be finished next year, Energy Transfer linked up with a company controlled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/06/carlos-slim-biography-diego-enrique-osorno-interviews\">Carlos Slim</a>, Mexico\u2019s richest man.</p> <p>On paper, perhaps, it did not seem likely to cause a fuss: relatively small and going through a sparsely populated area known as the Big Bend. Its proponents argue that it brings jobs and will reduce Mexico\u2019s dependence on coal.</p> <p>But it slices through a region of natural beauty beloved by its residents precisely because it was untouched by the large-scale oil and gas developments that dominate much of a state with about <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/pipeline-safety/\">432,000 miles</a> of pipeline.</p> <p>And, critics charge, there is no real national benefit, since the gas is headed for Mexico, to take advantage of recent energy industry reforms there.</p> <p>As well as environmental and economic concerns, the fight against the Trans-Pecos pipeline also spotlighted Texas\u2019s oil and gas industry regulations \u2013 or rather, the lack of them. Until recently, companies were able to assert their pipelines were for the public good simply by checking a box on a one-page form filed with the relevant state agency, the railroad commission. In essence, the commission registers new pipelines without judging whether they are needed or whether the route is appropriate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/10/texas-big-bend-natural-gas-pipeline-residents\">Texas pipeline plans rouse protest and pride from residents of lush Big Bend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once they have \u201ccommon carrier\u201d status, the company can use the power of \u201ceminent domain\u201d to route through private property over the objections of landowners, who have to resort to court action if they cannot come to an agreement with the company.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sick of being pushed around,\u201d said Glover, one of the organisers of Friday\u2019s march. \u201cOur community rights, our individual rights, our property rights, our environmental rights, are all very important and we need to live in a country that values those things.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a map of the United States and all the pipelines, it\u2019s crazy.

  "<p> Alastair Campbell has admitted that his newly published diaries show clearly how New Labour sowed the seeds of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union</a> by failing to respond to growing concerns over immigration.</p> <p>The former Downing Street director of communications said he feared the party became complacent on the issue due to Tony Blair\u2019s electoral success, allowing the debate to shift in favour of a pro-Brexit vote in the EU referendum years later. </p> <p>The diaries, covering between 2003-2005, also reveal the then chancellor Gordon Brown had growing concerns that Labour had not done enough to change opinions, complaining that Blair was helping the Tories under Michael Howard to turn immigration into an electoral issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/grace-campbell-alastair-campbell-how-i-survived-a-childhood-in-politics\">I was a Blairite baby: how Grace Campbell survived a childhood in politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Campbell told the Guardian: \u201cWe were more and more aware of the problem politically but there was always a tension between knowing that the economy and public services needed immigration but knowing the issue was causing real concerns. I think the fact that we won two elections in 2001 and 2005 despite the Tories campaigning on immigration may also have made us complacent. Just as in Scotland people started to feel Labour support was taken for granted so in areas of high immigration I think some Labour voters started to feel the same.</p> <p>\u201cI think deep down we always felt despite the difficulties we would be able to persuade people of the benefits of immigration and the benefits of the EU. We did to a large extent but where we are now, on both issues, suggests that we did not cement the political views we were putting forward.\u201d</p> <p>The diaries, Campbell\u2019s fifth volume and available from Thursday, record Blair\u2019s pollster Philip Gould raising immigration as a key factor in loss of support for Labour as early as 2004.</p> <p>In one extract in January that year from the book, Outside, Inside, which is being serialised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/27/the-new-european-sales\">New European newspaper</a>, Campbell writes: \u201cPG was worried we had three groups of people we were losing: anti-war middle-class and younger voters shifting to the Libs because of Iraq and tuition fees; suburban middle-class, some of them moving to the Tories over more general issues; and working-class voters switching to disengagement because of asylum and immigration in particular, and the feeling they are getting a raw deal. </p> <p>\u201cAsylum was definitely linking up all our negatives now, from anything bad on the economy to crime, pressure on public services, terrorism, Europe. There was an opening for populism that we had to watch out for.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell\u2019s diaries further reveal that in 2005 he asked the then Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, to join up with the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, to attack the Conservatives\u2019 hardline immigration policies under leader Michael Howard. One diary extract reads: \u201cAlex was interesting on the Howard stuff. He felt he had a point but that every foreigner would hate it. I said he and Wenger should do a joint presser saying they would have to send all their players back to their own countries under a Tory immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>It is also documented that it was Brown\u2019s belief that Labour under Blair, whom he was agitating to replace, was giving the Conservatives scope to make immigration a key issue. An extract from February 2005 reads: \u201c[Gordon Brown] said Bush was dominating world politics, a rightwing ideologue. But he was pretty down about [Bill] Clinton, with obvious resonances to [Tony Blair]. \u2018He won two elections, he did some good things, and was popular at times, but he didn\u2019t change the country\u2019s direction for good.\u2019 I argued that we had done a lot to change the country, not least thanks to him, but he said: \u2018Come on, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough and nor do I.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018We have not changed the country as much as we could and should. Look at the media 80% come at politics from a rightwing agenda, and we haven\u2019t changed that.

The vice-president\u2019s highly audible sigh in the 2000 presidential debate was just possibly the domino that led to the election of George W Bush, which led to the Iraq war, which led to the current mess, which led to Donald Trump. Thus can a sigh or a sniffle sink civilisation.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Hitler is having a moment. Making comparisons to the Nazis is often the sign of a losing argument. But credit to the New York Times for its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/books/hitler-ascent-volker-ullrich.html\">review of a Hitler biography</a> that contains some unnerving points without ever mentioning Donald Trump\u2019s name and is all the more powerful for that (after all, the pigs in Animal Farm are not called Stalin and Trotsky).</p> <p>Highlights include: \u201cHitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u2018only loved himself\u2019 \u2013 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatisation and \u2026 a \u2018characteristic fondness for superlatives\u2019\u201d; \u201cHitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u2018bottomless mendacity\u2019 that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message\u201d; \u201cHitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \u2018to lead Germany to a new era of national greatness\u2019, though he was typically vague about his actual plans\u201d; \u201cEarly on, revulsion at Hitler\u2019s style and appearance \u2026 led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u2018evening\u2019s entertainment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Just coincidence, then, that Barack Obama should make a Hitler reference of his own at a White House ceremony for the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Noting the presence of relatives of Jesse Owens and 17 other African American athletes who competed at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/29/remarks-president-welcoming-2016-usa-olympic-and-paralympic-teams\">the outgoing president said</a>: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Jesse. It was other African American athletes in the middle of Nazi Germany under the gaze of Adolf Hitler that put a lie to notions of racial superiority \u2013 whupped them \u2013 and taught them a thing or two about democracy and taught them a thing or two about the American character.\u201d</p> <p>Trump: come 8 November, beware a whupping.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Spotted on the menu at the new <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/hotel-collection/washington-dc/trump-intl-hotel\">Trump International Hotel</a> in Washington: \u201cThe Benjamin beer silver bucket, unlimited Amerrica beer.\u201d</p> <p>Make Amerrica great again.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gingrichproductions.com/\">Newt Gingrich</a>, former House speaker and Clinton foe, was at the Kennedy Center with his wife, Callista \u2013 a chorister \u2013 to watch Mozart\u2019s opera The Marriage of Figaro last weekend.

He doesn\u2019t need that.\u201d But you can\u2019t rehearse too much, in opera or in life. The night\u2019s performance made a false start when the curtain got stuck due to a technical hitch.

Instead, he employs a second \u201cchase plane\u201d for the media. Time magazine\u2019s Zeke Miller has anointed it First Amendment One, a reference to the US constitutional measure that protects freedom of the press.<br></p> <p>The arrangement enables Trump to continue to enjoy his own private plane, which he flies largely at taxpayer expense since it transports his secret service detail. On at least one occasion, it has kept reporters from making it to a Trump rally in time to hear him start speaking. The Republican nominee used the absence of the reporters, many of whom have been following him for more than a year, as an opportunity to mock them.</p> <p>Not all reporters on \u201cFirst Amendment One\u201d relish the nickname.

  "<p>Splash! There\u2019s a ripple on the water and I grapple with my camera to focus on the river. An otter-sized ripple is radiating out across the current. But it turns out to be from a fluorescent stick that\u2019s been tossed into the river and is now being chased by a swimming dog. I lower my camera. Even at 7am, dog-walkers are a ubiquitous hazard for anyone wanting to capture British wildlife.</p> <p>In another life, perhaps I would have had a double-barrelled surname and swaggered across the savannah in khaki, paying off my mortgage with a single photograph of a lion mauling a wildebeest. It\u2019s never too late to pursue your dreams, though \u2013 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hunched by a Suffolk riverbank with a malfunctioning camera, failing to photograph an otter and instead capturing a blurry image of a dog.</p> <p>I\u2019m getting tips from David Tipling, who is not a posh savannah-swaggering type, but an acclaimed photographer who has travelled the world in pursuit of rare birds. Tipling also offers one-to-one tuition, and close encounters with real wildlife. We meet at 7am by the River Little Ouse in Suffolk to look for otters. Tipling keeps it simple: with tiny binoculars around his neck and a Nikon with a 600mm telephoto zoom, he moves unusually quietly through the countryside. Fieldcraft, as well as technical know-how, is essential in wildlife photography \u2013 and few of us have it since we don\u2019t spend enough time outdoors. \u201cI call it the three Ps,\u201d says Tipling. \u201cYou need patience, perseverance and planning. If you\u2019re at the wrong time of day, or wrong time of year, you\u2019ll miss the wildlife.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0/0_0_2592_3888/667.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict on Patrick\u2019s shot \u2026 \u2018This has nice light and the poses are good.

While there\u2019s only a 50/50 chance of finding one, once you do they are surprisingly easy to follow, providing you move quickly ahead the moment they dive underwater.</p> <p>The elusiveness of most creatures is one reason why many keen photographers go on a course with a professional. Tipling may have travelled the world taking shots to illustrate Birds &amp; People, Mark Cocker\u2019s majesterial book from 2013, but he also knows exactly where to find a barn owl in Norfolk, and he has a special trick (I could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to kill you) to get close to wild hares.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even Tipling fails to turn up any otters during two hours of lovely riverside walking. We do enjoy seeing five kingfishers darting across the water, however. But these are gone in a flash \u2013 even Tipling doesn\u2019t attempt to photograph them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702/0_130_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have you ever admired a lovely shot of a kingfisher perched on a bare branch, silver fish in beak? Well, it was almost certainly set up. To photograph a kingfisher, Tipling says, you need to prepare a riverside branch, removing other branches so there\u2019s no visual clutter, then build a shelter to conceal yourself. You may also need bait.</p> <p>In fact, many amazing wildlife shots are created with a surprising amount of human intervention. So for our next lesson, we head to a Norfolk wood where Tipling has built a hide with special one-way glass imported from Barcelona. With the help of a feeder cleverly concealed behind an old oak stump, he has photographed sparrowhawks, green and greater-spotted woodpeckers, rare woodcocks and dozens of forest birds, not to mention stoats, squirrels, badgers, buzzards and red kites.</p> <p>We sit, concealed, on comfortable chairs and talk technology. Keen amateurs are sometimes said to have \u201call the gear and no idea\u201d. I\u2019ve just got no idea. In the decade since I bought a basic Canon digital single-lens reflex (one of those \u201cproper\u201d cameras where you look through the lens to take a shot) I\u2019ve specialised in mediocre pictures on automatic settings. I don\u2019t know what half my camera buttons do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The verdict \u2026 \u2018I like this, but a professional might have focused more on the water and less on the clouds, leaving something to the viewer\u2019s imagination.

Many keen amateurs purchase a basic telescopic zoom lens for \u00a31,000. But there is secondhand kit and it\u2019s possible to innovate cheaply: for his aerial work, instead of a drone Tipling attaches a \u00a3150 camera to a kite.</p> <p>The big revelation is to be shown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/photography-camera-tips\">features my own camera has</a> that I never knew existed. There\u2019s a \u201cdepth of field\u201d preview button so I can see what will be in focus before I take a shot. Tipling explains white balance (just keep it set to automatic), quiet shutter mode (a normal shutter click can spook a barn owl \u2013 Tipling recommends allowing a barn owl to fly as close as possible before taking that first photo) and the importance of technicalities such as Adobe RGB (the amount of colour information stored on a picture file). We also change my ISO setting from 100 to 800, which enables faster shutter speeds in lower light to better freeze movement.</p> <p>We examine a photo of a swan I took that morning. My automatic light settings overexposed the white bird against the dark water. Relying on automatic settings is too crude for most wildlife photography: Tipling sets his shutter speed and aperture manually. If I had done the same, I could have underexposed the photograph, making it darker, and thereby revealing the beautiful detail of the swan\u2019s feathers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40677c627c04ba047c0c41fa1f601cce0d6283a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40677c627c04ba047c0c41fa1f601cce0d6283a3/0_325_4921_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s swan and, below, Patrick\u2019s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David\u2019s swan and, below, Patrick\u2019s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25023a7e8ad40930a34aecef62e6c27a0d328917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25023a7e8ad40930a34aecef62e6c27a0d328917/0_174_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pro\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018The automatic settings have made Patrick\u2019s swan overexposed.

The quicker the shutter speed, the more sharply a camera captures movement: 1/1,000th of a second should be enough for a moving bird wing, although big flappy birds such as herons can be photographed in flight at lower speeds. The aperture (f2.8 to f22 on most cameras) sets the depth of field, or how much is in focus (f22 gives the deepest focus but lets in least light). Because Britain is often gloomy, you usually need a low f-stop.</p> <p>This is no bad thing for wildlife photography, though, because a shallow depth of field blurs the background and isolates the subject \u2013 just what we want. Novices are often so focused on their quarry, they don\u2019t pay any attention to what\u2019s behind it. Avoiding placing background tree branches through the head of a bird in the foreground is harder than it sounds. And even if you blur out what\u2019s behind, patches of light can still distract the eye. \u201cI keep backgrounds as clean as possible,\u201d says Tipling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b/0_0_2000_2320/862.jpg\" alt=\"David Tipling\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out in the field \u2026 David Tipling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, I snap away at blue tits and great tits, miss a shrew and get a blurry squirrel.

Tipling has checked the tides and we jump creeks and walk a mile across flat sand. On a distant bank lie more than 100 grey and common seals. \u201cThe biggest photographic challenge here is to make order out of chaos,\u201d says Tipling. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a chaotic jumble of bodies lying across the sand and you\u2019re trying to create a picture that takes away that chaos and gives some sort of impact. You\u2019ve got to get in reasonably tight, otherwise you lose the impact of the seals looking at you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/aug/31/2016-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-finalists\">2016 wildlife photographer of the year finalists - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We also have a \u201cfieldcraft\u201d challenge: getting closer without disturbing them. \u201cLow and slow\u201d is Tipling\u2019s mantra, and we approach a group of a dozen seals, extremely slowly and at a zig-zagging angle, as if we might be walking past them. I disapprove of disturbing wildlife but by using this approach, which takes a full hour, we get astonishingly close \u2013 and the seals are undisturbed. Tipling advises me to shoot at seal\u2019s eye-level to create a more intimate picture, slowly shifting position to squeeze out distracting lumps of other seals in the background.</p> <p>After a couple of hours, we quietly leave these beautiful beasts. I\u2019m glowing from a day outside, from my close encounters with wildlife, and from finally understanding what I can achieve with all those different buttons on my camera.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>David Tipling runs <a href=\"http://www.davidtipling.com/\">personalised Norfolk photographic safaris</a>: \u00a3275 per day; \u00a3390 for two people.</em></p> <h2><strong>Tipling\u2019s tips</strong></h2> <p>1. The \u201crule of thirds\u201d applies well to landscapes and wildlife: 1/3<sup>rd</sup> foreground, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> subject, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> background tends to create a nicely balanced picture.</p> <p>2. Give your subject space to breathe, don\u2019t just plonk it in the centre.</p> <p>3. Focus on the eyes: our eye is drawn to animal eyes in photographs \u2013 if an eye is blurry, it\u2019s rare for a picture to work.</p> <p>4. Check your background: lower your aperture/f-stop to reduce your depth of field and blur distracting backgrounds.</p> <p>5. Even professionals get wonky horizons on their landscapes \u2013 these can be retrospectively straightened with Photoshop or other computer software.</p> <p>6. Dare to go manual: If you want to capture action, go for a high shutter speed; if you desire texture and depth of field, set your aperture at f11 or higher.</p> <h2>The shot that almost sank a plane</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf/0_0_3421_5286/647.jpg\" alt=\"Emperor penguins in Antarctica\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emperor penguins in Antarctica</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Tipling went to extreme lengths to capture his most popular photograph \u2013 an emperor penguin and its chick. He flew to the Antarctic on a Hercules and camped 400 miles from the south pole before taking two flights in a Twin Otter 2,000 miles to the penguin colony. While camping on sea ice for 10 days, he was caught in a storm that began breaking up the ice. He and his group had to fly up into the blizzard or the plane would\u2019ve been lost. With almost no fuel left, they landed on the Antarctic plateau. He then had to walk ahead of the plane for 13 miles to make sure the ice was safe for it to taxi to the nearest refuelling spot. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fantastic thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><br></h2>",
  "<p>Over the years I\u2019ve kept many diaries: seed sowing, daily temperatures (max and min), night temperatures (max and min), propagation, first flowering, trials, tribulations and some heartache. They are all interesting in one way or another. Gardening is an art, but there\u2019s a great deal of science to make it work; understanding the many variables is part of mastering it. Or, if mastering\u2019s too much to hope for, a diary at least allows you to recognise your own messy, variable&#xa0;ways.</p> <p>If nothing else, learn to love plant labels. Yes, they are unsightly, and there\u2019s nothing sadder than a graveyard of them littering a bed, but there is no better way to record plant information.</p> <p>The plant\u2019s name is a must, because however much you believe you will remember it, you won\u2019t. Include the date, too \u2013 if in three weeks nothing has appeared, you can start to think of resowing. (Unless you\u2019re sowing perennials, shrubs or trees, which in some cases can take more than a year to germinate.) Seed doesn\u2019t germinate for all sorts of reasons: you sowed poorly, or it succumbed to disease early on and got damped off, or the seed was too old to be viable. You only see a pattern if you record it. If you\u2019re sowing in a community setup,&#xa0;particularly with beginner gardeners, knowing who has sown what is an essential teaching tool.</p> <p>Finally, if you are using more than one brand of&#xa0;compost, it\u2019s well worth noting this too, because good compost can make a huge difference to germination.</p> <p>I always write on labels in pencil because it doesn\u2019t fade in the sun and is easily removed with wire wool when you want to recycle. After years&#xa0;of experimenting with every type going, the&#xa0;bog-standard white label wins. It\u2019s easily cleaned up and will last for years if you buy a good version (try <a href=\"http://www.harrodhorticultural.com/plastic-plant-labels-pid8026.html\" title=\"\">harrodhorticultural.com</a>, pack of 100 for \u00a34.95). Thrifty types will find that plastic ice-cream or margarine tubs, and some milk cartons, make equally useful homemade labels with a little scissor action. I find the biggest issue with wooden labels is that they either rot or the writing fades. Bury the label in the ground at 12 o\u2019clock to the back of the plant; that way, even if you have to dig a bit, you\u2019ll always know where&#xa0;to look.</p> <p>In my good years, I back up all that I write on the labels in a seed-sowing book or in notes on my phone; it\u2019s one of the most useful things I&#xa0;do. As for the labels that come with shop-bought plants, I stick them on a pin board in the shed, or paste them into my notebook with a location in the garden. (The plastic nearly always shatters or fades if you leave them on the plant.)</p> <p>I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://www.anyweatherpaper.co.uk/waterproof-notebooks\" title=\"\">Rite In The Rain</a> waterproof notebooks. There are <a href=\"https://www.anyweatherpaper.co.uk/waterproof-notebooks/pocket-notebook-4-x-6\" title=\"\">reporter-style ones</a> if you want something small (\u00a36.99), or splash out on the <a href=\"https://www.anyweatherpaper.co.uk/waterproof-notebooks/geological-bound-book-4-3-4-x-7-1-2\" title=\"\">Geological version</a> (\u00a327.99) for something to keep in your damp shed.

  "<p>In 2013, more than 150 years after her death, Julia Pastrana was finally returned to her birthplace in Mexico for a proper burial. Famed during her lifetime as \u201cthe&#xa0;Ugliest Woman in the World\u201d, Pastrana, born in 1834, had two rare conditions: generalised hypertrichosis lanuginosa, which left her face and body covered with thick hair, and gingival hyperplasia, which thickened her lips and gums and gave her an unusually protruding jaw. The result, combined with her diminutive, curvaceous figure, led contemporary scientists to&#xa0;claim her as the \u201clink between mankind and the orangutan\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/26/carol-birch-interview-orphans-of-the-carnival\">Carol Birch: \u2018I am amazed at how people come through extreme things \u2013 at the strength of people\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the age of 20, Pastrana was sold to a Mexican customs administrator who exhibited her across the US and Canada before bringing her to New York. There she met and married Theodore Lent, an impresario on his uppers with whom she travelled to Europe, where again she was toured exhaustively. These were the boom years for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/oct/21/carny-classics\" title=\"\">freak shows</a>, an era of seemingly insatiable appetite for human oddity, and Pastrana was their poster girl, exciting the&#xa0;curiosity and disgust of medical professionals and paying punters alike. When she died in childbirth, Lent refused to let it get in the way of what was by then very good business. He had mother and child stuffed and continued to put them on show, twin exhibits in glass cases.</p> <p>It is no surprise that Pastrana\u2019s strange and macabre story caught the imagination of a novelist like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/26/carol-birch-interview-orphans-of-the-carnival\" title=\"\">Carol Birch</a>. Birch\u2019s previous novel, the terrific, Booker-shortlisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/jamrachs-menagerie-carol-birch-review\" title=\"\"><em>Jamrach\u2019s Menagerie</em></a>, took its inspiration from a true-life collector of exotic animals, among them a pair of armadillos bought by Gabriel Dante Rossetti which proceeded to burrow under the lawns of his neighbours in Chelsea. In that book, Birch showed herself to be a master storyteller, venturing into those richly coloured landscapes where everyday life tips into the fantastic.</p> <p>Like Jaffy, the protagonist of <em>Jamrach\u2019s Menagerie</em>, Julia Pastrana is an impoverished orphan granted by chance the opportunity to travel the world. Unlike Jaffy, however, she is not the seeker but the sought. In <em>Orphans of the Carnival</em>, Birch explores what it feels like to owe one\u2019s success to other people\u2019s fascinated revulsion; to be imprisoned in a body that is at the same time a golden ticket and a curse.</p> <p>The uneasy relationship the Victorians had with the human oddities they found so compelling meant that Pastrana was alternately feted and shunned, one day the toast of the town, the next an abomination to be hidden from children and expectant mothers for their own safety.</p> <p>Birch\u2019s Pastrana is a gentle, intelligent soul, soft-hearted enough not only to be hurt by but also to feel pity for those she terrifies; clear-sighted enough to appreciate the slightness of her talents as a performer: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I have a particularly beautiful voice, she thought. It\u2019s that they\u2019re surprised I have any voice at all that isn\u2019t a grunt or a howl.\u201d She knows all too well that her appearance is a double-edged sword. While she longs for normality, to be \u201cout in the world, free, unafraid\u201d, she understands, too, that her life \u201cis more interesting now\u201d. She relishes having money to spend. She takes pleasure in performing, in travelling the world and meeting new people. Her tragedy lies in the certainty that \u201ceveryone loved her because she made them so glad they were themselves and&#xa0;not her\u201d.</p> <p>Birch has clearly done her research and the novel sticks closely to Pastrana\u2019s real-life story. But, although Birch writes beautifully and creates some wonderful moments, the narrative never quite takes off. There is too&#xa0;little of the spark of gloriously unfettered imagination that ignited <em>Jamrach\u2019s Menagerie</em> in <em>Orphans of the&#xa0;Carnival</em>, especially once Pastrana leaves her motley crew of fellow freaks to travel alone. Touring has always been a drearily repetitive business \u2013 \u201ca&#xa0;long stretch of tedium punctuated by shows\u201d, as Birch puts it \u2013 and the book reflects this truth rather too accurately for its own good. It is only when Birch turns her attention to the conflicted Lent that the story gains real&#xa0;momentum.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the modern-day thread that runs through the book proves a distraction, its connection to the main story coming too late to make sense of its inclusion. When Lent first meets Pastrana, he tells her that \u201cnobody wants the truth. They want a story. A&#xa0;good one.\u201d Unfortunately, and despite its rich material, this one is not&#xa0;quite good enough.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Orphans of the Carnival</em> for \u00a312.29 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/orphans-of-the-carnival.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>Once the beach resort of choice for fashionable Glaswegians, the Isle of Bute lies in the Firth of Clyde, a short distance from Scotland\u2019s biggest city. This year, it became more famous as the place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/bute-refugees-dream-sun-syrian-families-resettled\">refugees from Syria said they wanted to leave</a>. Focusing on a run-down economy familiar to many British seaside resorts, the UK press painted Bute as a place with no future.</p> <p>But Bute turned the corner years ago, and many of the Syrian refugees have talked about their love for the island. When we visited this summer, the seafront squares in Rothesay, the port town, had just been renovated. The art deco Pavilion will reopen next summer, after a \u00a33m makeover, as an international arts venue. Old Victorian shops have been turned into stylish boutiques and upcycled furniture emporiums. There\u2019s a vegetarian cafe (<a href=\"http://www.musicker.co.uk/\">Musicker</a>) that sells guitars and books, and a bookshop that sells coffee (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PrintPointRothesay/\">Print Point</a>, West Princes Street), as well as old-style pubs and ice-cream makers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fca1c7031787ec2af153499a7be04da9240dd30d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fca1c7031787ec2af153499a7be04da9240dd30d/0_0_5170_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Stuart House has an absorbing art collection and also a restaurant and self-catering cottages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mount Stuart House has an absorbing art collection and also a restaurant and self-catering cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The council\u2019s decision to house refugees in unused accommodation here has mainly gone down well: most of the Syrians say they like life on this little island, and most of the locals have welcomed them with open arms. Dropping into the Rothesay shops to pick up groceries, I overheard an elderly Buteman greeting one of the dads with a broad smile. \u201c<em>As-salaam-alaikum</em>,\u201d said the Buteman, over the boxes of Scottish Blend teabags and tablet. \u201cHey,\u201d said the Syrian dad.</p> <p>On a long weekend in Bute, my boyfriend and I stayed in a self-catering converted stable on the Mont Stuart estate \u2013 a chic and cosy place with slate floors, tweed sofas and a woodburning stove.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6510d86b8f450a812b1fe0c95dcd8dacf20c228e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6510d86b8f450a812b1fe0c95dcd8dacf20c228e/0_17_508_305/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kilchattan Bay, Bute\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kilchattan Bay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Moment Open</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mount Stuart was the ancestral home of Bute\u2019s landowners, built by a Marquess of Bute who also happened to be the richest man in Britain at the time. More of a palace, the Victorian Gothic house was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson, and stacks arch upon marble arch, so entering its main hall feels like stepping into a cathedral, flecked with light and colour. The decor revolves around religion and the stars. Perhaps when a person has immense wealth, they need to be assured that their good fortune is part of the order of the universe. At any rate, constellations rush across the ceiling, while signs of the zodiac bloom on the stained-glass windows. The stars are clear prisms casting balls of rainbow light on the floor below. In other rooms, Tintorettos, Titians and Veroneses fill the walls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a637f2fbb250a85995d2d06827a5d6203a16f2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a637f2fbb250a85995d2d06827a5d6203a16f2f9/0_359_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Families at Ettrick Bay on the Isle of Bute\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Families at Ettrick Bay on the Isle of Bute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Academics come from the universities of Oxford and Yale to work on the collections in Mount Stuart\u2019s libraries. This year, an original Shakespeare folio turned up there: it\u2019s on display upstairs. But I got just as much pleasure from the house itself. I found a rose engraved on the hinge-plate of a door, and bees carved into a pillar wreathed in oak leaves and acorns. Every nook is crammed with hand-worked detail. It\u2019s like exploring Rivendell, with pieces of history thrown in \u2013 Bonnie Prince Charlie\u2019s pistols, family portraits of the Tudors.</p> <p>Those staying on the estate get a free pass to visit the house. When the house is closed to visitors, they can wander down through its quiet lawns and tree-lined walks to the rocky shore. We loved watching the seals bask in the evening sunshine here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da8dcb25cddbd8125294abc3ae8662a0215f65bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da8dcb25cddbd8125294abc3ae8662a0215f65bf/0_101_5845_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another view of Rothesay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another view of Rothesay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bute has a rare blend of worldliness and wilderness. Beyond the up-and-coming town of Rothesay are peaceful, windswept Hebridean vistas. The West Island Way runs the length of the island, providing good, waymarked footpaths through the hills. At Kingarth, near the southernmost tip of Bute, I passed the ruined monastery of Saint Blane, hidden in a green fold in the hills: among stone arches sit the graves of monks slaughtered by Viking raiders. Forking down to the road, I stopped for a picnic on a bench under a wind-blown tree. The ridges of a prehistoric hill fort jutted against the sea, with the mountains of Arran rising mistily in the distance.</p> <p>We spent another day touring the island\u2019s beaches. There\u2019s Ettrick, the most popular, with its busy tea-room, where we bought lovely ice-cream cones; St Ninians, where I picked rose quartz pebbles from the beach \u2013 there\u2019s also a small campsite here; Scalpsie, a broad bay shimmering with wildflowers; and Kilchattan, with its steep hill and friendly pub at Kingarth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c9b93f4bd7bb1fccfeaa4ad66fe909f623bdb23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9b93f4bd7bb1fccfeaa4ad66fe909f623bdb23/0_15_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"St Ninians bay Rothesay Bute\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Ninians with the Isle of Arran beyond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The island is big on renewables, and self-sufficiency.

It was fun to prepare meals in the kitchen of our converted stable on the estate. Because half of the stables are in use, our meals were punctuated by visits from the chickens, and a gentle soundtrack of snorting pigs.</p> <p>There are some good eating out options, too. Sunday lunch (\u00a316) at the Mount Stuart restaurant was superb: smoked salmon mousse with apple jelly, roast chicken with veg, and a cranachan millefeuille with lemon curd. All the dishes used local produce and were served in a modernist glass room that felt like a treehouse, situated above the new visitor centre at the entrance to the estate.

The fixed-term parliament act makes this route complicated, but not impossible. There is no sign from Downing Street that May relishes the distraction or volatility of a campaign.

  "<p>A hundred days on and the talk around Brexit is as delusional as ever. This week it fell to Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who is not allowed to negotiate international trade \u2013 that\u2019s Brussels\u2019 job until Britain leaves \u2013 to add to the already thick fog of fantasy. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/liam-fox-signals-britain-will-leave-the-single-market-in-hard-br/\">Fox declared that</a>, after the UK had left the EU, it would enjoy terms of commerce with Europe \u201cat least as free\u201d as those we had when we were still in. That makes perfect sense \u2013 if you think the EU\u2019s remaining 27 members are itching to show that exiting the EU exacts no cost, staying brings no benefits and others should start following us out the door.<br></p> <p>Where there is not magical thinking, there is vagueness and opacity. The prime minister might allow us a glimpse of her preferred degree of Brexit when she addresses the Tory party conference on Wednesday, but so far the only clues have come from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/brexit-weekly-briefing-theresa-may-3-three-brexiteers-0\">serial slapdowns</a> she has delivered to her ministers when they have supplied hints of their own.</p> <p>In this haze of obfuscation, Jeremy Corbyn shines bright as a beacon of clarity. Admittedly, he too has sent conflicting signals on the hardness or softness of his ideal Brexit, but on the intimately related issue of free movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\">he made his position crystal clear</a>this week. In so doing, he confirmed that immigration has emerged as the defining dividing line in his fractious party.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s stance is admirable and principled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t migrants who drive down wages,\u201d he said on Wednesday, blaming instead \u201cexploitative employers\u201d and the politicians who had both loosened the labour market and weakened trade unions. In the same way, it wasn\u2019t migrants who were putting strain on the NHS or causing a housing crisis. That was the fault of governments that had failed to invest in the health service or build new homes. And so, there would no \u201cfalse promises\u201d to bring down immigration. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">Corbyn\u2019s aides briefed that</a> he was \u201cnot concerned about numbers\u201d at all.</p> <p>It is a noble case, a rare defence of migrants, a group routinely maligned. The trouble is, Corbyn\u2019s stance is directly at odds with large swaths of his own party: those who would think of themselves as Labour realists. They are not all the usual suspects. Yes, they include the likes of shadow cabinet resigner Rachel Reeves, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\">spoke of her fear that \u201cbubbling tensions\u201d could \u201cexplode\u201d</a> if the kind of angst over immigration she encounters in her Leeds constituency is not assuaged. Andy Burnham, Chuka Umunna, Stephen Kinnock, Emma Reynolds and others have made a similar argument for controls. But so too has Angela Rayner, whose loyalty to Corbyn led her to take the shadow education portfolio after the summer rebellion. They are united in believing that the verdict of the electorate is now unmistakable. The voters want immigration controlled, they declared that loud and clear on 23 June and they can be ignored no longer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/labour-urged-to-make-immigration-controls-a-key-brexit-demand\">Labour urged to make immigration controls a key Brexit demand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I confess I find myself deeply torn on this most radioactive of topics. My every instinct is to stand with those who defend migrants and migration. Like so many others, I am the son of a mother born outside this country. A mere glance at my family tree shows the earliest roots were planted in soil far away from here. When I hear anti-immigration rhetoric I know that, 100 years ago, the target of such talk would have been me.</p> <p>And yet, I cannot ignore what Rayner, Reeves and the rest are saying. None of them is a racist. None hates migrants. None of them would, I believe, be calling for increased controls on immigration if they could see another option. But they are simply listening to what has become the settled will of the people they represent.</p> <p>This divide goes deeper than just immigration. It touches on class and geography too. For it is often a clash of the middle-class Labour of the big cities against the blue-collar Labour of the towns; London, metropolitan Labour \u2013 the Corbyn-McDonnell Labour that is relaxed about diversity \u2013 against the Labour of the post-industrial north, Midlands and east.</p> <p>More deeply still, it is a battle over what Labour should be. For many, especially among the idealists of Momentum who held their own, much livelier conference this week, Labour has to be a social movement that works to change public attitudes on migration and much else \u2013 even if that takes a generation. Ranged against them are those who see Labour as a political party that has to meet the voters where they are now, not where they would like them to be.</p> <p>There could be a pragmatic way to straddle this divide, revealed so vividly in the referendum. You could try to appeal to that part of the Labour coalition that overwhelmingly voted remain by promising to fight to retain British membership of the single market. At the same time, you\u2019d try to placate pro-leave Labour voters by aiming to modify or restrict the free movement of people. Some would call it cynical, but you might just about hold the Labour tribe together that way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/30/archbishop-of-york-says-eu-countries-are-shunting-migrants-towards-uk\">Archbishop of York says EU countries are 'shunting migrants' towards UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn is doing the exact opposite. He and his shadow chancellor <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/09/26/does-john-mcdonnell-even-know-what-his-brexit-strategy-is\">have signalled their readiness to jettison single market membership</a> \u2013 to be replaced by mere \u201caccess\u201d \u2013 but they are holding firm on free movement. For many, free movement is the price that has to be paid for the prize of single market membership. Corbyn\u2019s position is: let\u2019s give up the prize, but keep paying the price. At a stroke, he angers both Labour\u2019s remainers and its leavers, depriving both of what they cherish most. Whatever the opposite of a political sweet spot is, Corbyn has found it.</p> <p>To his credit, Corbyn did promise action to mitigate the impact of immigration. Rightly he said he\u2019d revive Gordon Brown\u2019s fund to pay for extra school places or housing in those areas that have taken in newcomers, and promised<strong> </strong>steps to prevent migrants undercutting the wages of workers already here. This way, he said, Labour would deal with \u201cthe real issues of immigration\u201d.</p> <p>But what if those are not the only real issues? What if it\u2019s not just the strain on services and pressure on pay that makes people fear immigration?

Grieve is among those warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a very high risk strategy and put the UK\u2019s economy and jobs at risk.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s grasp of trade law also came under attack from Sir David Edward, a former judge in the European court of justice who is advising the Scottish government on Brexit. Edward challenged Fox\u2019s claim that the UK would keep the EU\u2019s existing tariff schedule when it leaves the bloc.</p> <p>\u201cNobody who understands trade law could have possibly have said what he said,\u201d he told an MLex Competition conference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit \u2026 but the big question is when?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd as an economist has said, there is no such thing in today\u2019s world as free trade or a free trade agreement, there is only managed trade or participation in a regulated market, and that is quite important.

And that is that they do not want to see the economy suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not want to see jobs lost, they do not want to see standards of living decline. So they will expect us to negotiate a solution which delivers the key elements of leaving the EU, regaining our sovereignty, getting control over our borders \u2013 but they will expect us to do all of that in a way that allows the UK economy to go on growing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hammond is thought to be fighting the case within the cabinet for a deal that retains as much access to the single market as possible, against colleagues who would rather push for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d deal that distances the UK further from EU trade rules in order to achieve tougher controls on migration. </p>",

I used to own a small toaster oven \u2013 you could use a mini convector too \u2013 and cooked almost everything in it. I would make a batch of cookie dough and just bake the cookies as and when I needed them, warm out of the toaster oven.

Line a baking tray with parchment and grease lightly. Have a sugar thermometer ready in a glass of water near the hob.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Combine the sugar, syrup and salt with 60ml (about 4 tbsp) water in a large, heavy pan.

They should be gooey in the centre but crisp outside.</p> <h2><strong>Oatmeal prune cookies</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab13a7a178867bb28cab1375951189b4bab45759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab13a7a178867bb28cab1375951189b4bab45759/3476_1739_2942_1765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Ptak\u2019s oatmeal prune cookies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Ptak\u2019s oatmeal prune cookies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Makes 12 large cookies<br></strong>250g unsalted butter, softened<br>200g light brown sugar<br>100g caster sugar<br>1 egg<br>1\u00bd tsp vanilla extract<br>200g plain flour<br>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>1 tsp cinnamon<br>1 tsp salt<br>200g ground oats (if unavailable, use jumbo)<br>200g prunes, pitted and roughly chopped<br>Zest of 1 orange</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Cream the butter and sugars until well combined but not light and fluffy.

Add the dry mixture, along with the prunes and orange zest, to the creamed butter mixture and mix to combine.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Spoon heaped tablespoons of the mix on to a paper-lined tray that will fit in your fridge. Leave a bit of space between each cookie, as they will double in size when baked. Chill them while you preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. You can also pop them in the freezer at this point if you want to bake them later.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> If you are baking from frozen, allow the cookies 5-10 minutes out of the freezer before putting them in the oven. Bake for 18 minutes. The centre should be slightly soft and under-baked while the edges go golden and crisp. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving. These cookies will keep up to 5 days in an airtight container.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is a pastry chef, writer and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
