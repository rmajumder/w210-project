  "<p>I was looking at Facebook one evening last week when my attention was captured by the headline <a href=\"http://thetab.com/uk/2016/09/05/gin-lovers-psycopaths-17675\">Gin lovers are all massive psychopaths, according to experts</a> \u2013 a somewhat disconcerting thing to read as I sipped the gin and tonic I had in my hand at the time.</p> <p>As someone whose propensity to empathise with others has seen me spend entire evenings crying over the plight of movie characters, psychopathy has never made its way onto my list of self-diagnoses.</p> <p>I instantly felt compelled to learn more about how a penchant for gin had become the new diagnostic tool to detect a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/psychopaths-versus-sociopaths-what-is-the-difference-45047\">psychopath</a>. The short story is, it hasn\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/02/brisbane-show-to-fill-theatre-with-gin-and-tonic-vapour-for-guests-to-absorb\">Brisbane show to fill theatre with gin and tonic vapour for guests to absorb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I determined this reasonably efficiently. A search for the word \u201cgin\u201d in the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666315300428\">research paper</a> that prompted this news story produced a grand total of zero hits.</p> <p>It\u2019s therefore rather concerning that this paper has spawned a huge number of popular articles all reporting this non-existent link, such as <a href=\"http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/Gin-psychopath-test-alcohol-tonic-drink-truth-personality-favourite-beverage\">this one that has been shared on Facebook nearly 300,000 times</a>.</p> <p>Depending on what you read, if you\u2019re partial to a gin and tonic you are either <a href=\"http://thetab.com/uk/2016/09/05/gin-lovers-psycopaths-17675\">a psychopath</a>, or slightly more generously, <a href=\"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/news/a7758/gin-psychopath-study/\">a possible psychopath</a>.</p> <p>Other stories have cast the net a bit wider, branding <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/14/coffee-psychopathy-study_n_8296076.html\">coffee</a> and <a href=\"http://vinepair.com/booze-news/if-you-are-a-fan-of-ipa-science-says-youre-more-likely-to-by-psychotic/\">beer</a> drinkers as potential psychopaths too \u2013 which, if you think about it, would make society a pretty scary place.</p> <h2>Booze news</h2> <p>These news stories are misreported accounts of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666315300428\">research</a> from the University of Innsbruck. Across two studies, the researchers investigated the relationship between bitter taste preferences and various antisocial personality traits, including psychopathy.</p> <p>While many tend to think of it as a disorder that afflicts only the most calculating of criminals, psychopathy is also conceptualised as a personality trait that falls along a continuum, with those at the extreme end characterised by superficial charm, callousness, and a lack of empathy.</p> <p>The researchers measured psychopathy using a <a href=\"http://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/227057/The_Dirty_Dozen_A_Concise_Measure_of_the_Dark_Triad.pdf\">brief personality measure</a> that assesses three socially undesirable personality traits: psychopathy, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-are-we-becoming-so-narcissistic-heres-the-science-55773\">narcissism</a>, and Machiavellianism \u2013 collectively known as the \u201c<a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/8014939/jrp.02.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1476097838&amp;Signature=X6e04eud23fQSzJTITb2QdkCgvU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_dark_triad_of_personality_Narcissism.pdf\">dark triad</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/27/whos-for-gin-and-tonic-ice-cream-float-alcohol-ice-cream\">Who\u2019s for a gin and tonic ice-cream float?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Participants indicated their agreement with statements such as \u201cI tend to be callous or insensitive\u201d and \u201cI tend to lack remorse\u201d. Responses were then averaged to create a score for psychopathy and the other traits.</p> <p>The researchers measured bitter taste preferences in two ways. First, participants were provided with a list of 10 bitter foods and drinks, including coffee, tonic water, beer, radishes and celery, and rated them on a scale from 1 (dislike strongly) to 6 (like strongly). These scores were then averaged to create an overall measure of bitter taste preferences for each person. The researchers also asked participants to rate their liking for bitter foods and drinks in general (as opposed to the specific examples) on the same scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/66781/count.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The bitter truth</h2> <p>The results reported no significant relationship between psychopathy scores and participants\u2019 preference scores for the specific bitter foods and drinks. That is, those with higher psychopathy scores did not display stronger overall liking for the bitter foods and drinks on the list, including tonic water, coffee and beer.</p> <p>However, there was a weak correlation between psychopathy scores and participants\u2019 scores on their <em>general</em> preference for bitter tastes. So you might say that people at the psychopathic end of the spectrum are slightly more likely to express a preference for eating or drinking bitter things in general.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/may/19/gin-distillery-startups-renaissance\">Gin and tonic? The startups raising a glass to the gin renaissance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How on earth do these findings translate to people who drink gin, coffee or beer being probable psychopaths? Quite simply, they don\u2019t.</p> <p>The study provided no evidence that an individual\u2019s preference for specific bitter drinks such as coffee, beer or tonic water (with or without gin) has any relationship with psychopathy. Even if it had, this would fall a long way short of being able to brand anyone who enjoys a G&amp;T as a psychopath.</p> <p>The only thing this study found was a weak positive relationship between psychopathy and a general penchant for bitter things. In my view, this link is negligible compared with other, more well established predictors of psychopathy, such as a person\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/secrets-criminal-mind-adrian-raine/\">genes</a> or sex.</p> <p>If you want to know whether someone is a psychopath, the truth is that most will reveal themselves soon enough, especially if you know the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/not-all-psychopaths-are-criminals-some-psychopathic-traits-are-actually-linked-to-success-51282\">telltale signs</a> \u2013 which don\u2019t include whether or not they\u2019re brandishing an aperitif.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Megan Willis is a senior lecturer at the School of Psychology at the Australian Catholic University.

She was also one of 170 MPs who backed Owen Smith during the leadership race.<br></p> <p>At the time of her resignation, Debbonaire released a damaging statement recounting how Corbyn had appointed and then sacked her without ever speaking to her about either decision. She was still receiving treatment for breast cancer at the time.</p> <p>It was only when then shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, pushed him to reinstate her that he did so \u2013 which she only revealed after quitting the role.<br></p> <p>Debbonaire said in a statement that she was delighted to take on the role. \u201cMy duty will be to serve the whole Labour family. Thanks to Jeremy Corbyn for giving me this opportunity to serve.<br></p> <p>\u201cThese are uncertain times and there are real worries about the direction [in which] our country is heading. That makes it crucial that Labour is working as a strong, united team in parliament. We need to be able to effectively hold the government to account,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added that she was looking forward to having an active role. \u201cIn the coming weeks and months we will be fighting for genuine parliamentary oversight of Brexit, opposing Theresa May\u2019s divisive plans for grammar schools and putting pressure on the government over their inaction on Syria and the refugee crisis. I am looking forward to being an active part of that process.\u201d</p> <p>As a shadow whip her responsibilities will include acting as a communicator between backbenchers and the party leadership and ensuring that Labour MPs turn up to vote during their attempts to defeat the government.</p> <p>Two other MPs, Nick Smith and Chris Elmore, will also be joining her in the whips\u2019 office. </p>",

That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

It has been a rather odd occasion - not a debate about Brexit, but a debate about how parliament debates Brexit - but given that we now live in world where the pound can rally following the publication of government amendments to opposition day motions (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266#block-57fe14dce4b01d9dd2c90266\">11.50am)</a>, these procedural wrangles matter.</p> <ul> <li><strong>MPs are set to approve a motion with cross-party support saying the Commons must have a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d debate on the government\u2019s plans for Brexit before article 50 is invoked, but ministers are refusing to commit themselves to giving parliament an actual vote on the matter. </strong><strong>Theresa May</strong> made this clear at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2#block-57fe1fe8e4b03b22b4fb28b2\">12.36pm)</a> and<strong> David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, would not promise a substantive vote either in his speech at the start of the debate. It may well be the case that eventually MPs do get a vote, but any vote on a substantive motion would constrain the government, and also allow the possibility of Tory MPs rebelling with Labour, and May seems determined to resist it if at all possible. In his impressive debut as shadow Brexit secretary<strong> Sir Keir Starmer</strong> confimed that Labour was not explicitly demanding a vote in its motion because it wanted to maximise the chances of MPs voting for it tonight. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/12/pmqs-may-corbyn-brexit-debate-claims-real-victory-after-may-offers-brexit-debate-concession-politics-live?page=with:block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910#block-57fe2e99e4b03b22b4fb2910\">1.37pm.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Davis has played down suggestions that the government will publish a white paper or a green paper on Brexit. </strong>When it was put to him that a fellow minister, George Eustice, said a Brexit white paper was likely to be published, Davis dismissed the idea. Later he seemed to hint that one could be published.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I should also tell the House ... I have asked the chief whip to ensure we have a series of debates so that the House can air its views. And it would be again very surprising if we had those debates without presenting to the House something for them to debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a source in the department for Brexit said that Davis was not intending to suggest that policy papers would be published before the debates. Davis was just referring to the fact that ministers would keep MPs updated, the source said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative former minister has accused the government of pursuing a Brexit policy driven by ideology, not national interest.</strong> In a question to Davis <strong>Claire Perry, </strong>the former transport minister, said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am extremely concerned by what has happened to sterling and what has happened to interest rates since the prime minister\u2019s comments at the conference last week. And I think the problem [David Davis] is not acknowledging is that many people in the country do not think that there is a policy to put the national interest first. They think there is a policy to put people\u2019s narrow ideological interests first. And what we should be setting out is quite clearly how we are going to protect British jobs and businesses and put ideology in the past where it belongs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis rejected this claim.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, has withdrawn a claim he made on Monday that Starmer is a second-rate lawyer.</strong> He said he was being \u201cclumsy\u201d and that his comment was not intended to apply to Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can I unreservedly withdraw allegations that I made on Monday, only on the basis that it was clumsy, it was not meant about you, it was meant about advice. I don\u2019t doubt for one moment your capabilities as a lawyer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer said he considered the matter closed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m grateful for that and I can assure you and the House that I wasn\u2019t in the slightest bit concerned. I consider the matter closed.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis refused to confirm that powers over fishing and agriculture currently exercised by Brussels would currently devolve to the Scottish parliament. </strong>These were matters that would have to be discussed with Edinburgh, he said. <strong>Alex Salmond</strong>, the former Scottish first minister, said that under current law these matters would automatically get devolved to Scotland, regardless of what Davis said, unless the devolution arrangements were changed. He told Davis:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Agriculture and fisheries are not reserved, therefore they are devolved. Unless the government intends to change that position it\u2019ll be automatic that agriculture and fisheries powers go to the Scottish government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davis replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an area where we have not addressed or talked to the devolved administration at all yet.

The very fact that Corbyn focused on Brexit was striking, because since the referendum (and for some time before) he has generally avoided the topic. But, as usual, he asked strong questions but failed to follow them up. (In tennis terms, he has an adequate serve, but no return.) He also failed to press May on the one question that is really topical today; in the light of her U-turn last night on a Brexit debate, can she now commit to giving MPs a vote on a substantive motion? May responded competently, but not brilliantly, to Corbyn\u2019s questions, and interestingly she avoided some of the gratuitous Labour-bashing that has marred some of her earlier PMQs, although she did finish with a neat point about Labour getting the same answer when they ask a question for a second time.

There\u2019s a very good reason for this, because we can make a difference to what Britain does, we can make a difference to what our allies do to a certain extent and we have done. </p> <p>But, if we have a protest outside the Russian embassy it wouldn\u2019t make a blind bit of difference as to what [President Vladimir] Putin does because we are in Britain and were are in the West. </p> <p>And, not only that - a protest outside the Russian embassy would actually contribute to increasing the hysteria and the jingoism that is being whipped up at the moment against Russia.</p> <p>What we are saying is there is a hysteria which is being organised by politicians and the media against Russia to see Russia as the only problem in Syria.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir John Sawers</strong> was on the programme an hour or so later.

In it they said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you are able to provide satisfactory answers to all these questions, just one per day from tomorrow until 31 March next year, it might give some confidence that the government is entering the Article 50 negotiations with a clear plan.</p> <p>If not, it will reinforce the sense that the government is instead blundering into this process without a clear endgame in mind, repeating exactly the same mistake that the previous Prime Minister made with his \u2018renegotiation\u2019 of Britain\u2019s EU membership last year: working to an artificial, self-imposed timetable; with a flawed Plan A of what he wanted to achieve; and no Plan B whatsoever.</p> <p>Given you have consistently spoken up throughout your career in a highly principled way about the importance of Parliamentary sovereignty, we hope you will reflect again on the decision to deny the country\u2019s elected representatives the opportunity to debate and vote on the Government\u2019s plan for Brexit before Article 50 is triggered.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to the letter a Conservative spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are aiming to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom and return control over all the decisions that affect people\u2019s lives to the sovereign institutions of this country.</p> <p>That\u2019s what people voted for on June 23.

In reality, it it probably more a matter of establishing a temporary, tactical advantage, but an opposition is entitled to boast about its gains whenever it gets them.</p> <p>The key point is that Theresa May has compromised to avoid the risk of a Tory revolt over giving the Commons a say on Brexit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an opposition day in the Commons (meaning Labour gets the choose the motion for debate) and the party decided to get MPs to vote on whether the Commons should be consulted on the government\u2019s Brexit negotiating strategy. Here is the motion that it has tabled, which is also backed by the Lib Dems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That this House recognises that leaving the EU is the defining issue facing the UK; believes that there should be a full and transparent debate on the Government\u2019s plan for leaving the EU; and calls on the Prime Minister to ensure that this House is able properly to scrutinise that plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some Tory MPs also feel strongly that the Commons must have a say over Brexit (for reasons set out in the chamber on Monday) and, if there were a straightforward yes/no vote on whether the Commons should be consulted, Tory rebels could unite with the opposition to defeat the government. Theresa May wants to ensure the government has the final say.</p> <p>But May is not asking Tory MPs to reject the Labour motion outright (which is what normally happens when MPs debate an opposition day motion). Instead the government has tabled an amendment saying what Labour proposes is fine, so long as the government\u2019s negotiating position is maintained. The amendment reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At end add \u2018; and believes that the process should be undertaken in such a way that respects the decision of the people of the UK when they voted to leave the EU on 23 June and does not undermine the negotiating position of the government as negotiations are entered into which will take place after article 50 has been triggered.\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tory MPs will be asked to vote for this amendment, before the Commons votes on the main motions. Tory MPs who feel very strongly about parliamentary scrutiny, the \u201crebels\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">like Stephen Phillips</a>, may choose not to back the amendment, on the grounds that it is an attempt to neuter the demand for scrutiny, but that that won\u2019t look like much of a rebellion. And then the motion as a whole will get passed, probably with the amendment attached.<br></p> <p>That means effectively that May has conceded that there must be a \u201cfull and transparent debate\u201d in the Commons on the government\u2019s Brexit plan, before article 50 is invoked. <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the shadow Brexit secretary, said last night this was \u201ca real victory for \u201cparliament and will help ensure there is proper democratic grip of the Brexit process.\u201d</p> <p>But the Labour motion mentions a debate but not a vote. On the Today programme <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, said that it implied a vote. But ministers will be able to say that they have not agreed to let the Commons vote on, for example, whether remaining a member of the single market must be a priority. If Labour could get May to concede that, then that really would count as a huge victory.</p> <p>I will be covering this issue, and the debate, in full during the day.</p> <p>Here is the agenda.<br></p> <p><em>9am:</em> Justine Greening, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Fawcett Society gender pay conference.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Jeremy Corbyn, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative chairman, and Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee on women in the Commons after the 2020 election.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives a speech on HS2.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England deputy governor, gives evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit. </p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Senior police figures, including Stephen Rodhouse, deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police, give evidence to a Lords committee on Brexit.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process.</p> <p>I will be mostly focusing on Brexit today but, as usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens.</p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has said his country has \u201ca problem with Islam\u201d and that there are too many illegal migrants arriving in France.</p> <p>He also suggested that today\u2019s \u201cveiled woman\u201d could become a Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, and attacked his rival Nicolas Sarkozy as \u201cthe little De Gaulle\u201d.</p> <p>The controversial remarks are published in a 660-page book, A President Should Not Say That: Secrets of Five Years in Office.</p> <p>Hollande, 62, also spoke of the women in his life and how his actor girlfriend, Julie Gayet, wanted to be de facto first lady of France, which he said was a \u201chot topic\u201d between them. He admitted he is feeling lonely and betrayed in the Elys\u00e9e Palace, where he sometimes feels like a \u201cghost\u201d.</p> <p>The French leader, whose desperately low popularity ratings make it uncertain as to whether he will stand for a second term in office, made the comments during more than 60 interviews with Le Monde journalists G\u00e9rard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme. </p> <p>The subjects covered range from Hollande\u2019s dismay over the national football team and the new generation of players (\u201cthey\u2019ve gone from badly educated kids to ultra-rich stars with no preparation\u201d) to his 2012 presidential rival Sarkozy, whom he described as \u201ca Duracell bunny who is perpetually agitated\u201d and full of \u201cvulgarity and cynicism\u201d.</p> <p>But Hollande confided that he would not hesitate to vote for Sarkozy if it was a choice between his predecessor and Marine Le Pen, the leadeer of the far-right Front National.</p> <p>It was his comments on Islam that could prove the most controversial.</p> <p>The book quotes Hollande saying: \u201cIt\u2019s true there is a problem with Islam \u2026 and nobody doubts that. There\u2019s a problem with Islam because Islam demands places (of worship), recognition. It\u2019s not that Islam is a problem because it\u2019s a religion that is in itself dangerous but because it wants to assert itself as a religion on the Republic. What might also be a problem is if Muslims don\u2019t criticise acts of radicalisation, if imams behave in an anti-republican way.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe veiled woman of today will be the Marianne of tomorrow \u2026 because, in a certain way, if we offer her the right conditions to blossom she will liberate herself from her veil and become a French woman, while remaining a believer if she wishes, capable of carrying with her an ideal ... Ultimately, what are we betting on? That she will prefer freedom to subservience. Perhaps the veil is a kind of protection for her, but that tomorrow she will not need it in order to be reassured of her presence in society.\u201d</p> <p>Critics said the French president was \u2013 perhaps inadvertently \u2013 suggesting women in France who chose to wear veils were not French and preferred to be subservient.</p> <p>On immigration, Hollande told the authors: \u201cI think there are too many arrivals, immigrants who shouldn\u2019t be there \u2026 we teach them to speak French and then another group arrives and we have to start all over again. It never stops \u2026 so, at some point it has to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Laurent Wauquiez, president of the opposition centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains, accused Hollande of being \u201cwilling to barter the symbol of the French republic for political Islam\u201d. He said Hollande was \u201cselling off the most powerful symbols of the French republic on the cheap\u201d.</p> <p>On French footballers, Hollande allegedly called some of them \u201cguys from housing estates without bearings, without any values, who left France too early \u2026 they need weight training on their brains\u201d.</p> <p>He said he did not want to officialise his relationship with Gayet, 44, who he described as \u201ca fine girl\u201d and admitted she was \u201csuffering from this situation\u201d.</p> <p>The president\u2019s relationship with Gayet led to the break up with Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, a Paris Match journalist, for whom he left Socialist government minister S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, mother of his four children. Hollande said Trierweiler had an \u201cobsession\u201d with Royal, but he admitted: \u201cThe woman I am closest to is S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne \u2026 she is there when I need her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat weighs heavily on me is not having a family life. I liked family life a lot \u2026 at the Elys\u00e9e you cannot have a private life. There is no time to be happy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In a fitting turn of events, the outcome of the 2016 election may now rest with a reality television mogul. Mark Burnett, British-born, is one of the most recognizable names in the business, having created both Shark Tank and the genre-defining Survivor. He\u2019s also the mastermind behind The Apprentice, the NBC show where contestants vie for Donald Trump\u2019s approval.</p> <p>According to a former Apprentice producer, \u201cthere are far worse\u201d <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/ex-apprentice-producer-far-worse-trump-tapes-exist.html\">outtakes</a> from the show than the damning 2005 Access Hollywood clip that surfaced last week, in which Trump brags to host Billy Bush about kissing women and grabbing them \u201cby the pussy\u201d sans consent. In other words, assault.</p> <p>Of course, strict legal red tape binds Burnett\u2019s ability to simply release the footage, including a rumored $5m fine. A statement from his production company \u2013 owned by MGM \u2013 also cast doubt on whether Burnett himself has physical access to the clips, claiming he \u201cdoes not have the ability nor the right to release footage or other material from The Apprentice\u201d. In what might be the worst possible scenario, the tapes could belong to Trump himself.</p> <p>If Burnett legitimately has no access to the tapes, then he can\u2019t be held responsible for not publicizing them. But if they are indeed bad for Trump, and if there\u2019s any way at all for him to get them out to the press, it is \u2013 as civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred and many others have <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/12/donald-trump-apprentice-gloria-allred/\">argued</a> \u2013 \u201cin the public interest\u201d to do so.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s holding Burnett back, insiders explain, is nothing more than the keen business acumen, airtight contractual arrangements and salesmanship that have propelled him to the top of his profession,\u201d Politico reports. Mind, Burnett is worth $450m, a fortune built in no small part off of Trump\u2019s celebrity. For a man that has made millions off of the GOP candidate\u2019s rise to prominence, handing the tapes over the public is quite literally the least he could do. Neglecting that responsibility would display the same kind of selfish thinking that plagues Trump and the rest of the 1%: ranking personal success above collective ruin.</p> <p>White British immigrants like Burnett, of course, will be some of the best off should Trump come to power. He\u2019s threatened to round up and deport some 11 million undocumented immigrants, and called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on\u201d. What started as a joke could be a painful reality for millions, ripping families apart and criminalizing whole swaths of the population, people of color in particular. If he wants a preview for what these policies might look like in action, he needs only look towards home. Conservative prime minister Theresa May and her cabinet have <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151334637685/rudd-speech-to-conservative-party-conference-2016\">promised</a> to reduce migration by \u201ctens of thousands\u201d in Britain, punishing those who provide housing and banking services to undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>Depending on what happens on 8 November, May might find herself with an ally across the Atlantic. Though the Access Hollywood clips have put a bigger dent in Trump\u2019s chances than any scandal yet, his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trump-getting-thumped-in-post-tape-gate-polls.html\">nine point lag</a> could still shrink before election day.</p> <p>If Trump does win, he\u2019ll have Burnett to thank. NBC public relations head Jim Dowd <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/08/donald-trump-the-apprentice-burnett/\">called</a> The Apprentice and its ratings success \u201cthe bridge to the campaign,\u201d winning Trump an audience in middle America that the real estate mogul had never before reached. Before the show, Trump admits in his 2011 book Time to Get Tough, most people \u201cthought I was a barbarian\u201d.</p> <p>Reality television molded Trump into the ratings and polls-obsessed performer that we know today, and created a new generation of Americans ready to be entertained by him. The GOP \u2013 with its decades-running vendetta against women of people of color \u2013 allowed him to step right into the party\u2019s candidacy, swapping over 40 years of dog-whistle politics for an attack hound bent on going after those already on the losing end of Republican policies.</p> <p>Burnett helped create Donald Trump \u2013 the man, the myth and the legend, all neatly wrapped into one leathery package. It\u2019s only right that he chips in to help bring him down.</p>",

But we are now heading inexorably towards a hard Brexit, since the government has made immigration control of our borders its top priority, which is incompatible with staying in the single market or the customs union.</p> <p>When this realisation sinks in \u2013 the decline in the value of the pound shows it is already happening \u2013 domestic and foreign investment will decline, a flood of companies will emigrate, London will probably cease to be the financial centre of the EU and we are likely to face a severe, self-inflicted Brexit recession. In time that is likely to cause a major change in public opinion, as many voters for leave will feel they were conned. This change will fully justify a rerun of the referendum, after the conclusion of the negotiations, before our departure becomes inevitable.</p> <p>It is widely assumed that once we trigger article 50 and announce our intention to leave, this sets in motion an irreversible process. However, this assumption does not appear to be legally correct. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9fc30c8-6edb-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926\" title=\"\">an article for the Financial Times</a>, Jean-Claude Piris, former director general of the legal service of the Council of the European Union, has pointed out that invoking article 50 and declaring \u201can intention\u201d to leave is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9fc30c8-6edb-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926\" title=\"\">\u201cunilateral act that does not depend on what other members think or do\u201d</a> and that \u201cIn law, the word \u2018intention\u2019 cannot be interpreted as a final and irreversible decision\u201d. Nothing in article 50, he wrote, would prevent the UK, in conformity with its constitutional requirements, from withdrawing its unilaterally declared \u201cintention\u201d.</p> <p>Those who voted remain are therefore perfectly entitled, legally and democratically, to do everything possible to avoid a disastrous future for this country. Indeed some of us regard this as our duty.<br><br><strong>Dick Taverne</strong><br><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 One of the most worrying aspects of the Brexit debate is theconstant attempts by the Brexiteers to deny the legitimacy of debate following the referendum: \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d is their sole refrain whenever a contrary voice is heard. Yet scrutiny, challenge and debate are not optional extras in a democracy, they are the very essence. It is beyond ironic that those who argued so vehemently for parliamentary sovereignty should resort to the royal prerogative and so deny the very democracy they claim to have fought for. <br><strong>Roy Boffy</strong><br><em>Sutton Coldfield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Just suppose that the referendum had produced exactly the opposite result, with just over half of those who voted choosing to stay in the EU. Would the government have been entitled to go for hard remain and join the euro and sign up for the Schengen agreement? And, if so, would the leavers have accepted that the British people had made their decision and there was nothing more to be said?<br><strong>Kath Aspinwall</strong><br><em>Hathersage, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The prime minister (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet\" title=\"\">May quick to reject cross-party calls for Commons vote on the single market</a>, 10 October) believes that the government can proceed with Brexit under the royal prerogative without the authority of parliament. Brexit will inevitably involve the repeal of the European Communities Act. Only parliament can repeal an act of parliament. Any other view would be a constitutional nonsense.</p> <p>The prime minister might do well to recall that over 300 years ago we fought a civil war on the issue of parliamentary sovereignty, and at least one monarch lost his head as a consequence.<br><br><strong>Derek Gambell</strong><br><br><em>Bromley, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your coverage of Theresa May\u2019s conference speech (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\" title=\"\">\u2018Change must come\u2019: May consigns Cameron to history</a>, 6 October) omitted one of the most intriguing remarks that she made: that \u201cit is time to reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian right\u201d.</p> <p>The libertarian right, unlike the socialist left, is strongly entrenched within Mrs May\u2019s own party. Its disciples include Liam Fox and David Davis, as well as Nigel Lawson, who tells us that Brexit offers the chance to complete his interpretation of the Thatcher revolution, by shrinking taxation, regulation and the state as a whole.

Of course, she may back down before their passionate pressure; but if so, the social and industrial agenda that she has just set out will be a shell.

  "<p>A brief rally in the pound was quickly reversed on Wednesday after the government refused to make tariff-free access to the European Union\u2019s single market a red line in Brexit negotiations with Brussels.</p> <p>Investors sold the pound after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/brexit-mps-david-davis-eu-exit-plan\">Brexit minister David Davis told MPs it was \u201cnot black or white\u201d</a> whether the UK would stay in the single market.</p> <p>Sterling fell two cents to $1.21 on the currency markets in afternoon trading, reversing a jump to $1.23 overnight that followed Theresa May\u2019s concession for parliament to hold a debate on the government\u2019s stance on talks with the EU.<br></p> <p>The U-turn in agreeing to a debate initially lifted markets, but the refusal of ministers to clarify the government\u2019s position provoked a swift reversal in sentiment and the pound ended the day at $1.22.</p> <p>The pound has tumbled since last week when in her party conference speech May appeared to put taking control over immigration above retaining access to the single market on the current tariff-free terms. </p> <p>According to Bank of England figures, which compare the pound to a basket of major currencies, the UK\u2019s currency has fallen to its lowest level since the 1970s, when records began. </p> <p>The figures show that the value of sterling has fallen to below the levels seen in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and the slump in the pound in 1992 that followed \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d and the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/british-shoppers-told-to-expect-price-rises-after-steep-fall-in-pound\">Business leaders warned that without a rapid recovery in the pound\u2019s value</a>, the cost of imported goods in the shops would begin to rise, hitting household disposable incomes.</p> <p>Justin King said that supermarkets, already suffering from a prolonged price war, would be unable to absorb the recent rise in the cost of importing goods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/british-shoppers-told-to-expect-price-rises-after-steep-fall-in-pound\">forcing them to push up prices on the shelves</a>.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\">row between Tesco and Unilever</a> gave a foretaste of the likely disputes between suppliers and retailers after reports that the Dove soap manufacturer attempted to push through an across the board 10% rise in the price of its branded goods, which was resisted by the supermarket chain. <br></p> <p>Mike Rake, the chairman of BT, said imported mobile phones and broadband home hubs were already 10% more expensive and the cost would need to be passed on to consumers in the near future.</p> <p>Jordan Rochester, a Nomura analyst, said the pound was likely to continue its decline over the coming weeks. </p> <p>\u201cWhile Theresa May\u2019s acceptance that parliament should scrutinise her plan for Brexit in part provides for some form of a pre-article 50 \u2018checks and balances\u2019 procedure, it is unlikely to result in a detailed plan being revealed nor change the current government stance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at the financial trading firm City Index, said: \u201cEvery time Davis opens his mouth the pound falls because he is such a hard Brexiteer. But ultimately it will be May and Philip Hammond that make the decisions and investors were trying to work out which way they are going to go.\u201d<br></p> <p>She said a rise in prices could spook backbench Tory MPs who want to break free from the EU to cut tariffs and lower prices in the shops.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be that the Bank of England starts to raise rates to calm inflation, making the situation for low income families even worse,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Analysts said the US election was also influencing the situation after polls showing Donald Trump slipping in the race strengthened the dollar.<strong> </strong>Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the US presidential race is also seen as a green light to the US central bank to raise interest rates in December or early next year.</p>",
  "<p>Details of individual children on the national pupil database in England and Wales were passed to the Home Office for immigration purposes 18 times in four years, the Department for Education has disclosed.</p> <p>The revelation was made in a freedom of information response and comes as the Department for Education is trying to reassure parents in England and Wales that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/08/boycottschoolcensus-why-parents-are-refusing-to-reveal-their-childs-nationality\">new school census questions</a> asking them to list their children\u2019s nationality and country of birth, sent out in the last few weeks, will not be passed to immigration enforcement teams.</p> <p>The individual details of children\u2019s schools and home addresses were supplied in response to requests from the Home Office\u2019s absconder tracing team looking for parents who had disappeared after being told they faced deportation or trying to find unaccompanied child asylum seekers who have gone missing.</p> <p>Peers and campaigners on Wednesday claimed the FoI disclosure showed the questions on nationality and country of birth gave the wrong impression and should be removed from the national pupil census.<br></p> <p>But the DfE insisted that, while the Home Office has been given access on a limited number of occasions in the past to individual details on the national pupil database to find missing child asylum seekers or those who abuse immigration control, a fresh agreement means they will not pass over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\">new details on a pupil\u2019s nationality or place of birth</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time we are gathering data on pupil\u2019s country of birth, nationality and English proficiency as part of National School Census.

  "<p>The territory is marked out in red and blue <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">on two maps by statistician Nate Silver</a>. One map of the US showing what would happen if only women voted, the other if only \u201cdudes\u201d did. The lady vote would have Hillary Clinton ahead in typically safe Republican states such as Alaska, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. She would get&#xa0;458 electoral votes, compared with Donald Trump\u2019s 80.</p> <p>The dude-only map, though, shows that Trump could win every swing state with Clinton just about clinging on to the west coast, parts of the north-east, Illinois and New Mexico. Trump would get 350 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 188.</p> <p>Thankfully, this is not a dude-only election. It is not even a Democrat v Republican election. It is an insurgency by a man (and a movement) who, in promising to reinstate America\u2019s supposedly lost greatness, will destroy the GOP establishment. They deserve it. The sudden abhorrence at Trump\u2019s description of sexual assault as banter is ludicrous. Have they ignored everything he said on women, Mexicans, Muslims and black people? The cowardice of the Republican party meant they would not challenge him for fear of damaging their own prospects. They could not care less if the collateral damage is to poor women or black communities.</p> <p>For Trump has been a long time coming: he is the embodiment of the backlash against feminism that many of us recognised in the early 90s.</p> <p>We need to understand how culture and gender intersect with the economy. Votes for Trump might not be deliberately made in the name of a gender war, but that is exactly the battle being fought. Feminism is seen as both triumphant and pass\u00e9. Both views deem it as unnecessary. This backlash has been drip fed into popular culture.</p> <p>Its radicalism was stripped away in the mid-90s by the whole Sex and the City vibe. We could have sex and shoes, if we were white and rich. Lads could be sexist pigs again. Porn became ubiquitous and post-feminists embraced it. Women no longer needed feminism, because they needed men for babies and to open jars. For this they had to be appealing before they were 30 and their eggs shrivelled up. Dating became a desperate game and men preferred women who were free. Just not too free. Men wrote books about how to get women into bed that were akin to rape manuals. But worse was to come: men started embracing their manhood, rejecting \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d or political correctness. By&#xa0;the mid-to-late 2000s, this pushback against the gains of feminism was&#xa0;in full flow.</p> <p>This was implicitly tied to recession. This&#xa0;is something that the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage understand. The right always does. The left, with its eye on class struggle, continues to miss how things play out in terms of gender. The misogyny of a Trump, or his pet tic Farage, does not exist in an economic vacuum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/1/28/7929939/net-worth-decline\" title=\"\">net worth of the bottom 60% of US households is about 14% lower than it was 30 years ago</a>.

The number of single-parent families has risen rapidly. Michelle Alexander, a&#xa0;law professor, says there are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/michelle-alexander-more-black-men-in-prison-slaves-1850_n_1007368.html\" title=\"\">more black men in prison than there were slaves in 1850</a>.</p> <p>So the US and its men are in pain. So much so&#xa0;that a <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/04/news/economy/america-left-behind-white-men/\" title=\"\">quarter of white blue-collar workers are&#xa0;unemployed.</a> Many are on prescription painkillers, opiates such as OxyContin. Where there is pain, there is anger. And anger kicks downwards. On to women.</p> <p>This sense of abandonment felt by blue-collar workers feeds the backlash. Britain is a very different country, but the same sense of neglect is&#xa0;there in former industrial areas.</p> <p>I remember interviewing miners who \u201cretired undefeated\u201d, as they said, and would not take the new jobs on offer to them. Their women folk did. This inflexibility, combined with real inequality, feeds exactly into a backlash against women and&#xa0;\u201cimmigrants\u201d. The fragility of the masculine identity produces this hopeless nostalgia for defined gender roles. Look around. Have women \u2013 of every ethnicity \u2013 ever had to look so uniform? Long straight hair, pouty lips, big breasts? That\u2019s just the surface; the substance remains lack of equal pay, sexual violence, attacks on abortion rights, and online abuse. As Susan Faludi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash:_The_Undeclared_War_Against_American_Women\" title=\"\">wrote way back in 1991</a> the backlash is not coherent, it&#xa0;is&#xa0;more of a countercurrent, an undertow. But it&#xa0;will drag us down</p> <p>In yoking economic insecurity to the culture war, Trump and his cohorts threaten liberal certainty. His voters may know that his misogyny is a small price to pay for the change he offers; it may, indeed, be a bonus. The running down of the welfare state, after all, has been a war on women. The war on drugs has been a war on women with more and more women in prison. The overt coupling of patriarchy with race privilege and a militarised police force is visible enough proof to&#xa0;make Trump\u2019s assertion that the American Dream is over feel true.</p> <p>So how come women are rejecting his vision and men are not? What is in it for them? \u201cWhen power is scarce, a little of it is tempting,\u201d wrote Margaret Atwood in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\" title=\"\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>. A little power. Trump cannot win without women. The fact he thinks that he can reveals his heart of darkness. It still beats strong.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Carlos Lange \u2013 known as <a href=\"https://heladonegro.bandcamp.com/\">Helado Negro</a> \u2013 is an Ecuadorian American artist with an unprecedented sound. His music is a soothing, dreamlike collage of live and unorthodox instruments, and the 36-year-old musician uses his voice in so many absorbing ways, it almost feels as if you\u2019re not listening to a person. \u201cI like to utilize my voice as a new instrument,\u201d says Lange, who is based in Brooklyn. \u201cAnd when you hear songs in Spanish, for example, there are so many beautiful, flowery and exaggerated words that you can really mess with and they end up sounding like something else.\u201d </p> <p>Having grown up in south Florida as a first generation American with Ecuadorian parents, Lange makes music deeply connected to his roots and bicultural identity. In 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSykDP_zZx8\">Young, Latin and Proud</a>, he <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/13/177126294/five-reasons-why-people-code-switch\">code-switches</a> between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/03/nacion-espn-pitches-for-sports-loving-code-switching-latino-youth\">English and Spanish</a>, calling for unity among America\u2019s Latino community through understanding who we are and appreciating those who came before us.<br></p> <p>\u201cTu abuela [your grandmother] es young, Latin and proud, tus padres [your parents] son young, Latin and proud,\u201d he sings on the record. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll be old, Latin and proud.\u201d Pitchfork, the online music magazine, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/830-helado-negro-is-young-latin-and-proud/\">poignantly described the message</a> as a dream of a colorfully varied, empowered group of people, walking confidently toward the sunset. <br></p> <p>\u2018For us [US Latinos], especially in south Florida, growing up between English and Spanish is so common,\u201d he tells me, \u201cand in a way it kind of sustains the cadence and rhythm of life, so my process ends up being a larger part of that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSykDP_zZx8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TSykDP_zZx8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The song is featured on Helado Negro\u2019s fifth studio album, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22445-private-energy/\">Private Energy</a>, an internal, atmospheric journey of self-discovery in which he explores the meaning of his own place in society and celebrates his Latino roots. His single, It\u2019s My Brown Skin, proudly celebrates what it means to be brown, confronting issues of marginalization and the anti-immigrant views that regularly circulate in our newsfeed thanks to the rhetoric of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels good to be brown,\u201d Lange <a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/2016/09/helado-negros-new-song-its-my-brown-skin/\">told Vibe</a> in September. \u201cAnd I want all the other people who live in the US who might fear that their brown skin brings them trouble to use this as a meditation or a mantra.\u201d It works: thanks to the record\u2019s summery soundscape, when you listen to it, you can\u2019t help but smile. It\u2019s essentially a love song to himself and his race.<br></p> <p>Above all, however, Helado Negro (which means black ice cream) is an experimental musician, and more than willing to take his studio experimentations onstage. As he travels across America on his <a href=\"http://www.bandsintown.com/heladonegro\">biggest US tour to date</a>, he is backed by the Tinsel Mammals, performers covered head to toe in tinsel foil who interpret his music through dance.</p> <p>Lange created the concept and costumes with the help of the <a href=\"http://art.kristisword.com/about/\">visual artist</a> Kristi Sword, his wife. The Tinsel Mammals are not touring performers but volunteers selected by Lange in each city. \u201cThe beautiful thing about the people who volunteer is that they are people who always wanted to do performance art or wanted to be onstage, but were too afraid to do so,\u201d says Lange. \u201cSo the costumes, in a way, offer anonymity and safety.\u201d </p> <p>Lange says these performers represent the audience\u2019s insecurities, and by watching them, we can feel more comfortable in our own skins. \u201cIn one way or another we are all insecure \u2013 \u2018I feel fat\u2019 or \u2018this shirt doesn\u2019t fit me\u2019 \u2013 so these performers wash that all away, and they don\u2019t think about any of that. They\u2019re all safe, able to express themselves and have a private energy, to be able to put it out there delicately and not have to always guard it.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than overtly seeking to grab headlines, Private Energy explores self-discovery and growth. Helado Negro says he is not interested in trends but rather how music can help us evolve. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make anything \u2013 whether it\u2019s art, music or anything visual \u2013 that I can grow old with,\u201d Lange says. \u201cSomething that is continually a part of me and not just create something to try and stay relevant.\u201d<br></p> <p>As we end the interview, Lange gives me a gift: a cassette copy of Private Energy. As I thank him and hold it in my hand, I am immediately reminded of my own childhood and how much I loved making mixtapes. His gesture brings back so many memories, taking me back to a simpler time. And that\u2019s the impact of Helado Negro: his music helps you reflect on the simplicity and beauty of your own place in the world. <br></p>",
  "<p>In the distance, Aleppo briefly emerged from the smoke and dust of war, a low grey skyline on a brown summer plain. A heat haze shimmered over the road ahead, shrouding first an abandoned army barracks, then ransacked, smouldering factories, an empty crossroads, and finally, the city itself.</p> <p>Even then, days after the eastern half of the city had been seized by armed Syrians opposed to the rule of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a>, many of Aleppo\u2019s people had fled.

It was my first visit to the city, after several earlier trips to nearby towns where the rebel push for northern Syria had been gathering steam. It paved the way for the Guardian\u2019s subsequent reporting on a conflict with no apparent end.</p> <p>In more than 10 journeys to Aleppo, from that first visit in 2012 until my last in December 2014, I have chronicled the decline of one of the world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited cities as it has been ground down by savagery. Modern warfare has done what uprising and invasion have failed to do throughout the ages, transforming half the city into a shell of its prewar self, and imperilling an ancient core that has weathered centuries of conflict and even a devastating earthquake.</p> <p>Along the way, those who remained and fought for its destiny offered windows into a war that has ramifications far beyond the borders of Syria. Long a crossroads of trade and transport, and a hub of empire, Aleppo is again central to the fate of the region, even under the assault of Russian bombers, which have made much of the east uninhabitable over the past year.</p> <p>The rebel-held east was the focus of all my visits; west Aleppo has remained off-limits, functioning with little disruption and firmly under the control of the Syrian regime, which refuses visa requests.</p> <h2><strong>The lethal frontline</strong></h2> <p>On that first trip to the divided city, we moved slowly past makeshift roadblocks to enter an area that had felt foreboding since the popular uprising against Assad transformed into armed insurrection.

Families had fled the area hours before. Syrian troops and rebels had gouged holes in the walls of narrow-packed homes to use as rat-runs. As we stepped through the remains, cooking pots \u2013 some full of food \u2013 sat on stove tops and laundry hung on rails. There was something disconcerting about treading through the intimate worlds of strangers who, a little while earlier, had been going about their lives.</p> <p>Now these people were on the road to Turkey, joining tens of thousands of others whose lives had been upended. At a nearby intersection, not far from where the two sides faced off, strangers \u2013 non-Syrians \u2013 were instead arriving. Dressed in dishdashas and head shawls, some with leather ammunition belts strapped across their chests, a small number of Islamic fighters had come to join what to them was a holy war.</p> <p>The new arrivals were the vanguard of the jihadists, who, since May 2012, had started to travel to Syria and assemble in the countryside. They had turned up promising support to willing though underprepared rebel groups who could take the fight to the Assad regime, but faced a serious challenge in defeating it. The newcomers stood warily next to the rebel groups, several mocking the attempts of a band from a nearby town as they tried to shoot a hovering Syrian helicopter out of the sky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8773b7f115a7e1a4a7ffeb20f08066d9b0768e2/0_80_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wounded rebel fighter is carried to safety, October 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Baillie/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou donkey!\u201d one of the jihadists screamed. \u201cGive the dushka [heavy weapon] to me.

Throughout the remainder of 2012, they were reinforced daily by others who had also journeyed across the porous Turkish border and had begun to change the tone of the war from nationalistic uprising into an ideological conflict that paid no heed to borders.</p> <p>The jihadists and the regular opposition were barely co-existing. \u201cWe have to accept them because they are coming to help us Islamically,\u201d said Sobhi Mohammed, a fighter from an Islamic unit at the time. \u201cBut we know they don\u2019t want what we want.\u201d Sobhi was based with his unit, all blue-collar workers from the satellite town of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/turkey-syria-offensive-each-party-is-fighting-its-own-war-kurds-us-isis\">al-Bab</a>, in the villa of a Syrian officer. With tank fire shuddering in the distance, the men tried to teach themselves to swim in a pea-soup coloured pool fenced by ceramic mermaids.</p> <p>Later that year, Sobhi was killed in a battle nearby. As the ranks of the jihadists grew, the rebels slowly thinned. So too did the few remaining residents of east Aleppo. Scud missiles started to rain down on the city in late 2012, gouging giant craters where whole neighbourhoods once stood. By early the following year, entire suburbs directly east of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/24/syria-war-citadel-aleppo-history-cities-buildings\">Aleppo\u2019s historic citadel </a>lay deserted. Airstrikes were happening almost daily. Sniper fire regularly crossed a lethal frontline between east and west. And the regime\u2019s vengeance towards those in the east was about to be showcased in other ways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/611e8bb9025a78da3e935e24747f047b3708d9b7/0_214_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the bodies of the executed men dumped in the river, January 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdullah al-Yassin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Massacre by the river</strong></h2> <p>In mid February 2013, I returned to Aleppo to investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/mar/11/syria-bodies-river-aleppo-massacre\">the discovery of more than 100 bodies on a river bank</a>. All had been shot in the head, and dumped in the river. As flood waters had receded, they had exposed the fate of the men, who had all been detained as they crossed the frontline. Many had commuted between the two sides for work. Others needed to travel to the west for official business \u2013 there were no longer government offices in the east. For more than a week, locals fished the bodies out of the river, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/29/syrian-rebels-bodies-aleppo-canal\">erecting nets and grills to trap them as they washed down</a>. Families in the eastern area of Bustan al-Qasr all confirmed that their husbands, fathers, sons and cousins had disappeared at checkpoints. Most had been held in regime prisons.</p> <p>Even darker days were soon to follow. In April that year, the jihadists who had lurked with intent announced that they were now in charge, subverting the myriad opposition groups \u2013 and their cause \u2013 in the name of a global jihad. The Islamic State (Isis) had unveiled itself after a year long Trojan horse act of hiding in plain sight. A ruthless elimination of rival power bases followed, along with the imposition of an unflinching Islamic order. The front of the eye hospital, the rebel base at the start of the war, was painted black. The standards of the jihadists were planted everywhere. Streets were even emptier, women rarely seen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 100 men had been shot in the head and dumped in the river, the flood waters receding to expose their fate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the rest of 2013, east Aleppo was one of the most dangerous places on earth. In September, I visited again, this time under the escort of a member of a rebel group from al-Bab that was convinced it could ward off Isis. The east had been whittled down even further. Civic services had all but stopped. Local volunteers gathered rubbish and burned it on an enormous noxious heap near the south of the town. Medical aid was scarce, but still the hospital system was getting by.</p> <p>Outside one hospital, down the hill from Saif al-Dawla, a clapped-out ambulance sat at an odd angle on a footpath matted with blood and a filthy pile of white burial shrouds. Above them, on a small ledge, lay a dead infant girl, wrapped in a pink towel and left anonymously. She stayed there for most of the day, exhausted medics dealing with the rush of the dying before they tended to her.</p> <p>Outside the eye hospital, a lone Isis fighter sat on the back of a pickup truck with a heavy machine gun pointed at the sky. The jihadists were expecting US jets at the time. None arrived, but Syrian helicopters soon did, dropping improvised explosives packed into barrels over what remained of the eastern suburbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb4be1c39939203a65977b47ba4f127780918aa/0_260_5330_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child wounded in a Russian airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A deserted wasteland</strong></h2> <p>By early the following year, Aleppo had devolved even further. In January, rebel groups who had been sidelined by Isis for the previous nine months, turned their guns on the extremists, ousting them first from the city and then from the countryside. Isis retreated to al-Bab, which has since remained its most western position in Syria. The city, or what remained of it, was once again accessible, but this time under the noses of regime troops who had all but encircled the east.</p> <p>A small gap, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/syrian-regime-is-blocking-aid-from-entering-eastern-aleppo-claims-un\">Castello Road</a>, remained open to the north. It led to an industrial zone that used to be a central driver of Syria\u2019s economy, but is now a wasteland of fallen silos and factories that have been repeatedly crunched with heavy bombs. The road was one of the most menacing strips in Syria. And once through it, the devastation of east Aleppo was almost overwhelming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/future-wars-horrific-aleppo-war-zones-medical-facilities-un\">If we don't act now, all future wars may be as horrific as Aleppo  | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Near the city\u2019s outskirts, no one remained, except for small groups of rebels with radios who kept tabs on pro-regime militia forces gathering beyond the city limits. Three hospitals that had been functioning on our last visit had been destroyed by airstrikes. Much of the northern city had been emptied. Long sweeping boulevards that channelled commuter traffic were silent and sinister.</p> <p>The Old City, however, had remained a sanctuary. Here, market life went on. Butchers hung carcasses just out of reach of starving cats, and Turkish confectionery was piled alongside traditional Syrian sweet stalls. The cobblestoned roads were almost a safe zone for fighters and the remaining residents of east Aleppo. Here they could congregate as they always had, ignoring jets that mostly dropped their bombs elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4142796da2173d249bc142fd01a66d9d21e2304/0_127_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man sits in the rubble of a damaged buildings after losing relatives in an airstrike, October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdalrhman Ismail/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The illusion lasted only half a mile though, where it ended in the enormous pile of rubble that marked a frontline. Here, Abu Assad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/aleppos-most-wanted-man-rebel-leader-tunnel-bombs\">one of the original rebels of the countryside</a>, had led a team of tunnel diggers, who had burrowed under regime lines and blown up a hotel on the edge of the Citadel. Nothing was left of the building, and the enormous blast had damaged the wall of the Citadel itself. The war that was supposed to spare Aleppo\u2019s ancient core had crept closer than ever.</p> <h2><strong>Jets prowl the sky</strong></h2> <p>In December 2014, I returned to the city for the last time. Finding residents in the east was difficult. Those who had stayed this long had no plans to leave. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-female-medic-aleppo-syria-war-umm-abdu\">Umm Abdu, a wedding dress seamstress turned nurse was one of them.</a> She made her way from the Old City to a nearby hospital, a pistol strapped to her waist as she patched up fighters and civilians. She had lost a husband and a son in the relentless war. Everyone she knew had at least one tragic story. East Aleppo had no electricity and little running water. This time the road out of the city took us along muddy tracks gouged through farmland. A sand berm sheltered the road from sniper fire, and jets prowled the sky.</p> <p>It has been all but impossible to reach east Aleppo in the year and a half since, a time in which the divided city\u2019s agony has grown even worse. The Russian blitz has relentlessly targeted what remains of its basic services. Only two hospitals and two smaller clinics are still functioning and only 11 ambulances still service them. Umm Abdu has left Aleppo, and few of the others I met along the way have stayed behind. The Russian-led assault has demolished the east, and pro-regime militias are poised to move in. After 3,000 years, Aleppo is on its knees.</p>",

In the recording Trump discusses with the TV host Billy Bush a failed attempt to sleep with a married woman, before talking more generally about women.</p> <p><strong> </strong>\u201cI am automatically attracted to beautiful women,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss, I don\u2019t even wait \u2026 and when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in Missouri before Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, Farage said of the comments: \u201cLook, this is alpha male boasting. It\u2019s the kind of thing, if we are being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, quite a lot of women say things amongst themselves that they would not want to see on Fox News or the front page of a newspaper.

She added: \u201cThere is never an excuse for sexual assault and way too many women already suffer in silence from fear of having to face these entrenched attitudes that this type of behaviour is OK.\u201d</p> <p>Farage, who resumed the Ukip leadership temporarily after his replacement, Diane James, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\">resigned after 18 days in the role</a>, remains credited by most senior party figures as having been central to its success.</p> <p>But several have said privately that they fear his love of the spotlight and his association with Trump are now damaging the party.</p>",

Take, for example, the show\u2019s titular song, Let\u2019s Go Backwards Together. Its satirical point (\u201cno more progress!\u201d) is potent, but gets eclipsed in the leaden singalong that ensues \u2013 before we segue into a chorus of Rule Britannia, played out in a swirl of red, white and blue in the venue where union flags wave at the Last Night of the Proms.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s very odd, and generates mainly confusion about where the pub landlord (as opposed to Murray) stands on Brexit. I should add that this song, like the one about the internet in act one, is terrible \u2013 being musically and lyrically inert.

Almost half the works have been acquired by the museum in the last eight years, which the director Hartwig Fischer described as \u201ca fantastic achievement\u201d given the stature of the artists and the soaring art market prices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/oct/12/picasso-guernica-aleppo-syria\">As Aleppo burns in this age of lies, Picasso's Guernica still screams the truth about war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although some of the earliest pieces include Warhol\u2019s images of Jackie Kennedy after the assassination of her husband, and the artist\u2019s electric chair series, generally the works from the 60s have a more optimistic air.

  "<p>The over-painting of a fascia board bearing the name Shakespeare and Company, in Paris in 1941, remains a significant moment in the history of bookshops. Two weeks earlier, a German officer had walked in and tried to buy <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. The shop\u2019s creator and owner Sylvia Beach had refused to sell it to him, claiming she had only one copy and it was her own. Two weeks later he returned to inform her that all her goods were about to be confiscated and within a couple of hours every shelf had been emptied. Books, photographs and furniture had all been carried to an upstairs apartment and a house painter had obliterated the shop\u2019s title. The Anglo-American bookshop in the rue de l\u2019Od\u00e9on, which had been the rendezvous for famous writers and where early purchasers of <em>Ulysses</em>, published by Beach, sometimes found themselves being served by its author, was no more.</p> <p>There might its story have ended. But Beach lived on, and after the war ended, the GI Bill brought Americans to Paris. One of these was George Whitman. He may or may not have been related to his namesake, but he was certainly a great admirer of Walt. Having gained a degree in journalism from Boston University, this bookish vagabond hitchhiked and train-hopped across Mexico, Central America and the United States, then served in the American army during the second world war, ending up in Taunton, Massachusetts, where, briefly, he ran a small bookshop. Arriving in Paris, in the autumn of 1946, he enrolled at the Sorbonne and began swapping his GI food vouchers for other veterans\u2019 book allowances. In this way he acquired a good enough book collection to set up a lending library in his hotel room.</p> <p>Three years later, he was convinced that with his limited capital and specialist knowledge, his goal should be a significant lending library with a free reading room. But one of his regular visitors, the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/04/lawrence-ferlinghetti-interview-poets\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a> (later owner of the City Lights bookstore in San Francisco), upset his plans by telling him he had to get out of his book-cluttered hole and run a proper shop.</p> <p>A year later Whitman wrote: \u201cI live for the day when I\u2019ll have a bookstore to embellish this workaday world. I now own one of the best private libraries in the Latin Quarter and, living as I do on less than a dollar a day, I have accumulated a small capital \u2026 I\u2019ve talked with Sylvia Beach \u2026 There is a possibility that she would consent to go into business with me \u2013 although I\u2019ve been avoiding offers of partnership, it would be an honour and a privilege to work with Sylvia Beach, should she decide to reopen Shakespeare and Company.

Eventually she gave him permission to use the title of her former shop. It was a few years before he actually did so but, even before the name went up, Shakespeare and Company\u2019s second life, the subject of this new book, had effectively begun.</p> <p>It was not a normal shop, and this is not a conventional book. Rightly so, but there is some irritation in having to turn it sideways every time you want to read a caption to an illustration. It is fast and fun, historically slapdash and occasionally repetitious. The main text is regularly disrupted by poems, short memoirs and photographs, but what holds it together is the extraordinary character and behaviour of George, as Whitman is referred to throughout.</p> <p>His premises initially consisted of only three rooms, running like a series of railway carriages into an increasingly dark recess, offering a labyrinth of alcoves and cubby holes. But he soon expanded into the apartment upstairs, which made possible a reading room and a continuation of his lending library.</p> <p>His girlfriend at the time commented on the abounding energy within the shop. Whitman himself constructed the shelves and make-shift divans. A socialist entrepreneur as well as an ardent bibliophile, he not only aimed to stock his shop with the finest English language collection of books outside Britain and America, but also hosted free seminars at which visitors could learn Russian, engage in Italian conversation or discuss new topics of socio-psychological research. He had not forgotten the hospitality freely given him in the course of his early travels and encouraged those in need of a bed or a floor for the night (\u201cTumbleweeds\u201d, he called them) to sleep in the shop. \u201cI believe we\u2019re all homeless wanderers in a way,\u201d he would say.</p> <p>Generosity lay at the heart of this quixotic enterprise, in small ways and large. George made ice-cream on Sundays for homesick compatriots and baked American pies in the stove in the hall. Among the established authors who frequented the shop were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/the-durrells-new-biography-that-they-would-enjoy-corfu-tv\">Lawrence Durrell</a> and the Beat poets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/07/my-hero-allen-ginsberg-steve-silberman\">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/20/guardianobituaries.books1\">Gregory Corso</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/01/william-burroughs-junky-will-self\">William Burroughs </a>often attended the Sunday afternoon tea parties, and African-American writers sought refuge from the racism they had experienced in the States. Richard Wright did his book signings there. When Ana\u00efs Nin called Whitman \u201ca saint among books\u201d it was almost certainly the hospitality he offered the young and needy that she had in mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2cfd43b8a0561d250317d85327affe29c1809b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2cfd43b8a0561d250317d85327affe29c1809b1/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the bedrooms in the bookshop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the bedrooms in the bookshop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Numerous famous writers frequented the shop or gave readings there, and to this day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/shakespeare-and-company-bookshop-paris\">Jeanette Winterson</a>, who has written this book\u2019s preface, remains one of its \u201cTumbleweeds\u201d. At one point Whitman\u2019s eccentricity and the government\u2019s bureaucracy nearly brought the shop to a close. Certainly the absence, as late as 2002, of any form of modern technology, even a computer or telephone, caused problems.</p> <p>But a second Sylvia, namely Whitman\u2019s daughter, and her partner have stepped in and, after an inevitable degree of internecine warfare, the bookshop has been expanded on the ground and in cyberspace. It now has a cafe, occupies six floors and has also taken over two premises around the corner. George\u2019s ideals live on. He died aged 98, in his bedroom above the bookshop. \u201cI\u2019m tired of people saying they don\u2019t have time to read,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for anything else.\u201d</p> <p>These \u201cempires of the spirit\u201d, in Whitman\u2019s phrase, call for further attention in another book recently published, <em>Browse: The World of Bookshops</em>, edited by Henry Hitchings (Pushkin, \u00a312.99). Sixteen contemporary authors, from 11 countries around the world, recount the role bookshops have played in their own lives, as well as the stories, habits and treasure associated with particular examples. Ali Smith, who works a stint for a few hours each week in her local Amnesty International second-hand bookshop, is fascinated by the way books become unexpected repositories for inscriptions and detritus that indicate something about the lives of those who once owned them. But all these writers convey the magic of bookshops, while also making their vulnerability in recent times a recurrent theme.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Shakespeare and Company, Paris: A History of the Rag &amp; Bone Shop of the Heart</em>, edited by<em> </em>Krista Halverson,<em> </em>is available from Thames &amp; Hudson</p>",

  "<p>The population of London grew at twice the rate of the UK as a whole between 2011 and 2015, and could reach almost 10 million by the middle of next decade, official figures show.</p> <p>In mid-2011, the population of the city stood at 8.2 million, but over four years it increased by 469,000 to just under 8.7 million, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. </p> <p>The arrival of almost 200,000 people from overseas each year, and an average of 130,000 births a year drove the city\u2019s growth, and offset the high numbers leaving the city for other countries and the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The ONS figures show the population of London increased by 5.7% between mid-2011 and mid-2015, compared with growth of 2.9% for the UK as a whole. Over the same period, the cost of housing in the capital has rocketed \u2013 Land Registry figures show that the average price of a property rose by 47% between June and 2011 and June 2015, from \u00a3285,906 to \u00a3419,474.</p> <p>After Greater London, Bristol was the city that saw the biggest boom in residents, with its population rising by 4.5%, or 49,000, to 1.1 million.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1S08-YKi0d-iL8809Q1RqnZRu8TFmLDqFyQM46zv8yZw\" data-alt=\"UK cities population growth\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1S08-YKi0d-iL8809Q1RqnZRu8TFmLDqFyQM46zv8yZw\">UK cities population growth</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cDiffering levels of population growth across different cities and regions are often a reflection of the economic strength of the location, with areas where the economy is performing strongest often experiencing most population growth,\u201d the ONS said.</p> <p>London, with its robust economy, has attracted far more movers from overseas than other parts of the UK, the figures show. Over the four-year period in question, an average of 192,000 people a year moved to London from abroad \u2013 including Britons who have returned after a period living overseas \u2013 while 95,000 moved in the other direction.</p> <p>Net international migration to Greater London averaged 97,000 a year, out of a figure of 236,000 for the UK as a whole. </p> <p>\u201cLondon\u2019s attraction to immigrants no doubt reflects its status as a major employment centre and international hub,\u201d said the ONS. </p> <p>\u201cWith its high ethnic-minority population it may prove especially attractive to people wishing to join family or others from that cultural background. In addition, for people heading to the UK, London is somewhere they are more likely to have some pre-existing awareness of than other parts of the country \u2013 perhaps because of previous visits, but also simply because it has a higher profile as the UK capital.\u201d<br></p> <p>Because many immigrants are young adults, the comparatively high immigration to Greater London affects all its other population dynamics, the ONS said. Over the period in question, there were an average 130,000 births in the capital each year and just 48,000 deaths. </p> <p>The figures also showed large numbers of people leaving Greater London for other parts of the UK. Each year an average of 63,200 people left the capital, with the 22- to 29-year-old age group the only one where more people moved in.<br></p> <p>Among 30- to 44-year-olds, 33,600 more people moved out of Greater London than into the city each year, while amongchildren that figure was 31,700. </p> <p></p> <p>In contrast, Bristol saw more people move in from around the UK, with net internal migration averaging 3,700 a year between mid-2011 and mid-2015. The population of Edinburgh was also boosted by internal migration, with 2,700 more people moving into the Scottish capital than out. House prices in those cities have also increased.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-12T12:25:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK cities internal migration\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-12T12:25:45/embed.html\">UK cities internal migration</a> </figure>  <p>The ONS said that, based on recent trends, the population of Greater London was projected to grow by 12.7% between 2015 and 2025, to 9.8 million people.

Rohan Dennis, Tony Martin and Tom Dumoulin are expected to be among the frontrunners here, hoping to claim the title that Vasil Kiryienka claimed last year in Richmond, Virginia, USA. If that was a more classic course, this is a new challenge. Flat as a pancake, the 40km course will favour the most powerful riders and sprinters, who may have to battle crosswinds in the middle part of the course. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca117bb6c85beaf37832c3d1216a8eeb482e1918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca117bb6c85beaf37832c3d1216a8eeb482e1918/0_0_665_940/354.jpg\" alt=\"Men\u2019s time trial course in Doha.\" width=\"354\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men\u2019s time trial course in Doha.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UCI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riders will depart from the Lusail Sports Complex at 90 second intervals, navigate a series of technical turns and roundabouts before hitting a long straight and entering downtown Doha.

  "<p> After a second exciting performance for the national team, and a second goal in two matches, Julian Green is \u201cback in the picture\u201d, according to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/11/jurgen-klinsmann-jockeying-bradley-usa\">Klinsmann insists he wasn't jockeying for Bradley's US job: 'It simply isn't true'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green, who got USA\u2019s goal against Cuba on Friday, opened the scoring against New Zealand in their friendly match in Washington on Tuesday night, before Monty Patterson\u2019s equalizer forced the hosts to settle for a 1-1 draw. </p> <p>\u201cJulian Green is back in the picture,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cHe scored another nice goal today but overall he\u2019s becoming more mature, he\u2019s becoming stronger, he\u2019s far more confident. It\u2019s really nice to see his development.\u201d</p> <p>Sunderland\u2019s Lynden Gooch, who made his USA debut as a second-half substitute, also impressed the coach.</p> <p>The 1-1 draw represents USA\u2019s last action before they open their final round of World Cup qualifying against Mexico on 11 November. \u201cWe wanted to get some answers to a couple of things toward the Mexico clash a month from now,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cAnd I think we found a couple very interesting answers.\u201d</p> <p>Green scored his third goal for USA in just his eighth appearance. He\u2019s seldom featured in the past couple of years, after making a splash in the 2014 World Cup, where he scored a late goal in extra time in the last-16 defeat by Belgium.</p> <p>But Green, another of USA\u2019s German Americans, earned an invite to Klinsmann\u2019s camp after repeatedly making the 18-man squad for Bayern Munich this season. \u201cI\u2019m really happy about it,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to always be here in this team, and when I\u2019m here I want to give my best. And I think I did very well.\u201d</p> <p>After scoring the second goal against Cuba, Green put his side ahead in the 27th minute, when his 18-yard shot sneaked between goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic, who was wrong-footed, and the left post. \u201cI think for Julian it\u2019s just a maturing process,\u201d Klinsmann said of Green. \u201cHe\u2019s still very, very young. I think he learned a lot under Pep Guardiola and he learns a lot under [Carlo] Ancelotti. They\u2019re very, very good coaches and it\u2019s his job to be a sponge and learn from them.\u201d</p> <p>Klinsmann said: \u201cHe wants to break into that team [Bayern]. He wants to get minutes there and he has people like Rib\u00e9ry and Robben in front of him. But the way he presented himself these 10 days from the first training session on, where we said \u2018ooh\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cHe made a big step forward. I think it just becomes more personality. When you deal with [players] that age you have to give them their up and downs and just hope that they mature one day at a time.\u201d</p> <p>New Zealand equalised in the 72nd minute, when Altidore failed to clear a corner, and Patterson popped up to thump the loose ball into the net from about five yards.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they start throwing more numbers at us and they start in some ways becoming even more direct and more desperate, that combined with some subs on both sides just means that the game becomes hectic,\u201d said USA captain Michael Bradley. \u201cWe gave away a bad goal, and ultimately that\u2019s the difference between winning and tying.\u201d</p> <p>Gooch, the 20-year-old who has appeared seven times this season for Sunderland of England\u2019s Premier League, came on in the 59th minute. The California native, whose Irish mother and English father give him three international options, made several lively bursts on the right, drawing chants of \u201cGooooch!\u201d from the crowd of just 9,012 at RFK Stadium.</p> <p>\u201cGooch confirmed what we saw in training already,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless. He takes people on. Very physical as well, doesn\u2019t shy away from physicality. You know, so there are a couple things that we saw that we didn\u2019t know before that camp.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Daily Mail \u2013 which means its editor, Paul Dacre \u2013 does not do subtlety.

Stop the anti-democratic games and respect the emphatic verdict of the British people.</p> <p>From the moment the referendum result became clear, Remain have been sore losers: incredulous that the British people could be so disrespectful as to reject their wisdom, and increasingly furious that the economy\u0097 far from collapsing, as predicted by Mr Osborne, is flourishing.</p> <p>So it was that they resorted to desperate subterfuge.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This \u201csubterfuge\u201d involves the \u201cpetulant and unacceptable\u201d Remain side inventing a term, \u201chard Brexit\u201d, \u0097in order to demand a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d to keep the UK \u0097within the single market.</p> <p>By contrast, there was praise for Dacre\u2019s new-found political heroine, Theresa May, for having crushed the Remainers\u2019 \u201clingering hopes that Brexit was a bad dream that might never happen.\u201d</p> <p>There were tributes to her \u201cdevastating \u0097 and entirely accurate \u0097critique of a metropolitan elite that sneers at the public\u2019s concerns about mass immigration\u201d and her dismissal of the views of \u201ca well-heeled group of London \u2018intellectuals\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>This was a leading article reflecting Dacre\u2019s personal opinions. If it was not written by him, then it was certainly done at his dictation. </p> <p>That said, it is highly likely that the leader also reflects the views of the majority of the Mail\u2019s readership. Of the almost 2,000 comments below the online version of the editorial, the overwhelming majority were in favour.</p> <p>Many of them picked up on the arguments in the editorial\u2019s final paragraphs about the Remain side \u201cbeing sore losers\u201d and being \u201cdeeply unpatriotic.\u201d</p> <p>In conclusion, the Mail/Dacre said: \u201cIs it really too much to hope that the penny might now finally drop with the metropolitan elite, who for decades have ignored the wishes of their fellow countrymen? </p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that their contempt for democracy and the public is more to do with their own political ambitions than with concern for the future of Britain.\u201d</p>",

Finally, the UK and others could air drop food to the million starving people in besieged areas.

If this is how the House of Commons deliberates on emergencies, it\u2019s a shame for issues less urgent than live genocide.</p> <p>Nevertheless, one would have hoped that quality would trump quantity, even with the expectation that the devil\u2019s advocates would go out of their way to absolve criminals from responsibility for the carnage in Syria. Indeed, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/ed-miliband-syria-strike\">Ed Miliband\u2019s shameful posturing</a> after the August 2013 chemical massacre, most Labour MPs continue to disgrace themselves by refusing to denounce Assad\u2019s \u2013 let alone Russia\u2019s \u2013 massively documented war crimes.

When the US bombed an al-Qaida camp in northeast Syria in 2008, Assad closed down the American School of Damascus and ordered demonstrations - because that will show them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">Labour says 'fight will go on' after Tories vote down child refugee plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Syrians were crushed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\">MPs voted to deny a small Kindertransport for a mere 3,000 unaccompanied children</a>. As pitiful a spectacle as that debate was, it left some feeble hope that Britain would strive to do more to protect these Syrian children\u2019s lives, precisely so they wouldn\u2019t need to seek shelter elsewhere. That hope dissipates with every empty declaration reassuring Assad and his allies that nothing, absolutely nothing, will be done to halt their aggression.</p> <p>All that remains to complete this theatre of the absurd is for Johnson to suggest that people organise candle-lit vigils while singing Kumbaya to help the people of Syria.

It is possible that Putin might refuse but this would leave Russia isolated, condemned by the world community and severely weakened in terms of prestige and influence. Even Putin is unlikely to want that. If he agrees, Assad won\u2019t want to be left out in cold. He, too, is likely to reluctantly comply.</p> <p>This civilian protection plan may or may not work.

We must try.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lindsey-german\">Lindsey German</a>: The answer is not more war</h2> <p>Every time there is a debate about war in the House of Commons, it is as if we are starting from a blank sheet. Tuesday\u2019s debate was no exception. There was little to suggest that over the past few months alone there have been three separate official reports \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/chilcot-report-crushing-verdict-tony-blair-iraq-war\">Chilcot</a>, and select committee reports on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention\">Libya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-has-failed-to-justify-syria-airstrikes-mps-committee-says\">Syria</a> \u2013 which have been extremely critical of two recent prime ministers, Tony Blair and David Cameron, and damning about the interventions originally cheered through in parliament. Anne Clwyd, who along with Boris Johnson wants 2 million on the streets outside the Russian embassy, was one of the main cheerleaders of the Iraq war, at a time when 2 million were marching against it.</p> <p>On each occasion there is a drive to war we are told something must be done. But the answer to the misery of the people of Aleppo is not more war, more bombing, more military intervention. It is not a no-fly zone, which in fact entails military intervention. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world\">no-fly zone was the prelude to a bombing war in Libya</a> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/libya-war-saving-lives-catastrophic-failure\">30,000 people died</a> and where there is still a civil war raging more than five years later. All that this will bring to the people of Aleppo is more suffering. It also risks escalating into a much worse war than even that we are seeing at present.</p> <p>The call to demonstrate outside the Russian embassy is the sort of debating point which may go down well in the Oxford Union. I would suggest that sympathy for the plight of Aleppo is not likely to be mobilised by such calls, given that much public opinion is rightly sceptical of these successive failed wars. But Johnson does nothing to address the very complex and dangerous situation in a country which is being bombed by Russia, Syria, Turkey, the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia. If we want to help the people of Aleppo we must condemn all the bombing, demand an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all outside intervention. We should also demand entry into Europe for all Syrian refugees, and the end to the inhuman treatment of them by EU governments, including our own. Those are some things that really could be done to help end this war.</p>",

For \u201cthe hardships that he endured\u201d while Building The Dream\u2122, Alam is asking for the equivalent of $5,000.

His case is that in 2014, the then 29-year-old paid the equivalent of $4,000 \u201con account\u201d to a recruiter who led him to understand that a construction firm had sponsored him and he was to be employed as an unskilled labourer. Under the less rosy realities of the country\u2019s forced-labour kafala system, Alam\u2019s passport was taken from him and he was forced to work 18-hour days for nearly a year and a half. During what we\u2019ll sarcastically call his downtime, he was confined to a World Cup workers\u2019 camp, where he was naturally required to pay for his meals. In a cute and doubtless entirely coincidental instance of timing, he was fired before he had \u201crepaid\u201d his recruitment fee, whereupon he was deported penniless back to Bangladesh. He had mortgaged his land back home to pay the initial instalment to the recruiter, and is now unable to pay the debt.</p> <p>As I say, that little jolly consumed 17 backbreaking and cruelly fruitless months of Alam\u2019s existence. In contrast, let us consider the figures attached to a mere four days \u2013 four days! \u2013 in the life of Gianni Infantino, the Solomon Grundy of a Fifa president who was appointed on a Monday and embroiled in an ethics investigation by the Tuesday, before being cleared on the Wednesday.

According to this letter to the ethics committee, despite Fifa having booked him commercial flights between Geneva, Moscow, Doha, and Zurich over four days in April, Infantino rejected these in favour of accepting private jet flights paid for by Russia and Qatar. \u201cThe total value of the private jet invitations are in a range of at least approx $115,000 to $150,000,\u201d the letter states, \u201cdepending on aircraft and ferry-flights, even more.\u201d Needless to say, this does not include standard Fifa expenses such as hotel rooms, cars, dinners and other sundries. Unlike Alam, for instance, I imagine the Fifa president likes his Doha water bottled, rather than dispensed by a desert standpipe.</p> <p>Ah well. There are always two different World Cups. When Fifa bigwigs blather on about any tournament, you can always predict exactly which version of it is going to turn up. Either the World Cup pretty much has the power to heal the planet and is an incredibly transformative thing \u2013 which is why you increasingly have to award it to non-democracies. Or it is only a game, and really can\u2019t be held accountable for whatever it is you\u2019ve discovered is being done in its name, even if it profits you obscenely. I don\u2019t want to go out on a limb here, but which version do we imagine Infantino falls back on when he tells Alam and his modest plea to do one?</p> <h2><strong>Lockered out</strong><br></h2> <p>Like all women, I am shocked by the idea that either Donald Trump or Nigel Farage has been inside a \u201clocker room\u201d inside the past two decades \u2013 or even since school. Indeed, each time I consider these chaps\u2019 assured mention of the \u201clocker room\u201d, I find my mind wandering to the inevitable. Which is (but of course): what sport would Nigel and Donald have been playing just before the sexual-assault-reminiscences warmdown?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-locker-room-banter-athletes-reaction\">Athletes on Trump's 'locker room banter': that's not how we talk at work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there anything more preposterous than the notion of Trump playing even a bit of pitch and putt with little Barron, before losing interest and offloading it to the help? The idea of The Donald playing any form of sport is almost more bonkers than the idea of him being leader of the free world.</p> <p>I am reminded of an oblique remark made by his own devoted former butler, shortly after he\u2019d shown a reporter the sensationally bad portrait of his boss in costume cricket whites in the library bar of his Floridian estate. To wit: \u201cMr Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks.\u201d</p> <p>If I really stretch my imagination, I can just about picture both Nigel and Donald playing racketball incredibly angrily and atrociously for around three minutes, Farage in black office socks with white plimsolls, and Trump with those mid-calf efforts and trainers with a wide heel flare recommended by the American Orthotics Association.</p> <p>But really, two less credible denizens of a locker room I can scarcely contemplate. I assume there is already a horrendously niche strain of slash fiction devoted to what happens when these two finish chuckling about pussy-grabbing and head for the showers.

  "<p>\u201cWhen I walk out of the office, people are maybe not expecting a woman,\u201d says Megan Barry, when I ask whether she has experienced sexism since being elected mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, just over a year ago. \u201cYou can see the surprise in their eyes: \u2018Oh, ha!

But there are plenty who pour cold water on the idea that where one leads, others will follow, or that the election of a first female mayor \u2013 or indeed a first woman as a country\u2019s president or prime minister \u2013 changes anything much. </p> <p>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science at the University of Southern Denmark, says recent Scandinavian political history justifies such doubts. While Denmark has had its first female prime minister, and the sexes are widely seen to be more equal there than almost anywhere else, the percentage of female mayors in the country has not risen above 15%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.</p> <footer> <cite>Ulrik Kjaer, professor of political science</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince we have already some women mayors and we\u2019ve had a female PM, we tend to tick off gender \u2013 \u2018OK, we\u2019re done with that, we\u2019ve reached some kind of parity\u2019 \u2013 and focus on other under-represented groups, immigrants and young people and so on ... when in fact gender parity has not been reached,\u201d he says. \u201cWomen still have a very hard time being accepted as political leaders, especially in local politics.\u201d</p> <p>Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, echoes this. She says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/hillary-clinton-sexism-millennial-voters-women\">Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for US president</a> creates the \u201cfalse impression that women have really made it in politics. If she wins it will be enormously significant but it masks the reality. We\u2019re not anticipating a year of great strides. We might get from 19% women in the House of Representatives to 20%. State legislatures are not particularly great, and at governor level there are only six women [out of 50].\u201d</p> <p>Walsh believes the women with positions in American politics are, on the whole, more moderate, because women are more economically vulnerable than men, and see themselves as more likely to need state help. But she adds that partisan pulls have recently become stronger. </p> <p>She points to a lack of research into local government internationally as one problem confronting anyone trying to understand what impact, if any, women legislators make. She also notes that the jobs of mayor or governor pose particular challenges, because the stereotype of the good female politician is of a skilful group or committee worker, not a charismatic boss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b694f089511bb360fb7944bc939ac4be2abb6d29/0_384_3459_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of Watford Dorothy Thornhill speaks to Nick Clegg and project managers during a visit to the construction site for the Watford Health Campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mayor of Watford, Dorothy Thornhill, speaks to Nick Clegg and construction managers at Watford Health Campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> This point is echoed by Dorothy Thornhill, mayor of Watford in England for the past 14 years, and one of just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/03/where-women-council-leaders-northern-powerhouse-english-regions\">four directly elected English female mayors</a>. \u201cPeople think leadership equals male characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea that you have to be this macho-type of person is still around.\u201d As mayor, she has played against this type, and cheerfully reports how on a school visit a child shouted out, \u201cYou ain\u2019t no mayor!

She <a href=\"https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/96/light-in-the-dark/\">has since said</a> she thinks her words were a subconscious reflection of her own trauma. When I ask what lessons she took from New Year, she says the attacks are \u201cstill very much present in our heads\u201d.</p> <p>Ana Olivera, until last year mayor of Montevideo, capital of Uruguay, is another mayor to have focused attention on violence against women, by offering psychological therapy to survivors of sexual violence. But she describes rights for women as part of a larger struggle that includes racial equality and LGBT inclusion: \u201cI don\u2019t see women\u2019s interests as a trade-off against the interests of other groups.\u201d </p> <p>On the contrary, supporters of women\u2019s representation in politics believe women can act as a kind of bridgehead for other under-represented groups \u2013 older people, children, racial and religious minorities \u2013 because although women are not a minority, they are more likely than men to have experienced social exclusion and disempowerment. Olivera names among her proudest achievements as Montevideo mayor a skate park, proposed by a group of teenage skateboarders who won approval and a budget from the city.</p> <p>If a couple of themes recur in talking to female mayors, one is that they have often been underestimated, if not insulted; another is their sense that women can bring a different, less overtly combative and more consensual approach to government. Also, there is their pride at having blazed a trail. </p> <h2>Female mayors in their own words</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c690300d5b38a5e15f20fcfc03be9f79caa592f0/0_27_477_596/400.jpg\" alt=\"Cyvette Gibson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyvette Gibson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cyvette Gibson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cyvette Gibson, Paynesville, Liberia (population 347,000)</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn parts of Africa there are still prejudices about women in leadership roles and doubts about the impact we can make.

  "<p>As the Conservatives launch their Brexit gamble, Labour MPs are squabbling among themselves. This is nowhere more true than on immigration. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry\u2019s attempt to straddle the stark divisions within the party <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07x5qqh\" title=\"\">on BBC Radio 4 this morning</a> succeeded merely in emphasising them. While Jeremy Corbyn clings to his politically naive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\" title=\"\">\u201cwelcome all comers\u201d attitude</a>, centrist MPs race to reposition themselves, speaking out against EU free movement in a belated attempt to respond to what they heard on the doorstep during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>These are not people for whom the principle of sovereignty is crucial \u2013 in which case their arguments might make some sense. Rather, they believe that limiting immigration as part of any Brexit deal is what they must do to respond to disgruntled voters. They are wrong. While an open-door policy is obviously unworkable, the idea of sacrificing single market membership in order to limit EU migration is equally flawed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s deal first with a popular canard about the referendum campaign. The notion that the failure of the remain camp can be placed squarely at the feet of Corbyn is, as <a href=\"http://ukandeu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">my colleague</a> John Curtice <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/06/dont-blame-jeremy-corbyn-polls-show-only-tory-voters-could-have-kept-us-eu\" title=\"\">recently illustrated, untrue</a>. Not only were the demographics stacked against the party (older, white, less-educated voters tended to vote leave, and make up much of the party\u2019s traditional support in its heartlands), but also the remain vote held up better than one might have expected in areas where Labour is strong.</p> <p>Indeed, one might wonder why Corbyn is given such a hard time. David Cameron failed to convince almost 60% of Conservative voters to back membership, while the proportion of SNP voters who voted leave was virtually identical to that of Labour voters (<a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\" title=\"\">36%, versus 37%</a>, according to Lord Ashcroft).</p> <p>Which leaves Labour with the question of how to deal with the fallout. The most important issue in British politics today is to get the Brexit argument straight. Key to this are the debates over free movement. Here again, it is worth being clear about the facts. It was not high levels of migration that prompted people to vote leave \u2013 south Staffordshire saw one of the highest leave votes (at 78%), yet less than 1% of its population was born in continental Europe. Indeed, of the 20 areas in the UK with the lowest level of EU migration, 15 voted leave; of the 20 with the highest, 18 voted remain. It was not so much levels of immigration as rapid change in those levels \u2013 in places such as Redditch or Lincoln \u2013 that seems to have incited discontent.</p> <p>EU migration has been good for the British economy as a whole. The numbers are clear and unambiguous. That said, there are clearly areas of the country \u2013 south Lincolnshire being a topical example in the context of the referendum \u2013 where high levels of inward migration place a strain on local services and disrupt local communities.</p> <p>How, then, to address this problem? One option, clung to by some, can be rapidly dismissed \u2013 based, as it is, on the hope that other member states will unanimously agree to allow Britain to remain in the single market while restricting freedom of movement. Another, increasingly espoused even by centrist, staunchly pro-remain Labour figures, is to accept a trade-off between market and free movement and envisage forsaking our membership of the former as a price for restricting the latter.</p> <p>Yet this would be an act of economic self-harm. Contrary to what senior Labour figures seem to think, the real economic benefit of the EU does not lie in the direct payments we receive from its budget. UK annual receipts from <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/faq/#1\" title=\"\">cohesion policy</a> are around \u00a31.6bn, or 0.1% of GDP.</p> <p>In contrast, the hit to the British economy of leaving the single market could, depending on the relationship we have with it thereafter, be of the order of 1% to 4% of GDP. The IFS has estimated that a fall of 2.1% in GDP (relative to what it would have been had we stayed in) would leave the budget deficit \u00a320bn to \u00a340bn higher than it would otherwise have been. Clearly, payments from the budget are relatively trivial in comparison. And, of course, the very act of reducing migration would exert a further a negative impact on the public finances.</p> <p>Yet the levers that need to be pulled to address the problems caused by migration \u2013 and indeed those generated by globalisation in general \u2013 lie in the hands of national government. Investment in housing, in health and education are obvious ways of tackling some of the negative effects that migration might generate. So, too might more rigorous enforcement of the minimum wage, in order to prevent the exploitation of those same migrants at the hands of greedy employers and gang masters.</p> <p>None of this will be easy. It will require talking to the electorate, rather than blindly reacting to what we think they are saying. And Labour will have to own up to its failure to address many of these issues while in power. Most of all, it will require a Labour government rather than simply a social movement.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, the choice confronting Labour is one between risking damage to the national economy because of legitimate grievances in a relative small number of areas, or making the case for a progressive answer to the paradoxes of globalisation. The more money at the disposal of the state, the easier it will be to deal with the real problems that a system that has raised over a billion people globally out of poverty and has contributed to the growth of the British economy causes in some parts of the country. Surely, the key to a successful Brexit lies in maintaining as much prosperity as possible and ensuring that the gains from trade and from migration are divided fairly? Isn\u2019t that, after all, what social democracy should be for?</p>",
  "<h2><strong>I\u2019m most looking forward to watching \u2026</strong></h2> <p><strong>Connor McDavid</strong>. We didn\u2019t get to see a full season from him last year, but the 45 games we did get lived up to the hype. He looked phenomenal at the World Cup, and when I was down there I talked to a few hockey people who thought he might be very close to \u201cbest player in the world\u201d status right now. Not eventually, or a few years down the line, but right now. If he stays healthy, I think he has a shot at the Art Ross. <strong>SM</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/13/stanley-cup-pittsburgh-penguins-san-jose-sharks-ratings\">This year's Stanley Cup playoffs had it all. If only hockey fans had watched it</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Connor McDavid</strong>. The supposed next [insert great forward from hockey history] had his rookie season interrupted by a broken collarbone last year, yet in 45 games he still nearly bested No2 overall pick Jack Eichel\u2019s full-season points output. Of course, in true Bettman/NHL form, the league is capitalizing on McDavid\u2019s draw by putting the Oilers on national TV in the States this season a grand total of zero times. <strong>DG</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8641e0015615d3a2c7c7bcb4d1b5f18278402ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8641e0015615d3a2c7c7bcb4d1b5f18278402ab/0_0_3510_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Connor McDavid: the next big thing?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"854\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connor McDavid: the next big thing?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Perry Nelson/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Calgary Flames</strong>. One of the biggest issues for Calgary has been goaltending, but they picked up Brian Elliott from St Louis over the summer, so that could now change. Elliott had a 2.07 goals-against average, and a .930 save percentage over 42 games last year with the Blues. Also, adding Troy Brouwer (also from St Louis) gives them some necessary experience up front. And if Matthew Tkachuk, picked sixth overall in the draft, makes the permanent lineup, there\u2019ll be a lot to be excited about in Calgary over and above of the fact they got rid of Bob Hartley. <strong>CH</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Mitch Marner</strong>. The Maple Leafs rookie racked up 116 points in 57 games in junior last season and embodies everything that the modern NHL is about: speed, skill and not necessarily size. Sure, 1st overall pick Auston Matthews will have more eyes on him in Toronto this season but Marner creates magic with the puck not unlike last year\u2019s Art Ross winner Patrick Kane. If he can make the jump to pro, the Leafs could have a Toews/Kane duo on their hands. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>The biggest disappointment will be \u2026</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Vancouver Canucks</strong>, who think they\u2019re a playoff team but could end up finishing dead last. I don\u2019t think this will qualify as a major surprise to anyone outside of the Canucks organization \u2013 even their fans seem really down on the team right now \u2013 but it will be a disappointment to the management group that apparently thinks they have a contender. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>Maybe this answer is a cop-out because it can be submitted every year, but: the <strong>Washington Capitals</strong>. After the Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners got knocked out of the second Round of the playoffs by the Penguins, general manager Brian MacLellan said the team needed to get faster. So the Capitals enter this season with ... almost exactly the same roster. It\u2019s a bold (and very slow) approach. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Over the summer, the <strong>Toronto Maple Leafs</strong> grabbed Frederik Andersen from Anaheim and gave him a stack of cash ($25m over five years). Andersen is an OK goalie! But when it comes to hockey, Toronto is a hellish panopticon, where the punishment for mistakes \u2013 perceived or real \u2013 is swift, brutal, and unending. Andersen is bound to disappoint, even if he has a good year. Call it the Phil Kessel effect. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Anaheim Ducks</strong>. They\u2019ve won the Pacific Division the last four seasons but won\u2019t qualify for the playoffs this season. Their aging group of forwards will do little to inspire this season and eventually, the speed of the league will lap them. Hiring a coach with methods as dated as Randy Carlyle\u2019s won\u2019t help matters either. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>One bold prediction</strong></h2> <p>Shameless plug: I\u2019ve already made 30 of them, one for each team, and you can find those <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/down-goes-browns-nhl-preview-part-1-bottom-feeders-and-middle-of-the-pack-teams\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/down-goes-browns-nhl-preview-part-2-contenders-hard-to-figure-out-teams-and-predictions\">here</a>. But one that sticks out would see the <strong>Red Wings finally miss the playoffs after 25 straight seasons</strong>. And I\u2019m not even sure they get to go out with a dramatic chase; they could already be done by April. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Penguins stick with Marc-Andre Fleury as their No1</strong> goalie. Matt Murray was in net for most of Pittsburgh\u2019s Cup run last spring, no small accomplishment for a 22-year old, but he\u2019s rail thin and is already developing an injury track record. If Pittsburgh isn\u2019t 100% sold on him, they could find a trading partner who is and get a nice haul in return. <strong>DG</strong><br></p> <p>The <strong>Vancouver Canucks will finish in the bottom five</strong>. The Canucks appear to be adrift. Back in May, the team made a curious trade, sending Jared McCann, a rookie with some promise, and two draft picks to Florida in exchange for Erik Gudbranson and one draft pick, much to fan shagrin. Meanwhile, there are two question marks in goal \u2013 Ryan Miller has yet to deliver on the (somewhat limited) promise he had when he arrived, and Jacob Markstrom has struggled, while at 26 is running out of time to solidify himself as a likely successor for the first-string role. The Sedin twins are still around, but beyond that top line, can Vancouver score? Or keep goals at bay? <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Corey Perry will be traded before the new year</strong>. Another early season slump will be too much for Ducks GM Bob Murray to stomach and he will ask Corey Perry to waive his no-movement clause as a means to shake up his roster and remind the Ducks he means business. Perry\u2019s even-strength points production has decreased dramatically through the last three seasons but another GM will have no trouble offering a roster player and a prospect, plus taking on Perry\u2019s $8.625m cap hit for the next five seasons. Perry may be just five seasons removed from his Hart Trophy win but his style of play has proven to be unsustainable lately. The cap space allows Murray some flexibility and having only made it past the second round of the playoffs once in his eight-season tenure, buys him some more time on the job. <strong>JK</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>One change to improve the NHL</strong></h2> <p><strong>Make the nets bigger</strong>. I know it\u2019s sacrilege to some hockey fans, but enough is enough. The dead puck era is now two decades old. The NHL has been talking about increasing scoring for over 20 years (literally, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/14207776/nhl-brief-history-nhl-pretending-fix-scoring\">I catalogued it</a>). They keep making little tweaks, and those changes always end up having no impact at all. This year, it was supposed to be smaller goalie equipment, but the league dropped the ball and it couldn\u2019t get it done in time for the start of the season, so it\u2019s the status quo yet again. It\u2019s ridiculous.</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s a great sport, but far too often these days, the NHL product is just flat out boring. Imagine going to you very first game, and you end up watching a plodding 1-0 contest where the only goal comes on a fluke deflection. You\u2019d never come back. How many potential fans has the NHL\u2019s inaction cost them over the last two decades? Make the goal an inch or two bigger all around, give the shooters some net to actually shoot at, force the defense to cover a wider scoring area, and make the goalies work for their shutouts. It won\u2019t solve the problem of dull, defense-first coaching sucking the life out of the game, but it will at least bring a bit of excitement back to the sport. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"128b81cbd054571e344fd98fd0301cac0c22cc9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/128b81cbd054571e344fd98fd0301cac0c22cc9d/0_0_4509_3006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time to stop the fighting?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time to stop the fighting?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Belski/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Finally ban fighting</strong>. The World Cup was the latest example that the best hockey happens without any punches thrown \u2013 also see: Olympic hockey \u2013 and ridding the game of goons frees up roster spots for skilled players who can actually play the sport at a high level. Sure, some fans want to see pointless brawls, but the NHL shouldn\u2019t degrade the quality of its product just to appeal to the basket of deplorables demo. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>The <strong>NHL\u2019s Stadium Series</strong> bills itself as all-important, but it is nothing more than a branding exercise taken past its reasonable limit. We\u2019re getting plenty of that elsewhere. Shut it down. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Be more liberal with 30-40 game suspensions</strong> for players who fight more than once in a season and those who commit violent hits to the head. You can be sure that players will choose much more wisely when fighting as a means to sway the momentum of a game. This would also quicken the pace of the game. Few things will make a player re-think his violent on-ice actions than threatening a giant hit to his paycheque. And, most importantly, the health of players around the league could hopefully be protected. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>How many Canadian teams will make the playoffs?</strong></h2> <p><strong>One \u2013 the Montreal Canadiens</strong>. The Jets and Flames have a shot. The Leafs, Senators and Canucks would be shockers. The Oilers, really, who knows. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p><strong>One \u2013 the Calgary Flames</strong>. They made the playoffs two years ago a bit ahead of schedule, but took a big step back last year and got head coach Bob Hartley fired. They\u2019ll be improved this season thanks to acquiring Brian Elliott, a significant upgrade over the goalie-shaped, cardboard cutouts they tried in net before. <strong>DG</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Two</strong>? Maybe <strong>Montreal</strong> can sneak back in, if Carey Price remains healthy and things don\u2019t fall apart too badly in front of him. And, on paper anyway, <strong>Calgary</strong> looks best positioned in the west to make the playoffs. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Two \u2013 the Winnipeg Jets and the Calgary Flames</strong>. Carey Price will do everything in his power to get the Montreal Canadiens to the post-season but they don\u2019t have enough talent to find the back of the net. The Edmonton Oilers will be fun at times, messy at others. The Jets will see their young goalie tandem step up in a big way and the Flames will surprise their way into a division win. <strong>JK</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>How will Gary Bettman upset hockey fans this year?</strong></h2> <p>By continuing to exist. But if you want something more specific, let\u2019s say by pulling the NHL out of the 2018 Winter Games and then, in typical Bettman form, making some ridiculous comments about how hockey fans don\u2019t really like the Olympics anyway. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>Bettman said in a press conference before the start of the World Cup of Hockey that the thing he loves most about being commissioner is presenting the Stanley Cup each year. Yes, the thing he does while getting booed, loudly, every time. Gary Bettman is clearly a heel and will do anything and everything to enrage fans further. <strong>DG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41d6e2c4529347d7b00528940e1829d1cd7f146f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41d6e2c4529347d7b00528940e1829d1cd7f146f/0_72_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Bettman: not exactly you average hockey fan\u2019s favourite person.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Bettman: not exactly you average hockey fan\u2019s favourite person.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to concussions, Gary Bettman adopts the same stance as a climate change denier. For this, history should judge him extremely harshly. Well, for that, and putting a team in Las Vegas. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>By not getting ahead of the concussion problems, which could still threaten to damage the integrity of the NHL. Yes, the league-wide concussion spotting program has been amped up yet again in an effort to catch players who sustain concussions in game but there are still far too many players involved in a lawsuit against the league. Bettman is in a tough spot here with regards to fighting in the game: he\u2019d upset purists by instilling tougher punishment for fighting and could also upset progressive fans who want to see it banned from the game. But with the mental health of future hockey players at stake, Bettman needs to take a stand and eliminate any opportunity for unnecessary, long-term head injuries. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Metropolitan winners</strong></h2> <p>Regular season: <strong>Pittsburgh Penguins</strong>; playoffs: <strong>Washington Capitals</strong>. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p><strong>Washington</strong>. The Penguins are the better team, but having a big regular season is very Capitals. Soon the Verizon Center ceiling won\u2019t have any room left for more <a href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4066/5145030052_93846f6dcb_b.jpg\">banners that no one cares about</a>. <strong>DG</strong><br></p> <p>We need some hope in our lives these days. The New York Islanders. (Just kidding. The <strong>Caps</strong>.) <strong>CH</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Washington Capitals</strong>. The best pure goalscorer and goaltender in the game right now topple a Penguins team that could be hurt with injuries. <strong>JK</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Atlantic winners</strong></h2> <p>Regular season: <strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong>; playoffs: <strong>Lightning</strong>. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p><strong>Tampa Bay</strong>. The Lightning lost in the 2015 Cup Final and the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals. That may look like a team on the decline, but they\u2019re still one of the youngest teams in hockey and they made the best offseason acquisition of all in keeping Steven Stamkos. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>This is going to be a weird division. <strong>Florida Panthers</strong>. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong>. If Nikita Kucherov\u2019s game takes another step and they receive a decent return in a possible Ben Bishop trade, the collection of also-rans in this division won\u2019t be able to touch them. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Central winners</strong></h2> <p>Regular season: <strong>Predators</strong>; playoffs: Stars. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p><strong>Dallas Stars</strong>. Dallas started fast last year and then waned as the season wore on. This year they open with four top forwards battling injuries. That could be a blessing in an ice pack disguise, allowing Dallas to peak later in the year with everyone healthy. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>What happens when the <strong>Nashville Predators</strong> bring in PK Subban to energize an offensive defence, while adding center Ryan Johansen? Maybe they take the division. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Nashville Predators</strong>. Under Peter Laviolette, this lineup will be one of the most dynamic and entertaining to watch. The most offensive defence corps in the league should keep games as high scoring affairs, even if that means their Goals Against Average will suffer too. Nevertheless, this is a team that\u2019s been on the verge for years and with a number of players, including possible Norris Trophy winner Roman Josi, entering their primes, they will emerge as one of the league\u2019s elite. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Pacific winners</strong></h2> <p>Regular season: <strong>Kings</strong>; playoffs: <strong>Kings</strong>. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p><strong>LA Kings</strong>. Speed and youth is the new Stanley Cup model, whereas the Kings are remain built around size and veterans. That style still works to get through the long grind of the regular season, but the Kings may want to make a few trades before the playoffs start. <strong>DG</strong><br></p> <p>Someone from <strong>California</strong>. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Calgary Flames</strong>. A new coach will inject life into this up-and-down team. Plus, Johnny Gaudreau could challenge for the scoring title and new man between the pipes Brian Elliott will give this team the stability in net that they\u2019ve lacked for years. Post-season success is another question, of course. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Eastern Conference finals prediction</strong></h2> <p>Lightning over Capitals. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>Penguins over Lightning. <strong>DG</strong><br></p> <p>Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Washington Capitals. Will Sidney Crosby recover quickly from his latest concussion? Hopefully! <strong>CH</strong> </p> <p>Washington Capitals over Tampa Bay Lightning. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>Western Conference finals prediction</strong></h2> <p>Stars over Kings. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>Stars over Ducks. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>San Jose Sharks v Chicago Blackhawks. Recent history might suggest San Jose is a good candidate to reach the conference final. Less recent history might suggest that San Jose is a good candidate to go off the rails in the first round. Let\u2019s assume irregular things happen in San Jose again this year, and somewhat regular things happen in Chicago. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p>Nashville Predators over Chicago Blackhawks. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Hart Trophy winner is \u2026</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sidney Crosby</strong>. McDavid wins the Art Ross, but voters shy away from giving him the Hart too after the Oilers don\u2019t make the playoffs. <strong>SM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4ac3f4c8f3fc761013609f192bd63f45736b684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4ac3f4c8f3fc761013609f192bd63f45736b684/0_0_3000_2158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sidney Crosby: he\u2019s still pretty good at hockey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sidney Crosby: he\u2019s still pretty good at hockey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Denette/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the last 10 months, <strong>Sidney Crosby</strong> went from 100-something in NHL scoring to third, won the Cup, won the Conn Smythe, won the World Cup and won the World Cup MVP. It\u2019s been a reminder to the hockey intelligentsia that he\u2019s still pretty good at the sport. Barring a long-term absence from concussion (or McDavid scoring 150 points and single-handedly taking the Oilers to the playoffs), it\u2019s Crosby\u2019s to lose. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>If Dallas has a similar season to its last one (which they might!) and <strong>Jamie Benn</strong> equals or exceeds his 2015-16 performance (which he could!) one would hope that he is rewarded properly. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Ovechkin</strong>. Like it or not, Ovechkin will always be linked and compared to Sidney Crosby. Crsoby himself reminded the world why he\u2019s one of the league\u2019s greats both in last season\u2019s run to the Stanley Cup and in this fall\u2019s World Cup of Hockey. This will only light a fire under Ovechkin. At 31, he knows his window for a Stanley Cup is closing and seeing what one of his rivals did last season will push him not only to another 50-goal season but also a determined approach the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen from him. As talented as the Capitals are, he could take them on his back. <strong>JK</strong></p> <h2><strong>The 2017 Stanley Cup winners will be \u2026</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong> over the Stars in six. <strong>SM</strong></p> <p>No team has repeated as Stanley Cup champions since the Red Wings did it in 1997 and 1998, but <strong>Pittsburgh</strong> returns almost the exact same roster that dominated the NHL last winter and spring. No one would be surprised if Gary Bettman hands them the Cup (while getting booed) again this June. <strong>DG</strong></p> <p>Maybe the Chicago Blackhawks can play the Pittsburgh Penguins in the final, and we all win, but more specifically the <strong>Penguins</strong> can. <strong>CH</strong></p> <p><strong>Washington Capitals</strong>, finally. The defending champs will run into injuries and Braden Holtby\u2019s regular season workload may be as exhaustive as seasons previous. Carey Price\u2019s Montreal Canadiens won\u2019t factor into the playoffs and these will be the playoffs when Holtby emerges not just as one of the best goaltenders on the planet, but a big-game player as well. And of course, Ovechkin, on his own mission, will take these two to the promised land, finally. As per usual the Western Conference will beat themselves up. The Capitals, however, won\u2019t have to sustain nearly as much damage in the early rounds. <strong>JK</strong></p>",
  "<p>\u2018The colour is so alive and so free, it almost makes you laugh out loud,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.scottishdancetheatre.com/company/fleur\">Fleur Darkin</a>, talking about <a href=\"http://www.mapplethorpe.org/\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mapplethorpe.org/portfolios/flowers/\">flower photographs</a> from the late 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time he uses colour after a life of black and white,\u201d the choreographer explains. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like he is finally surpassing the need to be cool, and he comes out with his true love for colour and life and nature in all its glory.\u201d</p> <p>Mapplethorpe\u2019s images are the inspiration behind Darkin\u2019s latest work for Scottish Dance Theatre, <a href=\"http://www.scottishdancetheatre.com/productions/velvet-petal\">Velvet Petal</a>, which premieres in Mexico tonight. The US photographer is better known for his monochrome portraits treating the naked body as still life and for chronicling the sexual subcultures of New York in the 1970s. But for Darkin, his bright and detailed closeups of flowers embody a real sense of transformation. \u201cWe have tried to do the same in the show,\u201d she says. \u201cStick to black and white \u2026 and then an epiphanic colour burst at the end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bfddf0330cce5ea6d87767482282f68c8e1e1350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfddf0330cce5ea6d87767482282f68c8e1e1350/0_819_3311_4038/820.jpg\" alt=\"Tough girls and pretty boys \u2026 Velvet Petal.\" width=\"820\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tough girls and pretty boys \u2026 Velvet Petal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sense of emerging from the chrysalis and realising your true nature is at the heart of Velvet Petal, a work that began when Darkin read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/just-kids-patti-smith-biography\">Patti Smith\u2019s memoir Just Kids</a>. The book recounts Smith\u2019s early years in New York, living with Mapplethorpe at the Chelsea Hotel, scraping by, making art and rubbing shoulders with rock stars, drag queens and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/14/andy-warhol-friends-reveal-all\">Factory girls</a>. Darkin\u2019s show is not a narrative \u2013 \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to make Bob and Patti: The Ballet,\u201d she says \u2013 it\u2019s more about embodying a coming-of-age spirit. \u201cTo me, the real richness in that book is not the bit when their work is successful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s capturing that age when you are constantly creating and transforming yourself. It\u2019s about people metamorphosing.\u201d</p> <p>Like Mapplethorpe himself, Velvet Petal plays with a fluid and fluctuating idea of identity, especially sexuality. \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in showing a \u2018gay\u2019 character or a \u2018straight\u2019 character,\u201d says Darkin. \u201cWhat am I going to do, a duet with two men to show they\u2019re gay? It just seems sort of embarrassing. It\u2019s not good enough for a subject Mapplethorpe is so sophisticated on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have tough girls and pretty boys,\u201d she says of the piece. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like gender only exists on first glance, and the longer you look at bodies, it disappears. Gender is this huge thing to play with and create outrage with, it\u2019s incredibly potent; and yet on one level it\u2019s a fiction.\u201d</p> <p>For Darkin, a lot of this project has been about looking past first impressions. I suggest that the perfection of Mapplethorpe\u2019s flower pictures makes them seem a bit static. \u201cI would say, spend another minute with it and you start to see movement,\u201d she counters. \u201cYou see growth patterns in the shape of the flower. You can see life. It connects you to infinity. I can look at those flowers and feel like crying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1cb7385ca96e95bd8ce5840e6926d91b98f581b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1cb7385ca96e95bd8ce5840e6926d91b98f581b/279_372_4410_2646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018His Polaroids are just so electric and they speak so much of that age in life when you\u2019re on the margins\u2019 \u2026 Velvet Petal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018His Polaroids are just so electric and they speak so much of that age in life when you\u2019re on the margins\u2019 \u2026 Velvet Petal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of things we think we understand at first glance but actually it\u2019s when we spend time letting the object communicate with us that the magic happens \u2013 and I think this is true for dance,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at [Mapplethorpe\u2019s] <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/see-rare-robert-mapplethorpe-polaroids-birthday-356240\">Polaroids</a>, you see the way people present themselves, the things they show and the things they hide. You see these little telling details, how people hold their hands. And that feels really close to dance.\u201d</p> <p>The flower photos inspire the climax of Velvet Petal, but Darkin has also looked at Mapplethorpe\u2019s collages and his early portraits. \u201cHis Polaroids are just so electric and they speak so much of that age in life when you\u2019re on the margins, dreaming about being at the centre.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb24e25a87a6dfb0845b2bbea6e1acf9bd5df8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb24e25a87a6dfb0845b2bbea6e1acf9bd5df8a1/0_120_3311_4218/785.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you look at Mapplethorpe\u2019s Polaroids, you see the way people present themselves, the things they show and the things they hide.\u2019\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You see the way people present themselves, the things they show and the things they hide.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Hartley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Darkin spent her own formative years dreaming in her Bristol bedroom \u201cof being a musician and a writer and a dancer\u201d, she says. \u201cSo it feels like a miracle because I\u2019m sort of doing all three through this.\u201d But she\u2019s now less sure about whether being at the centre of things is the best environment for an artist. She ran her own company, Darkin Ensemble, for the best part of a decade, until taking over as artistic director at <a href=\"http://www.scottishdancetheatre.com/\">Scottish Dance Theatre</a> in 2012. She moved from London to Dundee and has experienced a flowering of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s really rich living and working here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a different sensibility, in the best way. It\u2019s cheap for artists to live, everyone walks to work. I remember doing rehearsals in London where dancers have done their two-hour commute just to get to the studio. Here it\u2019s just easy, and there\u2019s a real mentality of sharing. There\u2019s much more collectivism.\u201d</p> <p>Collaboration is almost an obsession for Darkin \u2013 what her publicity material calls an \u201copen-source hothouse approach to dance making\u201d \u2013 meaning that the performers and collaborators shape the work as much as Darkin does. For Velvet Petal she\u2019s worked with Mexican new music ensemble <a href=\"http://www.cepromusic.org/\">Cepromusic</a>, composer <a href=\"http://www.victoribarra.net/\">Victor Ibarra</a>, writer <a href=\"http://www.untitledprojects.co.uk/collaborators/pamela-carter\">Pamela Carter</a> and photographer <a href=\"http://www.untitledprojects.co.uk/collaborators/jack-wrigley\">Jack Wrigley</a>. The collaborative process is a way of sparking constant reinvention. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find new movement that\u2019s fresh and feels like it\u2019s just dawning on us today, and there are no habits and cliches,\u201d says Darkin. It\u2019s her own daily metamorphosis.</p> <ul> <li>Velvet Petal has its world premiere at Teatro de la Danza, Mexico City, on 12 October. Its UK premiere is at Tramway, Glasgow, on 6 May 2017.

  "<p>Softly spoken with assertive undertones, Fadumo Dayib is the first woman ever to run for the presidency of Somalia. As a Somali female campaigner, she was a \u201cshero\u201d of mine before I met her.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Dayib defeating incumbent Hassan Sheikh Mohamud; she isn\u2019t even listed as a candidate in <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201608180542.html\">analysis in regional media</a> and has said herself that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/fadumo-dayib-the-somali-refugee-vying-to-return-home-as-first-female-president\">she has little chance of winning</a>.</p> <p>But Dayib\u2019s courage says something about my home country and how far it\u2019s come. So far, the daily death threats she receives are greatly outweighed by the overwhelming support from fellow Somalis. Dayib believes Somalia is ready for female leaders and the fact that she can run at all is in itself cause for celebration.</p> <p>I ask the most obvious question: \u201cWhy do you want to run for the Somali presidency in such a hostile environment to women?\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/22/woman-for-a-week-salve-international-gender-inequality\">I decided to be a Ugandan woman for a week \u2013 it was the wig that broke me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Living in Finland, she says, gives her many privileges she wouldn\u2019t have had in her own country, and she wants to extend these to women and girls back home. Dayib wasn\u2019t fully literate until the age of 14 but now has several degrees in international public health, including one from Harvard, and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Helsinki. Born in Kenya to Somali parents, as a child Dayib was deported back to Somalia with her family. When civil war broke out shortly thereafter, the family was forced to leave again, ending up in Finland.</p> <p>\u201cAll I want is for my people to reach their full potential and exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she says, adding that by running for the presidency, she is exercising her rights as a Muslim woman. During our discussion, she frequently expresses sadness at the global wave of Islamophobia and the portrayal of Muslim women as voiceless and weak. Were she to be elected, she would want to ensure Somalia practices the correct Islam, \u201cthe religion of peace\u201d.</p> <p>Dayib has seen first hand the violence of extremists al-Shabaab in Somalia, where she worked for six months setting up maternal health clinics before the UN evacuated her over security concerns. </p> <p>However, the everyday hostility she faced was oddly familiar. \u201cIt was very similar to what my Finnish colleagues were telling me, \u2018you came to our country to take our jobs\u2019. Now I was being told by Somali colleagues, \u2018you came back to Somalia to take our jobs\u2019. So where was I to go? I was stuck in the middle. Where did I belong?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls go to school, women are working, people feel happy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From there, Dayib went to Fiji and Liberia, where she helped set up HIV prevention offices and trained health care providers for the UN. Seeing how Liberia had emerged from long-term strife brought Dayib\u2019s thoughts back to her ancestral land. </p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t Somalia be like this? I want to be in an environment where you don\u2019t hear gunfire, girls are going to school, women are working, people feel happy,\u201d she says. Experiencing progress in other African countries gave her hope, but she was under no illusion about the difficult road ahead. The start, however, is always the hardest and that\u2019s what her candidacy is all about: a huge step for Somali women and for Somalia as a whole.</p> <p>Even if Dayib not chosen as next president at the election (<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/27/somalia-delays-its-presidential-election-by-month.html\">currently scheduled for 30 November</a>) she vows to remain in Somalia. Her plan is to set up an independent panel to deal with corruption. She says its her duty to help rebuild the country, and is is adamant that more Somali women should invest back in Somalia whether economically or through their skills as doctors, teachers or social workers. </p> <p>Dayib is under no illusions; she knows Somalia is still very male-dominated, and that when she announced her bid for the presidency, many people struggled to believie it. I was one, but meeting her has extinguished any doubts. Dayib is fierce and her vision for Somalia is clear.</p> <p>\u201cI have a calling and purpose in this world,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must stand and speak up against injustices, my family gets that, it\u2019s not easy but this is who I am. If loving my land means I will die, so be it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dayib and I both know too well that Somali women do not lack strength, intelligence or skills; what they lack is opportunities to reach their goals. We agreed that women and girls in Somalia are in desperate need of safe spaces to access resources, support, education and for protection.</p> <p>Our country faces great challenges. The al-Shabaab rebellion is certainly one of the greatest, but it does not scare Dayib. She believes that by creating a stable environment, and reclaiming the Somali identity, she can address the anger and disillusionment of young Somali men that is fanning the rebellion. </p> <p>In the end, however, corruption might prove a greater obstacle. Dayib places ending corruption at the top of her candidacy\u2019s priorities. She recognises, however, that corruption is also the greatest barrier to her own chances of winning, possibly even greater to her being a woman. I hope this will not be the case. I believe that a president like her could take on the great challenges facing our country.</p> <p>Meeting Dayib reignited my own commitment as a campaigner. It helped me believe again that no battle is too big to fight.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Last year as a result of Labor\u2019s tax transparency legislation, tax office data revealed that one in three private companies paid no tax and one in four public corporate entities operating in Australia paid no tax. In addition, half of the foreign companies operating in Australia had no taxable income while 56 millionaires paid no income tax in 2013, not even the Medicare levy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swan then got specific about BHP and called on the board to provide a full and frank explanation of their role.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a stark contrast between the esteem in which BHP, its executive and the board expect to be held and their actual behaviour. </p> <p>BHP has an experienced Board;<strong> Jack Nasser, Andrew MacKenzie, Malcolm Brinded, Malcolm Broomhead, Pat Davies, Anita Frew, Carolyn Hewson, Ken MacKenzie, Lindsay Maxsted, Wayne Murdy, Dr John Schubert </strong>and<strong> Baroness Shirti Vadera. </strong></p> <p>The Board should provide a full and frank explanation of their role in approving this aggressive transfer pricing scheme. <strong>The board of BHP has not been true to the values they espouse in their charter of corporate responsibility.</strong></p> <p>Corporations are not ends in themselves. The community cannot allow the corporate veil to hide the moral responsibility of those that run them. When companies fail to pay their fair share of tax, revenue must be found elsewhere from businesses and individual taxpayers. </p> <p>The billions of dollars avoided are forever lost to education and infrastructure, which are investments vital to growth and ultimately support the bottom line for business....</p> <p>At a time when this government hacks and slashes at the social safety net in the name of budget repair, it is simply obscene for corporates to walk away with money on this scale.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the respect boards and executives expect and what their actual behaviour merits.

What we have done is make sure Australians pay their fair share of tax, multi-nationals will be paying their fair share of tax.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdaff9e4b05d915e4240b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:38:38.684Z\">4.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Senate question time, senator <strong>Penny Wong</strong> has taken up the attack on attorney general <strong>George Brandis </strong>by asking why he failed to stick up for the solicitor general when he was criticised by senator <strong>Ian MacDonald</strong>.<br></p> <p>Wong said that as the first legal officer, Brandis is obliged to stand up for independent statutory officers like <strong>Justin Gleeson</strong> and Australian Human Rights Commission president, <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/george-brandis-says-he-was-not-aware-of-political-games-attack-on-solicitor-general\">MacDonald accused Gleeson and Triggs of \u201cbeing involved in political games\u201d</a>, and Wong adds MacDonald said Gleeson\u2019s advice \u201chas not been all that hot\u201d and his submission to an parliamentary committee examining the spat with Brandis was \u201cterribly unprofessional\u201d.</p> <p>The attorney general sticks to his guns that he didn\u2019t read or hear MacDonald\u2019s speech and adds that in an interview with Radio National Brandis had said \u201csome very gracious things\u201d about Gleeson.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s see how cordial the attorney general and solicitor general are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/george-brandis-to-front-inquiry-into-veto-over-solicitor-general-advice\">when they appear on Friday before the committee inquiring</a> into Brandis\u2019 veto over referrals for legal advice.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdafb9e4b01d9dd2c90182\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:36:35.317Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/786047715037765633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;It&#39;s nice to be popular Mr Speaker&quot; Tony Abbott reacts to interjections from labor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/QT?src=hash\">#QT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabriellechan\">@gabriellechan</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fe3l4dNc3c\">pic.twitter.com/fe3l4dNc3c</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/786047715037765633\">October 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdaf43e4b01d9dd2c90181\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:36:21.104Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dixer question to Morrison is on Labor not supporting the government\u2019s enterprise tax plan which cuts tax for small moving to large businesses.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fdae40e4b01d9dd2c90180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:34:00.792Z\">4.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor goes to negative gearing.

Here are a few highlights:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I genuinely believe that politics is a noble calling, not a grubby, necessary evil. We are so incredibly fortunate to live in free and fair democracies where we have the right to run for parliament. Jo was an exceptional person, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But she wasn\u2019t unique, and she would have been the first person to say so. There are so many women in our communities who could serve with distinction: we need to help them to get into parliament and to be proud to be political.</p> <p>Of course, this isn\u2019t just about numbers, and it\u2019s not about \u2018having a go\u2019. It\u2019s about results. <strong>Women need power to change things.</strong> You can\u2019t change things if you are a name on a ballot, a quota filled \u2013 you need your seat in parliament. Participation is the start, but power is the end. Jo knew that \u2013 it\u2019s why she worked so hard across party lines to make sure that women were running for seats they could win and it\u2019s why she herself joined a party where she stood a shot of becoming an MP and, one day, a minister, even a prime minister.</p> <p>Jo had courage, but she was also unashamed to have ambition. She wanted to go far, and she wanted to lift up others as she climbed. There\u2019s no stain in aspiring to the highest office in your country. It doesn\u2019t taint the purity of your purpose.</p> <p>Today, I want to say to you loudly and clearly: have the highest of ambitions for yourself, for your purpose. Jo believed Britain could be a force for change in the world, and she fought for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a lot more, in fact I could copy the whole speech over but question time looms. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:08:36.036Z\">at 4.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda136e4b01d9dd2c90178\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:43:50.906Z\">3.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong again calls for Brandis to resign. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ea3ece305fc46d618f60168c4b3185d7e4e0e9c/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Wong has a go at the attorney general, George Brandis, in the Senate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T03:09:14.930Z\">at 4.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fda088e4b01d9dd2c90177\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:33:29.317Z\">3.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Wong\u2019s case:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This matter started when s<strong>enator Brandis</strong> made an amendment to the <strong>legal services directions</strong> in May.</p> <p>The legal services directions set out rules and requirements for the performance of commonwealth legal work.</p> <p>Brandis\u2019s amending direction bars the solicitor general from providing legal opinions or advice to anyone in government without the attorney general\u2019s permission.</p> <p>It prohibits any commonwealth agency or officer from referring a question of law to the solicitor general without the written permission of the attorney general.</p> <p>This is a blatant power grab.</p> <p>It is a bid to control the flow of legal advice from the independent solicitor general to government departments and to senior figures in the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:39:39.101Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9fd9e4b05d915e4240a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:30:03.850Z\">3.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wong is reprising the dispute between the AG and the SG. </p> <p>Wong says Brandis seems to believe that the only legal opinion anyone may need is his opinion. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd9ee7e4b03b22b4fb274f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:27:05.321Z\">3.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, in the Senate, <strong>Penny Wong</strong> is talking <strong>George Brandis</strong>, his greatest hits and his latest dispute with the solicitor general.</p> <p>She says the attorney general should not mislead the parliament and the public.

The Australian Electoral Commission investigated and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/25/voter-investigation-not-about-political-gain-say-indi-campaigners\">then the Australian federal police</a>.</p> <p>The AFP then charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/niece-of-federal-mp-cathy-mcgowan-faces-court-over-alleged-election\">Maggie Ellen McGowan, 27, and Sophie Petrea Fuchsen, 24</a>, with providing false and misleading information, alleging the pair voted in the seat of Indi while living in Melbourne during the 2013 election.</p> <p>The case dragged on and eventually was thrown out in April this year, almost two years after it began. From the story:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Outside court the women\u2019s lawyer, <strong>Rob Stary</strong>, said the case was bound to fail and a terrible waste of resources.</p> <p>Both women were students at the time and the AEC website clearly said students did not need to change their \u201chome address\u201d, he had told the court.</p> <p>\u201cThe original complaint, whoever it was that initiated it, was quite scurrilous,\u201d Stary told reporters.</p> </blockquote> <p>The heart of the issue is around country kids who go to cities to study. As they often have no fixed address, they remain enrolled for voting and other purposes at their family home. But within this loophole, someone found cause to complain. On the numbers, given these are conservative electorates in regional Australia, it seems incredible that the complaint may have originated within the Coalition. If these young people cannot enrol at their home address, it is likely they would remain without a vote. </p> <p>Anyway back to McGowan. She wants the appointment of a minister for young people, to \u201caddress systemic barriers that prevent young people from civic participation, to advocate on their behalf, and help ensure that when policies affecting young people are considered, they do not have an adverse impact\u201d.</p> <p>This is what she said last night.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is confusion about enrolment rules. The involvement of the Australian federal police, Australian Electoral Commission and media in the affairs of 27 young people in my electorate caused the loss of trust in our democratic political institutions. In 2016 approximately 350,000 eligible young people were not enrolled to vote. In the eyes of many young people, these events are even more reason why they feel it makes no sense to engage. No wrongdoing was found after rigorous investigation but these young people are still being scrutinised. We need to stand up for our young people, we need to support them and we need to encourage them to participate in politics. The AEC needs to be supported to engage young people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T02:23:58.236Z\">at 3.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd8fe5e4b01d9dd2c9016b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T01:34:06.969Z\">2.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A summary, before the time gets away.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Singaporean prime minister has addressed the parliament praising the relationship between Australia and Singapore.

We heard a number of speeches last night. Longtime Liberal National party advocate <strong>Warren Entsch</strong> made a heartfelt contribution \u2013 in the end arguing for the plebiscite as the \u201cthe best possible chance\u201d in a decade. You can argue the point on the plebiscite but you cannot argue with Entsch\u2019s intentions. His frustration with both parties is palpable.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has been a long road to get to this point, and I accept that there are those who are not happy with where we have ended up. The plebiscite certainly is not my preferred position either. I put up a cross-party bill back in 2015 in good faith, but it joined the other 17 unsuccessful bills that have gone before it ... This is a battle that has been going on for decades now. And, while I am not challenging the intention of some individuals across politics in championing this cause or those within the marriage equality movement, I am concerned that people are losing sight of the endgame. For them, it is more about the battle than the outcome.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the opposition leader, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>, also spoke:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This plebiscite is not about marriage equality. It is about two things and two things only: <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s</strong> ideology and <strong>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s</strong> job security. Equality for minorities should not be conditional on the approval of majorities. You do not have an opinion poll on rights. That is why they are called rights. Imposing this plebiscite would not just be a waste of money or a failure of leadership; I think it would be a failure of basic decency. It is a glaring contradiction of our national ideal of a fair go for all. </p> </blockquote> <p>We will have more of those speeches throughout the day.</p> <p>On top of that, <strong>the revised legislation for the backpackers tax </strong>will also come to the house, with the attached increases in the passenger movement charge and the backpacker superannuation changes. <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> has already been out this morning.</p> <p>The <strong>Singaporean prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong</strong>, will address the house mid-morning. </p> <p>There is a big cybersecurity report out. <strong>Cameron Stewart</strong> of the Oz <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/threat-of-cyber-terror-closes-in-says-report/news-story/c471a1cb730fee42bf53641929667e36\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Terrorists could be able to break into secure Australian government networks to wreak significant disruption or destruction within three years, according to a major government report on cyber security. </p> </blockquote> <p>I will flesh that out in a minute.</p> <p>Let\u2019s get this baby up and running.

I\u2019ve found my own relationship with the women\u2019s movement so much more straightforward now that I work every day in an area \u2013 with refugee women \u2013 where we can focus on action rather than theory.</p> <p>So if you want to know if you are a feminist, try asking yourselves some questions about what you do \u2013 in your work, in your home, in your everyday life. Do you support women rather than pull them down, do you refuse to judge women \u2013 including yourself \u2013 on the absurd standards of hypersexual femininity, do you speak out against violence against women, do you support victims of male violence, do you listen to women less privileged than you are, and talk to women from different backgrounds and ethnicities about what they want from equality, do you buy dolls for your son or encourage your daughter to be strong and fierce?

That \u201cyou hate men\u201d shtick is really only another way of getting us to focus our discussion on, you guessed it, men. Men and women can be guilty of sexist thinking and behaviour because it forms the fabric of our daily lives. Feminists have, in fact, been at the vanguard of examining what men lose as a result of living in a society that confers them so much power by virtue of their maleness. It is a dominance that as constraining as it is intoxicating.</p> <p>Being a feminist is not believing your particular struggles as a woman are the struggles of all women. All women do not experience life in the same way. And anyway, as black feminists have been saying since the dawn of feminism, that kind of universalising talk only serves to marginalise anyone who differs from the white norm.</p> <p>A feminist is committed to understanding and working with women whose struggles are impacted by a range of social categories from age to sexuality, class to nationality, race to ability. Feminists understand this is difficult work. The payoff is the wonderful women we meet on the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"59efcf23e7d31808e999bc597aee1e656f7bb3d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59efcf23e7d31808e999bc597aee1e656f7bb3d4/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Kate Maltby\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-maltby\">Kate Maltby</a>: You don\u2019t have to be a lesbian, or burn your bra</h2> <p>You\u2019re looking for a quiz, aren\u2019t you?

  "<p>The British economy will be hit by a \u201cpermanent cost\u201d of more than \u00a325bn a year if it decides to withdraw from the EU customs union, a new government adviser on Brexit has said.</p> <p>Raoul Ruparel, who has been hired by David Davis to provide expertise on the process of leaving the EU, said he believed there was no question of the UK staying in Europe\u2019s free-trade bloc. </p> <p>But he admitted that leaving the customs union, inside which EU countries negotiate trade deals collectively and set common external tariffs, would reduce GDP by between 1 and 1.2% in the long term.</p> <p>Ruparel\u2019s comments, made before he was appointed to the senior government position, could provide ammunition for Labour MPs who have challenged the government\u2019s trade secretary, Liam Fox, to prove the benefits of such a move.</p> <p>A group of 53 Labour MPs, led by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, have sent a letter organised by the campaign group Open Britain demanding a \u201crigorous and publicly available cost-benefit analysis\u201d to demonstrate why it would be the best option. <br></p> <p>So far Davis and Theresa May have not said whether they believe Britain ought to withdraw from the union, with some ministers in government warning that the move would cause a huge extra burden on exporters.<br></p> <p>But Fox has signalled that he supports withdrawal to allow the government to negotiate its own free trade deals. </p> <p>Ruparel, who will be heavily involved in the process, made clear that he believed Britain would have to leave the bloc, arguing \u201cthis ship sailed some time ago\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe only real question then is why this is even a \u2018live debate\u2019 in Whitehall?\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is concerning that, at this stage, the UK government seems to still be debating the most basic tenets of Brexit when the time is upon us to be drafting a detailed approach.\u201d</p> <p>In the revealing analysis during the summer, he pointed to in-depth research by his thinktank, Open Europe, about the issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e8e3f95dfc39d14c5793649bad292e93fd2069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e8e3f95dfc39d14c5793649bad292e93fd2069/0_23_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hilary Benn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-remain MP Hilary Benn is one of the frontrunners to chair the Brexit committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we found is that, in the long run (up to 2030), there will be a permanent cost to leaving the customs union,\u201d the analysis said. \u201cThis cost is around 1% to 1.2% GDP.\u201d</p> <p>The additional costs were linked to the administrative burdens that would result from something known as \u201crules of origin\u201d, under which the UK would have to prove that goods being exported into Europe were produced locally. </p> <p>\u201cBut this cost is clearly not prohibitively high,\u201d he said, adding that Norway and Switzerland were outside the bloc but had significant levels of trade with the EU. Ruparel said the alternatives were \u201cless palatable\u201d.</p> <p>The Turkish model of being inside the customs union but outside the single market would allow immigration restrictions but \u201cwould mean the UK could not negotiate its own free trade deals and would have to accept whatever the EU agrees to with other parties,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Adopting a different Norway-like model in which Britain was in the customs union but also had a free trade deal would be hardly different to remaining in the EU. \u201cThe former would be economically disruptive and the latter would be politically explosive,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>The intervention could alarm senior figures inside the Treasury, with ministers telling the Guardian that the reality of leaving the bloc will be significant costs for business that had to be addressed.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the EU said the comments were not made on behalf of the government, saying: \u201cThis article was written before Mr Ruparel joined the department and reflects his work at Open Europe.\u201d<br></p> <p>A Labour MP, Emma Reynolds, said Ruparel\u2019s comments made it more urgent for the prime minister to outline the direction that Britain would take. \u201cThe government needs to level with the British people that there are big trade-offs in this process and it is not going to be an easy thing to achieve,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Prof Jim Rollo, deputy director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, added: \u201c\u00a325bn is not a small amount. The main advantage of leaving the customs union is that we can make our own trade deals around the world but there is no guarantee that these will be any better than those negotiated by the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe other 27 countries have a combined GDP that is almost six times that of the UK\u2019s so they are offering other countries access to a much larger market and have more negotiating clout.\u201d<br></p> <p>The letter from Labour MPs, including the former home secretary Alan Johnson and former leadership candidate Liz Kendall, said they would have to conclude Fox was being \u201cdisingenuous about hypothetical future trade benefits and in denial about the real cost\u201d unless he could produce evidence of the benefits of such an exit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb09f4a8aba389654c88949ec26a221aeaae004c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb09f4a8aba389654c88949ec26a221aeaae004c/2591_203_2109_1265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Emma Reynolds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Emma Reynolds called for greater clarity from the prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, will write to Davis on Wednesday with a list of 170 questions that they say remain unanswered by the government on Brexit \u2013 one for each day until article 50 is triggered in late March.</p> <p>There are tensions within government departments about whether May will push for a hard Brexit in which immigration controls will be heavily prioritised over economic links.<br></p> <p>Reports suggested that government was still using a warning of a \u00a366bn a year cost in tax revenues if Britain leaves the single market, despite the figure being based on a Treasury forecast from April.

Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party has laid down a motion calling for MPs to be able to scrutinise Brexit plans before article 50 is triggered in March.</p> <p>The prime minister has joined Davis, the chancellor Philip Hammond and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to add a sentence calling for parliament to respect the decision of the 23 June vote in favour of Brexit. It also says that politicians must not \u201cundermine the negotiating position of the government\u201d.</p> <p>A Downing Street aide said: \u201cThe government is focused on delivering on Brexit. We have always been clear that while we should do nothing to undermine our negotiating position, parliament has an important role to playand this motion reflects that.\u201d<br></p> <p>In a plan to be officially announced on Wednesday, 21 MPs will sit on the new cross-party Brexit select committee. The committee will be almost double the size of almost every other Commons select committee following a deal struck between Conservative and Labour whips.</p> <p>Some senior MPs have claimed that the committee has been made deliberately large <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/mps-criticise-ridiculously-large-brexit-select-committee\">so that it is less effective at scrutinising the government\u2019s strategy</a> and less able to reach a consensus.</p>",
