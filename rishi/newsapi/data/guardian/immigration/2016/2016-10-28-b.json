  "<p>The Australian newspaper has run a curious item in recent times headlined \u201cMeanwhile, in Victoria\u201d. It contains stories about everyday state issues, but it also runs quirky items the paper thinks sets Victoria apart as somewhat of an oddity.<br></p> <p>In many ways, Victoria <em>is </em>an oddity. Daniel Andrews\u2019 government is unashamedly leftwing at a time when Australians are more familiar with Labor governments run by the party\u2019s right. We are used to a virtual Labor unity ticket with conservative governments about what economic responsibility means. And we have come to expect Labor to take modest steps on social issues that don\u2019t push the boundaries too far \u2013 it would have been courageous for Labor to support same-sex marriage a decade ago; it is not now. </p> <p>The Andrews government is in trouble over its poor handling of the never-ending Country Fire Authority dispute, and there are constant challenges over infrastructure priorities and growing worries about crime. But on social issues, its progress has been spectacular, and so far it appears not in the least wobbly in the face of a predictable backlash. </p> <p>Interest groups that have lobbied for years on gender and LGBTI issues in particular are finding a receptive government determined to make big leaps, to change the culture in fundamental ways.</p> <p>Will it succeed? Perhaps to an extent, but you can\u2019t accuse it of not trying. Is the government ahead of public opinion? Most certainly in some areas, particularly for people living outside the inner city for whom heteronormativity is not discussed routinely around the dinner table. No doubt there will be missteps and over-reaches \u2013 and too much trendy jargon \u2013 but you can\u2019t accuse it of complacency. </p> <p>The government\u2019s latest initiative is the <a href=\"http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/health/Pages/respectrel.aspprogram\">Resilience, Rights and Respectful Relationships</a> program that will be mandatory for all school levels in government and Catholic schools from next year. Independent schools can use it if they wish. </p> <p>That the government scrapped religious instruction in state schools in favour of a respectful relationship curriculum took some chutzpah. The program was recommended by Victoria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/royal-commission-into-family-violence\">royal commission into family violence</a>, which itself was a bold inquiry, followed up by considerable government funding. </p> <p>Respectful relationship classes in schools are having a moment. At the Coag family violence summit on Friday, the premiers of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania all spoke about programs under way or being implemented. Yet they come nowhere close to Victoria\u2019s almost $22m commitment over two years. In Victoria, the program is mandatory, comprehensive and firmly feminist in approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/i-hadnt-realised-how-absolutely-pervasive-family-violence-is-royal-commissioner\">'I hadn't realised how absolutely pervasive family violence is': royal commissioner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government says Respectful Relationships \u201cis about tackling family violence\u201d \u2013 it is stated as its primary purpose. That is a shame because, while there is lots of evidence that attitudes towards women are linked to intimate-partner violence, there is lots of evidence, too, indicating that other factors are also crucial, especially in advanced countries such as Australia. And perhaps it might have been useful to focus on preventing violence generally instead of violence against women. But those debates can be had again and again, and don\u2019t diminish the program\u2019s strengths.</p> <p>The family violence prevention group, <a href=\"http://www.ourwatch.org.au/\">Our Watch</a>, is an advocate for respectful relationship programs in schools as one way to reduce domestic violence and it has found its champion in the Victorian government. Our Watch has acknowledged that this approach is an experiment. Few countries have taken such a generational approach, to put together a program to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/19/australians-are-being-told-that-gender-inequality-is-the-root-cause-of-domestic-violence-but-is-it\">transform cultural attitudes towards women</a> specifically to reduce violence against women.</p> <p>Is it worth a go? Of course. We can\u2019t just keep responding to family violence with more laws, police powers and refuges, as important as they are. We need a big shift, a cultural breakthrough, to stop men beating up their wives and partners \u2013 and killing them in alarming numbers (and of course that applies to men being assaulted by their partners or ex-partners).</p> <p>And not only do we want them to stop happening; we want them to become culturally unthinkable. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448308/\">There is evidence</a> that well-designed school programs can reduce relationship violence for young people, who are more likely to be victims of violence than older people. </p> <p>There is worrying research, too, suggesting that many young people are holding on to antiquated ideas. One 2014 study found that a quarter of young people still believe that women who often say no to sex really mean yes. Victim blaming \u2013 maybe the woman provoked the violence \u2013 is still too common, and somehow, these views have to change.</p> <p>The release of the curriculum has led to some headlines in Victoria, of course, as superficial as they are predictable. The Herald Sun\u2019s resident warrior against social justice warriors, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/rita-panahi/rita-panahi-on-safe-schools-and-gender-diversity-programs-in-schools/news-story/4d3d02c39f2d7a7f015e3c6c3796a567\">Rita Panahi, wrote that it was</a> the \u201ctype of ideologically driven sloppy thinking that belongs in a socialist alliance get-together, not in schools\u201d.</p> <p>You can pluck out a line or two that might make it look so. But look deeper. It\u2019s much more than a program to reduce violence against women, as vital as that is. It just might help our kids \u2013 boys and girls \u2013 to learn critical life skills. To be more resilient in the face of setbacks, protect themselves and others from harm, cope with challenges of modern life and respect each other\u2019s differences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/i-wrote-the-safe-schools-lgbti-program-tony-abbott-its-vital-and-it-changes-lives\">I wrote the Safe Schools program Tony Abbott. It's vital and it changes lives | Chris Bush</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children in early primary school will talk about their emotions, learn relaxation techniques to cope with stress, about how to talk to themselves positively when they get angry or frustrated. They will start to learn about problem solving and when to ask for help if they need it.</p> <p>And they begin to think about gender stereotypes that are already embedded by the time they reach school. This is as relevant for boys as it is for girls. The materials for older students point out that young men experience violence at higher rates than young women, and that boys are especially vulnerable to being teased or bullied if they are not typically \u201cmale\u201d, especially if they are gay or transgender.</p> <p>For the little kids, it\u2019s about what\u2019s your favourite ice cream, what\u2019s your favourite playground game, or your favourite quiet time activity. Can boys and girls like different things? The same thing? It even throws in the old chestnut \u2013 is it OK for a boy to like pink and a girl to like blue? Why?</p> <p>In older year levels, the program introduces more complex ideas. By year 11 and 12, it\u2019s full on. How to cope with the stresses of study and exams, how to set goals, positive psychology, relaxation techniques, how to handle conflict in relationships, alcohol abuse, looking out for his each other\u2019s safety at parties, and what the law says on sexual consent and sexting. </p> <p>None of this should be controversial. It can\u2019t be a bad thing for young adults to think about how invisible LGBTI people can feel if our language, culture and discussions assume that the only \u201cnormal\u201d thing is to be heterosexual. Or to think about why the word \u201cgirl\u201d is often used as an insult, or why women are under-represented in our parliaments and earn on average 17% less for doing the same work. And most importantly, how these things might be challenged.</p> <p>We have been talking about these things for so long, and while much has changed for women \u2013 and men \u2013 much has not. Gender stereotypes and expectations, reinforced by the media and advertising, are often limiting even though we have had discrimination laws in place for a generation.</p> <p>We are living through a time of big social change, an impatient push by women, the LGBTI community and minority cultures for significant breakthroughs. It will take determined effort but despite pockets of resistance and the messiness of it all, many citizens are ready for it.</p> <p>It will be fascinating to see if this program shifts attitudes and reduces violence. We will only be able to tell if it persists for many years beyond the next election, and that is not assured \u2013 the Liberal opposition is muttering about \u201cbrainwash(ing) our children with propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the government steams on, at least so far. Its relationship program is just one item on its social agenda. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/15/australia-daniel-andrews-says-he-wont-take-advice-from-bigots-at-safe-schools-launch\">Andrews scoffed at the national fuss</a> over the Safe Schools program that aims to ensure a safe environment for LGBTI students and, again, get students thinking about stereotypes and discrimination.</p> <p>It is going ahead with Safe Schools without the changes the federal government insisted on, with Andrews saying he would get his policy advice from experts \u201cnot bigots\u201d. Victoria is also proposing to allow <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/gender-diverse-win-right-to-new-birth-certificates-20160817-gquvs8.html\">transgender people to change their birth certificates</a> without having to undergo reassignment surgery, an idea proving challenging, especially to some feminists.</p> <p>Before the end of the year, it will launch another first: a <a href=\"http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/gender-equality-strategy-to-be-launched-as-part-of-victoria-against-violence/\">statewide gender equality strategy</a>. This has been in preparation for months, with women\u2019s minister Fiona Richardson travelling around the state consulting more than 1,000 Victorians, including businesses, councils, community groups, indigenous organisations, the media, about how to address gender inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/03/rosie-batty-by-teaching-children-we-can-change-the-culture-of-violence-against-women\">Rosie Batty: by teaching children, we can change the culture of violence against women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strategy will be launched as part of Victoria\u2019s 16 Days of Activism against family violence, a United Nations initiative. No other state has taken this up with such gusto. Mostly it\u2019s symbolic \u2013 last year, the parliament and other public buildings were lit up orange for 16 days as a public stand against violence against women.</p> <p>Wherever Victorians look, they cannot miss what\u2019s going on. It can be critiqued, of course. There are lines here and there in the various strategies that are so right-on they can make you cringe. You can argue that a focus on identity politics takes effort away from persistent economic disadvantage in some communities. And you can insist that governments should tread warily in trying to push through cultural change.</p> <p>Yet at a time when same-sex marriage has been delayed by awful politics in Canberra and when the domestic violence sector worries about momentum being lost as priorities shift and the media loses interest, the Victorian government is not playing it safe. Whatever is happening nationally and in other states, meanwhile in Victoria, it\u2019s all action.</p>",

When I played at Southampton people there showed me them and I saw some in the supermarket here \u2013 it was strange.\u201d</p> <p>Sub-equatorial Fray Bentos, surrounded by fertile pampas and abundant palm trees, is said to retain the feel of a place belonging in a Graham Greene novel. Nestling on the border with Argentina, it is the type of town where humid evenings unfold against a soundtrack of cicadas and the pace of life is deceptively languid.</p> <p>Teesside\u2019s lack of similar exoticism must have come as quite a culture shock yet Ram\u00edrez, much as he misses idyllic days spent fishing from the banks of the Uruguay river, explains he would be happy to see his nine-month-old daughter grow up in his new habitat.</p> <p>\u201cI like England, the quality of life and the security,\u201d he says, gesturing at the window and its view of the tranquil, undulating parkland surrounding Middlesbrough\u2019s attractive training ground near Darlington. \u201cYou have to adapt but I like it here.</p> <p>\u201cBeing at the Boro is like being part of a family; you feel at home and that\u2019s very important. When I signed in the summer [a long-term, free transfer deal following last January\u2019s loan from Southampton] I had a feeling I was in the right place. I\u2019m enjoying it here.\u201d</p> <p>His neighbours in a pretty, quiet County Durham village have become accustomed to seeing smoke rising from the Ram\u00edrez family\u2019s back garden in all weathers. \u201cSometimes we go to Newcastle to eat out but, mostly, I like to cook at home,\u201d says the 25-year-old in impressively fluent English. \u201cI like to have barbecues.\u201d But surely not at this time of year? He appears amused. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about the weather.

It\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve learned a lot from him.</p> <p>\u201cLuis and I drink Mate [South American tea] together every day before and after training. He\u2019s a very nice guy \u2013 he\u2019s actually a quiet person. The Uruguay players have group chats on WhatsApp so we\u2019re always in touch, always congratulating him when he scores a goal in Spain \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of times.</p> <p>\u201cBut Uruguay is not just Su\u00e1rez, it\u2019s Cavani, God\u00edn, Gim\u00e9nez, big players who play for big teams.

We are always very tired, very afraid.\u201d<br></p> <p>Kim says she stopped eating, lost significant amounts of weight, and couldn\u2019t sleep for the stress. \u201cI ended up crying, many, many times.</p> <p>\u201cI expected Australians to be respectful, respecting women and workers, but these are Korean people doing this, not Australians. They are exploiting other Koreans because they know they can, and there is no way we can complain.\u201d</p> <h2>The myth of \u2018the going rate\u2019</h2> <p>Haln says Korean workers were particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of a number of factors, particularly:</p> <ul> <li>Language \u2013 many Korean workers, when they arrive in Australia, don\u2019t speak strong English and so would struggle to find work outside the Korean community. If they upset one employer in the close-knit Korean community they fear being blacklisted by all employees as troublemakers.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cultural \u2013 there is not a culture of worker organisation in Korea. Unions in the Republic of Korea are seen as political, radical and anti-government, so few workers arrive in Australia with a history or connection with organised labour.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Naivety \u2013 many who arrive are unaware \u2013 and are kept unaware by the exploitative nature of their employment \u2013 of Australia\u2019s legal protections for workers, award rates or conditions, and other legal employer obligations, such as safety equipment.<br></li> </ul> <p>There are now in Australia at any time about 1 million people on temporary residence visas with rights to work \u2013 mainly working holiday makers, 457 visa holders, students and New Zealanders.</p> <p>According to census figures, there are more than 75,000 Koreans living in Australia, more than half of those in Sydney. Fewer than 10% speak English at home.<br></p> <p>The office of the fair work ombudsman says it has uncovered a string of cases involving exploitation of Korean workers over the past two years, dominated by \u201cpersistent underpayment\u201d of workers.</p> <p>Several migrant employers have told the ombudsman they undercut minimum wage rates because they paid agoing rate for overseas workers.</p> <p>The ombudsman, Natalie James, says the so-called \u201cgoing rate\u201d for overseas workers of any nationality is a myth that must be dispelled.<br></p> <p>James says it is illegal for employers to arbitrarily set and pay low, flat rates of pay, and that minimum wage rates apply to everyone in Australia \u2013 including visa holders \u2013 and are not negotiable.<br></p> <p>Last year the operator of a Korean restaurant in Sydney told the fair work ombudsman he advertised for staff for as little as $12 an hour because he feared retribution from competitors if he offered the award rate.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40cbb6ddfb1bc5d9d4abdb0dcd1edc831d4e3a43\"> <img

here to understand and apply Australian laws,\u201d James says.<br></p> <p>In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2015/7-eleven-revealed/\">7-Eleven scandal</a> \u2013 where franchisees were discovered to be paying as little as $5 an hour to workers \u2013 the minister for employment, Michaelia Cash, announced the establishment of a migrant workers taskforce, charged with weeding out and reforming worker exploitation in the Australian economy.<br></p> <p>\u201cA number of recent high-profile cases where vulnerable migrant workers have been underpaid and exploited at work have exposed unacceptable gaps in the system,\u201d Cash said.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile the government acknowledges that the majority of employers do the right thing by their employees, we will not

  "<p>Touch, speed, aggression, all tempered by pitch-perfect judgment of the briefest moments have defined some of the greatest drivers in Formula One but the latter, perhaps more so than in any sport, must sometimes ride pillion to blind luck. Both have been key factors in determining how the world championship title fight has evolved this season and one or the other will yet be key here in Mexico.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, who was faster than Rosberg in both practices on Friday even if Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel proved quickest in the second outing, must execute his role to perfection to keep his title hopes alive and should the dice roll for him his challenge to win a fourth championship might be in his hands again. If fate is fickle, however, it could be over.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/28/f1-lewis-hamilton-world-title-nico-rosberg-mexican-grand-prix\">Lewis Hamilton admits wresting world title from Nico Rosberg grip is tall order</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His battle with Nico Rosberg can still go to the wire \u2013 three races\u2019 time in Abu Dhabi. The German leads by 26 points, and even Mercedes one-twos in Hamilton\u2019s favour would still secure his first championship. But that would seem too straightforward an ending to a season during which the advantage between them has ebbed and flowed to dramatic effect and on Sunday the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez might yet host a further twist in this tale.</p> <p>If Rosberg wins here and Hamilton fails to finish or score a point, the title will belong to the German. If Hamilton wins and Rosberg endures a DNF, the gap between them will be down to one point. Neither Mercedes driver thus far has been able to lay claim to truly be the heir apparent. Rosberg opened with four wins and an advantage of 43 points but Hamilton came back at him with a run of six from seven and was 19 points to the better after the German Grand Prix. He did not win again, however, until the last round in Austin, with Rosberg\u2019s advantage regained through four victories.</p> <p>What has made these shifts so compelling and caused so much debate is that they have not been down solely to one driver simply gaining the upper hand on track. Without doubt fortune has not been kind to Hamilton. His early season deficit was prompted by ERS failures in qualifying for China and Russia, then he lost practice time in Singapore with a hydraulic issue, all setbacks that would be dwarfed by having his engine blow up while leading in Malaysia \u2013 an event that was as unlikely for the Mercedes hybrid power unit as it was crushing to the driver.</p> <p>The early-season failures were compounded by a penalty-enforced start at the back in Spa, while the only major mechanical issue Rosberg has endured was a gearbox problem at the British Grand Prix that caused him to finish third rather than second. After Malaysia Hamilton was vocal in his frustration that whenever a Mercedes power unit had an issue it was the one on his No44 car. He has a point; of the eight Mercedes-powered cars on the grid only his has needed replacements engendering&#xa0;penalties.</p> <p>But there have also been uncharacteristic problems in areas over which he does exercise control. An error in qualifying cost him Baku but poor starts are the real issue: five, in Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Italy and Japan. The change this season to only one clutch with the teams unable to change its settings once the car has left the garage, is one with which Hamilton has struggled and it has cost him.</p> <p>He must not let it happen again this weekend but how it plays out beyond that is made all the more compelling by taking place at the unique challenge of the Mexican Grand Prix. The daunting high-speed banking of the Peraltada may have been neutered but in almost every other way this track is still a ferocious test of car and driver.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/26/mexican-grand-prix-fans-passion-foundation-f1-future\">Mexican Grand Prix fans and passion lay foundations for long F1 future | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The high altitude and thinner air of Mexico City reduces aero effects. The turbo-chargers work harder to deliver the same level of power but with the drag reduced top speeds are high and may well better the upper limits of the current generations of cars \u2013 it will be at least around 227mph before braking into turn one. Equally, however, there is less downforce, to deal with a track that requires grip through the second half and particularly through the stadium section. The power unit is under pressure then, as are the brakes which are difficult to cool and the tyres face extra work from the lack of downforce and low grip levels. As engineering tests go, Mexico poses stern questions and having raced here only once before in the modern era, it remains to a certain extent an unknown quantity \u2013 if the dice are to roll, a DNF here for either contender would be more likely than Brazil.</p> <p>The tight corners, allied to lower downforce and higher top speeds, will demand the maximum from the drivers, with intense pressure on both this may well prove to be both a test of nerve and of will. Crucially, however, here Rosberg has an advantage. Hamilton cannot afford a retirement and should the German squeeze him and risk contact he will have to yield, not something the world champion will take to easily.</p> <p>There were questions about Hamilton\u2019s focus in the season-closing races after he had the title secured in 2015, all of which Rosberg won, beginning in Mexico but this year, with the title race in the balance, luck and judgment may play their part, but there will be no questioning the attention of either driver.</p>",
  "<p>The final chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/calais-france-rebukes-britain-over-abandoned-refugee-children\">Calais debacle </a>promises to be as depressing as those that preceded it. With around 1,500 teenage refugees still held in shipping containers on the smouldering site waiting for a decision on their future, French and British officials have embarked on a last-minute flurry of undignified diplomatic buck-passing over who should be responsible for them.</p> <p>For the past 18 months both governments have behaved appallingly in their failure to address the crisis; this disorganised denouement is merely the predictable continuation of the chaos that went before.</p> <p>The refusal of both governments to resolve what was (from a global refugee crisis perspective) a very small problem was startling. In the past year <a href=\"http://http//ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:First_time_asylum_applicants,_Q2_2015_%E2%80%93_Q2_2016.png\">1.4m asylum applications </a>have been made in Europe; 641,000 of them in Germany, 142,000 of them in Sweden. The scale of the Calais site should have been easily manageable.</p> <p>Instead the crisis was ignored and the camp became a uniquely horrific spot. With no proper water supplies, sewage systems or electricity and only second-hand tents for shelter, it felt worse than the worst slums of Mumbai, and yet it was overlooked by comfortable suburban houses, just half a kilometre from the town\u2019s cheerful zinc-countered bistros.</p> <p>Conditions were worse than in camps set up in disaster and war zones because of the absence of any mainstream charity or official French involvement in providing food or shelter for its 10,000-plus inhabitants. A network of grassroots charities stepped in to try to help; some were brilliant, some much less so. It was disturbing to see responsibility for providing food and shelter for thousands fall on the shoulders of volunteers.</p> <p>Refugees could not conceal their dismay when they arrived. The smell of burning plastic and raw sewage was overpowering. In the summer there were piles of fly-ridden, dead rats on the pathways. In the winter, families slept in wooden shacks that let in the rain. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/calais-france-rebukes-britain-over-abandoned-refugee-children\">Calais: France bows to pressure on abandoned refugee children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most striking was the large number of lone child refugees, dispatched by their parents to seek safety in Europe. British tabloids have raged with scepticism about the ages of the children and the motivations of their parents, but over the course of numerous trips over the past year I met dozens of children aged between 8 and 16, who had spent months living in total squalor, hoping to join relatives in the UK.</p> <p>Volunteers collected accounts of tear-gassing of children and documented cases of children hit by rubber bullets shot by riot police. But the bigger scandal was that hundreds of children were left to live in a water-logged field, some for over a year, with no help from the French or British governments.</p> <p>While both countries were languidly debating who should take responsibility, vulnerable asylum-seekers with family in the UK were taking matters into their own hands, and trying to get to Britain illegally; they risked their lives most nights trying to hurl themselves on to lorries, hiding in refrigerated containers \u2013 usually unsuccessfully, sometimes with fatal consequences.</p> <p>There is no memorial for the 14 refugees who died this year except the understated list kept by the local prefect\u2019s office \u2013 the file includes <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/15/very-scared-death-teenage-stowaway\">Raheemullah Oryakhel</a>, the 14-year-old from Afghanistan who died when he fell from a moving lorry and was hit by a car (the driver did not stop). It lists a \u201cmigrant whose sex could not be identified, found drowned in the port of Calais\u201d, an \u201cAfghan migrant 22 years, hit by an HGV on the A16\u201d, and an \u201c18-year-old female Eritrean found dead on the ring road near junction 47\u201d.<br></p> <p>Most of these deaths went unreported. When the Guardian wrote about Raheemullah\u2019s death, the coverage attracted some no longer surprising vitriol, with tweets commenting \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cOne less to worry about\u201d. One of the most dispiriting aspects of writing about the refugee crisis has been this exposure to the high-levels of public hostility to a group of people who have mostly spent the last year fleeing violence.</p> <p>While it is good that the British government has begun to accept some responsibility, the disparity in the numbers housed by the French (6,000), and the 274 children given shelter by the UK speaks for itself. The president of the local regional council, Xavier Bertrand, joined Bernard Cazeneuve, France\u2019s home office minister, in criticising the British response, describing it as insufficient. </p> <p>As work progresses swiftly on the \u00a31.9m UK and French co-funded one-kilometre-long wall, designed to stop a new Calais camp from forming, it would be nice to think that homes could be found for the remaining refugee children with equal speed and efficiency.</p>",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency.

This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU.

Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member.

It is consistent not only with her last conference speech as home secretary but with the whole of her tenure at the Home Office, in a \u201ctradition\u201d that dates back to restrictions on migration in the 1930s (and postwar), and the insistence then that those who were allowed entry \u2013 children and adults \u2013 should not draw on the public purse.</p> <p>Then, as now, many non-politicians have volunteered to welcome into their homes migrant children and families in flight from Syria and beyond; then as now the Home Office throws up bureaucratic barriers and, through lack of financial support, prevents local authorities from stepping up at a time when children\u2019s services across the country are being starved of funds. So the Home Office has \u201cno jurisdiction to operate on French territory\u201d?</p> <p>Jolly good then. Grandiose talk of Britain\u2019s legacy of offering refuge is just that, grandiose talk empty of meaning. Empathy? Sympathy? UN and EU treaties and covenants signed but in practice not acted upon.

Hundreds of children sleeping on the ground, or in unheated warehouses or other inappropriate buildings, unregistered through no fault of their own, nowhere to go and now being arrested.</p> <p>This is simply intolerable. If we ever want to talk about British values again, we must intervene immediately. It is unacceptable to say that this is a French problem \u2013 we could take every single one of these children right now under the Dubs amendment, and if the home secretary and a contingent of Home Office staff were to get on a train tomorrow morning, and go there, they could make this happen.</p> <p>The events of the past few days constitute a dreadful stain on the reputation of this country and that of France, and will go down in history as evidence of our collective lack of humanity. It is surely now a matter of criminal negligence that, despite all the detailed information and warnings over so many months, our Home Office has left taking any action until the absolute last minute, and then failed so badly to ensure the most basic human rights of so many of these children.<br><strong>Dr Felicity Laurence</strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 My family and I fled my home nation of Kurdistan in 1999 due to the civil war. My father, like many other Kurds, sought a better life in Europe for his family as a result of the oppression faced from Saddam\u2019s regime.

I wanted to share my story of coming to Britain, and of being here for reasons other than stealing your jobs or your benefits.</p> <p>I was four when I came to Europe. First we settled in Holland and eventually we moved to the UK. As a child refugee life wasn\u2019t always easy as some may have you believe. At school I struggled with the language, growing up in poverty, and facing racism. However, we integrated, learned the language and adapted to become part of British society. My siblings and I all studied Stem subjects at top universities across the UK. I\u2019m currently a chemical engineering undergraduate at the University&#xa0;of Leeds.</p> <p>We are not a lone example of \u201cforeigners\u201d wanting to integrate into the UK society.

The list goes on and on of those who came to Britain and made a difference.</p> <p>No matter what, I\u2019m extremely thankful for what the UK has given me. My family and I have had multiple chances to move abroad and make a lucrative living. We never accepted those offers because Britain is now our home. The people who have welcomed and accepted us have been far greater in number than those who haven\u2019t. We want to be here and help Britain grow, pay back the debt that we feel we owe the UK, and work towards making Britain great, no matter how much negativity a minority give us.</p> <p>If we weren\u2019t forced out of our homes in Kurdistan, we wouldn\u2019t have moved. However, I do want to make it clear that my family, like many others, didn\u2019t come here to sponge off British society. We came here to be part of your society. So thank you, Gary, for showing compassion for those who need it. <br><strong>Mohammed Ali</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 Given how many nice, white, middle-class English parents lie about their religious beliefs or where they really live in order to get their children into their preferred school (\u201cWell, we don\u2019t like it but you have to do the best for your children, don\u2019t you?\u201d) you would think they would show more sympathy if \u2013 and I stress if \u2013 a desperate 19-year-old claims to be 17 in order to get out of a hell hole. <br><strong>Rosemary Chamberlin</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>In 1948 a report blamed cold mothers who failed to bond with their children for the autism in their offspring.

In the span of less than a lifetime, I have gone from being a \u201crefrigerator mother\u201d to \u201csuper parent\u201d as we have finally been given the tools to break through the ice surrounding what was once described as our \u201cfrosty\u201d children.</p> <p>I remember our first speech and language therapy session with our first autistic child. It was apparent that the therapy was not for my child directly but a way of teaching me to be his therapist on a daily basis. As in this study, this has in effect given me the ability to engage my autistic children. This is slowly allowing our children to enter our world and warm our hearts. I hope the results of the study not only encourage further participation in this practice, but also an appreciation for the parents of autistic children out there.

  "<p>\u201cCareful of the curtains, they must be full of scabies by now,\u201d the nurse said. I smiled and perched on the edge of the bench as far away as I could. It was 10.30am in the Calais refugee camp and our Refugee Support First Aid and Care Team caravan was open for business. The team for the day was a GP from Leeds, a junior doctor, a trainee nurse and four medical students.</p> <p>The first patient came in with his friend and the translators, Mustafa and Ahmed. I asked how I could help and then sat silently as Mustafa and my patient had a long conversation, often laughing, sometimes an indignant shake of the head and once a broad smile at me. When it seemed to be dying down I looked expectantly at Mustafa: \u201cHe\u2019s got jungle lung.\u201d</p> <p>The most common problems we encountered were this range of coughs and colds and lung irritation caused by smoke and tear gas. <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Scabies/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">Scabies</a> also featured high on the list, as did diarrhoea. We saw all manner of minor traumas: burns from the endless fires in camp; bruising; stab-wounds and broken bones from fights either between residents of the camp, or between residents and the CRS, the French riot police. Such ailments formed the backdrop to the living conditions and politics there, all underpinned by endless mental health problems. Mental health care in the camp was largely non-existent, despite the miseries that almost every member of the camp described, from separation to starvation to rape. We had nothing to offer, not even a quiet room to talk. Analgesia and wound dressings were the best we could do.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/28/where-next-the-last-days-of-the-calais-refugee-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k29\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2848995\"            data-video-name=\"Where next?

The last days of the Calais refugee camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We met a man who was too badly beaten to move \u2013 he had truncheon-shaped bruises covered his back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More serious conditions, particularly pneumonia and tuberculosis, sat alongside those less severe complaints, and many people couldn\u2019t make it to the caravans, either because they were too injured or too ill. Some didn\u2019t want to because they were scared of being detained. We saw one patient who was bright yellow from hepatitis A, a disease that spreads quickly in the cramped and unhygienic conditions. A case of appendicitis required a volunteer to drive the patient to the Calais hospital because the ambulance wouldn\u2019t come, and, later that day we met a man who was too badly beaten to move \u2013 truncheon-shaped bruises covered his back. These are all potentially life-threatening conditions when basic provisions such as drips or antibiotics aren\u2019t available.</p> <p>One day someone came running over to us shouting that they needed a doctor \u2013 there had been a fight. Near the edge of the camp a group of CRS officers were standing around two men who sat slumped against each other, covered in blood. At first the CRS refused to let us through, but relented when the doctor showed his NHS badge. One of the men was holding his side, blood seeping between his fingers, and the other was vomiting between his legs while his kaftan saturated with blood. A knife fight had ended with each making punctures in the other. By the time we arrived a non-medical volunteer was putting pressure on the stab wound in the first man\u2019s back, and she insisted that all the blood on the other\u2019s kaftan was from this man. She said the vomiting man was drunk and had started the fight.</p> <p>As she spoke, the latter got up and staggered off. Forgetting our training, we allowed him to leave and focused on the man in front of us. After a few minutes, the fire service \u2013 apparently the only paramedics who will come to a trauma call in the camp \u2013 arrived and walked straight past us. We turned to find the vomiting man we had dismissed had staggered around the corner and collapsed from blood loss. His blood pressure was dropping and he was taken into the mock ambulance, the sicker of the two by far.</p> <p>Among the tide of minor ailments, it was easy to imagine missing serious pathology, particularly when some of the basic tools for assessing a patient, such as thermometers and blood pressure machines, are faulty or unavailable. And even though there was good done \u2013 the patient sent with suspected appendicitis was taken for surgery the same evening \u2013 it seemed possible that we were doing more harm than good. The junior doctor admitted to having been almost unable to return after the first day, terrified that, with a paucity of resources and experience, she might give false reassurance to a sick patient who then wouldn\u2019t seek proper care. Equally, the presence of NGOs like ours may have ensured that medical catastrophe was sufficiently averted that the French government wasn\u2019t shamed into action; our presence facilitating the French government\u2019s absence.</p> <p>The French government had insisted <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/en/article/france-update-calais-jungle-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> leave in spring of this year, maintaining that the existing French provision was sufficient. But that provision lasted just a few weeks before it had to be expanded, and MSF was reinstated. In a country that has an average doctor to population ratio of 1:300, the camp\u2019s residents were living with a ratio of 1:4,000, a situation exacerbated by the unhygienic conditions.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, admitted that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-to-relocate-refugees-and-migrants-within-weeks-in-bid-to-close-calais-jungle-camp-a7327546.html\" title=\"\">conditions in the camp were unacceptable</a>, while at the same time refusing either to improve them or to afford it the \u201crefugee camp\u201d status that would enable aid agencies to operate there fully. The head of MSF UK said the conditions in Calais were the <a href=\"http://www.msf.org.uk/france-msf-s-work-in-calais-and-dunkirk-camps\" title=\"\">worst she had seen</a> in her 20 years of humanitarian work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/calais-camp-minors-children-abandoned-uk-france-human-rights\">Calais minors lured from camp then abandoned by authorities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Calais camp didn\u2019t sit in the middle of a war-torn state, but on the border of two of the wealthiest countries in the world, countries which purport to be champions of human rights. The conditions and the images of its life, as well as its destruction, should serve to shame Europe.</p> <p>On our final day we ate lunch in one of the camp\u2019s makeshift restaurants, a large tent backing on to an unexpected lake. We sat on the raised bench around a table with Ahmed. Mustafa was ill that day. Ahmed showed us photographs of his family in Afghanistan, and his Facebook newsfeed showed adverts for shops in London and flats in Bournemouth, giving an indication of his internet searches. He said he would visit us in the UK soon, but without much conviction. He had given up trying to get into the UK at night, jumping onto the back of lorries.</p> <p>The demolition of the camp was overdue. Watching the bulldozers go through the rotten caravans we worked in, there was a strong sense of good riddance. A water table saturated with sewage, health clinics as likely to give you disease as cure you, and whole families living in tiny kerosene-stained tents felt beyond repair. The new centres must guarantee a basic level of living. This eviction must be an abolition of this camp and its appalling conditions, not simply a relocation to a deeper, darker part of France and a more distant corner of Britain\u2019s guilty conscience.</p>",

Carefully wrap up the foil package, so no smoke can escape, and put the wok on a high heat. When the rice begins to burn and smoke, after four or five minutes (check by unwrapping a corner or by smelling), leave to smoke for four minutes, then open the foil and tip the potatoes into an oven tray. Toss with a little oil, season and roast alongside the ribs for 45 minutes, until tender, then remove \u2013 the potato will get smokier as it cools.</p> <p>Take the ribs from the oven and leave to rest.

  "<p>British delegates, including a Liberal Democrat peer, are to take part in a controversial conference in Damascus this weekend organised by the father-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad, which critics say is little more than a Syrian regime propaganda exercise.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishsyriansociety.org/\">British Syrian Society</a> has organised a two-day workshop, starting on Sunday, on the \u201cramifications of the war in Syria\u201d. Speakers include <a href=\"http:// http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/earl-of-oxford-and-asquith/4343\">Raymond Asquith (Lord Oxford), a Lib Dem peer</a>, alongside British academics and a range of figures from Assad\u2019s government. Several high-profile UK journalists are also taking part.</p> <p>The society was set up in 2000 in London, and its chairman was Fawaz Akhras, a London-based cardiologist, whose daughter Asma married Assad later that same year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4c71e259f00580757978fc808f498c3e8855c3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c71e259f00580757978fc808f498c3e8855c3bc/107_98_2226_2782/800.jpg\" alt=\"Asma al-Assad.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asma al-Assad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the society went into hibernation after Syria\u2019s bloody civil war erupted in 2011. Since then 400,000 people have died, most killed by Assad\u2019s forces. The international conference \u2013 organised by Akhras \u2013 is the society\u2019s first recent event. </p> <p>It appears to be a sign of the regime\u2019s growing confidence that it is winning the battle against Syria\u2019s rebel groups and will ultimately prevail. The event follows the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/syrias-first-lady-asma-al-assad-says-she-rejected-offers-of-asylum\">first public interview for five years by Asma al-Assad</a>, shown on Russian state TV earlier this month. </p> <p>Chris Doyle, the head of the <a href=\"http://www.caabu.org/\">Council for Arab-British Understanding</a>, said it was a mistake for Lord Oxford and others to take part in what was a regime \u201cPR exercise\u201d. Asquith is chairing the opening session, titled: \u201cThe background of the war in Syria\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe regime is trying to energise its public diplomacy and public outreach in Britain. They are trying to maintain this is a neutral conference. It\u2019s simply not. The speakers are senior regime figures, plus others who are extremely supportive,\u201d Doyle said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe British delegates are merely reinforcing the regime\u2019s narrative that it\u2019s business as usual as they [the regime] carpet-bomb Aleppo and other Syrian cities. It\u2019s wrong to take part. If you are involved in track two diplomacy, fine. If you are going on some sort of propaganda conference, no way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the FCO [Foreign Office] will be happy about this.\u201d</p> <p>Other British speakers include Maj Gen <a href=\"http://www.quintelintelligence.com/executive-team.php\">John Holmes</a>, a former British special forces officer, who runs a private intelligence business, and<a href=\"https://rusi.org/people/kamal-alam\"> Kamal Alam</a>, a research analyst at the defence and security thinktank Rusi.</p> <p>Asquith was unavailable for comment. </p> <p>The Lib Dems said the party was unaware of the Damascus trip. It said: \u201cLord Oxford was part of the Foreign Office for many decades before he became a Lib Dem peer, and we assume any such trip has been organised through contacts he developed during that time.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cWe strongly condemn the continuous atrocities committed by the Assad regime and its Russian backers against civilians in Syria. We have called for urgent humanitarian access to besieged areas and have urged the government to establish a no-fly zone.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood that UK delegates are paying their own airfare. Several have already flown to Beirut, where they were picked up by Syrian government vehicles. From there they were driven across the Lebanese border to Damascus. It is unclear if the regime is paying for their hotels and food.</p> <p>Speakers from the Syrian regime include Bouthaina Shaaban, one of Assad\u2019s key political advisers; Dr Ali Haidar, Syria\u2019s minister for state reconciliation; and Fares Shehabi, an official from Aleppo. His presentation is called: \u201cWhy did reconciliation not work in Aleppo until now?\u201d</p> <p>On Friday Syrian rebel groups said they had launched a large-scale offensive designed to break the government\u2019s siege of eastern Aleppo. They fired rockets at a military airport and detonated car bombs. At least 15 people were killed in the rebel bombardment, and 100 injured.</p> <p><a href=\"http://sana.sy/en/\">Syria\u2019s state TV</a> is expected to cover Sunday and Monday\u2019s conference exhaustively. \u201cYou can guess the regime media will be all over it,\u201d Doyle said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29efe885b856f2744aa833938da2d29e63e482e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29efe885b856f2744aa833938da2d29e63e482e9/72_513_1030_617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fotonoticias/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Akhras, Assad\u2019s London-based father-in-law, is not speaking but is the driving force behind the workshop, it is understood.

In 2010 he and his wife, Sahar Otri, attended a banquet thrown by the Queen in honour of the Emir of Qatar.</p> <p>Since the war began Akhras has kept a low profile, refusing to talk to journalists. He is believed to divide his time between the UK and Damascus. Akhras was born in Homs, Syria\u2019s third-largest city. He emigrated to London in 1973 where he met his wife, an official at the Syrian embassy. </p> <p>Their daughter Asma was born in 1975. They raised her in Acton, where she grew up known as Emma, attending a local school and then Queen\u2019s College, a private girls\u2019 school on Harley Street. </p> <p>Akhras was the founding director of the British Syrian Society. He got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/15/assad-father-in-law-uk-syria\">the backing of a number of British establishment figures, including the former Liberal leader David Steel and Sir Andrew Green, the former British ambassador to Syria.</a> The society flew MPs to Syria and arranged business conferences.

  "<p>One of the frontrunners to become the new Ukip leader has used his official campaign launch to defend Donald Trump and to call for a national referendum on banning women from wearing the niqab.</p> <p>Speaking in front of a few dozen supporters at a pub in Westminster, Raheem Kassam also appeared to cast doubt on the veracity of women accusing the US Republican presidential candidate of sexual assault, and said he did not believe Trump had anti-Muslim views.</p> <p>Kassam, 30, a former staffer for Nigel Farage who now runs the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/london/\">UK arm of the rightwing US news network Breitbart</a>, is second favourite with bookmakers behind Paul Nuttall, an MEP and deputy leader, to be voted the next Ukip leader.</p> <p>Suzanne Evans, a former Conservative councillor who compiled the party\u2019s 2015 election manifesto, is also standing. Farage is the interim leader after his replacement, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\">Diane James, stepped down after 18 days</a>. </p> <p>Speaking at the central London pub, where he spent much of the time with a pint of beer in his hand, Kassam styled himself as the Farage continuity candidate, while also promising to hugely expand Ukip\u2019s membership and inject radical ideas into the party.</p> <p>\u201cI regard myself as the Faragist candidate,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cOf the Faragists, I am the Farage-est. And that is something that we as a party should not hide from. Our legacy is Nigel, Nigel is our legacy. And we shouldn\u2019t be trying to drag this party to the squishy centre ground. </p> <p>\u201cWe should be proud of what I call Faragism \u2013 a belief in your country, a belief in your culture, a belief in the people of this great nation.\u201d </p> <p>Kassam\u2019s candidacy has attracted immediate controversy, notably over his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">prolific and often robust Twitter feed</a>, which has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/raheem-kassam-ukip-leadership-election-twitter-deleted_uk_580cf387e4b056572d82f392\">included a deeply personal insult against Nicola Sturgeon</a>, for which he again apologised.</p> <p>He has also attracted attention for his appreciation of Trump \u2013 Kassam\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cMake Ukip Great Again\u201d echoes the Republican candidate\u2019s motto.</p> <p>While describing his slogan as \u201ca bit tongue in cheek\u201d, Kassam reiterated that he would supported Trump in the 8 November election, saying: \u201cI hope he wins over crooked Hillary, certainly.\u201d</p> <p>Kassam told reporters after his speech: \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing him. What I\u2019ve said it that I prefer him to win than Hillary Clinton. I\u2019ve got no problem with endorsing him, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think my endorsement makes any difference either way.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to condemn Trump\u2019s policies, such as the mooted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">proposal to bar all Muslims from entering the US</a>, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe he has anti-Muslim views.\u201d Kassam added: \u201cI can see where his supporters\u2019 frustrations were in supporting the blanket ban, but I think we have a much better plan of how to deal with radical Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the series of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault, Kassam said he had doubts about the claims, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s strange that somebody who was a celebrity for so many years only has these things come out right at the tail end of a presidential campaign.\u201d</p> <p>It was possible that the women \u201cdid not feel that he had enough support to speak out\u201d in the past, he added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.makeukipgreatagain.com/\">Kassam\u2019s personal manifesto</a> is strongly rightwing, including massive cuts to the foreign aid budget, and a focus on cutting immigration and measures targeting elements of Islam, including an end to forms of halal slaughter.</p> <p>Kassam, who was brought up in a Muslim family but says he now has no religious faith, said he supported a referendum on banning the use of the niqab, the most conservative form of Islamic dress for women, which covers the face. </p> <p>\u201cI think most people in this country are OK with the hijab,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would want a referendum on the niqab.\u201d</p> <p>After James resigned, the immediate favourite to replace her was Steven Woolfe, a former barrister and now an MEP. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/ukip-mep-steven-woolfe-quits-party\">he left the party</a> in the wake of a scuffle with a fellow Ukip MEP, Mike Hookem, amid a dispute about Woolfe\u2019s admission he had almost defected to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Woolfe spent three days in hospital after the fracas, and said Hookem had punched him. However, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/ukip-blames-mep-steven-woolfe-row-hookem-european-parliament-police\">party investigation into the incident</a> said Woolfe appeared primarily to blame. </p>",

  "<p>Politicians don\u2019t answer questions: this is so long established, so easily observed, so universal, that the intricacies of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424\">Peter Bull\u2019s research</a> into the subject [<a href=\"https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/89ebb493-ac8a-472f-a12a-3c88edc95021.pdf\">pdf download</a>] seem almost decorative, like devising 35 typologies for the Pope\u2019s Catholicism. And yet the York University psychologist, who specialises in micro-analyses of interpersonal communication, has a series of insights, some very broad, some very precise and relating to Theresa May, that have crystallised the process, driven home its necessity, and elaborated its mechanisms so precisely as to have more or less destroyed my faith in public life.</p> <p>First, Bull details why politicians evade giving direct answers to interviewers: \u201cIt\u2019s primarily to do with face; positive face is concerned with making sure they themselves don\u2019t look bad, and negative face is about keeping one\u2019s freedom of action and not committing to anything.\u201d Positive face is, of course, pretty ignoble, and politicians we perceive to be able to say what they really feel, regardless of the flak they get, are admired disproportionately to how honest or talented or effective they demonstrably are.</p> <p>Negative face, however, is much more of a conundrum. Thinking specifically about current politics, there are very few plain, practical answers May could give to anything, without inhibiting her room for manoeuvre in the near future, even as near as tomorrow. This might explain why, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37268458\">one interview with Andrew Marr</a> that Bull analysed for <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/theresa-may-has-a-very-special-technique-for-avoiding-questions-67424\">The Conversation</a>, she gave a straight answer only 14% of the time. (Bull has found the average explicit answer rate in British political life to be 46%. I was surprised to find it so high, but this is comparable to a 1991 study that put it at 39%).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNBKCAOC1qc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uNBKCAOC1qc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cA non-reply may include several different forms of not replying,\u201d says Bull. May\u2019s signature evasion is to answer a specific question with a non-specific answer. So, for instance, Marr asked her whether she would prevent a second referendum in Scotland, and she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether there could be a second referendum, it\u2019s whether there should be a second referendum.\u201d Within that leap from specific to non-specific, she rephrases the question, then answers it as she posed it (\u201cthat\u2019s a little ploy that politicians often use\u201d).</p> <p>She also expresses a hope rather than a plan. \u201cShe\u2019s making political points all the time,\u201d Bull notes. \u201cPresenting policy, justifying policy, giving reassurance. She often talks in terms of aspirations. In PMQs on Wednesday, she was asked about the border in Ireland. She said: \u2018Of course, we don\u2019t want a return to a hard border between north and south.\u2019 Would anyone want that?\u201d This is where aspiration becomes indistinguishable from platitude; people rarely aspire to anything to which anyone else would not aspire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/05/david-cameron-avoids-question-father-tax-affairs-panama-papers\">David Cameron avoids question on benefiting from father\u2019s tax affairs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May is often compared to Margaret Thatcher \u2013 they have that ineffable, sphinxish quality so rare in public life (let\u2019s call it, for brevity, being female), but their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu7kZdbI2sg\">evasive techniques</a> couldn\u2019t be more different. Thatcher frequently attacked the interviewer, which might have been charmless, but had the desired effect: few stayed on point after a skirmish. (\u201cTheresa May isn\u2019t like that at all. She is very polite.\u201d) Neil Kinnock was known for negative evasion \u2013 he would tell the interviewer what he wasn\u2019t going to do, which wasn\u2019t effective at all, encouraging a predictable, punchier response: well, what <em>are</em> you going to do, then?</p> <p>Bull is sceptical about whether adversarial interviewing styles are the best way of eliciting an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to construct a question in such a way that they\u2019re bound to answer.

They\u2019re not even anything like a deliberate, non-white lie, in which there is at least the challenge of darting away from the matter. It\u2019s like being in a conversation based on a deliberate premise of meaninglessness. You take discourse \u2013 which is actually quite a sacred thing, a moment in which people of good faith can get closer to one another \u2013 and you turn it into the opposite of that.

  "<p><strong>I grew up in a vibrant east London</strong> working-class community, which made my Ghanaian parents and their three children feel at home in this country. We initially lived in a council block in Leytonstone, then we moved to a council place in Walthamstow, which resembled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/03/broadcasting.channel41\" title=\"\">Brookside Close</a>. Our&#xa0;neighbours there were really helpful, checking up on my siblings and me when my mum began working full time, after my parents separated. Working-class communities have been getting a really bad rap because of the Brexit vote, but they have embraced immigration, while economics has sheltered wealthier communities from&#xa0;it.</p> <p><strong>My family moved to Ghana when I was two,</strong> although I was born in east&#xa0;London. My parents always planned to raise a family there. Dad worked in finance for the Ghanaian government and we had a very big house in a posh part of the capital, Accra. We enjoyed all the trappings of wealth, including drivers, servants and&#xa0;housekeepers. But then, suddenly, we had to return to the UK after a coup&#xa0;in 1984.</p> <p><strong>The pressure of going from a very cushy life</strong> to a council estate, plus my dad being unable to get the kind of job he was qualified for, took a toll on my parents\u2019 marriage and they separated when I was seven. Dad moved to America and got a job with Bank of America. He remained in contact and used to send us money. My mum became a nurse. I have to give my mum credit for picking herself up, because she had been a housewife throughout her marriage and so having to then work full time with three children wasn\u2019t easy.</p> <p><strong>My mother was very glamorous and beautiful</strong>, and I looked up to her. One&#xa0;of my fondest memories from childhood is of her getting ready for parties. I\u2019d also play with her handbags and totter about in her high heels. But I have been a daddy\u2019s girl my whole life. When he moved to the US, it was a shock, but I don\u2019t remember crying \u2013 I just got on with my life. As I got older I&#xa0;realised that his departure wasn\u2019t ideal, but kids can be quite resilient. And at school I was the cool kid because I always went to America during the holidays and brought back the latest trainers.</p> <p><strong>Education is everything in Ghanaian culture</strong> and so my parents were furious when, at 18, I decided to get a job as a receptionist with Kiss FM, instead of going to university. We had this family meeting and all these uncles came, people I hadn\u2019t seen since I was two. They told me how much shame I was bringing on the family by not going to university. I stood my ground and so my dad eventually said: \u201cI am going to give you a year and if this nonsense doesn\u2019t work out then you are going to university.\u201d Luckily, it did work out. The funniest thing is that my family now say to people: \u201cWe told her: \u2018Follow your dreams.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>My older brother Sam and I were very close.</strong> We used to play doctors and nurses, and he would let me pretend to give him an injection, by pricking him with a pin! He was an amazing human being. His passing in October last year is still so raw, really painful.</p> <p><strong>My sister Rebecca used to save up her pocket money</strong> and buy nice dresses from Walthamstow market, which I would wear to show off to my friends at school. When Rebecca found out, she hit the roof! I have a younger sister, Gina, who came along when I was 14, after Mum remarried. I babysat Gina a lot and became more like an aunt than a sibling because of the big age gap.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 June Sarpong recently launched Ldny, a clothing collection in partnership with the United Nations Trust Fund, to end violence against women (</em><a href=\"http://www.ldny.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Ldny.com</em></a><em>). </em></p>",
  "<p>The midi skirt \u2013 by which I&#xa0;mean a loose skirt whose hem hits a little below the knee \u2013 arrived in my wardrobe as a seasonal visitor, granted a temporary visa by dint of being on trend. Silver, with a pleasing swishiness, it was meant to represent a short-term, casual kind of hook-up, so I was surprised when this skirt made itself indispensable and moved in on a&#xa0;permanent basis. Our happy relationship has borne fruit: I now have five midi skirts, including a&#xa0;second silver one. (Yes, I do need both, thank you. The new one is pleated, so it\u2019s quite different.)</p> <p>The midi skirt, which you would imagine to be an almost polar opposite look to black trousers, has unexpectedly edged them out of my wardrobe. Weirdly, despite its vaguely housewifely air, it ticks lots of the same boxes. Looking smart makes me feel more confident up to the point where looking smart crosses into looking dolled-up, when it makes me feel more self-conscious. The midi skirt, like a&#xa0;good pair of black trousers, is relaxed without being scruffy. Also, it works with flat shoes as well as heels, both stylistically (there is something pleasingly modern about a loafer or trainers with a longish skirt) and from a&#xa0;self-image perspective (your legs don\u2019t need to look longer if they are hidden by your skirt). And you can walk fast in it (can\u2019t stand anything I can\u2019t march in), and you don\u2019t need to wear tights unless it is really cold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/21/what-wore-week-corduroy-jess-cartner-morley\">What I wore this week: corduroy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while we skip off into the sunrise together happily of a&#xa0;morning, no relationship is perfect.

Over the course of the game, you\u2019ll collect resources including wood and stone, using them to construct buildings and earn wealth and prestige in the process.</p> <p>Things quickly get tricky, though, because you\u2019ll need to open up paths through the valley\u2019s rolling fog to transport resources to your building sites. The routes you create can also be used by your opponents, and if you\u2019re not careful you\u2019ll unwittingly hand them an advantage. Add in a selection of different buildings to construct, each of which grants a different bonus or special ability, and you\u2019ve got a game that\u2019s considerably more cutthroat and strategic than its cartoon artwork suggests. Figuring out your opponents\u2019 intentions, disguising your own and denying opportunities to your rivals will all help you towards victory, and, while there\u2019s little in the way of direct head-to-head competition, the game is packed with subtle, nuanced, passive-aggressive ways to mess with your fellow players.</p> <p>Designer Martin Wallace is best known for heavy, complex games, but while new players might find some of the terminology in Via Nebula\u2019s rulebook a little intimidating, things really click into place after you\u2019ve played a couple of rounds.

One player on each side serves as a spymaster, giving a series of cryptic clues to help their teammates. The clever bit: they do it using word association, employing links between words to nudge their allies towards the right answers.</p> <p>A spymaster trying to identify the two words \u201cknight\u201d and \u201csquare\u201d for instance, could give the clue: \u201cchess, two\u201d.

While the game is otherwise unchanged, it gains a new level of challenge thanks to the surreal quality of its pictures: a dragon attacking a radio telescope; a water slide protruding from the leaning tower of Pisa; a writhing mass of tentacles holding a beautifully gift-wrapped present. It\u2019s all decidedly trippy, and it feels like the game exercises a different part of the brain than its wordy predecessor.</p> <p>Do you need to own both versions? Probably not.

Different arrangements of rooms grant different scores, and you\u2019ll aim to grab the ones that are beneficial to you while denying useful cards to your opponents.</p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting concept, and it\u2019s quite satisfying to watch as your house comes together bit-by-bit over the course of the game. But, in terms of complexity, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly who Dream Home is for.

Then in June, a companion bill was introduced in the House, but there has been no movement in Congress since.</p> \n<p>His first adoptive parents, a strict couple, relinquished custody to the state of Oregon\u2019s foster care system in 1985, when he was around 10 years old, after deciding they didn\u2019t want him any more. After bouncing around foster homes, he was adopted into the Crapser family.

  "<p>With the situation in Syria desperate and with so much riding on the relief effort to compensate for the lack of a political settlement, the pressure on aid agencies, particularly the UN, is immense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/un-hires-assads-friends-and-relatives-for-syria-relief-operation\">UN hires Assad's friends and relatives for Syria relief operation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the bravery of workers on the frontline is not in doubt, there have been bitter arguments about a number of fundamental issues, raising the prospect that the situation is worse than it seems. Here are some of the key questions.</p> <h2><strong>How many people need aid?</strong></h2> <p>There is an enormous discrepancy in numbers, particularly the figures relating to \u201cbesieged\u201d areas.<br></p> <p>For instance, the UN began referring to rebel-held eastern Aleppo as besieged in the past few weeks \u2013 three months after the area last received a significant supply of humanitarian aid.<br></p> <p>As with other aid organisations, the UN uses a formula to identify places under siege. It asks three questions:</p> <ul> <li>Is the area surrounded by armed actors?</li> <li>Can humanitarian assistance regularly enter?</li> <li>Can civilians, the sick and wounded enter and exit?</li> </ul> <p>Applying this criteria, the UN estimates that 586,200 people were living in 17 besieged areas in Syria in September. It believes that a total of 4.88 million were living in \u201chard to reach\u201d locations.</p> <p>But these numbers are disputed by other organisations, which use similar formulas and get much higher numbers.</p> <p>Advocacy group <a href=\"http://siegewatch.org/#7/35.111/38.540\">Siege Watch estimates</a> that 996,975 people are living in 39 besieged areas, not including 275,000 under siege in Aleppo.<br></p> <p>The group says the extra 21 areas are surrounded by government forces. It believes that another 1.4 million people are at risk of siege.</p> <p>Those figures are supported by another well-established international NGO working in Syria, which spoke to the Guardian but does not want to be named.<br></p> <p>According to this organisation, there are between 1.2 million and 1.3 million people under siege, which increases to 1.5 million if Aleppo is included.<br></p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"http://activityreport2015.msf.org/country/syria/\">M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res estimates</a> that 1.5 million are living in besieged areas.</p> <p>A source told the Guardian that UN hubs outside Damascus had privately agreed with the higher counts, but felt unable to challenge the official UN figures, which are set by the organisation in the Syrian capital.</p> <p>The UN said: \u201c[We] are aware that different aid groups use different definitions and have access to different data sources. Differences of opinion do occur.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"875f7e6ed82fbb79751ed9b3fd98b88e55d40d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/875f7e6ed82fbb79751ed9b3fd98b88e55d40d9c/0_23_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy arrives in Ghouta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy arrives in Ghouta.

All were accepted, but only six convoys made it to their destinations.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This is not untypical; most months, an initial \u201cnote verbale\u201d (third-person note) grants permission for almost all the requested locations, but this is then denied further down the line.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The initial approval, therefore, does not reflect how much aid is delivered: usually about 20-33% of locations are reached.</p> <p>But when the UN gives monthly updates to the security council, it routinely leads with figures relating to convoy approvals.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In July, for instance, the UN said of the \u201c35 locations, 34 have been approved for access, representing approximately 75% of total beneficiaries targeted\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Later, the organisation concedes that only nine locations were reached.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3130bdc0eb36e7c4bb5e81c0e4921e6b1c56709\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3130bdc0eb36e7c4bb5e81c0e4921e6b1c56709/0_176_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A UN flag lies next to a destroyed aid convoy outside Aleppo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A UN flag lies next to a destroyed aid convoy outside Aleppo.

This travelled from Damascus through 23 checkpoints and across frontlines to reach an area 22 miles (35km) from the Turkish border.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Similarly, UN documents seen by the Guardian said the UN favoured cross-line aid deliveries from government-held western Aleppo to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, because this was the \u201cpreference of the government of Syria\u201d.</p> <p>The Syrian regime also makes requests of the UN. In May, the president, Bashar al-Assad, asked for deliveries to Palmyra, al-Qaryatayn, Bloudan and Houla. </p> <p>In August, Syrian authorities asked the UN to deliver assistance to 41 locations outside the proposed plans. None of them were thought to be in greatest need or under siege.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a355bd12385d014907dfbae0e1079221b7f855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a355bd12385d014907dfbae0e1079221b7f855/0_389_2734_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aid convoy prepares to depart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aid convoy prepares to depart for Madaya and Zabadani.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) withdrew its participation in a convoy to Moadamiya on 19 September after only 10% of proposed supplies were allowed through. The Syrian government also removed 11.5 tonnes from World Health Organisation (WHO) medical supplies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/30/syrian-families-moadamiyah\">Syrian families flee besieged Moadamiyah \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Items of food in the Moadamiya convoy were destroyed by Syrian soldiers at a checkpoint on the way into the area and rejected. A subsequent convoy reached the area with new supplies.<br></p> <p>Convoys to Madaya and Zabadani in September had half their medical supplies, 1.5 tonnes, removed.<br></p> <p>As a result, 64% of WHO health supplies in Syria have gone to government-held areas since January.<br></p> <p>This number is backed up by UN reporting, which suggests that as many as 3 million of the 4.3 million people reached with aid supplies in Syria each month are in government areas.<br></p> <p>Due to the lack of medical supplies in besieged areas, it is often necessary to move patients across conflict lines.<br></p> <p>But permission is routinely delayed or denied. Patients and family members have to be cleared by Syrian security services before being given permission.<br></p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, said medical evacuations from eastern Aleppo during the recent pause were scuppered by both parties, including rebels.</p> <p>\u201cObjections by two non-state armed opposition groups, namely Ahrar al-Sham and Nour al-din al-Zenki, scuppered these plans,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties, only for the parties to then fail to agree on each other\u2019s conditions about how evacuations should proceed.

It\u2019s not true that they can say they have reached that amount of people when they go with their trucks ... and drop them there hoping they are going to somehow be delivered to the target individuals in the besieged areas,\u201d they said.<br></p> <p>One former UN employee in Damascus said field visits were nearly impossible and oversight of the projects funded by the UN was minimal as a result.<br></p> <p>A senior humanitarian worker in Syria said there was a particular problem with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which has been criticised for its apparent closeness to the Syrian government.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you keep saying SARC is not politically biased and you\u2019re reaching the majority of those in besieged areas, that is a lie,\u201d they said. Cross-border aid partners said there needs to be more rigorous assessments on the ground.</p> <p>Fadi Al-Dairi, the founder of Hand in Hand for Syria, said: \u201cWhen we deliver aid in the opposition areas, we do a \u2018needs assessment\u2019. We send in someone to check on the needs and then again to ensure the people received the aid. We are not seeing the same from the aid being distributed from the GoS [government] side.\u201d </p> <p>Advocacy group Siege Watch recently recommended that the UN monitor its aid programmes using independent third parties to ensure that supplies are being received by those most in need. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d99937538e72ec8c8dbf107f91f487014ae83c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30d99937538e72ec8c8dbf107f91f487014ae83c/30_158_5314_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath of an airstrike on a hospital in Aleppo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of an airstrike on a hospital in Aleppo.

According to the NGO Physicians for Human Rights, at least 705 medical workers had been killed in Syria by March. This included 346 deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on 246 medical facilities.</p> <p>MSF said 23 Syrian health staff they were supporting were killed and 58 wounded in 2015. Sixty-three hospitals and clinics backed by MSF were bombed or shelled on 94 separate occasions in 2015, 12 of which were completely destroyed.</p> <p>The Syrian government and its allies have been responsible for more than 90% of recorded hospital attacks and more than 95% of medical personnel killings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That number has increased exponentially in recent months, according to UN reports; in July, 44 hospitals or health facilities were targeted or attacked. There were 55 attacks against medical facilities in August.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>SARC has had 53 staff and volunteers killed during the conflict. </p> <p>One NGO working in Syria told the Guardian about 40 of its aid trucks have been hit by airstrikes in Syria.

But this is a new strategy.</p> <p>Until now, the UN has not been in the habit of apportioning blame for violations, saying it has to work with all sides in the conflict to remain impartial.</p> <p>One senior UN official told the Guardian: \u201cSometimes we feel that the ire of many understandably outraged people is directed at the UN instead of those parties that are inhibiting the access, or sponsoring or committing the atrocities against civilians.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe really want it to be clear that working with the system to try to reach locations from within Syria is unbelievably challenging.

Real actions must be taken to protect aid workers and hold those responsible accountable. Many aid workers have stopped their work because they are being deliberately targeted.\u201d</p> <p>According to the WHO website, before February it made no obvious mention of attacks on health workers.

O\u2019Brien said recently: \u201cHumanitarian aid must remain neutral, impartial and free of political and military agendas.\u201d<br></p> <p>But one senior member of an international NGO said: \u201cWe cannot demonstrate total impartiality in this conflict, but we are strictly impartial in our services. This is a big difference.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to do our best and be very conscious that we are only working on one side. The UN and ICRC etc, are not doing the same exercise. They don\u2019t recognise this internally either.\u201d</p> <p>Potential conflicts of interest, whether real or perceived, can be found everywhere.</p> <p>For instance, the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the main relief organisations in Syria, has struck a deal for access to Damascus with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/how-assad-regime-controls-un-aid-intended-for-syrias-children\">Syria Trust for Development</a>, a charity set up and run by Assad\u2019s wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/in-syria-we-believe-in-honouring-our-word-asma-al-assad-speaks-about-syrian-conflict\">Asma al-Assad</a>.</p> <p>The NRC\u2019s secretary general is Jan Egeland, a UN special adviser and the chair of the International Syria Support Group.</p> <p>The NRC said working with the trust was its best option. \u201cNRC searched long and hard for partners in both opposition and government-controlled areas that can ensure our direct access to the displaced people in greatest need.</p> <p>\u201cSyria Trust was one of the partners selected because it allowed NRC staff to directly implement programming, without intermediaries, according to needs only and not political affiliation.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the humanitarian impartiality principle we work by: we are only governed by how to serve those in greatest need and never take sides in a political conflict.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the Guardian reported this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit\">Theresa May had privately made a passionate case for Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU</a> shortly before the referendum, it didn\u2019t look great. The problem wasn\u2019t her opinion: she was saying the sort of things a member of the remain campaign was supposed to. The problem was that she wasn\u2019t doing so in public \u2013 and the audience for her secret pitch was a select group of bankers from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>May is very far from the first politician to accept such an invitation. She has, for example, put herself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">same category as Hillary Clinton</a>, who between resigning as US secretary of state and running for president made a number of highly lucrative speeches for the same bank. For both politicians, the idea that they are giving off-the-record briefings to the banking industry that stand at odds with their public pronouncements makes for very bad publicity indeed. For the spin doctors at Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, this must have been a pretty good week.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that \u201cGoldman\u201d or \u201cGoldmans\u201d \u2013 as insiders call the bank \u2013 is in general enthusiastic about publicity. Much like Fight Club, the first rule of the City is that you do not talk about the City: especially at major banks, unauthorised contact with reporters or researchers is grounds for immediate dismissal. Nowhere is this rule enforced more vigorously than at Goldman. There isn\u2019t even a sign with the bank\u2019s name on at its City HQ.</p> <p>In the absence of a more conventional PR strategy, though, visits from the likes of May and Clinton serve a very useful purpose. Other banks may have good risk management, but none has Goldman\u2019s mystique, or its network of former employees, from the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and former US Treasury ministers Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. Goldman loves to present itself as the bank that is better than any of its competitors at drawing the most powerful decision-makers into its orbit \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/jean-claude-juncker-jose-manuel-barroso-decision-to-join-goldman-sachs\">hiring the former EU leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso</a> earlier this year. All of this helps with recruitment as well as with holding on to staff. And so, publicity shy though Goldman may be, the outcry over May\u2019s speech this week makes it look exactly the way it wants to.</p> <p>\u201cAny person being seen as at the global top of what they do, be it in basketball, green technology, fashion or chess, will be an interesting speaker for a bank trying to position itself as the global leader in its own field,\u201d says one insider. Another adds: \u201cIt is the rock-star effect. \u2018Look who we know! Look who we got!\u2019 They say that politics is show business for ugly people. Getting a big-name politician in is just part of that \u2013 a celebrity to cheer up and maybe stimulate very well-paid but hard-pressed employees.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5929j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836072\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e2c3de4b0c146d58914f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">Theresa May\u2019s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That May was invited to Goldman Sachs and that she accepted, then, is neither surprising nor remarkable, City insiders agree. While her argument may have been more passionately stated behind closed doors, there was technically no gap between what she said at Goldman and her public position at the time and she was not paid \u2013 in line with a generally adhered-to rule that those in office come for free. Though there are other opportunities for political leaders to snuggle up to top bankers, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/refugee-crisis-dominates-downbeat-davos-2016\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a> and conferences such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/bilderberg-conference-dresden-charlie-skelton-bilderblog\">Bilderberg</a>, building some bridges to Goldman must have felt to May like a smart thing to do \u2013 not least because so many of her recent parliamentary colleagues have ended up with a role in banking as \u201cspecial advisers\u201d: John Major at Credit Suisse, Gordon Brown at Pimco, Alistair Darling at Morgan Stanley, William Hague at Citibank and of course Tony Blair taking a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7186975.stm\">reported \u00a32.5m a year</a> at JP Morgan.</p> <p>She may have had more immediate reasons for moving closer to Goldman, too, and if she made any contacts in the margins of her speech these could actually come in useful amid all the uncertainty over a hard, soft or \u201cdirty\u201d Brexit. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/07/alistair-darling-back-from-brink-review\">memoir Back from the Brink</a>, Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer in 2008, recounts how at one point the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, openly threatened him with no longer buying British sovereign bonds if the government were to introduce a tax on bonuses. Global banks can relocate, and then there is the possibility of a global bank\u2019s chief economist talking down your country. Today\u2019s global mega banks wield immense power and while banks have good reason to lobby governments, politicians have good reason to lobby banks, too.</p> <p>This week, May must have regretted her decision to speak at Goldman, given that the larger public is unlikely to understand that unlike Clinton, who charged an estimated $200,000 per speech, May got nothing. Their audiences appear to have been very different, too. Clinton seems to have spoken mainly to groups of Goldman Sachs clients whom the bank was probably hoping to impress. These are so-called professional asset managers, whose job is to invest the money of pension funds, insurers, rich families or oil-rich countries. Many of them might very well make more than the Goldman Sachs bankers trying to sell them investment products. The term here is \u201cclient entertainment\u201d \u2013 giving your clients something interesting for free in the hope of securing some business later. Recent regulation makes it increasingly hard for banks and brokers to take clients to expensive restaurants, exclusive cultural events or prestigious football, tennis or golf tournaments in exotic locations. But flying out for a speech by a global political celebrity is usually still allowed. In the words of one insider with decades of experience: \u201cBringing in a very expensive speaker is also a way of saying to your clients: \u2018See how much we care for you, that we paid XXX to get this person here! We play in the big leagues.\u201d</p> <p>The same dynamic seems to be at work when global banks bring in a celebrity to speak to their youngest recruits. A young maths student who finished an internship at a big global bank said: \u201cWhen they flew in a famous politician from the other side of the globe just to talk to us interns, you can\u2019t help feeling, well, important. You think, wow, my bank can do this?\u201d</p> <p>All in all, those responsible for crafting Goldman\u2019s image as the world\u2019s most powerful and well-connected bank must have been happy to see this week\u2019s outrage about May\u2019s speech. Could the same be said of those actually in the audience?</p> <p>Goldman\u2019s top brass are paid well over \u00a33m a year, and nearly all of them must make the bank a multiple of that amount in order not to be demoted or \u201cculled\u201d by the end of each year. Based on how much the average senior banker works, \u00a33m breaks down to a little under a thousand pounds an hour. So there they were, sitting in a room listening to May rehearsing the same arguments she had made many times before, positions she was to abandon within days after the referendum. Even worse, May\u2019s speech might very well have contributed to the false sense of complacency in the City over the referendum result. In retrospect, then, attending the speech must now feel to those in the audience like a momentous waste of time. In City jargon: a pretty bad trade.</p> <p><em>Joris Luyendijk is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/swimming-with-sharks-406352.html\">Swimming with Sharks: My Journey into the World of the Bankers</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Michael White, the Guardian\u2019s assistant editor, retired last week after almost 45 years at the paper as a reporter, foreign correspondent and columnist. He was political editor from 1990-2006, Washington correspondent (1984-88) and parliamentary sketch writer (1977-84). Here he reflects on his Guardian career.</p> <p><strong>When did you first know you wanted to be a journalist?</strong><br>I was never a student journalist but, after failing a few interviews for industry in my final student year, I decided \u2013 correctly \u2013 that I am by nature an observer, not a doer. I was lucky in my timing: 1966 was a very good time to embark on a career in journalism.</p> <p><strong>Do you remember your first day at the Guardian?</strong><br>I was a refugee from the reporters\u2019 desk at the London Evening Standard, where the appointment of Stuart Kuttner, later of News of the World fame, as news editor made me keen to move. On day one at the Guardian, as Derek Malcolm, who was the paper\u2019s film critic, showed me how to subedit the late arts reviews \u2013 those of Michael Billington and Nancy Banks-Smith among them \u2013 he said: \u201cDo you know, I\u2019m the only film critic in Fleet Street who still has to do this.\u201d I realised I was Derek\u2019s ticket out.</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be political editor?</strong><br>No. But I was always interested in politics and applied for a Westminster vacancy that was earmarked for someone else, who turned it down. Within a year, I was the Guardian\u2019s sketch writer. A lucky fluke, but Machiavelli \u2013 a better observer than a doer \u2013 was right to say luck is half of everything.</p> <p><strong>Is there one job you didn\u2019t do that you would have loved to have tried?</strong><br>War is appalling and mostly to be avoided, but it has a grim fascination. I should like to have been a war correspondent, but only once.</p> <p><strong>What was your most embarrassing moment?</strong><br>When I got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/nov/05/labour.uk\">slight fisticuffs with the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor Alastair Campbell</a> over the death of his paper\u2019s proprietor, Robert Maxwell. \u201cIt shows there is a God,\u201d I said. I woke next day to find Alastair had been sacked by the new boss, and Fleet Street was proclaiming Maxwell a saintly hero. It was two weeks before Maxwell\u2019s hand was found to have been in the pension fund and I could emerge from the doghouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa3474de90744f6363780ba6ad1b06d8b6bc61b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3474de90744f6363780ba6ad1b06d8b6bc61b5/0_37_1379_827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell, whom Michael White got into \u2018slight fisticuffs\u2019 with over the death of Robert Maxwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What was your biggest scoop?</strong><br>I was never very good at finding scoops, which is just as well because I am a scoop sceptic. A few reporters are brilliant at it, but most \u201cscoops\u201d aren\u2019t what they are cracked up to be. There are usually only half a dozen real crackers a year. I value sound judgment of known facts more highly. Pompous, I realise.</p> <p><strong>Is there a story that you wish you had written?</strong><br>I never wrote my best scoop. In the mid-1990s, a well-placed Tory MP told me the Provisional IRA was in ceasefire talks with John Major\u2019s government. I couldn\u2019t get a second source and it was too serious an issue to take a punt on. People might have been killed. And did my source have a suspect ulterior motive? The story was true, but I don\u2019t regret my caution.</p> <p><strong>What has been the Guardian\u2019s greatest moment during your career? </strong><br>There have been many, none prompted by me; battles with government \u2013 I admire Edward Snowden as I did not Julian Assange \u2013 and risky libel victories. When we beat Neil Hamilton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk\">and Jonathan Aitken</a>, even Dennis Skinner was impressed. The crime reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/23/duncan-campbell-cops-robbers-and-me\">Duncan Campbell\u2019s win</a> over corruption at Stoke Newington nick impressed me greatly because he wrote so modestly about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b048e37983b64b27ef5bd1df62f2a9314b71a24b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b048e37983b64b27ef5bd1df62f2a9314b71a24b/0_106_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael White interviews former prime minister Tony Blair in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael White interviews former prime minister Tony Blair in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Which of the journalists who you have worked with do you most admire?</strong><br>I have admired and deplored all my editors, loved my Westminster colleagues, notably Ian Aitken and the much-missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/06/simon-hoggart-guardian-observer-journalist-dies-67\">Simon Hoggart</a>, the naughty boy. I admired the leader writer and war hero <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-mentor-charles-wheeler-on-mark-arnold-forster-421320.html\">Mark Arnold-Forster</a> and Mick Downing, father of the NUJ chapel, because they were both understated, and idealistic without being naive, though I would prefer to have been marooned on a desert island with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/28/posy-simmonds-tamara-drewe-interview\">the great cartoonist Posy Simmonds</a>. Among the many Fleet Street rascals with whom I have worked and drank, I have special affection for the late Gordon Grieg, of the Mail, and David Wooding, of the Sun.</p> <p><strong>Can you sum up the organisation in a sentence?</strong><br>More than most, the Guardian tries to do the decent thing and sometimes it succeeds.</p> <p><strong>A final thought after 45 years \u2026</strong><br>Scepticism towards leaders and institutions is healthy for citizens and journalists, but cynicism is not. In sentimental and credulous times like ours, it can be dangerously corrosive.</p>",

The farmers have allegedly been given assurances that the migrant worker schemes on which their harvests depend will be protected. The big banks are told over ministerial lunches there is no question of obstacles to the free movement of their staffs round Europe. Care homes, NHS hospitals, the construction industry, tourism are all beating paths to Whitehall\u2019s doors, relying as they do on low-paid continental and seasonal labour. Within the car industry, it goes without saying that Toyota, Ford and other big manufacturers are awaiting the same soothing words as Nissan has received. Otherwise all hell will break loose.</p> <p>The British government complains when international companies are offered sweetheart deals from Ireland, Luxembourg or Monaco. When investment becomes a free-for-all, there is a rush to the bottom. Countries compete with each other, either to subsidise business or \u2013 the same thing \u2013 to excuse them taxes or compensate them for tariffs. The prospect under a \u201chard\u201d Brexit, and a reversion to World Trade Organisation tariffs, would result in myriad such deals, day in, day out. And when clout is the issue, one thing is for sure: the smaller the business the less clout.</p> <p>Ever since the industrial revolution, free trade has been one of the greatest boons that politics has brought to mankind.

  "<h2>Kolmanskop, Namibia</h2> <p>Sand in itself is not spooky (unless you are frightened by beaches), but desert sand slowly filling a ghost town does rather chill the spirits. This former <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/08/kolmanskop-namib-desert-_n_5431202.html\">German mining town</a> was founded a century ago by diamond hunters, and once sported a ballroom, skittle alley, casino and tram. But the diamonds dried up and the town was abandoned to the elements in 1954. To this day, it is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of miners who died in the brutal heat of the desert. A TV crew for Destination Truth once locked themselves in the meat locker of the old butcher\u2019s shop, and recorded some \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon\">electronic voice phenomena</a>\u201d of ghosts whispering in their ears \u2013 which is certainly a better story than travelling all the way to the desert and finding nothing supernatural at all.</p> <h2>Prague, Czech Republic<br></h2> <p>Considered by many aficionados to be the most haunted city in Europe, Prague is known for its <a href=\"http://prague-stay.com/lifestyle/review/840-the-headless-templar/\">headless Templar Knight</a>, who is often spotted trotting down the cobbled streets at night gripping his head in one hand. To release the knight from this ghastly doom, a living bystander must grab his sword and stab him in the heart \u2013 a feat that, unsurprisingly, has not yet been accomplished. To the north of the city lies <a href=\"http://www.ghost-story.co.uk/index.php/haunted-castles/250-houska-castle-blatce-czech-republic\">Houska Castle</a>, where Nazi officers supposedly conducted occult experiments during the war; in its grounds lies a building that was allegedly constructed to <a href=\"http://www.mcgeesghosttours.com/gate-to-hell-at-castle-houska/\">cover a hole full of demons</a>.

Chichen Itza also supposedly hosted mass human sacrifices, and tourists and guides now report seeing the ghosts of those killed, and of old priests doomed to wander the city forever.

It followed the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.convictcreations.com/history/punishments.html\">Silent System</a>\u201d where prisoners were not allowed to talk, were held in solitary confinement, and had to wear hoods when in the company of other prisoners.

We don\u2019t know who to believe any more.\u201d</p> <p>This view was shared by Wesley Gaul, a 57-year-old consultant. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sign of him giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at all the people here. I live around here and there are Trump signs in every yard and only two Clinton signs in 30 miles. I don\u2019t believe the polls. I think the people\u2019s vote will shock everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was Devon Coffin, 24, a maintenance mechanic wearing a profane t-shirt that referenced Monica Lewinsky. He said: \u201cHe\u2019s doing three rallies a day, seven days a week. That\u2019s not giving up. That\u2019s a man on a mission.

In May Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cWord of mouth is the No 1 thing. And the word of mouth at my rallies is like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to go see it\u2019. And you know, one person goes and they talk about it to 20 people.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Seckely, 39, a US Marine, said: \u201cHe ain\u2019t going to quit. If you follow the numbers of people who come out to these events, you have to believe there\u2019s opportunity. It\u2019s like you go to a football game and the crowd is so big, you play hard.

It wouldn\u2019t bother me either way.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, many of his loyalists are clinging to the hope that his campaign can emulate the shock British vote to leave the European Union in June. Nigel Farage, then leader of the UK Independence party, called it a victory for the \u201clittle people\u201d over the establishment and has appeared alongside Trump at rallies.</p> <p>Marte Sellura, 65, an artist, said: \u201cI feel we\u2019re in a similar situation to Brexit. I listen to Nigel Farage\u2019s speeches all the time. I feel that we in America are in tune with the British on immigration issues. America has woken up: there is a globalist agenda. Those things we though are conspiracy theories are not conspiracy theories any more; they\u2019re happening.\u201d</p> <p>Sellura, wearing a t-shirt depicted a rifle with the slogan: \u201cThe people will never surrender\u201d, also launched a critique familiar to consumers of conservative media such as Breitbart News and Fox News. \u201cThe polls are lying. We all know they\u2019re rigged. The real polls show him 10 or 15 points higher. The only way she can win is to have it rigged horribly. They all know they\u2019re going to steal it. There is massive evidence of voter fraud: dead people are voting, illegal immigrants are voting. It\u2019s been a Democratic tradition.\u201d</p> <p>Sellura also claimed that the involvement of TV presenter Billy Bush, cousin of George W Bush, in the lewd 11-year-old video that rocked Trump\u2019s campaign was evidence of a conspiracy by the \u201cBush-Clinton family\u201d. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re up against a crime family that makes the Russian mob and the Sicilian mobs look like schoolboys.\u201d</p> <p>Trump took his usual swipes at the \u201cdishonest\u201d media during Thursday\u2019s rally, eliciting boos and whistles. Chris Burton, 65, a building restorer, said: \u201cThe media are full of BS it\u2019s unbelievable that people don\u2019t go down and burn the newspapers out of existence. It\u2019s just lies.\u201d</p> <p>Most of those interviewed said they would have to accept the outcome and move on without a violent backlash, but not everyone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live under President Clinton,\u201d said one man, who did not wish to be named. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be a revolution. People will rise up and take over the government. A civil war has happened before so it\u2019s not unthinkable today.\u201d</p> <p>Queuing outside the arena was retired secretary Irena Rus, 75, from Melania Trump\u2019s home country, Slovenia. When she explained she had immigrated legally and learned English, Trump supporters congratulated her and shook her hand. Asked if Trump was losing, she pointed to the long queue and said: \u201cCan you see this? No, I don\u2019t think so, because the news media make him lose. He\u2019s doing a good job campaigning. He\u2019s the only one who speaks the truth.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Just like the concept of the cocktail itself, Halloween is not technically speaking an American invention, but also like the cocktail, you can\u2019t deny that American culture perfected it. </p> <p>Halloween and mixed drinks therefore go together like the peanut butter and chocolate in a Reese\u2019s cup \u2013 especially after the neighbourhood\u2019s children have slipped into a diabetic coma from eating the spoils of their trick or treating. </p> <p>In the spirit of the holiday, here are four tricks that will help make your adult libations a real treat this Halloween. <br></p> <h2><strong>1. Put an eyeball in your highball</strong></h2> <p> As the old bartender\u2019s saw goes, you take your first sip of a drink with your eyes \u2013 which is usually just another way to say that visual presentation is important. But you can make this saying somewhat more literal by garnishing your Halloween drinks with edible \u201ceyeballs\u201d, which can be made either sweet or savoury to match your drink. </p> <p> For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=188qPek61r4\">sweet eyeballs</a>, you\u2019ll need tinned and pitted lychees, fresh blueberries and some strawberry or raspberry jam. Drain the lychees, then stuff a little jam into each lychee\u2019s pitting hole until they\u2019re half-filled. Place a blueberry in at the front of each hole, which will become the eyeball\u2019s iris and pupil. If you like, you can paint some more jam around the exterior of the eyeball for an extra-grisly \u201cfreshly plucked\u201d effect. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMEuVY_jFi_/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Ihr sucht noch nach einer schnellen und einfachen Halloween Idee oder wollt einfach mal Freunde und Familie etwas erschrecken?

Wash the radishes and trim their tails, then lightly peel them, leaving flecks of the red skin behind. Slice the top off each radish, leaving a flat surface. Slice the olives in half to create a green iris and red pupil. Then, with a paring knife, carefully carve a small divot in the flat surface of each radish for the halved olives to sit in. </p> <p> If you really want to camp up the horror quotient, pair them with one of these two bloodthirsty classic cocktails: the blood and sand (sweet) or the bloody Mary (savoury).</p> <p><strong>Make it at home: blood and sand</strong></p> <p><strong>22.5ml scotch whisky<br>22.5ml sweet red vermouth<br>22.5ml cherry brandy (preferably Cherry Heering)<br>22.5ml freshly squeezed orange juice (or blood orange juice)</strong></p> <p> Build all ingredients in shaker.

Make a shimmering witch\u2019</strong><strong>s potion</strong></h2> <p> Whoever came up with the idea of Viniq liqueur was really on to something, at least as far as presentation goes. This shimmering, swirling liqueur might be a little bit, ahem, <em>de trop</em> for most bars, but it\u2019s perfect for adding a bit of supernatural sparkle to your Halloween cocktails. The only problem? It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.delish.com/cooking/videos/a43113/is-viniq-shimmery-vodkadelish-or-not-delish/\">not to everyone\u2019s taste</a>.</p> <p> You can get around that, though, by cutting out the middleman and going straight to the source of the shimmer: lustre dust (also known as pearl dust). Without this flavourless, edible powder (readily available in cake decorating specialty stores), Viniq would simply be a plain old mixture of flavoured vodka and moscato. Which means that you can apply the same shimmer to just about any translucent drink. Just add a tiny pinch of the powder (a little goes a long way) and stir until the lustre dust is fully incorporated, and your drink is as sparkly as unicorn poop. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/_uPYOxEbfl/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Putting #lustredust in #wine O.O</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A video posted by Clara McCourt (@aerisfelidae) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2015-12-25T17:04:18+00:00\">Dec 25, 2015 at 9:04am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Unless you\u2019re going to sparkle up a clear drink (magical martini, anyone?), go for the plain silver colour when purchasing your lustre dust.

Make a billowing pumpkin punch cauldron</strong></h2> <p> You wanna hear something real spooky? A woman who took a liquid nitrogen shot at a bar in Lancaster, England, was so badly effected by the cryogen inside it that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/17/oscars-wine-bar-lancaster-gaby-scanlon-stomach-liquid-nitrogen\">her stomach had to be removed and her oesophagus directly connected to her small bowel</a>. She later sued the bar for \u00a3100,000, which doesn\u2019t seem like a radical figure given that her lack of a stomach has basically ruined her life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/17/oscars-wine-bar-lancaster-gaby-scanlon-stomach-liquid-nitrogen\">Wine bar fined after woman's stomach removed following liquid nitrogen shot</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Cryogens are a serious health hazard, which is why I\u2019m amazed that a number of recipes still encourage readers to chuck a piece of dry ice in their cocktails to create a cool smoking effect. The gas itself (carbon dioxide) is harmless, but if any of that dry ice gets inside you or your guests, your night of spooky revelry could be cut short by a real horror show: a trip to the emergency room.</p> <p> The safer way to achieve that cool effect is to <a href=\"http://honestlyyum.com/6804/halloween-pumpkin-punch/\">create a multilayered punch bowl</a> that keeps the dry ice separate from the actual drink. Start by carving the top off a large pumpkin, and hollow it out to fit a large metal kitchen bowl. (Don\u2019t use glass \u2013 it could break from the extreme cold of the dry ice.) Using tongs or thermal gloves, place small chunks of dry ice inside this bowl, then place another, slightly smaller, metal kitchen bowl on top. Fill this bowl with a punch of your choosing, and when you\u2019re ready to serve, pour a small quantity of warm water in between the rims of the two bowls to activate the dry ice. If your cauldron stops smoking, add some more warm water or dry ice. (If you have small children at your Halloween party, keep the smoking cauldron out of their reach.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.359375% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMD4LKbgLqC/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Halloween weekend is coming \ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf3d We&#39;re open 7/7:  Tomorrow and saturday 9 - 19h Sunday 10 - 13h Monday 31 october 9 - 18h Tuesday 1 november 10 - 13 h ICE CUBES-CRUSHED-DRY ICE-ICE BLOCKS-ICE BUCKET \ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a\ud83c\udf2a Rue De La Glaci\u00e8re 38 Bruxelles - Ijskelderstraat 38 Brussel - parking \ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f \ud83d\udc7bWelcome\ud83d\udc7b #halloween #laglaci\u00e8re #ice #dryice #glacecarbonique #droogijs #ice #open #pumpkin #horeca #ijskelderstraat #ruedelaglaciere #effects #halloween16 #brussel #bruxelles #belgium</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by La Glaci\u00e8re \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea (@laglaciere) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-10-27T09:01:33+00:00\">Oct 27, 2016 at 2:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p> Now that you know how to make your cauldron, what should you put in it?

But if you\u2019re after something a little more fancy (but nonetheless easy), whip up a pisco punch \u2013 the famed drink of pre-prohibition San Francisco, with which Rudyard Kipling was so taken that he claimed it was \u201ccompounded of the shavings of cherub\u2019s wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset and the fragments of lost epics by dead masters\u201d.</p> <p> <strong>Make it at home: pisco punch</strong></p> <p><strong> 700ml (one bottle) Peruvian pisco<br>480ml still or sparkling mineral water<br>360ml freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice (strained)<br>240ml pineapple syrup (see below)<br>120ml Lillet rouge or Dubonnet (optional)</strong></p> <p> To make the pineapple syrup, peel a whole fresh pineapple and cut it into small (one inch) chunks. Place these chunks in a bowl and cover with a simple syrup made from two parts raw sugar to one part hot water. Place overnight in the refrigerator. Strain the syrup from the pineapple and keep the pineapple chunks for garnishing individual cups of punch.</p> <p> To make the punch, simply combine the ingredients in the punch bowl just before your guests arrive. For the pisco, look for a high-quality Peruvian one \u2013 Campo de Encanto is a recent entrant on the market and is now widely available. Make sure the lemon or lime juice is squeezed just before mixing into the punch \u2013 it can develop off flavours if prepared too far in advance. The mineral water is traditionally still, but can be sparkling if you\u2019d like a few bubbles. </p> <p>San Francisco bartender Duggan McDonnell adds a splash of Lillet rouge to his pisco punches to imitate the long-lost secret ingredient and red hue of Duncan Nicol\u2019s original pisco punch (the very one that inspired Kipling\u2019s reveries on the subject). If you can\u2019t find Lillet rouge, Dubonnet will perform the same trick, just a little less admirably.</p> <p> <strong>Pair it with a film: </strong>Justin Kurzel\u2019s 2015 adaptation of Macbeth \u2013 even if the Weird Sisters of Kurzel\u2019s film never actually say the famous \u201cDouble, double, toil and trouble\u201d line. </p> <h2><strong>4.

While the growing love affair with the <em>D\u00eda de Muertos</em> has become somewhat, ahem, <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/2537340/why-its-offensive-to-wear-a-day-of-the-dead-costume-for-halloween/\">problematic</a>, nobody will begrudge you if you raise a small salute to Mexico\u2019s unique religious traditions in the form of a delicious beverage.</p> <p> While the margarita might be the best-known of all Mexican mixed drinks, the most popular one inside Mexico is undoubtedly the paloma \u2013 a simple blend of tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda, with an optional salt rim. If you want to add a slightly goth air to your salt rim (it is Halloween, after all), pick up some black lava salt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFNoFfOLSlp/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">After a really long Monday, I am dreaming of a Strawberry Paloma Cocktail.

  "<p>Almost all human beings have the capacity for empathy. Everyone has the potential to be at least troubled, or feel genuine anguish, about the suffering of other human beings.

The responses were not representative of the decent majority: they were extreme sentiments but nonetheless instructive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry are we meant to feel sorry for these criminals??\u201d, asked one. \u201cOh well one less to drain Britain\u2019s economy got no sympathy for them,\u201d said another. \u201cNearly made it \u2026 bet was chuffed to bits!!!\u201d cackled another.

However these are not sociopaths, who make up a tiny fraction of the population. And there is a significant difference between glibly embracing a stranger\u2019s death on Twitter and killing them yourself.</p> <p>But the truth is that much of the violence throughout our species\u2019 bloodstained history was not inflicted by people incapable of empathy. Atrocities were committed by people who, in other scenarios, would help a pensioner cross the road, smile endearingly at a stranger\u2019s infant in a train carriage, or come to the assistance of someone they\u2019d never met before who was in distress.</p> <p>In the Balkan wars of the 1990s, neighbours, colleagues, even friends, <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2022-6-awful-things-i-learned-surviving-genocide.html\">murdered one another</a>. It didn\u2019t matter who they were: they were members of a group who, it was believed, posed an existential threat to the killers\u2019 own community.

Stripping away the humanity of Jews, Slavs and other \u201cundesirables\u201d was a precondition to murdering them. In the Polish town of Poznan in October 1943, Heinrich Himmler officially <a href=\"http://ww2history.com/key_moments/Holocaust/Himmler_s_Posen_speech\">confirmed</a> the Nazi Holocaust. \u201cWe must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else,\u201d he declared.</p> <p>There is no systematic industrialised attempt to exterminate millions of people today, but hundreds of thousands have perished in Syria\u2019s killing fields, and the UN describes the treatment of Yazidis as genocide. Our grim history is littered with other reminders of the logical extremes of dehumanisation. As social neuroscientist Professor Tania Singer <a href=\"https://www.cogneurosociety.org/empathy_pain/\">puts it</a>, a \u201cnatural capacity for empathic resonance can easily be blocked \u2013 not just in psychopaths \u2013 but in all of us: simply because we think someone was unfair or is not belonging to \u2018our tribe\u2019\u201d.

Political linguists have argued that the right often uses stories to make an argument, while the left falls back on facts and statistics. But we\u2019re human beings, not machines. Take the refugee crisis. What, at least momentarily, shifted attitudes? It was when a little Kurdish boy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\">Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up dead on a Turkish beach.

It\u2019s a story that always provokes a sharp intake of breath: mentioning the hundreds of thousands who have had their benefits stopped does not. Similarly, responding to a Daily Mail story about a benefit \u201cscrounger\u201d living in luxury with the government\u2019s own estimate of benefit fraud \u2013 that is, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/371459/Statistical_Release.pdf\">0.7% of social security spending</a> \u2013 doesn\u2019t work. The story trumps the statistic.</p> <p>Injustice becomes less tolerable if the victims are human beings rather than cockroaches. Dehumanisation leads to the tolerance of suffering at best, to murder at worst.

  "<p>Day of the Dead is the Mexican tradition celebrating the lives of friends and family who have died. Candles are lit and the souls of the departed are welcomed with cakes, sugar skulls, and breads decorated with edible \u201cbones\u201d. Processions and gatherings bring lightness even to the darkness of death. The Mexican poet Octavio Paz said it best: \u201cThe word \u2018death\u2019 is not pronounced in New York, in Paris, in London, because it burns the lips. The Mexican, in contrast, is familiar with death, jokes about it, caresses it, sleeps with it, celebrates it, it is one of his favourite toys and his most steadfast love.\u201d Rather than be afraid of death, the tradition embraces it.</p> <p>This sentiment has resonated with me since I spent a Day of the Dead in Mexico many years ago. Beautifully intricate candy skulls, cast from sugar and decorated with colourful icing and sprinkles, adorned homemade altars that were visible through doorways and windows in nearly every home.

Fireworks, huge bonfires, and effigies of Fawkes himself are lit all over the UK. This year, instead of lighting bonfires, you could just gather with friends and nibble on bonfire toffee. When made just right (not burnt), this bitter toffee has sweet characteristics enhanced by a touch of flaky salt.</p> <p>Both of this week\u2019s recipes call for a sugar thermometer, which are available cheaply in large cook shops, supermarkets and online.

  "<p>In 2016, hate travels fast. News that the Soldiers of Odin were <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/vigilantestyle-group-soldiers-of-odin-patrolling-melbourne-cbd-20161009-gry51g.html\">conducting vigilante patrols in Melbourne\u2019s CBD</a> coincided with reports of renewed activity by the group in Canada, a widening presence in the United States, as well as ongoing incidents at their point of origin, in Europe. </p> <p>The group was founded in Finland in late 2015 by Mika Ranta, who has a long history as a white supremacist activist. Members of the group in Finland are <a href=\"http://finlandtoday.fi/the-neo-nazi-attack-against-jimi-28-who-later-died-after-being-released-from-hospital-explained/\">allegedly responsible for the murder of a young anti-racist activist</a>. This year the group has exploded, in Europe and internationally. It\u2019s growth in the United States has been so rapid that the Anti Defamation League was moved to issue a special report on the group, which it described as an \u201canti-refugee vigilante group\u201d. </p> <p>The ADL noted that the group had thousands of Facebook supporters, an increasing presence on the streets throughout the country, and had been instrumental in activism opposed to the settlement of refugees in states like Montana. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/why-are-we-surprised-by-every-populist-politician-voting-for-them-can-be-a-rational-choice\">Why are we surprised by every populist politician? Voting for them can be a rational choice | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The central idea the Soldiers push is an association between Muslims \u2013 both refugees and immigrants \u2013 and crime. Alexander Reid Ross, a US-based anti-fascist researcher and author of the upcoming book, Against the Fascist Creep, says they are part of a \u201cradicalisation of the right that is grounded in the reaction to the spectre of \u2018refugees\u2019 and \u2018immigrants\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Their offer of protection is explicitly pitched at white fears about Arabs and other migrant groups. Their name and iconography refer directly to Norse mythology, which <a href=\"https://antifascistnews.net/2016/04/21/soldiers-of-odin-plan-meet-up-in-lodi-lake-ca-on-april-30th/\">they interpret in racial terms</a>. As Reid Ross puts it, \u201cthey explicitly present themselves as preservers and defenders of the white race in spiritual terms\u201d. </p> <p>In this context, one thing that sets them apart from other groups is their street patrols \u2013 an idea they\u2019ve brought to Melbourne. Alan Dutton works for the Canadian Anti-racism Education and Research Society (<a href=\"http://www.stopracism.ca/\">CAERS</a>). He says that in that country, patrols are one way that the Soldiers are \u201ctrying to appear to support civil responsibility. But that seems to be a strategy to gain social license to raise money and recruit members\u201d. </p> <p>He added that while the Soldiers discourage open, public racism in their online communities, and try to disavow the unapologetic white supremacism of European chapters, they \u201chave been unable to explain why, if they disavow racist violence, they assume the name of a racist and violent group\u201d.</p> <p>The same question could be asked of the Melbourne chapter, which similarly plays down the racist associations of their name and group. Indeed, the Age\u2019s reporting on the group has been criticised in some quarters for similarly backgrounding the group\u2019s far right associations. </p> <p>Kieran Bennett, an Australian political blogger and antifascist researcher, faulted the Age for not seeing that the Soldiers \u201care implementing a tried and tested racist strategy\u201d. Like many far right groups, they offer security that they say the state has failed to provide. </p> <p>\u201cFascist rhetoric centres around the idea that the state has failed the \u2018nation\u2019 in some way \u2026 they are purporting to react to this failure.\u201d</p> <p>In the US context, Reid Ross says that \u201cthey thrive off the anti-government movement, and its attempts at replacing the federal government with localised systems of right-wing, sovereign power\u201d, and there is a lot of crossover with so-called patriot groups and other right wing militia. </p> <p>In Melbourne, some of the members of the Soldiers of Odin have been drifting around the far right for a while. Long standing blogger and researcher on the far right in Australia, Andy Fleming, says the Soldiers\u2019 leader, Jay B Moore (who featured in the Age\u2019s report), was previously a member of the Patriots Defence League of Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re drawn from an already-existing milieu,\u201d he says, \u201cand you could argue for some of them it\u2019s a rebadging \u2013 they\u2019ve taken off they\u2019re PDLA gear and put on Soldiers of Odin gear instead.\u201d</p> <p>Given that the PDLA was itself a splinter group from the Australian Defence League, and that he estimates that the Soldiers in Melbourne number no more than 20, they need to be understood in the context of the fractious history of the far right. </p> <p>So far they have attended far right rallies and intermittently clashed with other far right groups like the True Blue Crew.

100 people, from European data scientists to gun-toting elderly call-center volunteers. They labor in offices lined with Trump iconography and Trump-focused inspirational quotes from Sheriff Joe Arpaio and evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. </p> <p>To compensate for this, Trump\u2019s campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d says a senior official. They\u2019re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans. Trump\u2019s invocation at the debate of Clinton\u2019s WikiLeaks emails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are \u201csuper predators\u201d is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls \u2013 particularly in Florida.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaGreen/status/791587739246309376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.
