  "<p>At the Rio Olympics they crossed the line together in triumph, winning gold and silver in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/triathlon\">triathlon</a>, but on Monday the Brownlee brothers provided a possibly even more enduring image as Alistair, the elder, helped his distressed sibling, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/jonny-brownlee\">Jonny</a>, cross the finishing line.</p> <p>The Brownlees were competing in the final race of triathlon\u2019s World Series in Mexico, where victory in a stiflingly humid Cozumel with their main rival \u2013 Spain\u2019s Mario Mola \u2013 finishing no higher than fourth, would have made Jonny world champion.

Let him come home'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They joined many of his other detractors in making old and factually incorrect arguments about what Snowden actually did. As the movement demanding his exoneration grows nonetheless, here are five common misconceptions about the whistleblower \u2013 and why they are wrong. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not take 1.5m documents and dump them en masse on the internet </strong></h2> <p>Snowden critics love to pretend that everything the public learned from his disclosures was solely because he chose to release the information. In reality, the number of documents that Snowden published himself is zero. Instead of dumping a mass of documents on the internet, he gave them to experienced national security reporters who worked at some of the most respected news outlets in the country. He relied on their judgments about what was in the public interest. And those reporters allowed the government to make objections (some of which they listened to) tied to national security concerns. </p> <p>The Washington Post claimed, as others have in the past, that Snowden copied and kept 1.5m classified documents. Snowden\u2019s lawyer, Ben Wizner, has called that number \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777885903024975873\">absurd</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/777899804076670976\">made up</a>\u201d. Even the former NSA director himself admitted that the 1.5m number only represented the documents that Snowden \u201ctouched\u201d, and officials didn\u2019t know how many he actually took.</p> <p>The real number is likely at least an order of magnitude lower, according to public comments by the journalists involved, which the Post editorial board could have found out if they had bothered to ask their own colleagues.</p> <h2><strong>There\u2019s no evidence Snowden \u2018harmed national security\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The House intelligence committee published an error-riddled report on Snowden last week, making vague claims about \u201cdamage\u201d to national security in a naked attempt to counter the narrative in Oliver Stone\u2019s movie. Three-time Pulitzer prize winner Barton Gellman <a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/\">dismantled the whole report point-by-point</a> on his blog.</p> <p>We know the US government makes all sorts of dire predictions when information is leaked to the press (the Pentagon Papers, the Chelsea Manning disclosures and the release of the torture report, to name a few cases), and it is always caught exaggerating. The Snowden disclosures are no exception. As the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131224/01373925683/james-clapper-admits-private-that-hes-really-not-too-concerned-about-terrorists-changing-communications-after-snowden.shtml\">reported two years ago</a>:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>[Director of national intelligence James] Clapper has said repeatedly in public that the leaks did great damage, but in private he has taken a more nuanced stance. A review of early damage assessments in previous espionage cases, he said in one closed-door briefing this fall, found that dire forecasts of harm were seldom borne out. </p> </blockquote> <p>The House intelligence committee did not point to a single concrete example of how national security was harmed solely by the Snowden disclosures. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden could not go through \u2018proper channels\u2019 to blow the whistle </strong></h2> <p>The idea that Snowden is not a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d because he didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/nsa-email-snowden-surveillance-internal-whistleblowing\">go through</a> internal government channels to make his claims is absurd on two fronts. First, at the time Snowden gave his material to the Guardian and Washington Post, he was a government contractor, and contractors were exempt from most whistleblower protections given to national security employees. (Politifact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-nsa-leaker-snowden-failed-use-whistle/\">called Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement</a> that he had access to whistleblower protections \u201cmostly false\u201d.)</p> <p>But this argument is a red herring anyway. Snowden was not blowing the whistle on some rogue NSA agent or a program that only a handful of people knew about. These mass surveillance programs (later ruled illegal) were approved at the highest levels of the executive branch and by the Fisa court. Snowden would have essentially been telling his superiors, who already knew about them and were tasked with carrying them out, that they themselves were breaking the law. </p> <h2><strong>Snowden did not \u2018flee\u2019 to Russia and has regularly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights record</strong></h2> <p>There is a persistent yet false accusation that since Snowden is in exile in Russia, he \u201cfled\u201d there and has cooperated with the Russian government (in the words of the Post\u2019s editorial, \u201cMr Snowden hurt his own credibility as an avatar of freedom by accepting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/snowden-leaves-moscow-airport-to-live-in-russia/2013/08/01/2f2d1aba-faa9-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html\">asylum</a> from Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin\u201d). </p> <p>This is false. The only reason he is in Russia is because the US government canceled his passport as he was transiting through the Russian airport to Latin America. He was marooned there against his will. Everyone, including Snowden himself, wishes he wasn\u2019t in Russia, but the alternative is being thrown in a maximum security prison in the United States. At least right now he is <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/edward-snowden-life-as-a-robot.html\">free to participate in the international debate virtually</a>. </p> <p>Snowden has harshly criticized Russia\u2019s human rights and civil liberties record so many times at this point that it is hard to count (including, in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/vladimir-putin-surveillance-us-leaders-snowden\">in an op-ed for the Guardian</a>). Snowden\u2019s condemnation has been so strong that the former US ambassador to Russia (and Snowden critic) Michael McFaul recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/751752731769999360\">tweeted</a>: \u201c@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden\">Snowden</a> makes a stronger statement about human rights regression in Russia than anything I ever said as [Ambassador]. Wow.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>He cannot make his case to a jury in what the Post called the \u2018best tradition of civil disobedience\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a perfect world, Snowden could come home and tell his story to a jury, as many of his critics say he should. However, this belies a fundamental misunderstanding of the law Snowden is charged under. The Espionage Act \u2013 a first world war-era statute meant for spies, not whistleblowers who give information to the press \u2013 does not allow for a \u201cpublic interest\u201d defense. Snowden would literally not be allowed to tell the jury his motive for leaking the information, describe the benefits of the disclosures, or discuss their lack of harm to national security. <br></p> <p>The most famous whistleblower in American history, Daniel Ellsberg, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-ellsberg-snowden-fair-trial-kerry-espionage-act\">made this point</a> repeatedly and is on the record as saying that Snowden was right to leave the country so he could continue to participate in the public debate around his disclosures. </p> <p><em>Edward Snowden sits on the board of directors at Freedom of the Press Foundation, where the author is executive director </em></p>",
  "<p>New and more effective. That\u2019s how Theresa May describes the migration policy she proposed to the world on Monday ahead of the UN general assembly . The prime minister wants to combat migration by helping more refugees to stay in the first country they reach; by distinguishing better between people fleeing war, and those fleeing poverty; and by giving countries more licence to protect their borders by force, or with a fence. Wrapped within this three-part plan is the implicit idea that it is better to enable developing countries than to offer sanctuary to the refugees stuck in them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/18/angela-merkels-refugee-policy-must-succeed-for-europes-sake\">Angela Merkel\u2019s refugee policy must succeed \u2013 for Europe\u2019s sake | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de </a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the global context, May\u2019s comments are something of a sideshow; a British leader\u2019s interventions in world affairs arguably matter less today than at any stage in the past few centuries. But it\u2019s useful to examine May\u2019s vision.</p> <p>In short: it is neither particularly effective, nor new. The first plank of her plan \u2013 the suggestion that more refugees should be encouraged to stay in the first country they reach \u2013 is not a new idea. This is the status quo \u2013 and the situation that is driving migration in the first place.</p> <p>Just look at the statistics. More than 86% of refugees live in the developing world, and the vast majority of them live in the first country they reach. Almost all of the refugees in Turkey, which has the world\u2019s largest refugee population, have crossed the border from neighbouring Syria or Iraq. Lebanon hosts more refugees per capita and per square kilometre than any other; its 1.2&#xa0;million Syrian refugees also came from next door. The Somalis at the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Kenya came from the next country along. The three million Afghans in Pakistan crossed just one border too.</p> <p>So the problem is not that too few refugees are staying in neighbouring countries. It\u2019s that too many are forced to do so. Since the west has refused to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees from the Middle East, or from Pakistan or east Africa, those refugees have been forced to choose between a life of limbo \u2013 in places where they do not have access to education, healthcare or work rights \u2013 or irregular migration to the west. And in 2015, a significant minority chose the latter, leading to what we have termed the European refugee crisis.</p> <p>If May wants a new and effective policy, then organised resettlement \u2013 and the provision of safe and legal routes \u2013 is one option available to her. Instead, Britain was at the heart of behind-the-scenes moves to take out a pledge to resettle 10% of the world\u2019s refugees from a new treaty signed on Monday at the UN summit in New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cbf4e510a84daaf236267f25668a6720dd08627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cbf4e510a84daaf236267f25668a6720dd08627/881_238_1361_1701/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lifejackets that have been used by refugees to cross the sea to Europe and representing refugees who have died trying to reach Europe since 2015 are laid out in Parliament Square as the UN Migration Summit takes place in New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lifejackets that have been used by refugees to cross the sea to Europe and representing refugees who have died trying to reach Europe since 2015 are laid out in Parliament Square as the UN Migration Summit takes place in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about the increased border protection May speaks of? It\u2019s certainly not new. This has been the knee-jerk migration policy of choice in Europe over the past 15 years. It\u2019s not very effective, with walls simply shifting migrants elsewhere, and often forces them into the hands of smugglers. Increased policing of the Canary islands\u2019 maritime borders, and ever-higher fences between Morocco and Spain, proved meaningless once migration routes shifted through Libya. Greece and Bulgaria\u2019s two fences along their respective Turkish borders saw migrants take new routes to the Greek islands. Hungary\u2019s Serbian fence routed people west through Croatia. And while Macedonia\u2019s fence along its Greek border has significantly reduced Balkan migration numbers this year, at least 25,000 people have still passed through the Balkans since the Macedonian fenceborder was sealed in March.</p> <p>What\u2019s next on May\u2019s shopping list? Differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. Taken at face value, this suggestion is at best misguided. One of the lessons I\u2019ve learnt from reporting on migration in more than 20 countries is that the line between who\u2019s fleeing poverty and who\u2019s fleeing war is rarely clear-cut. How do you classify someone who left Senegal to find work in Libya, but then fled Libya to escape a war? What about a Syrian who reached Turkey from bombed-out Aleppo, and then left Turkey because he wasn\u2019t allowed to work?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/25/theresa-may-scrapping-minister-syria-refugees-disgraceful\">Theresa May's scrapping of minister for refugees 'utterly disgraceful'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May isn\u2019t interested in such nuances. She isn\u2019t after better definitions \u2013 she simply wants to change them so that fewer vulnerable people qualify for legal protection in Britain. Again, this isn\u2019t new. Last year, the Home Office, which she ran, adopted highly controversial guidelines that made it far harder for Eritreans to qualify for asylum in Britain. This change in classification didn\u2019t make things better \u2013 a few months later a UN committee accused the Eritrean government of committing widespread crimes against humanity against its own people. But it did reduce the number of people able to seek sanctuary in the UK.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s the implicit suggestion that investment in developing countries should be pursued at the expense of resettlement programmes. Development is indeed essential in the general sense, and in the long term it may reduce migration. But migration researchers have shown it is no silver bullet. As specialists such as <a href=\"http://heindehaas.blogspot.com/2011/05/development-leads-to-more-migration.html?m=1\" title=\"\">Hein de Haas have explained: \u201cEmigration initially goes up with levels of development</a>, and only goes down once countries move into high development categories. It indicates that if poor countries become wealthier, emigration will increase.\u201d</p> <p>The world certainly needs new and more effective means of addressing protracted refugee crises. But the ideas set out by Theresa May don\u2019t fall in either category.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/nujeen-mustafa-syria-isis-germany\" title=\"\">idea of a refugee</a> or a displaced person means different things to different people. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\" title=\"\">the human suffering they encompass</a> is often much the same. Europeans might envisage families in leaky boats adrift in the Mediterranean, or quietly determined crowds trekking northwards along highways. For people in the Middle East, it might be row upon row of tents in a refugee camp; for Africans, stories of men, women and children trafficked across the Sahel, only to end up in a sordid detention centre run by militias in Libya. In Asia, it might be desperate boat people being turned back, or the island camps where those who hope to find a new life in Australia find themselves detained.</p> <p>Across the globe, the 21st century has become an era of disruption and exodus. An&#xa0;unprecedented 65 million people are fleeing war or persecution, or migrating in search of training, an education or a job. The response is asymmetrical: most refugees only go as far as a neighbouring country. According to Britain\u2019s Refugee Council, 44% of refugees are in the Middle East and Africa, and 27% in Europe. Turkey, Pakistan and Lebanon are all sheltering more than 1 million from Syria and Afghanistan. The UK, according to the UNHCR, hosts about 170,000.</p> <p>And beyond the human trauma, there are the geopolitical consequences. The stability of democracies is jeopardised when scenes of chaotic population movements fuel demagoguery and populism; authoritarian regimes or their proxies exploit refugee flows as weapons of war to destabilise adversaries whose resources will be suddenly stretched, or as a technique to score points in a diplomatic negotiation. Against that backdrop, <a href=\"http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit\" title=\"\">a UN summit</a> devoted to the crisis can only be applauded \u2013 especially considering the topic had never been addressed before in a diplomatic gathering of all nations. Yet to many, today\u2019s event in New York turned out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\" title=\"\">to be a disappointment</a>.</p> <p>It is more than 60 years since the world agreed that such huge population flows were a matter of global responsibility. Now the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/1951-refugee-convention.html\" title=\"\">Geneva convention on refugees</a>, signed by 144 states in 1951, is facing a profound threat as politicians respond to domestic pressure by looking for ways to evade its obligations. Across the world, the power of a global moral imperative is being undermined by the rise of nationalism and identity politics, driven partly by a traditional fear of the other, partly by the impact of recession on governments\u2019 capacity to provide public services.</p> <p>At the UN this week, there will be much empathy and little concrete action. The great hope of the NGOs and other humanitarian lobbyists was for a commitment for the global north to resettle 10% of the world\u2019s refugees. Instead, although the text of what is to be known as the <a href=\"https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/declaration\" title=\"\">New York declaration</a> recognises the scale of the crisis, it fails to lay out concrete measures. Signatories are asked to continue to work towards a global compact to be reached by 2018. Whether the second summit, convened by President Obama, will do any better seems uncertain. Its objective is to encourage individual state pledges of aid to refugees, not develop a global strategy.</p> <p>All of this leaves unaddressed the no less important matter of preventing or resolving the conflicts that drive mass migration. Hopes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/week-old-syrian-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance\" title=\"\">a ceasefire in Syria</a> have all but dwindled. Alone, this conflict has forced 12&#xa0;million people from their homes in the last&#xa0;five years.</p> <p>The wider picture is that politicians across the world feel little incentive to act \u2013 after all, refugees have no voice, no vote, and scant organisation. The moral commitment to them was made in the aftermath of what the world\u2019s leaders thought was an unrepeatable catastrophe. It was not supposed to happen again. In that context, small as the results of the refugee summit appear, the mere restatement of the commitment was a small victory. Now President Obama will hope at least to incentivise some positive action.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the paradox: political leaders won\u2019t reduce the risks they fear for themselves (and their careers) by sitting idle in the face of an unprecedented exodus. Creating safe channels for refugees and organising migration routes, not building fences, may be a better way. It has been tried before. Thirty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese boat people were saved by a coordinated and comprehensive plan. Globalisation increases mobility. Instead of resisting it, nations should consider organising it. Save lives, rather than&#xa0;creating conditions that only aid the people smugglers. Inaction breeds more chaos, not&#xa0;less.</p>",
  "<p>A reported 55% of the Syrians who have been given protection in the UK under the Syrian resettlement programme are torture survivors, according to the National Audit Office. <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Syrian-Vulnerable-Persons-Resettlement-programme.pdf\" title=\"\">The NAO report</a>, a review of the progress of the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme (VPRS), highlights concerns of human rights charity Freedom from Torture that these vulnerable people are not able to access specialist help so that they can begin a journey of rehabilitation and rebuilding their shattered lives. Freedom from Torture provided input to the report after raising repeatedly with the former minister for Syrian refugees the need to ensure that all of those resettled under this scheme can access specialist support including torture rehabilitation.</p> <p>Without these services it can be difficult for survivors to address the trauma they have faced and to access other opportunities that are being provided, such as English language lessons. Since the launch of the scheme we have received only a few referrals for resettled Syrians and we are concerned that many more are being resettled in areas where they cannot access support. Our concerns are shared by local authorities, which highlighted that those refugees with physical or mental health needs require substantial support, especially in&#xa0;the long-term, which is not covered by&#xa0;existing funding arrangements.</p> <p>We welcome the UK\u2019s commitment to&#xa0;provide sanctuary to torture survivors and other vulnerable Syrians through this programme and to meet its arguably modest goal of accepting 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020. As the only UK-based human rights organisation dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation of torture survivors, we know that torture is widespread in Syria. This scheme\u2019s objective is to help the most vulnerable, so we are surprised not to have more being referred to our centres. Torture survivors risk being either identified too late or missed entirely. The government needs to immediately improve its coordination with specialist voluntary sector providers. The amount of funding given to local authorities to support each refugee will be reviewed after the programme has been in operation for a year. We strongly recommend that mental health services are included in the programme without delay so that torture survivors coming in the next wave of the refugee resettlement scheme get the vital support and services they need and deserve.<br><strong>Susan Munroe</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"https://www.freedomfromtorture.org\" title=\"\"><em>Freedom from Torture</em></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

It lies behind a high stone wall in the centre of Grantchester, the little village outside Cambridge that has long been a favourite with students on a pre-pub stroll. Visitors enter through a little gate into a sprawling, slightly overgrown garden that surrounds the whole house. Blumenfeld\u2019s sculptures stand in leafy corners. On a hot August day it feels as if an ancient temple is being disturbed.</p> <p>Blumenfeld is one of the most respected sculptors of her generation, regarded by some as the heir to Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Her marbles and bronzes are more abstracted than those of her artistic forebears, and they stand in prominent locations around the UK. A new exhibition will see a large piece unveiled in Canary Wharf, London, later this month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6537739679a2c01f007bcec8190907814c8387b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6537739679a2c01f007bcec8190907814c8387b/0_1060_3682_2210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taking shape: Blumenfeld in the light-filled room she uses as a studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking shape: Blumenfeld in the light-filled room she uses as a studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For someone with such burnished credentials, however, the artist in person is welcoming and friendly. \u201cWelcome to the only 15-bedroom one-bedroom house I know,\u201d she says. \u201cOriginally it had six.

Speaking to reporters in Brighton, he said: \u201cYour presumption is that all the 48% who voted to remain in Europe would want to see a second referendum. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.

Upon them not only rests the next installment of bailout aid \u2013 at \u20ac2.8bn critical for the debt-wracked economy - but the onset of official debate over what to do about Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load, at 180% of national output by far the highest in the eurozone. \u201cThe idea is to push the multi-bill with all these measures through parliament this week,\u201d said one well-placed source.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1822cf2e6697073542e66e07f00d9f40fcc2e5f/0_133_3979_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras at last wek\u2019s informal EU summit in Bratislava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Among the measures will be the appointment of a supervisory board for the country\u2019s new privatisation fund - an issue Athens has rowed about vociferously with creditors \u2013 and the formal inclusion of several loss-making public entities in the body. </p> <p>With Greece\u2019s debt-repayment timetable far from pressing, creditors - though peaved with the slow pace of reforms - are not piling on the pressure. Instead it is the government, that feeling the pinch of public hostility, is now keen to move on to the next step of passing the reforms so the Euro Working Group can agree to disburse the aid when it next meets on September 29.

The mistake, the chancellor said, was that she and her government had not been quicker to prepare for the mass movement of people triggered by conflicts in the Middle East. </p> <p>\u201cIf I was able to, I would turn back time by many, many years, so that I could have prepared the whole government and the authorities for the situation which hit us out of the blue in the late summer of 2015,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/angela-merkels-party-suffers-slump-in-berlin-election\"> Sunday\u2019s election</a> ushered in a new era of multi-party politics for the German capital, with the two governing establishment parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic party (SPD) plummeting to the worst Berlin result in their parties\u2019 histories, while the leftwing Die Linke and anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) enjoyed impressive gains.</p> <p>On Monday, Merkel admitted she had failed to sufficiently explain her refugee policy, and that her phrase \u201c<em tabindex=\"-1\">Wir schaffen das\u201d </em>(\u201cWe will manage\u201d) had provoked some of those who did not agree with her political course. Her words will be interpreted as an olive branch to the leader of her CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), who has repeatedly called on her to distance herself from the much-cited slogan.</p> <p>For too long, Merkel said, she had relied on procedure according to the Dublin resolution, \u201cwhich, to put it simply, had taken the problem off Germany\u2019s hands\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that was not good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56b8d2837d6cfe2161c9570cd7c597e32a23a18/0_4_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georg Pazderski, the Berlin leader of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.

Banning people from entering the country on the basis of their religion, she said, would be incompatible with Germany\u2019s constitution and her own party\u2019s \u201cethical foundations\u201d.</p> <p>She lamented that the European Union as a whole was failing to recognise the refugee crisis as \u201ca global and a moral challenge\u201d. \u201cWhat we are seeing in Europe is a realisation that we are no longer leading the field when it comes to globalisation, we are not setting the pace.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1990, when the wall fell, the cold war came to an end and freedom blossomed everywhere; it looked like we were on an irreversible road to victory, and that it was just up to the rest of the world to join our model. Freedom had won. It now turns out things aren\u2019t that simple\u201d.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s result served to illustrate the extent to which party political landscapes across Europe are becoming ever more fractured. The Social Democrats had unwittingly hit the nail on the head when predicting in their poster campaign that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LorenzMaroldt/status/777795404893151232\">\u201cBerlin will stay multifaceted\u201d</a>.</p> <p>AfD\u2019s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski, on Monday hailed his party as \u201cthe biggest democratic project of the last few decades\u201d after it entered its 10th state parliament in a row. The AfD had managed to mobilise 64,000 \u201cnon-voters\u201d, as opposed to 41,000 \u201cnon-voters\u201d who gave their support to all the other parties put together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrikenderlein/status/777592756386529286\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Schaut auf diese Stadt.<br>Reicher Rand West: CDU<br>Armer Rand Ost: AfD<br>Urban West SPD<br>Urban Ost: Linke<br>Gentrified: Gr\u00fcn <a href=\"https://t.co/irmFWElbFj\">pic.twitter.com/irmFWElbFj</a></p>&mdash; Henrik Enderlein (@henrikenderlein) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrikenderlein/status/777592756386529286\">September 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The fledgling party profited most in the suburbs in the formerly communist east, such as Treptow-K\u00f6penick (with 20% of the vote), Lichtenberg (30%), and Marzahn-Hellersdorf (23.2%), areas in which many lower-income residents have been considerably affected by rising living costs, and where many were outraged when refugee accommodation was built without them being consulted.</p> <p>The AfD also secured 12.2% in the adjacent working-class district of former west Berlin, Neuk\u00f6lln, where many long-term residents accuse the longstanding SPD leaders of insufficiently protecting the district\u2019s residents and actively supporting gentrification.</p> <p>But it was in Pankow \u2013 a district in the north of Berlin which includes the trendy, gentrified Prenzlauer Berg area \u2013 that the AfD\u2019s performance was most surprising, as it got more votes (13.8%) than the CDU (12.6%).</p> <p>The CDU, which fell back to its worst result since the end of the second world war, unsurprisingly received its strongest support in the well-off suburbs to the west, such as Reinickendorf and Steglitz-Zehlendorf, where the party has always had a solid support base.

One moment Jonny Brownlee is striding to victory in the final World Triathlon Series race of the season, about to become world champion for the second time; the next his legs buckle beneath him as if punched by an invisible haymaker. Then, just as Jonny is stumbling like a drunk into an official, his elder brother, Alistair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\">swoops to the rescue</a>, hooking his arm around his shoulder and helping him to cross the line in second place. Jonny then slumps to the floor, floppy and desperately spent from heatstroke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\">Alistair Brownlee gives up chance to win World Triathlon race and helps brother Jonny over line</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pictures of these two brothers in arms brought to mind a hobbling Derek Redmond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/30/50-stunning-olympic-moments-derek-redmond\">being helped to finish the men\u2019s 400m in the 1992 Olympics by his father</a> or perhaps the American Abbey D\u2019Agostino and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/17/olympic-spirit-new-zealand-and-american-runners-help-each-other-after-collision\">aiding each other after a collision</a> during the 5,000m at the Rio Olympics. There were thousands of retweets when the videos were posted on social media and praise from other athletes, such as Jessica Ennis-Hill.</p> <p>It was a vital intervention. Jonny\u2019s condition was serious enough for him to be taken to hospital, thus missing the podium presentation. Alistair said: \u201cIf he\u2019d conked out before the finish line and there wasn\u2019t medical support it could have been really dangerous. It was a natural human reaction to my brother but for anyone I would have done the same thing. I think it\u2019s as close to death as you can be in sport.\u201d</p> <p>Yet for all the kudos and praise that has \u2013 rightly \u2013 been directed their way, it would be wrong to sugarcoat what happened on Sunday in Mexico. Alistair was intervening not only to stop his brother falling but also to try to help him win the world title. The mathematics were simple.</p> <p>Alistair was out of the running for the world title having missed a number of races earlier in the season and he knew Jonny had to win the final race in Cozumel, with the Spaniard Mario Mola finishing no higher than fourth, to take the top prize. All was going to plan until Jonny pushed too hard in the heat, losing the race to the South African Henri Schoeman and the world championship to Mola. A not entirely sympathetic Alistair said afterwards: \u201cI wish the flipping idiot had just paced it right and won the race. He could have jogged the last two kilometres.\u201d</p> <p>Some might consider that remark a little raw but that is how the brothers are, simultaneously encouraging, chiding, bickering, helping each other to become the world\u2019s best triathletes while also refusing to waste an opportunity to take the mickey. The pair are enormously bright: if it had not been for triathlon Alistair would have gone to the University of Cambridge and Jonny to Durham and they like to get one over on each other, physically and intellectually, whenever they can.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-gives-chance-win-helps-brother-jonny-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53kh9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2731302\"            data-video-name=\"Alistair Brownlee gives up chance to win race and helps brother Jonny \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITU\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dfa172e4b0c762d480de1f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/19/Brownlees_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/19/Brownlees_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11895070&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-gives-chance-win-helps-brother-jonny-video\">Alistair Brownlee gives up chance to win race and helps brother Jonny</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Alistair was just as cutting when Jonny collapsed at the finish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/alistair-brownlee-olympic-triathlon-jonny\">having won bronze at the London 2012 Olympics</a>. Jonny was unable to walk or stand for an hour and was vomiting through his nose. The reaction of Alistair, who had sprinted away to win gold? \u201cI wasn\u2019t too worried. I\u2019d seen Jonny like that before and I knew he would be OK. Of more concern was that he might have to stand on the Olympic podium wearing only his shorts: his special tracksuit was soaked with sweat and covered in blue vomit.\u201d</p> <p>Then there were the Games in Rio last month. With the 1500m swim and 40km bike completed, Jonny and Alistair were out on the road on the run in front, battling for Olympic gold and silver. Then Jonny uttered one word to his brother \u2013 \u201crelax\u201d \u2013 and Alistair, who interpreted it as a sign of weakness, attacked to retain his title.</p> <p>Not that this brotherly battle is a one-way street. In their autobiography, Swim Bike Run, Jonny admits that when Alistair \u2013 then a 20-year-old outsider \u2013 was leading the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he was desperately thinking: \u201cThis is the Olympics. It\u2019s special. You can\u2019t have my brother winning it.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about their relationship a couple of years ago, Alistair said: \u201cJonny would deny it to the core but I think his entire life has been about trying to compete with me. Trying to get level with me and then beat me.

Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thank you to Apulina and Raestory for your questions. I have voiced my support for decriminalisation in the past, motivated by not wanting those engaged in prostitution to become criminals, but I recognise there are a range of passionately-held views by those currently in sex work, and those such as Raestory, who identify themselves as survivors, by campaigners, and women\u2019s rights activists. All these people have women\u2019s interests and equality at heart. Where we can agree is that women in prostitution and sex work should not be criminalised or stigmatised, and have their human and citizen rights protected, and have access to the support of social, health, public services and justice. This is no less than all women deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that a \u201chard\u201d Brexit would eliminate most manufacturing in the UK. </strong>Someone asked him about Brexit, saying that one notable economist has said a \u201chard\u201d Brexit would mostly eliminate manufacturing.

I always try to see something good in all the people I am dealing with. And whilst the mainstream media have been fairly hostile it\u2019s not my experience when travelling around the country and indeed in my office we have a wall of postcards from people of all ages from all parts of the country giving positive supportive opinions and wishing us well. Politics is too often done in a over-adversarial way which involves personal abuse and name-calling. I don\u2019t do any of that and i don\u2019t think anyone else should either.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that socialism was a \u201cnatural instinct\u201d to him.</strong> Asked what inspired him to become a socialist, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Socialism is a natural instinct to me, one that shares wealth and resources, gives opportunities to all and recognises the limits of exploitation of our natural environment. I have many political influences, from my mother and father and also as a late teenager living and working in Jamaica and travelling throughout Latin America, I could see the dreadful levels of inequality there. Later as a trade union organiser seeing the way in which we can challenge injustice at the workplace and inequality through trade union membership.

In<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/09/17/the-royal-yacht-should-sail-again/\"> an editorial</a> the paper said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit, and the need to negotiate new trade deals, is calling the royal yacht back to service. A debate has begun over whether or not to return Britannia to sea or to commission a replacement. It has demonstrated its potential before: Britannia brought in an estimated \u00a33 billion in commercial deals between 1991 and 1995. Now that the UK is taking back control of its national trade arrangements from Brussels, engagement with countries such as Australia and Canada is primed to begin. Britain is rediscovering its ancient role as a seafaring, mercantile power. In that context, the symbolism of the royal yacht is striking.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when the spokesman was asked if the prime minister supported this campaign, he said the government was looking at \u201ca number of ways\u201d in which the government could achieve its ambition of turning the UK into a \u201cglobal leader for free trade\u201d. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as I\u2019m aware, the recommissioning of Britannia is not on the agenda for that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street defended the work of the Iraq Historical Abuse Team, following reports today that</strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3795778/David-Cameron-overruled-wanted-end-Iraq-abuse-probes.html\"><strong> David Cameron tried to close it down when he was prime minister</strong>. </a>The spokesman said that the work of IHAT had recently been reviewed and that the review found it to be \u201cwell led and operating well\u201d. It would soon be moving to a position where it had a much reduced caseload, he said, and it was expected it would finish its work by the end of 2019.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said the government was raising the case of the \u201cChennai Six\u201d at the highest level with the Indian government - but he refused to say if the government thought they had been wrongly jailed.</strong><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1807193/british-war-heroes-rotting-in-indian-prison-for-crimes-they-didnt-commit-beg-for-government-to-help-them/\"> Campaigners claim that the six former British servicemen, who were jailed for having weapons which they say they were using legitimately for anti-piracy work, are victims of a miscarriage of justice.</a> The spokesman said that Theresa May was aware of the case and that British consular officials were \u201cproviding a full package of support\u201d. The case has also been raised with the Indian government \u201cat the highest level\u201d, the spokesman said.

When it was put to him that Johnson had called him \u201cincompetent\u201d, \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cincapable\u201d, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very kind of Alan. How generous of him ... Alan hasn\u2019t fully understood what my concerns were in the past. My concerns were when a Labour government led by Tony Blair took us into war in Iraq, I opposed that. When he tried to bring in, and indeed did bring in, tuition fees, I opposed him on that. I think he should understand my opposition to those issues was on the politics of it. I didn\u2019t indulge in that language that many have used against me, and I never will. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a flavour of what Johnson said in the interview.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Corbyn] is totally incompetent and incapable of being the leader of a political party and he knows it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a huge ego but it\u2019s got bigger and he\u2019s self-righteous. There\u2019s this adulation out there, it goes to your head. No compromise with the electorate was the left\u2019s theme in the early Eighties and God forbid we go back to that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn rejected suggestions that he was avoiding giving interviews to mainstream media outlets. </strong>Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Corbyn, said this was the first interview with Today Corbyn had agreed to do since the leadership contest started. Citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-should-be-tougher-not-my-style\">what Corbyn said in his Guardian interview on Saturday about how \u201ccommunication is everything\u201d </a>, Robinson put it to him that if he avoided interviews with the mainstream media, he could not win an election. Corbyn did not accept this. He insisted that he had done plenty of media:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the deepest and greatest respect to the Today programme - I know it\u2019s the most important radio programme on the whole planet - it is not the only radio programme on the whole planet. So, yes, of course we will be reaching as best we can to all forms of communication ...</p> <p>It is not the only radio programme.

Coyle, who was one of the Labour MPs named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/14/corbyns-team-mistakenly-issues-list-of-mps-who-undermined-leader\">on a list of supposed abusive rebels released by the Corbyn camp last week,</a>said that if Corbyn was re-elected, he and his supporters would \u201cjust continue to cause abuse\u201d. Referring to the list Coyle said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this is their attempt at reaching out or an attempt at engagement, then they are failing abysmally. He [Mr Corbyn] knew about it and did nothing to stop it being drawn up, did nothing to stop it being published, and has done nothing to demonstrate that he is interested in a unified party, which is why I say to any Labour members still listening who haven\u2019t voted yet, they still have until Wednesday to make sure we end this nonsense. </p> <p>They are not interested in party unity. If they are re-elected, they will just continue to cause abuse. A year ago, the kind of abuse we are seeing in British politics, certainly on the left, was not there. Either by incompetence of design, it has happened under Jeremy\u2019s watch and he should take some responsibility for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Coyle said that some members of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group, were \u201cpragmatic and want to win and want to engage with voters\u201d. But he said some Momentum activists were on the hard left and that Corbyn and John McDonnell were encouraging them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a section who aren\u2019t interested in Labour winning the election, and are interested in only having a particular ideology and -ism at the top of the party.

He was asked why he thought being able to get hundreds of people to attend a rally could lead to him gaining power. Corbyn said that tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real \u201cinterest in politics\u201d, he said. The crowds were \u201cpretty diverse\u201d, he went on, and quite different from the sort of people who used to turn up to hear him speak before he became Labour leader.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That then becomes, surely, a very strong campaigning basis for the Labour movement, becomes a campaigning factor in towns and cities where there\u2019s never been very much activity before.

I don\u2019t know anybody at all, and they\u2019re people who come up to me who say \u2018I\u2019ve never been involved in politics before, I\u2019m interested in what you have to say, because I\u2019m interested particularly in the economic argument that you have to rebalance society away from inequality towards equality\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the interview shortly, and all the latest developments in the Labour leadership contest.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also a Number 10 lobby briefing, Theresa May heading for a UN conference in New York and the Lib Dem conference taking place in Brighton, with Nick Clegg holding a Q&amp;A on Brexit at 4.30pm.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Asked by the Guardian whether she would consider calls for Britain to resettle more refugees, she said: \u201cWe have always taken the view that we can help more Syrian refugees by putting aid into the region.\u201d </p> <p>She added that some Syrians were also coming to the UK through the normal asylum-seeking routes, as well as 3,000 children from the region.</p> <p>Her answer appears to confirm that May will take the same approach as David <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">Cameron, who only agreed to the programme for vulnerable refugees from Syria under pressure</a>.

She said: \u201cWe are working with local authorities and NGOs in relation to delivering on the Dubs amendment and we have for example speeded up our processes for ensuring family reunification can take place.\u201d</p> <p>May\u2019s main intervention at the UN summit will be to awarn of the dangers that mass uncontrolled migration poses. She will call for a better global system to manage the movement of people and propose better differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. It is understood that she is unlikely to announce any increase in the quota of refugees to be accepted, but the UK is expected to commit more money and humanitarian aid at the summit.</p> <p>Obama and the outgoing UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hope to make progress in getting world leaders to pledge more help for refugees before the end of their tenures. Amnesty and other groups, however, have criticised the declaration due to be adopted at the UN summit for lacking teeth and merely reiterating humanitarian principles.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/rowan-williams-200-faith-leaders-open-letter-revise-refugee-policy\">Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was one of 200 religious leaders who called last week for more action from the UK</a>, criticising the government\u2019s response to the refugee crisis as \u201ctoo slow, too low and too narrow\u201d.</p> <p>David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK would resettle more refugees. \u201cFrankly, the UK should be saying \u2018we\u2019ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year\u2019, so four times the current level to match the commitment of countries like Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThese proposals indicate that the prime minister is intent on attempting to reinforce the untenable status quo, blocking off people\u2019s escape routes and leaving poor countries looking after nearly nine out of 10 of the world\u2019s refugees. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we really need to see instead is the UK leading by example, adopting sustainable solutions aimed at saving refugees\u2019 lives and implementing a more equitable system for sharing responsibility for protecting them.\u201d</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, called on May to meet the government\u2019s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians two years early and offer more help to those fleeing the war. \u201cThis will be a terrible missed opportunity if we don\u2019t get strong international action, and if Britain doesn\u2019t show the leadership needed,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants, that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a 14-year-old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children\u2019s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety.\u201d</p> <p>As well as making an intervention on migration, May will host a \u201cround table\u201d on stopping modern slavery and trafficking - one of her personal priorities as home secretary.</p> <p>The prime minister will point to the UK\u2019s new taskforce and announce that the heads of Mi5, Mi6, GCHQ and Interpol will join it when required. \u201cJust as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, I am determined that the United Kingdom will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery,\u201d she said ahead of the session for world leaders.</p> <p>In her maiden speech to the UN on Tuesday, May will call on the UN to deal better with problems that need a global response such as terrorism, mass migration and modern slavery. </p> <p>At the summit, May will also defend the vote for Brexit in her speech to the UN, saying the British people \u201cdid not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world\u201d but they did want \u201ca politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them\u201d.</p> <p>She will echo her claim made at the G20 in China that too many people are feeling left behind by globalisation.</p> <p>May is expected to have bilateral meetings with Ban Ki-moon, and the prime ministers of Pakistan, New Zealand, Egypt, and Turkey. She will also meet the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, for the second time in a fortnight, after Tokyo\u2019s warning at the G20 summit that it\u2019s businesses could leave the UK without more clarity about the consequences the Brexit vote.</p> <p>On Monday evening, May will hold a reception for about 60 executives from companies such as Amazon, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Black Rock, as the UK attempts to calm investors\u2019 fears about Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I will be talking about with both American and British leaders is about how we can encourage that trade and investment between the countries,\u201d May said. \u201cSomething like a million [British] people wake up each morning and go to work for an American company.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Nujeen Mustafa lives in the kind of humdrum European suburb that most 17-year-olds could not wait to get out of. The streets in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesseling\" title=\"\">Wesseling</a> outside Cologne are flanked by neatly trimmed hedgerows and even more neatly parked cars. Pebbledash two-storey new-builds with drawn blinds. Vast gardens with not a playing child in sight.</p> <p>A year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/nujeen-mustafa-interview-syrian-refugee\" title=\"\">Nujeen completed a 3,500-mile journey from Syria to Germany in a cumbersome steel-frame wheelchair</a>, an Odyssean adventure that involved dodging masked Isis fighters, navigating perilous Mediterranean waters and fending off packs of wild dogs. Now the wheelchair is folded up on the veranda and she sits on a faded beige sofa in the living room of the flat she shares with two sisters and four nieces, struggling with a crumbly German biscuit.</p> <p>Looking at this teenager, with her thick black-and-red spectacles, I cannot help thinking of her as a Harry Potter figure, exiled on a Westphalian Privet Drive. There are even some Dursley-esque neighbours who, Nujeen says, \u201caren\u2019t such big fans of refugees\u201d.</p> <p>When I suggest the comparison, she shakes her head. She likes the town she has ended up in, and the fact no one knows her here. \u201cHarry Potter is such a lifeless book, there\u2019s too little emotion and too much display of power,\u201d she says, adding a barb that has a special sting coming from someone with her backstory: \u201cIt makes every boy in the world think they are the chosen one.\u201d</p> <p>Nujeen Mustafa was born on New Year\u2019s Day 1999 in Manbij in northern Syria, the youngest of a Kurdish family of 11 in a mostly Arab town. Though Muslim, she says her family were never \u201cobsessed\u201d by religion: she and her sisters and cousins were the only girls who didn\u2019t cover their heads in their local high school.</p> <p>Her pride in her cultural identity as a Kurd is fierce, however, and shaped her view on her country\u2019s descent into civil war. As the population divided into supporters and opponents of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/diyarbakir-kurdish-teenagers-dream-of-becoming-guerrillas\" title=\"\">the Kurds had their own side</a> as they couldn\u2019t trust anyone\u201d, as Nujeen puts it in the memoir she has co-written with Sunday Times journalist Christina Lamb, who also co-authored Malala Yousafzai\u2019s autobiography.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"351e1ba2900a642685263b46ebf0c8aacce119e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/351e1ba2900a642685263b46ebf0c8aacce119e4/0_107_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nujeen in Croatia in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nujeen in Croatia in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zeljko Lukunic/PIXSELL/Pixsell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Isis set up its headquarters in Raqqa, less than 100 miles from Manbij, Nujeen and her siblings knew that as members of Syria\u2019s largest ethnic minority they would be targeted by the jihadi militant group and decided to flee Syria for Turkey.</p> <p>For Nujeen, the journey was particularly arduous. Born 40 days prematurely, she has grown up with a condition known as \u201ctetra-spasticity\u201d. Her legs, she says, \u201chave a life of their own\u201d: \u201cThey kick up when I am speaking, my ankles turn inwards, my toes point downwards, my heels point up and I can\u2019t walk. I am forever stuck on tiptoes.\u201d</p> <p>But Nujeen learned to make up for the resulting \u201cfun deficiency\u201d with an exceptional intellectual curiosity. In Syria, she watched non-stop satellite TV: Disney cartoons, science documentaries, football matches. But it was discovering the internet, when she was staying in Gaziantep, Turkey, that changed Nujeen\u2019s life. \u201cI would go on to YouTube and look up the most famous pieces of music in the world, or the most famous museums. Then I would remember the date the work was created and the name of the artist.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversations are interspersed with little explosions of joy as she wheels out nuggets of information from her memory bank. \u201cMy keenest interests are always influential people, like who invented Google, thank you Sergey Brin; who invented Tom and Jerry, that\u2019s William Hanna and Joseph Barbera; who plays Mr Bean, that\u2019s Rowan Atkinson, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>Born to parents who were illiterate goat traders, she has recently listened to an audiobook of War and Peace, read Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Jane Eyre, and A Tale of Two Cities \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s by Charles Dickens.\u201d</p> <p>She had learned English via her favourite US soap opera, Days of Our Lives, which turned out to be invaluable as she and her siblings made their way from Turkey to Greece, then through Macedonia to Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria and eventually Germany (her parents remain in Gazientep). Her ability to communicate with border guards and officials turned the youngest member of the Mustafa clan into its de facto leader.</p> <p>In September last year, when she was on the Hungarian border waiting for her brother who had travelled ahead to Germany to apply for asylum, Nujeen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg7KcXIbmAM\" title=\"\">encountered BBC journalist Fergal Keane</a>. She confided to him with her infectious optimism that she wanted to become an astronaut and meet the Queen.</p> <p>John Oliver\u2019s Last Week Tonight picked up on the interview and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCIsENNMCWM\" title=\"\">commissioned a one-off scene from Days of Our Lives</a> that brought back to life Mustafa\u2019s favourite character EJ, killed off in a previous episode. The clip was designed to be an instant tearjerker. EJ, played by James Scott, looks straight at the camera as he pronounces Nujeen\u2019s name and tells his love interest Sami: \u201cShe\u2019s our kind of people.\u201d By the time she reached Slovenia, people were pointing at her, saying \u201cYou\u2019re the refugee girl in the newspaper!\u201d Nujeen, Oliver said, seemed \u201clike the kind of person that would improve any country that would have her\u201d.</p> <p>Well-intentioned as the stunt may have been, its cheerleading tone doesn\u2019t age well. In her memoir, Nujeen recalls waking the morning after watching it and feeling \u201cas if something had been stolen from me \u2026 Days of Our Lives had been my own thing, it was private. Also the video clip wasn\u2019t realistic \u2013 EJ and Sami would have had a fight. I would have liked that better than them talking about me\u201d.</p> <p>It also seems unfair to turn Nujeen into a media-age saint, not least because she herself is quick to acknowledge her flaws. With her precociousness there are often flashes of arrogance. She is dismissive of things other teenagers are into \u2013 Harry Potter, Pok\u00e9mon, pop music. \u201cI pretty much dislike childish behaviour. I always want to be right and be wiser than my age, to make everyone surprised that I am disabled but a person who is educated and knows a lot about the world. If that is a fault, it\u2019s entirely my fault.\u201d</p> <p>By her own admission, she is at her worst when she gets impatient. Her worst memory of the entire trek across Europe is the five-hour queue at the German border. \u201cI am a very impatient person. I like everything to be perfect, and if things aren\u2019t perfect, then I can be very annoying.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be a terrible teacher,\u201d her brother Shiar teases her. \u201cAn awful teacher,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Germany had always been the final destination of their journey. Shiar, 26 years her senior and a film director, had lived there since before she was born, having left Syria to escape conscription for the Iraq war in 1990. While organising their passage across the Mediterranean from Turkey, the Mustafas heard with relief that Germany had temporarily suspended the Dublin regulation procedure. This enabled them to apply for asylum in the heart of the continent, rather than the country where they first stepped on to European soil. When Nujeen was pushed over the river Saalach on the Austrian-German border on 21 September last year, she became one of just over a million refugees who entered the country in 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/nujeen-mustafa-interview-syrian-refugee\">Nujeen Mustafa: \u2018Sometimes it\u2019s good to be unaware. Maybe I was too young to realise the danger\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her book Nujeen describes her initial bemusement with the national character of her adopted home: \u201cThe people are like machines \u2013 they get up at a certain time, eat at a certain time and get very stressed if a train is two minutes late.\u201d</p> <p>A few months later, she has partially revised that view. Having enrolled at a school for children with disabilities last October, she initially struggled with the unfamiliar educational system but has since acquired a level of fluency in German at a frightening speed. Our interview seamlessly switches between German and English, and though she still giggles about tongue twisters such as <em>f\u00fcnfhundertundf\u00fcnfundf\u00fcnfzig </em>(the number 555) or <em>Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung</em> (speed limit), she pronounces them without an accent<em>.</em></p> <p>\u201cSince I finished the book, my German has improved and I can communicate much better. I am more adapted to the German style of life and I look more German than I used to. In the way of acting, the habits of daily life, I feel like I am more German.\u201d Initially sceptical about European cuisine, she has grown fond of German baking, with Donauwelle cake and Spekulatius Christmas biscuits big favourites.</p> <p>Even the orderly rhythm of life has grown on her. \u201cYou know, Germans are really proud people, they always wish to be number one. That\u2019s why there is some kind of rivalry with the rest of Europe and England in particular. But I have this instinct that I too really love working hard, even if it makes me look like an emotionless robot. Every genius I have heard of, or everyone who invented something, it\u2019ll be like: oh, he\u2019s a German, I get it. But I can be a German too, and I can work hard and be number one\u201d.</p> <p>She has started to make friends at school, even though the children in her class are two years younger than she is. Recently, she says, she has even started dreaming of them rather than the war. Becoming an astronaut is still the long-term plan, whatever her teachers are telling her. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t work out, I still have my imagination.\u201d She has recently developed an interest in geography and biology, and is determined to go on to university in Germany. Getting there may depend on whether her optimism can survive the slow grind of German bureaucracy. When I ask the status of her asylum application, she starts shuffling on her seat and changes the subject \u2013 it\u2019s Nujeen, the impatient hater of queues. Shiar later explains that almost a year after arriving in Germany, Nujeen is still waiting for her residence permit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4487bc4183a86d1a9b91e5c366162eee089fa13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4487bc4183a86d1a9b91e5c366162eee089fa13/0_35_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Appearing on German television last year.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appearing on German television last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Angela Merkel recently announced that all refugees who arrived last year would be registered by the end of September, but for Nujeen time is running out. Under the Geneva convention, she has only three months, until she turns 18, to apply for her parents to be reunited with her in Germany. When I email her later to ask how she feels about the wait, Nujeen the optimist is back in charge: \u201cI have become a waiting expert,\u201d she writes, suggesting that \u201cthey need to do something so that the German process of applications might be as fast as the German cars!\u201d</p> <p>Most of her relatives and friends are now based in Europe \u2013 only her sister Jamila still lives in Kobani. Recently, the family has been unable to reach her on her phone. Mustafa follows the news of what is going on at home \u201cunwillingly\u201d, because it is hard to escape on the news. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible what\u2019s happening in the world now. One of my basic rules is that no one is born evil or bad, and I think watching the news will make the basics of this principle shake. We need a major, major thing to restore our faith in humanity now, but I still have hope. When you keep hope, you are pretty much in a good situation.\u201d</p> <p>During Mustafa\u2019s journey, Angela Merkel became, for her, a reincarnation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenobia\" title=\"\">Queen Zenobia</a>, the third-century queen of the Palmyrene empire who had found solutions for all of Syria\u2019s problems. One year on, after a string of poor results in regional elections, many of the politicians who had supported Merkel are criticising her for her handling of the refugee crisis. Does Mustafa worry about her?</p> <p>\u201cI feel like Merkel is under pressure because some people are bad ambassadors of the refugees, and they are not representing a good image of us. What I would like to say is that she is doing good for the EU and for Germany: Germany is getting better from the love from refugees. She\u2019s doing good, and I hope she keeps us.\u201d</p> <p>But she acknowledges that the mood in Germany is different now. \u201cI can see that some people have changed their minds about welcoming the refugees. But I think they know they are doing the right thing. Refugees are like everyone else in the world: there are bad and there are good people. If you are welcoming to those people in turn, they are ashamed of harming you. If you continue doing good, and they are continuing to do bad, they won\u2019t feel good about it. Eventually they will stop.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nujeen by Nujeen Mustafa with Christina Lamb is out on 22 September, \u00a316.99, William Collins.

For Aceves, this is to represent the human suffering that affects millions of migrants, and the bodily toil involved in the quest for survival.

After three or four months, Musa followed his advice, but when he reached Libya, he ended up being imprisoned. \u2018Libya is worse than hell. I spent one year [there], but I cannot tell you anything about Libya,\u2019 he says. He lived in a small house with 40 to 50 people, working from 6am until the evening, and food was only provided once a day.

He was born with a congenital malformation, and cannot walk. He made the journey to Europe, which took a total of four months, with his friend Monday, whom he met while travelling from Nigeria to Libya. Whenever the pair had to walk, Monday would carry Yusuf on his back.</p> <p>Yusuf decided to leave Nigeria because of the difficulties that people with disabilities face there. Both left without telling their families, for fear that they would persuade them not to make the journey.<br></p> <p>Yusuf left Nigeria in May, and then spent two weeks in Niger, looking for a driver to take them through the Sahara desert \u2013 most refused to carry him because of his disability, believing he would not survive the journey. When he finally persuaded a driver to take him, they drove for four days through the desert, with no food or water. Finally, they reached Libya, where they waited for more than three months for a boat that would take them to Europe. According to Yusuf, \u2018Libya is not a country someone should stay.\u2019<br></p> <p> Eventually, they boarded a boat and after five hours at sea, they were rescued and brought to Catania port. This was the most difficult part of the journey, he and Monday say. \u2018There is no guarantee.

The entire political and military game has to be worked out in advance \u2013 none of this has been done yet,\u201d Shukla says.</p> <p>Even if swift military retaliation were possible, both sides are keenly aware of the limits of armed coercion, particularly since Pakistan acquired nuclear capacity in 1998.</p> <p>\u201cThe government actually has a very narrow band of options, and even those are not without a certain amount of risk,\u201d says Dhruva Jaishankar, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in New Delhi.</p> <p>Covert action, such as cross-border raids on militant camps or training centres, could send a signal to Pakistan but would do little to cool public anger at home.</p> <p>India could also shell Pakistan positions across the disputed Kashmir border \u2013 as both sides have done in past years \u2013 at the risk of drawing retaliatory shelling and further weakening a 2003 ceasefire agreement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/kashmiri-activist-detained-and-barred-from-leaving-india-to-attend-un-summit\">Kashmiri activist barred from leaving India to attend UN summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Airstrikes against Pakistani army posts or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/pakistan-holds-members-of-group-blamed-for-india-airbase-assault\">Jaish-e-Mohammad</a> facilities <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-can-respond-to-uri-terror-attack-possible-options/articleshow/54406750.cms?utm_source=toiiphoneapp&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=show&amp;from=mdr\">are also a possibility</a>, though would come with significant risk of casualties from Pakistan\u2019s air-defence system, geared towards that very kind of Indian attack.</p> <p>\u201cAll options come with latent risks and latent costs, but the short answer is there are no good options, and if there were, they would have been explored already,\u201d Jaishankar says. </p> <p>Yet if the Indian government can ride out the public anger, a restrained, diplomatic response might be its wisest route. </p> <p>Myra MacDonald, a South Asia specialist and author of an upcoming book about relations between India and Pakistan, says the statements issued on Sunday by the US and UK were telling.

  "<p>The Washington Post has stunned many people in the United States, including a large section of the country\u2019s journalistic community, by coming out against a pardon for whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>Despite the newspaper having been responsible for publishing leaks by the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/edward-snowden-doesnt-deserve-a-pardon/2016/09/17/ec04d448-7c2e-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">its latest editorial urges President Barack Obama not to pardon him</a>. </p> <p>The paper\u2019s editorial board dismisses the call by human rights organisations for Snowden to receive presidential clemency because of his \u201cnoble purposes\u201d and the policy changes prompted by the mass surveillance revelations that emerged from his leaking of classified documents. </p> <p>The board states that by making the truth public, not least through its own reporters, Snowden enabled \u201cthe American public to learn for the first time that the NSA was collecting domestic telephone \u2018metadata\u2019 \u2014 information about the time of a call and the parties to it, but not its content \u2014 en masse with no case-by-case court approval.\u201d</p> <p>It then concedes that the NSA\u2019s activities violated federal law and posed risks to privacy, which was later the subject of \u201ccorrective legislation.\u201d</p> <p>But the editorial accuses Snowden of pilfering and leaking the \u201cseparate overseas NSA internet-monitoring programme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/prism\">Prism</a>, \u201cthat was both clearly legal and not clearly threatening to privacy...</p> <p>\u201cWorse \u2014 far worse \u2014 he also leaked details of basically defensible international intelligence operations: cooperation with Scandinavian services against Russia; spying on the wife of an Osama bin Laden associate; and certain offensive cyber operations in China.\u201d</p> <p>The Washington Post believes Snowden should come home and \u201cin the best tradition of civil disobedience\u201d show himself \u201cwilling to go to jail for [his] beliefs.\u201d</p> <p>It continues: \u201cMr Snowden hurt his own credibility as an avatar of freedom by accepting asylum from Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin, who\u2019s not known for pardoning those who blow the whistle on him.\u201d</p> <p>The publishing of the editorial coincides with the release of Oliver Stone\u2019s movie, Snowden, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/edward-snowden-why-barack-obama-should-grant-me-a-pardon\">a campaign by US civil liberties groups to persuade Obama to offer Snowden a pardon. </a><br></p> <p>Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/edward-snowden-pardon-bernie-sanders-daniel-ellsberg\">is one of more than 20 other prominent American public figures to have called for clemency for Snowden.</a> </p> <p>The Washington Post\u2019s editorial has drawn fire from Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists involved in placing the Snowden leaks in the public domain. </p> <p>He wrote that the Post had <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/09/18/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-after-accepting-pulitzer/\">\u201cachieved an ignominious feat in US media history</a>: the first-ever paper to explicitly editorialise for the criminal prosecution of its own source - one on whose back the paper won and eagerly accepted a Pulitzer Prize...</p> <p>\u201cEven more staggering than this act of journalistic treachery against the paper\u2019s own source are the claims made to justify it.\u201d</p> <p>Two other newspapers that published Snowden\u2019s revelations - the Guardian and the New York Times - have run opinion pieces calling on the US administration to allow him to return to the US without facing any charges.</p>",

When she also proposes that countries must \u201ctake responsibility to stop uncontrolled migrant flows\u201d she is willing the means to ensure that happens.</p> <p>We know this because the UN\u2019s speech is not a one-off. Indeed May showcased her strategy for dealing with the worst refugee crisis since the second world war in her Conservative party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/theresa-may-speech-new-low-politics-migration\">conference speech</a> as home secretary last October.</p> <p>Then she made clear that she wanted to limit the number of asylum seekers who made it to Britain to claim refugee status by branding those who had made it across the Mediterranean to Calais or Britain as the \u201cwealthiest, fittest and strongest\u201d with the quasi-Darwinian implication that they are in some way undeserving queue-jumpers.</p> <p>She said more than 290,000 Syrians had claimed asylum across Europe at that point, and contrasted them sharply with the plight of the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d refugees in the Middle East camps. May boasted of Britain\u2019s decision to take 20,000 of those most vulnerable refugees and promised she would \u201cnot in a thousand years\u201d take part in any Europe-wide refugee responsibility-sharing programme.</p> <p>Instead May asserted last October that she wanted Britain to unilaterally enforce the \u201cfirst safe country\u201d rule by breaking the link between being recognised as a refugee and getting the right to settle in Britain.</p> <p> \u201cIf you\u2019ve spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere \u2013 but we cannot return you to that safe country and you still need refuge \u2013 you\u2019ll get the minimum stay of protection and you won\u2019t have an automatic right to settle here,\u201d she warned, adding that when that came to an end they would be returned as soon as a case review deemed it safe for them to do so. This lesser form of refugee status will also apply to those who successfully claim asylum after overstaying a British visa.</p> <p>She also launched her campaign for a review of the international legal definitions of who can qualify as a refugee or be rejected as an economic migrant to chip away at the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/1951-refugee-convention.html\">1951 Geneva convention</a> definitions of those who should not be returned to countries where they face serious threats to their lives or freedom.</p> <p>This was not just party conference rhetoric. Home Office ministers confirmed in February that work was under way on a strategy to cut the numbers claiming asylum in Britain and to provide temporary protection to all but the \u201cmost deserving\u201d refugees. </p> <p>There is a new twist. In her final months as home secretary, May was considering introducing a policy that a greater number of the most vulnerable refugees would be resettled in Britain only if it matched a reduction in those claiming asylum after reaching Britain under their own steam.</p> <p>Today\u2019s UN summit on refugees and migrants will see many developing countries arguing for a major expansion in legal routes such as resettlement programmes, so that the wealthiest countries share some of the responsibility for the greatest refugee crisis since the second world war. </p> <p>They are hoping the UN special assembly will prove a watershed moment in the world\u2019s response. Instead of rising to the challenge, the British prime minister will be blocking people\u2019s escape routes and leaving the world\u2019s poorest countries to cope with the crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Ending the free movement of people from the European Union should become a key demand from Labour before the Brexit negotiations with the EU, according to a collection of essays from Labour figures. </p> <p>Labour must accept that people who voted for Brexit had legitimate concerns over the scale of numbers arriving in Britain from the EU, according to the <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/facing-the-unknown/\">Fabian Society paper</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live\">Corbyn says huge turnout at his rallies shows he can win an election - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gathering contributions from nine Labour MPs, as well as others within the party and from elsewhere in Europe, the report is billed as a chance for the party to start shaping its own post-Brexit narrative, rather than let the Conservatives dominate the debate.</p> <p>In her contribution Rachel Reeves, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, noted that one study had found migration into the UK exerted a \u201cslight drag\u201d on workers\u2019 wages, but that remain campaigners had refused to acknowledge this effect.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe remain campaign \u2013 and Labour in particular \u2013 had little to say to working class voters with whom we, above all the other parties, should have been able to communicate,\u201d Reeves wrote. \u201cWe did not offer any solutions to those who felt locked out from opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves added: \u201cImmigration controls and ending free movement has to be a red line post-Brexit \u2013 otherwise we will be holding the voters in contempt. Subject to that, we need the greatest possible access that we can get to the single market without free movement.\u201d</p> <p>Also writing for the paper, titled Facing the Unknown: Building a Progressive Response to Brexit, was Emma Reynolds, the Labour MP for Wolverhampton North-East. She argued that free movement must end even if it meant settling for a worse trade deal.</p> <p>\u201cMy constituents in Wolverhampton voted overwhelmingly for leave, and their principal reason was immigration,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, it is my strong view that no future deal can retain free movement of people in its present form. We must argue for restrictions while getting the best possible economic deal in the circumstances. </p> <p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be as good as the status quo but leave voters clearly said that their concerns about immigration trumped their worries about the economic cost of leaving.\u201d</p> <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">essay in the report</a>, the Aberavon MP, Stephen Kinnock, also said Labour needed to reshape its approach to large-scale immigration because it had been rejected by voters. He argued that a post-Brexit immigration policy was likely to involve work permits for EU nationals.</p> <p>\u201cSome will say managing immigration is a \u2018tough\u2019 approach,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf limiting immigrant numbers were the defining objective, I would agree. But it is not.</p> <p>\u201cThe managed immigration approach I am proposing is rooted in leftwing values and anchored in the reality of post-referendum Britain. It will allow us to build an open and non-racist society and help rebuild Labour\u2019s electoral coalition, staying true to the values and pragmatism that have been the basis of our historic successes and support. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.\u201d</p> <p>Other contributions took a different approach. Chuka Umunna, the Streatham MP who is a leading figure in the Vote Leave Watch pressure group, argued that Brexiters in the government should still be pushed on the promises they made in the runup to the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cAccepting the result does not mean accepting the way in which it was achieved,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no getting away from the fact that Vote Leave ran a cynical and mendacious political campaign. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe must not stop from holding the leavers in government to account, and pushing our vision of a positive future relationship with Europe.\u201d<br></p> <p>Olivia Bailey, who is research director at the Fabian Society and edited the report, said Labour must accept the Brexit result \u201cand get on with fighting to shape the future\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cLabour must approach Brexit with a set of clear and comprehensive principles that clearly define red lines as well as opportunities. If Labour doesn\u2019t get its tactics right fast, the right of the Conservative party will be left to shape Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future in its own image.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Every once in a while someone asks me about my \u201caha\u201d moment: the exact time when I knew I would become a full-time nomad, quit my job and \u201cretire\u201d from a budding and promising career at age 29 to travel across the American continent indefinitely in a 22-foot Rialta RV with one dog, one cat and one husband in tow. </p> <p>I would usually tell the story of my epiphany on the summit of a mountain in Colorado.

The \u201caha\u201d moment was more like an \u201cuh-oh\u201d moment. </p> <p>This story involves the collapse of a failed long-term, live-in relationship back in my 20s, when I still believed a woman could change a man with nags and threats alone. It was the day I abandoned my treasured and custom-made cherry wood table.</p> <p>The night we split up, we didn\u2019t discuss the table. We discussed my debts. The ones he caused with his traumatic brain injury, lengthy recovery, even longer rehabilitation, subsequent reschooling, and ultimate refusal or inability to get a job. We discussed how bad my credit was. How badly I needed to sell the condo.</p> <p>When things were first becoming strained between us, I had the cherry wood table custom-made. It was spectacular: dark brown, beautifully finished, simple and sturdy. I displayed it without a tablecloth. In the evening, the sun would hit it just right and it would practically glow. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/08/gave-it-all-up-live-land-simple-good-life\">I gave it all up \u2026 to live off the land</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHere is something beautiful for the both of us that I have helped create,\u201d I thought. </p> <p>My efforts didn\u2019t work, and our paths shifted. I gave up the dream of a house-centered life that didn\u2019t quite fit me. </p> <p>My new path took me to San Diego, where I re-entered the workforce and eventually married a wonderful man whose destiny it was to drive me around. </p> <p>That first year in the RV was like a vacation. Both of us overworked and under-stimulated, we drove from San Diego to Alaska, across Canada, then back down the East coast. And for the next two years, we did our favorite parts all over again. </p> <p>These days we have slowed way down. Our senior dog, now 15, is showing her age and doesn\u2019t travel as well as she used to. We are ageing too, favoring quiet campgrounds over urban convenience. We chug along with poor clearance in a never-ending pursuit of that perfect campsite no one has ever heard about. </p> <p>We own two bowls, two spoons and two forks. We wash our dishes with creek water. My husband goes fishing for our breakfast. I walk a lot. I seek solitude like a junkie seeks crack. I sleep extravagantly. </p> <p>The miles have been kind to me. I\u2019ve known hummingbirds as friends, holding their tiny pulsing bodies in the palm of my hand. I often waste an entire day reading. I can sneak up on a squirrel. </p> <p>I live and write offline. The sunsets slip by one after the other, and I am sentenced to watch them quietly, without reaching for a selfie. I tuck these moments away in my heart where they fester into a messy sort of love.</p> <p>I have learned that I don\u2019t need to possess things in order to love them. I have learned that most people are not like me. I have learned that many people are exactly like me. I have learned that security is a myth. </p> <p>At this exact moment, I have a little over $6,000 sitting in my bank account. Without any extra sacrifices, this can feed and sustain my humble family for three months. </p> <p>Of course, a sudden accident or illness could do me in at anytime, but I\u2019m afraid this is true for all of us. Or at least it has always been true for me. I used to have insurance once, many years ago. When I had to start choosing between food or coverage, I picked eating. I have never been able to afford both since then. </p> <p>One winter morning while I was working towards my university degree, I picked up the school paper to read an article about how very affluent our student body was and how much disposable income we all had. Just the day before I had eaten dinner out of the garbage, my first meal of the day. Somehow I always feel that everything is going to be okay. </p> <p>I have faith not so much in the positive outcome of things, but more strongly in my own ability to endure everything. There will always be times of trouble and I will always survive them. I am good at making jokes in the dark places. I am good at suffering. I am good at loss. </p> <p>Today I went to see the Gila Cliff Dwellings in New Mexico. Seven hundred years ago, Mogollon natives inhabited these caves. I walked where they walked. I saw where they ate and drank and slept. I looked out of their windows and saw the same views they would have seen. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t spot any cherry wood tables, but the view was of one giant mesa: a table for God himself.

A sub-group of <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/ed-templetons-huntington-beach\">neo-Nazi surfers</a> acquired notoriety for daubing swastikas on boards. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/16/real-housewives-interview-scott-dunlop\">Real Housewives of Orange County</a>, a reality TV show, has bolstered the impression of a white enclave. </p> <p>In fact, over the past two decades, the county has become diverse to the point that whites are no longer a majority. They make up 44% of the population of 3 million, with Latinos comprising 34% and Asians 18%.</p> <p>But melting pot it is not. Most whites live in tracts that are at least 60% white, many of them coastal cities such as Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach and San Clemente. The inland city of Santa Ana, in contrast, once predominantly white, is now 78% Latino.</p> <p>Economics explains much of this. Whites are wealthier and can afford pricey coastal real estate. Most Latinos cannot. Many observers have long suspected racism, too, but the evidence has been anecdotal. </p> <p>Now there is an academic study bolstering the case that racism does indeed fuel the segregation. Celia Lacayo, a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA\u2019s Institute of American Cultures, has published a report titled<a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/6/3/25\"> Latinos Need to Stay in Their Place: Differential Segregation in a Multi-Ethnic Suburb</a>. </p> <p>It is based on in-depth interviews with 40 white residents in 2010, conducted by two white researchers Lacaya contracted to encourage candour. The random sample was aged 25 to 61 and mostly middle to upper class professionals involved in law, real estate, sales and marketing.</p> <p>A small sample, but with striking findings. The respondents \u201coverwhelmingly characterized Latinos and African Americans as culturally deficient, problematic and inferior\u201d, according to Lacayo.

  "<p><strong>Debt</strong>: $75,000</p> <p><strong>Source</strong>: Student loans, medical bills, credit cards</p> <p><strong>Estimated years until debt-free</strong>: Free<br></p> <p>Even before I was fully conscious, before I\u2019d been loaded onto the stretcher in the middle of the road, I was thinking about money. \u201cI don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d I protested as paramedics wrapped a neck brace around me, and shone a flashlight in my eyes. They asked me my name; I couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cTrauma November\u201d, my hospital wristband ended up reading. </p> <p>It had been a bad year. A nasty breakup snowballed into an unshakeable depression and the subsequent loss of my job. My bank account was empty, my credit cards maxed out. I did in fact have health insurance, albeit a poor plan \u2013 whatever I could afford to pay for while I skimped by on TaskRabbit gigs cleaning houses.</p> <p>And just when I thought things couldn\u2019t <em>possibly </em>get worse, they did, of course. I was hit on my bicycle by an SUV making a right-hand turn from a middle lane, while I cruised through a green light. I hit the vehicle and somersaulted two lanes of traffic, landing on my face next to a median.</p> <p>After that confusing ambulance ride, I woke up in a dingy ER hallway, my best friend holding my hair back as I tried to throw up. My busted face was sewn up, my lacerated liver monitored. Eight metal screws and a large metal plate were surgically implanted into my shattered elbow. The following few weeks coasted by in a haze of Dilaudid, and yet I somehow still interviewed for a job I wanted, my face a mess of stitches and bruises, my bandaged elbow hidden slightly by a theatrically-placed scarf, and my brain a jumble from Percocet. I didn\u2019t get it. </p> <p>The letters began filling up my mailbox before I\u2019d even got my elbow to bend past 90 degrees in physical therapy. Despite my measly insurance plan, my share of the medical bills from the wreck would end up totaling over $50,000. They came in small, teasing chunks \u2013 $250 here, $60 there. One itemized bill showed that a generic birth control test I\u2019d been required to take before surgery came to a whopping $267. </p> <p>After a while I couldn\u2019t read the letters anymore, and they teetered unopened in piles on the edges of my desk. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to open the mailbox, and my mailwoman would have to ring my doorbell to hand me armfuls of second and third notices from the three hospitals I\u2019d been to. </p> <p>The PTSD that accompanies such financial trauma still follows me around. It took two years for me to get a settlement from the driver\u2019s insurance company, during which I missed credit card payments, student loan bills and my rent checks bounced \u2013 three times. The day I picked up the settlement check from my lawyer\u2019s office my whole body shook as I walked the four blocks to the bank. The check was so large, it took four tellers to figure out how to process it. On the bus ride home I pulled up my bank account on my phone and looked at my balance. It didn\u2019t feel real, just a list of numbers lined up next to each other. </p> <p>That abstractness of numbers continued a couple days later when the full check cleared. I clicked around on my computer, paying off four credit cards, student loans, and writing checks to friends who\u2019d helped me buy groceries. The $50,000 in medical debts was negotiated and settled. And I was free.</p> <p>I\u2019d still be in debt today, with government-issued student loans and steep credit card interest that made it just impossible enough to every completely pay off a full account balance. So in some ways, getting hit by that SUV was one of the best things that\u2019s ever happened to me. My right arm will never function in the same way, but I\u2019ve moved on. Mostly.</p> <p>What hasn\u2019t changed, three years later, is the terror I get in the pit of my stomach when I run a credit card. My groceries are bagged and ready to go, and I know my bank account is okay. But still, that moment after I scan my card, before the cheerful \u201cAPPROVED\u201d pops up on the screen still makes my legs weak. If it takes long enough, I break out in a sweat and often completely stop breathing. It\u2019s the kind of trauma someone only knows if they\u2019ve seen \u201cDECLINED\u201d over and over and over again. <br></p>",

Her name is Esther, and we met in June in the <a href=\"https://kanere.org/about-kakuma-refugee-camp/\">Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya</a>, in the country\u2019s far northwest. Esther is an 18-year-old South Sudanese girl who showed me around the camp, which has been her home since she was 11 when she, her two sisters and her mother fled their home in Juba. It took a long time to get Esther\u2019s paperwork sorted so that she could go to school and when she did get in most people wondered why she was bothering. Her mother couldn\u2019t read or write, they said, and she would never amount to anything, either \u2013 better to get married and have children as soon as possible.</p> <p>Esther decided to prove her doubters wrong. As it happened, a new privately-financed school for girls had just opened in Kakuma \u2013 well built, with better facilities and solar-powered lighting \u2013 and once the idea of walking through its gates had got under her skin, she studied day and night and won a coveted place. Somewhere along the line she got on the internet and read about becoming a surgeon \u2013 a neurosurgeon, to be exact \u2013 and in the way that children do, Esther decided, \u201cOK, I want to be South Sudan\u2019s first female neurosurgeon.\u201d</p> <p>It is an inspiring story \u2013 but I left out a few details.</p> <p>Just by completing secondary school, Esther has overcome huge odds. Across the world, one in two refugee children is in primary school and fewer than one in four in secondary. By contrast, more than 90% of primary-age non-refugee children are in school, as are 84% of secondary-age children. As for higher education, a paltry <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/education.html\">one in a hundred</a> refugee children makes it that far. That compares badly with the worldwide figure of 34.5%, but it compares even worse with North America and western Europe, where nearly three-quarters of young people are in some form of higher education.</p> <p>The most protracted refugee situations now last an average of more than 20 years. That means a child born to refugees can reach adulthood without ever having known the country of their parents. It means that many children who were forced to flee to safety will become adolescents and then grown-ups with only the haziest memories of home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/nov/29/german-schools-taking-refugee-children-syria\">No teacher lets them suffer: inside the German schools taking in refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet one day they will return.

The question is this: will they be equipped for the challenge?</p> <p>We send youngsters to school and university for many reasons. We want them to be academically curious, to develop their capacity for critical thinking, explore new ideas, to acquire the means to realise their ambitions and aspirations. Indeed, in wealthy countries a government that does not provide an education for its people is considered incompetent. So why do we fail to do this with refugees? Why do we say, \u201cHere\u2019s a tent, a blanket, food and water, a certain level of healthcare \u2013 but anything else you might wish for, such as a school, an apprenticeship, a satisfying job, all the tools for self-sufficiency ... no, sorry, that\u2019s not for you\u201d?</p> <p>It\u2019s a priority for UNHCR and our partner organisations \u2013 that is why we develop accelerated education programmes to enable overage learners to catch up and rejoin the curriculum, why we lobby education ministries to include refugee children in their national education systems as the most effective and sustainable way of ensuring they are taught by experienced teachers and receive accredited qualifications. It is why we campaign for funding for new and improved facilities: safer classrooms, internet connections and computers, uniforms and backpacks, proper toilets and sanitation.

It\u2019s to show that political leaders don\u2019t have their heads in the sand at a time of international crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Obama will co-host Tuesday\u2019s summit with the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and leaders of some of the countries deemed to have done most for refugees or carrying more than their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\">share of the burden</a>: Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia. Before the event, the president raised the goal of the number of refugees the US would permanently resettle in the coming year by 10,000, to 110,000. </p> <p>British officials say the prime minister, Theresa May, will be a speaker at Tuesday\u2019s summit, in part because of the UK\u2019s role in hosting a donor conference that raised $12bn (\u00a39bn) in pledges for Syria and the region. They said she would also be making new British commitments.</p> <p>Samantha Power, the US envoy to the UN, made it clear that any other world leader wanting to speak at the event would have to come up with genuinely new and meaningful offers of help. </p> <p>\u201cWe are leveraging the additional steps that we are taking to get other countries also to do their part, given that up to this point a small number of countries have been carrying a disproportionate share of the refugee opportunity and burden,\u201d Power said. </p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to have dozens of countries present at the meeting. I can\u2019t give you an exact number now because we\u2019re still in a whirl of countries coming to us and saying, this is what we\u2019re going to commit, and us saying, actually, that\u2019s not new or significant, and then some of those countries going back to the drawing board. But it will be dozens of countries and you\u2019ll be able to see a very significant return on this format of meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Clark, New Zealand\u2019s former prime minister who is now head of the UN Development Programme, said that even if the summit produced a significant increase in support for refugees, it would not help the majority of the record 65 million people forced from their homes by conflict or persecution around the world \u2013 internally displaced persons (IDPs) who flee their homes but do not cross into another country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOf the 65 million, my understanding is that the clear majority are IDPs and they\u2019re not dealt with, so that means there is more work to do to raise awareness of those needs,\u201d Clark said. </p> <p>She said it was possible IDPs were getting less attention because by not leaving their country of origin they did not pose such a direct threat to the political stability and budgets of the developed world. </p> <p>\u201cThat might be a factor. All I can say is that the IDPs also want their kids in school,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe IDPs are unfinished business, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>On the eve of the UN summit, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), Pierre Krahenbuhl, urged leaders not to forget the plight of long-term refugees, nearly half of whom are Palestinians.</p> <p>\u201cThe summiteers are clear that no one must be left behind and I urged that this must include the 5.2 million Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA,\u201d Krahenbuhl said. \u201cThey represent 44% of the world\u2019s long-term refugees, the largest in scale and most protracted in duration of any refugee situation today.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the failure of world leaders to agree firm commitments for the UN summit on Monday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said the draft of its final non-binding declaration would still make a difference by reaffirming the global community\u2019s collective responsibility for refugees, encouraging longer-term responses to prolonged refugee crises, which are currently often dealt with in a knee-jerk way.<br></p> <p>Volker Turk, the UNHCR\u2019s assistant high commissioner for protection, said: \u201cI see it as the beginning of an exciting process \u2026 it identifies a response framework that consolidates the nuts and bolts of what is needed if a country is faced with a large-scale [refugee] situation.\u201d<br></p> <p>The declaration was also praised by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which was pleased that it engaged with migrants as well as refugees. \u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed in any way,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, IOM\u2019s chief spokesman.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But others are. Record numbers of people are displaced worldwide, and given the gravity of the crisis, rights campaigners along with countries hosting large numbers of refugees are frustrated that the declaration has achieved no concrete measures, and concrete proposals will not be approved until 2018.<br></p> <p>Lebanon has a higher number of refugees per capita and per square mile than any other country in the world \u2013 and its ambassador to the UN, Nawaf Salam, said the proposals did not go nearly far enough.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFrom our perspective, all this falls way behind what is needed to address, one, the plight of refugees and, two, the needs of host communities,\u201d Salam said. \u201cThere are no commitments in terms of responsibility-sharing, no agreement on relocation of refugees, no real commitment to [the creation of] development funds that could address the needs of refugee and host communities.\u201d</p> <p>Salam said he would have liked to have seen international partners \u201cmake good on pledges already made. We need to shift from only humanitarian aid to development aid <em>and</em> humanitarian aid. We need to give more help to host communities. And we need to prepare plans for a safe and dignified return [of Syrians to Syria] \u2026 That\u2019s not implementable today, but preparations need to start today, to be implemented when conditions permit.\u201d</p> <p>The watered-down nature of Monday\u2019s summit means that the stakes on Tuesday are far greater, Miliband argued. \u201cIt would be better not to have a summit at all than to have a summit that doesn\u2019t lead to substantive change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Tuesday\u2019s summit achieves nothing, if the convening power of the American president on Tuesday doesn\u2019t deliver, it will further drain confidence that the international system gets it.\u201d</p>",

And fourth, specifically to the UK government, give refugee women in the UK dignity and a fair hearing.</p> <p>The refugee crisis is controversial, and in these turbulent times calls to offer added protection for refugees are increasingly met with opposition. But I look at the media\u2019s portrayal of refugees \u2013 the objectification, the dehumanisation \u2013 and I see history repeating itself: the same history that sent my own ancestors fleeing for their lives. For I am the daughter and granddaughter of refugees. On the famous suffragette Pankhurst side, my grandmother Sylvia\u2019s partner was an Italian anarchist who came to call the UK home; and my mother originally came from Romania in 1938, fleeing the rise of fascism.</p> <p>Wherever in history we see vast swaths of people forced out \u2013 or worse, wiped out \u2013 you can guarantee it\u2019s accompanied, somewhere, by propaganda insinuating that these lives are disposable. As a country we were on the right side of history when fascism and nazism took hold. We must ensure the same applies today.</p> <p>The shame of this crisis will not be whitewashed in the history books; it will scar our collective conscience for generations. We have an individual and collective responsibility to act now.</p>",

  "<p>A new Wellcome Collection exhibition, <a href=\"http://wellcomecollection.org/bedlam\">Bedlam: the asylum and beyond</a>, which I co-curated with B\u00e1rbara Rodriguez Mu\u00f1oz, uses the story of Royal Bethlem hospital to trace the rise and fall of the mental asylum. Although the asylum\u2019s era of mass confinement has been consigned to history, the ideas that animated it still shape the mental health landscape. And some of its long-forgotten aspirations are now being reclaimed to imagine and create new approaches to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health\">mental healthcare</a>.</p> <p>Bethlem hospital \u2013 known for centuries in popular slang as Bedlam \u2013 has occupied three different sites over the last three centuries. Each illuminates the attitudes to mental health of its day. During the 18th century it was a grand edifice in Moorfields, north of the City of London, whose baroque fa\u00e7ade concealed the bleak galleries in which patients were confined. This contrast expressed the dual function of the \u201cmadhouse\u201d, as it was then known: a worthy charitable initiative for the benefit of those who would otherwise be on the streets, but also keeping them securely segregated from the population at large.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/17/richard-dadd-victorian-artist-bedlam-mental-illness-fairies\">Locked up in Bedlam, artist Richard Dadd was set free by fairies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1815 Bethlem relocated south of the Thames to the building in Southwark that now houses the Imperial War Museum. The ambitions of the 19th-century asylum were far greater than its predecessor\u2019s. They were formed by inspiring examples such as the Retreat at York where the local Quaker community cared for their mentally unwell members in spacious, comfortable surroundings more like a home than a prison. The asylum became an emblem of social progress: a therapeutic community in which patients were to be treated with kindness, healed and reintegrated into society. But recovery rates remained stubbornly low, and as the century progressed the asylums filled and overflowed. Care was stretched thin and their humane intentions were lost in the crowded wards, where ever more patients were \u201cput away\u201d for life.</p> <p>In 1930 Bethlem moved once more, to its current site: a villa complex in Beckenham, in what was then London\u2019s leafy fringes. That year the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Treatment_Act_1930\">Mental Treatment Act</a> officially replaced the term \u201casylum\u201d with \u201cmental hospital\u201d and reconceived insanity as mental disease, to be treated with the latest developments in medical science. Yet despite their early therapeutic optimism, the mental hospitals filled up just as the asylums had, and for similar reasons. By the 1980s they were being closed at an astonishing rate, replaced wherever possible with medication-led treatments and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_in_the_Community\">\u201ccare in the community\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bd7d9579be54e592152796fd762d288257b9480\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bd7d9579be54e592152796fd762d288257b9480/46_31_4413_2512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An engraving of Bethlem hospital when it was in London Moorfields.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"569\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An engraving of Bethlem hospital when it was in London Moorfields.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Bethlem Museum of the Mind/Wellcome Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each incarnation of the asylum failed to live up to its early promise, yet each lives on in the post-asylum world. The need for custodial and residential institutions has not gone away, and the biomedical approach developed in mental hospitals remains the primary focus of clinical treatment.</p> <p>Over the past half century, however, attitudes to mental health have shifted once more. In the wake of the asylum, mental ill-health is no longer seen as something that can be segregated from society, but something that affects us all. With a growing tolerance to mental diversity, some of the more far-reaching dreams of the asylum are being reimagined. Throughout its history, progressive voices observed that the potential of patients living together to help one another was rarely tapped and often actively suppressed. Under some enlightened regimes they were encouraged to manage their own affairs: staffing the sickrooms, growing their own food and organising creative activities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/19/taking-over-the-asylum-art-made-at-bedlam-and-beyond-in-pictures\">Taking over the asylum: art made at Bedlam and beyond \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could the asylum be reconceived entirely as a grassroots project, not controlled from the top down but evolved from the ground up?

Unless we rebuild that coalition, Labour will never again win power and deliver the change Britain needs.</p> <p>I believe there\u2019s a new approach to immigration that Labour, and Britain, must take in the post-referendum era. It\u2019s no cheap imitation of Ukip, nor an \u201celectoral ploy\u201d, but an approach born of progressive values and our desire to see them realised. The starting point must be to view our core values through the prism of immigration, and to conclude that immigration itself is not a leftwing value. I am resolutely pro-immigration, yet I don\u2019t see immigration as a value; I see it as a social and economic dynamic. The difference is vital.</p> <p>Being pro-immigration means making it an economic, social and political success in the long term: as much immigration as is possible and sustainable, limited only by our ability to create the environment for all of Britain to thrive and feel valued.</p> <p>The referendum had a clear message: the limitless nature of freedom of movement, despite its proven economic benefits, is not socially and politically sustainable. That\u2019s why opposing freedom of movement isn\u2019t the same as opposing immigration.</p> <p>Two key values of the society we must build are openness and non-racism. These values aren\u2019t defined by the number of immigrants, but by the quality of experience every person has of this country. This allows us to set out the role of immigration within that: as much immigration as possible, without driving social tensions to such an extent that racism breaks out.</p> <p>It says we can be pro-immigration and champion immigrants as part of a non-racist and open society, while recognising we have to manage immigration so those values aren\u2019t threatened.</p> <p>This is facing up to a human truth: nobody is born racist, but immigration that reaches levels beyond a society\u2019s capacity to cope can lead, in extremes, to racism. That racism fuels a vicious, ugly backlash, in which there is tremendous anger in one community and tremendous fear in another. Nobody wins and everyone suffers. It sets back our ideal of an open and non-racist society, makes further immigration politically unsustainable and, as we\u2019ve seen in relation to Syria, means we cannot show our humanity to the refugees who need us.</p> <p>This approach doesn\u2019t mean we become less pro-immigration, just that we recognise we must balance our desire to encourage immigration with our ability to manage immigration and its impact.</p> <p>So, what would managed immigration look like in practice?</p> <p>The answer will be driven by how we judge who should be able to receive work permits. This must be a carefully calibrated approach so will likely have to be a system predicated on the applicant\u2019s skills and qualifications; the need for those skills in the economy; and their economic context.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A managed balance is what makes immigration sustainable and takes us ever closer to a non-racist, open society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the priority is designing a transition to a system based on work permits, this requires a comprehensive approach that stretches across almost every responsibility of government, from entry requirements and integration support, to economic and public service investment to combat marginalisation. This managed balance is what makes immigration sustainable and takes us ever closer to a non-racist, open society.</p> <p>These are complex questions, both in the process we create but also what the answers say about the nature of our country, with implications for our economic, trading and international future. We can\u2019t be squeamish about having a comprehensive discussion about how we do this \u2013 getting it right is too important.</p> <p>Some will say managing immigration is a \u201ctough\u201d approach. If limiting immigrant numbers were the defining objective, I would agree. But it is not.</p> <p>The managed immigration approach I am proposing is rooted in leftwing values and anchored in the reality of post-referendum Britain. It will allow us to build an open and non-racist society, and help rebuild Labour\u2019s electoral coalition, staying true to the values and pragmatism that have been the basis of our historic successes and support. It is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p> <p>It is also an approach that will be vital to Britain in a post-Brexit age: in the era of increasing globalisation, the people and countries who are successful in the future will be those open to other cultures, international opportunities and to new technologies. And the successful governments will be the ones that bring their people together, to make immigration work for all.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The full version of this article, which sets out the required shift in the immigration debate more comprehensively, can be seen in the new Fabian publication Facing the Unknown: Building a Progressive Response to Brexit </em></p>",
  "<p> Sir Alexander Morison stands tall and sombre with his top hat in his left hand and a white handkerchief in his right. His eyes are grey and slightly sunken, his lips thin, his face long and gaunt. He seems marked by the sadness of his profession. For Morison was an \u201calienist\u201d, a 19th-century doctor of mental illness, at London\u2019s infamous asylum Bethlem Hospital, popularly known as Bedlam, whose history and cultural significance are explored by the Wellcome Collection\u2019s new exhibition <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/bedlam\">Bedlam: The Asylum and Beyond</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/19/taking-over-the-asylum-art-made-at-bedlam-and-beyond-in-pictures\">Taking over the asylum: art made at Bedlam and beyond \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man who painted this portrait of Morison there in 1852 was one of his most pitiable patients. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/17/richard-dadd-victorian-artist-bedlam-mental-illness-fairies\">Richard Dadd</a> had been marked out for a brilliant career but this gifted young painter became confused on the way back from a trip to the Middle East in 1842, thinking he was receiving messages from the ancient Egyptian gods and had uncovered a plot by the pope to have him killed. In 1843, he met his father on a country lane in Kent and stabbed him to death because he thought he was the devil. Dadd spent the rest of his life in Bedlam and at Broadmoor. In both institutions, his doctors provided him with materials and space to paint \u2013 contradicting modern caricatures of the Victorian asylum as a brutal \u201cmadhouse\u201d. </p> <p>Dadd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/d/artist/richard-dadd/object/sir-alexander-morison-1779-1866-alienist-pg-2623\">portrait of his doctor</a> is an eerie masterpiece whose take on reality is captivatingly askew. His eye for detail is exact, even miraculous \u2013 but is it a little too exact for comfort? The shape of Morison\u2019s shiny black hat, held upside down to reveal the yellow lining inside, engrosses him. So do the figures of two tiny women in the background who are totally out of proportion to the tall, thin doctor. Dadd is fascinated by Morison. He sees him as a heroic, lonely pillar of compassion. Yet with his wild white hair the alienist looks like he could just as easily be an inmate as a doctor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e9ecf56320d1ebc2d77bd945fddc4353a7a56ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e9ecf56320d1ebc2d77bd945fddc4353a7a56ed/59_0_2205_2755/800.jpg\" alt=\"The 1890 etching L\u2019Homme \u00e0 la Pipe by Van Gogh depicts the doctor who treated the artist after leaving Saint-R\u00e9my asylum.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1890 etching L\u2019Homme \u00e0 la Pipe by Van Gogh depicts the doctor who treated the artist after leaving Saint-R\u00e9my asylum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Trustees of the British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 150 years later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2013/nov/21/images-bedlam-art-therapy-bethlem-hospital-video\">Bethlem Royal Hospital still exists</a>, although it has changed its location, architecture and attitude to mental illness. Today it is home to an artist called Mr X who makes amazing trucks and vans out of cardboard. In a video, he tours Bromley in his homemade vehicles, driving into a filling station and on the main road. No one bats an eyelid. Most significantly he drives in and out of the hospital gates, for Mr X is not a prisoner. </p> <p>The Wellcome\u2019s exhibition tells a story of changing attitudes to mental illness from the middle ages to now, using Bedlam hospital as both an example and a metaphor of the rise and fall of the asylum. Why were \u201clunatics\u201d locked away from the 17th century onwards, when they had not been before, and why have asylums been abolished since the 1960s? </p> <p>I think that\u2019s a fair summing up of the exhibition\u2019s intentions. I hope it is. This is a serious, absorbing subject, and the curators bring together a rich variety of documents, photographs, books, films and art. Yet Bedlam is a confused and complacent exhibition that touches on huge issues but fails to follow through \u2013 often adopting a semi-ironic pose.</p> <p>The revolution in thinking about mental illness in the 1960s, for instance, is encapsulated by some controversial books in a transparent case. What exactly is anyone going to learn about the history of psychiatry by looking at the cover of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_and_Civilization\">Michel Foucault\u2019s Madness and Civilisation</a>? Either you\u2019ve read it, in which case looking at it in a vitrine is a bit irrelevant, or you haven\u2019t, and you need to know what it actually argues \u2013 not to mention the debates it provokes. </p> <p>Even sillier is an exhibit consisting of a drug company\u2019s brochure illustrated with paintings by Salvador Dal\u00ed. It\u2019s too flip as a way of dealing with anything, let alone the lives of millions of people afflicted by mental illness and its treatments. Worse, these superficial hints at vast cultural changes and misrepresent the history of psychiatry. Radicals including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/26/obituaries/michel-foucault-french-historian.html\">Foucault</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/rd-laing-mental-health-sanity\">RD Laing</a> are equated with the evolution of pharmaceuticals (there\u2019s a jar of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/03/will-self-psychiatrist-drug-medication\">Largactil</a> on display) when they represent diametrically opposed attitudes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2291281a30bb7ebc30c30bf6b2aea99cbc8b5745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2291281a30bb7ebc30c30bf6b2aea99cbc8b5745/43_0_4065_5016/810.jpg\" alt=\"Epitaph of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II, 1834, by Bedlam resident James Hadfield.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epitaph of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II, 1834, by Bedlam resident James Hadfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Stokes/Bethlem Museum of the Mind</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s much more poignant to see that it was health minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/0098/feb/09/obituaries.mikephillips\">Enoch Powell</a> who announced a much more sceptical approach to asylums in Britain in the early 1960s and so helped spearhead new attitudes to mental illness. I doubt if old Enoch was a big reader of Foucault\u2019s theories. So what was his thinking? The exhibition does not tell us.</p> <p>The history of asylums is a vast theme, of course, but this exhibition fails to make sense of it. Bedlam is both a real place and a modern myth. The Wellcome could have created a powerful exhibition by concentrating on this dark shadow on the story of London. If it stuck to its title and shone a light into Bedlam, it would be much more moving. Instead, it throws in loads of other stuff \u2013 including plenty of second-rate contemporary art \u2013 and ends up being vague, diffuse and empty. </p> <p>The show is at its most compelling when it reveals the sad, strange world of London\u2019s historic asylum. A view drawn by JT Smith in 1812 shows the wall of Bedlam seen from the street. Barred windows induce a shudder. Sheets hang out of them \u2013 relics of escape attempts? The strangest detail is a man bent double on the street outside. Is he mad or sane? This haunting print suggests that London\u2019s streets are as eccentric and idiosyncratic as the closed wards of Bedlam itself. </p> <p> This suspicion that \u201cmadness\u201d does not respect the walls of Bedlam has long haunted art and literature. In texts of Restoration plays exhibited here, there are jokes about London being one big Bedlam. In <a href=\"http://www.soane.org/collections-research/key-stories/rakes-progress\">William Hogarth\u2019s picture The Rake in Bedlam</a> \u2013 shown here only as a print \u2013 inmates of a dank chamber exhibit various symptoms of insanity, from a man dressed as the pope to the half-naked, shaven-headed Rake who stares fixedly at the floor, fallen into a \u201cmelancholy\u201d madness of paralysing despair. (The paintings of Hogarth\u2019s Rake\u2019s Progress are in Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum.) Hogarth depicts two well-dressed ladies who have come to gawp at the lunatics: they seem the most foolish of all. A society that laughs at the mad is itself mad. Hogarth was a social reformer, and he is pointing out one of the grotesque abuses \u2013 letting in paying voyeurs \u2013 that made Bedlam notorious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dde40cb80cdfca10572ba554cd97917ef4d96185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dde40cb80cdfca10572ba554cd97917ef4d96185/0_0_5996_4002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madlove \u2013 Designer Asylum, 2016, by Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian\u2019s asylum design for the Madlove \u2013 Designer Asylum project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas SG Farnetti/Wellcome Images/Courtesy the Vacuum Cleaner and Hannah Hull</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/05/vincent-van-gogh-myths-madness-and-a-new-way-of-painting\">Madness and Civilisation</a>, which the Wellcome invites us to judge by its cover, Foucault imagines a medieval world where madness was celebrated and included in the community, until the asylum locked unreason away.

  "<p>Although they both served successive Labour governments, it would be hard to think of two politicians more different than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/ed-balls-labour-minister-memoir\">Ed Balls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/alan-johnson-lay-off-last-labour-government-if-you-want-to-get-elected\">Alan Johnson</a>. Balls, a middle-class product of Oxford and Harvard, was a bright, driven, occasionally intimidating presence throughout 13 years of Labour government. For much of that time he was a backroom boy at the frenetic court of chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/inspiring-view-britishness-defeat-brexit-isolationists\">Gordon Brown</a>, ending up as education secretary in Brown\u2019s cabinet.</p> <p>Johnson, by contrast, was the orphaned child of an impoverished single mother, who started his working life as a warehouse assistant in the Hammersmith branch of Tesco, rising by some almost miraculous process, via the postal sorting office at Slough, to hold five cabinet posts.</p> <p>For all that Balls had a reputation as a political bruiser, <strong>Speaking Out</strong> is a thoughtful memoir, sometimes self-deprecating, occasionally boastful, but always rational and balanced. There are hints at the difficulty of working for so volatile and demanding a political master as Gordon Brown, but no great revelations. Of the low-intensity warfare between Downing Street and the Treasury that dogged Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, in which Balls undoubtedly played a part, he says little except that there was fault on both sides.</p> <p>Clearly there was no love lost between Balls and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-endorses-owen-smith-for-labour-leader\">Ed Miliband</a>, whom he worked alongside both in the Treasury and later as shadow chancellor under Miliband\u2019s leadership. For much of the time they were barely communicating. \u201cWe would go for days, sometimes weeks, without a conversation.\u201d At times, history seemed to be repeating itself. \u201cWhen members of [Ed Miliband\u2019s] inner circle would brief against me from time to time, he clearly found it painful and offensive, and would apologise in a very heartfelt way. But as with Tony and Gordon, years before, his apparent dismay didn\u2019t stop it happening.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/sep/07/ed-balls-strictly-versus-politics-true-meaning-of-brexit-politics-weekly-podcast\">Ed Balls on Strictly versus politics, plus the true meaning of Brexit \u2013 Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one thing not explained in any detail is New Labour\u2019s love affair with the bankers and enthusiasm for so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/labour-regulations-city-rbs-collapse\">light-touch regulation</a>\u201d. As a casual reading of Brown\u2019s annual Mansion House speeches demonstrates, he became more and more sycophantic with each year that passed. Towards the end of his term, the chancellor was positively euphoric, singing the praises of the City for inventing \u201cthe most modern instruments of finance\u201d and going so far as to assert that, thanks to the genius of the City, we were living in \u201ca new golden age\u201d. All this addressed to some of the very people who helped bring the global financial system to the edge of ruin. Presumably Balls had something to do with it. Indeed, he gave one or two similar speeches of his own. It would be of interest to know how such intelligent people as Balls and Brown could possibly have bought into such nonsense, and yet the author offers little by way of explanation.</p> <p>Balls is at his best when he is in a reflective mood. There are chapters entitled Ambition, Image, Risks, Spin, Emotion, Mistakes, Hinterland. In a chapter headed Assumptions, he points out that just about all the assumptions he shared with the other bright young things in his class at Harvard 25 years ago turned out to be wide of the mark or just plain wrong. No one foresaw the rise of China or that the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/globalisation\">globalisation</a> would become about the movement of people \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 with the potential to destabilise existing economic systems.</p> <p>Come the general election in May 2015, Balls\u2019s world fell apart. Had Labour won, he would have become chancellor. In the event, not only did the chancellorship elude him, but he lost his seat in parliament. Suddenly, after 20 years at the centre of events, he found himself out of work, aged only 48. Even so, he is not short of things to do, lecturing at Harvard, chairing the board of his beloved Norwich City, competing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/strictly-come-dancing-launch-show-draws-more-than-10m-viewers\"><em>Strictly Come Dancing</em></a>. Plus, of course, he has more time to devote to his family. This book is part memoir, part therapy. In the long run, I suspect that out of politics he will be a happier man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6c0ea855fab9d1944ebd161b58dae19a4d3070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6c0ea855fab9d1944ebd161b58dae19a4d3070/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Johnson: \u2018I had no wide network of contacts and I\u2019d never been to a dinner party in my life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/long-and-winding-road.html\"><strong>The Long and Winding Road</strong></a><strong> </strong>is the third and final volume of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/aug/13/politics.economicpolicy\">Alan Johnson</a>\u2019s remarkable memoir. It opens in the early 1990s as our hero is about to become general secretary of the Union of Communications Workers. In this role his principal (and not inconsiderable) achievement was to see off attempts by the then Tory government to privatise the Post Office.</p> <p>Then, as the 1997 election approached, he receives a call from Tony Blair asking if he fancies becoming a Labour MP, a thought that had never previously occurred to him. With just two weeks to go he is shoehorned into a safe Labour seat in Hull and, with another wave of Blair\u2019s magic wand, is soon wafted into government. Over the next decade he holds no fewer than seven ministerial jobs, eventually ending up as home secretary under Gordon Brown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/alan-johnson-lay-off-last-labour-government-if-you-want-to-get-elected\">Alan Johnson: 'Lay off last Labour government if you want to get elected'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The way he tells it, and there is no reason to doubt his version, it all seems so effortless.

He does not address the possibility that had he not been so laid-back he might easily have become leader and perhaps prime minister. Fittingly, he ends with a tribute to his mother, Lily, who after a miserably short life died, tragically, at 42, never knowing how life would turn out for young Alan and his redoubtable sister, Linda.

  "<p>One offshoot of the Brexit aftermath that is particularly disturbing is a growing obsession with the \u201cpost-truth\u201d society. This has allegedly sprung into being because politicians who made stuff up polled well in the EU referendum and, in Michael Gove\u2019s catchy line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">\u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">You\u2019re wrong Michael Gove \u2013 experts are trusted far more than you | Anand Menon and Jonathan Portes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This assertion has put politicians and the research community on the defensive. It expressed the feeling of being cut adrift by the electorate, which surged through government, the civil service and professional bodies following the referendum result. It has now spiralled into a debate about how to better appeal to \u201cpost-truth\u201d citizens, as though they are baffling and lack reason. In fact those citizens could say the same of the discussions about immigration, public spending and why we were having a referendum in the first place, all of which the politicians did not confront.</p> <p>Anyway, are the public really sick of experts? Given the provenance of that claim, shouldn\u2019t somebody with sense have checked it before we all set to trying to work out how to handle it? </p> <p>Fortunately someone has. <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/trust-government-growing-%E2%80%93-it-needs-deliver\">The Institute for Government (IfG) has released a poll</a>, conducted by Populus, which suggests that 85% of people want politicians to consult professionals and experts when making difficult decisions, and 83% want government to make decisions based on objective evidence. Trust in experts and confidence in government have both increased since a similar poll in 2014 and people who voted leave and remain share much the same view.</p> <p>This unequivocal finding must now chase the debate. The rush to believe that facts and evidence aren\u2019t what people want is already streaming through policy and professional circles and influencing a rethink of how to communicate with the public. A post-Brexit <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130803-500-post-brexit-experts-need-to-reassert-their-value-to-society/\">New Scientist editorial</a> proposed communicators of science use more emotion. Civil servants who, pre-referendum, were embracing the demand to share more of the evidence behind policy are now talking as if it were subversive - \u201cnow\u2019s not a good time to raise this with the minister\u201d. </p> <p>No doubt some election 2020 Svengali is right now writing the plans for how to win over a post-truth electorate - more statements on buses. Someone at an event I attended last week declared that while experts are trusted by \u201cpeople in this room\u201d, ie professionals, the public out there doesn\u2019t have the same respect for expertise. They don\u2019t use it in their daily lives. He clearly doesn\u2019t have a subscription to Sky Sports, where an hour\u2019s viewing guarantees multiple encounters with statistics, unlike the passage of many bills through parliament.</p> <p>This is, however, all a counsel of unnecessary despair and the IfG poll couldn\u2019t make that clearer.</p> <p>So why is a post-truth, evidence-rejecting public so beguiling? Because, I\u2019m afraid, it flatters timidity and easy populism. Big decisions are hard. Policymaking is not straightforward. There are always trade-offs, mitigating factors and politics to contend with and these are difficult to communicate. Facts and evidence are disruptive too. They don\u2019t always fit easily with scoring points or appealing to prejudices in debates about immigration, drugs or prison sentences. Sometimes they\u2019re just hard work to explain. The idea of a post-truth public is an excuse to run from all this.</p> <p>Yes, people respond to slogans and emotion. Most of us do, but politicians and communicators who insist this means the public doesn\u2019t want to be informed risk driving us to a two-tier society \u2013 one in which evidence is discussed in corridors of power, senior common rooms and private members clubs, while publicly leaders just play to the gallery or hide. </p> <p>Such doublespeak is not an appeal to the public and its priorities. It\u2019s elitist and obnoxious. It means that the account of the world that decision-makers work from goes unscrutinised and fewer of us get to consider the world as it really is. It is the stuff of the 1950s, when what authorities knew privately on subjects including homosexuality and abortion didn\u2019t appear in the public domain. For a healthy society we must insist that we discuss what we know about all aspects of it openly, in public.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/\">Sense about Science</a>, where I am director, I hear from people all the time about why evidence matters, on subjects as diverse as air pollution, childcare, the safety of military personnel and cause-of-death investigations. These are people who want to make the best choices and to be able to tell when people in authority are doing so ; people who aren\u2019t looking for a sound bite or a quick fix, who expect policy to draw on experts and evidence.</p> <p>We all have work to do to create more space for a frank discussion of what we know and a culture where that\u2019s expected. Maybe this aggravating debate spawned by Brexit \u2013 and the correctives it is now prompting from the IfG and others\u2013 is just the catalyst we need. </p> <p>People\u2019s attraction to some of the dodgiest claims of the referendum was a signal of many things, but it was not an invitation to people in authority to abandon the principle of truthfulness in public life. </p>",

  "<p>European embassies in Britain have logged dozens of incidents of suspected hate crime and abuse against their citizens since the vote to leave the European Union, according to figures obtained by the Guardian.<br></p> <p>The vast majority of xenophobic incidents involved citizens from eastern European countries, with more attacks against Poles than all the other nationalities put together, the survey of EU embassies in London revealed. </p> <p>The Polish consular service in London, Manchester and Edinburgh has logged 31 incidents of reported hate crime since 23 June, including eight attacks in the past three weeks. </p> <p>They include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/31/harlow-death-arkadiusz-jozwik-exposes-left-behind-town-where-residents-live-in-fear\">killing of Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik in Harlow</a>, in an apparently unprovoked attack that is being treated by police as a possible hate crime. Five 15-year-old boys and one 16-year-old boy, all from Harlow, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/30/five-teenage-boys-arrested-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-essex\">arrested on suspicion of murdering J\u00f3\u017awik</a> and bailed until 7 October pending further inquiries. A second Polish man survived the attack.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted the London embassies of all 27 EU member states. Of the 17 embassies that replied, almost half reported a rise in incidents of xenophobic abuse in the 12 weeks since the EU referendum. Between them, there were 60 incidents logged, including shots fired at a Lithuanian home in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, this month, an arson attack on a Romanian shop in Norwich in July and a break-in at a home in Nottingham in the immediate aftermath of the vote when a Latvian family were called \u201cfucking immigrants\u201d and told to leave the UK. </p> <p>The bulk of the attacks were against Poles or people mistaken for Poles. A Finnish mother was told \u201cPoles go home\u201d when she was overheard talking to her children, according to the Finnish embassy in London. The embassies of western European countries that responded to the survey, including Spain, France and Germany, reported no post-referendum abuse against their citizens. </p> <p>Arkady Rzegocki, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said he was \u201csaddened by each and every incident\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe Polish community is the largest national minority in the UK and, due to its visibility, may be statistically an easier target of xenophobic abuse. We recognise and appreciate the show of solidarity from the British public and the decisive steps taken by the British government and local authorities to resolve the problem. We need to work together to foster dialogue and mutual understanding between communities.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of hate crime in the wake of the vote was raised by London-based diplomats at a working lunch of the Nordic group of ambassadors on Tuesday. Latvia\u2019s ambassador, Baiba Bra\u017ee, who hosted the lunch, said: \u201cIt is a trend that we discussed. Our citizens have not experienced anything like this before the referendum.<br></p> <p>\u201cNone of six incidents [involving Latvians] referred to the referendum, but there is maybe an atmosphere that is more permitting of unpleasant words and maybe actions. There shouldn\u2019t be any discrimination and the Latvian community shouldn\u2019t let it go unreported.\u201d </p> <p>Jon Burnett, a researcher at the Institute of Race Relations, said: \u201cThe upsurge in attacks against eastern Europeans should come as no surprise, given the way that they have been portrayed repeatedly as scroungers, cheats and, ultimately, threats. This depiction, which intensified in the build-up to the referendum, of course predated it. The hate crimes are a product of a politically constructed climate which has been years in the making.\u201d</p> <p>Bra\u017ee welcomed the British government\u2019s assurances that it would not tolerate such abuse. She said she had been encouraged by a fall in incidents involving Latvians since the immediate aftermath of the vote. </p> <p>But the Polish embassy is troubled by a recent uptick in violence against Poles. Many of the 31 attacks it recorded took place in the days after the vote and, by early August, the embassy had detected a lull in incidents. But there has been a new spike in attacks, with eight incidents in the past three weeks, including attacks on three other Poles in Harlow and an allegedly racist attack on a Polish man in the Armley area of Leeds last Friday. </p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re going to put cameras up\u2019</h2> <p>In the days after the Brexit vote, one Polish family in Plymouth felt the force of what appears to be a continuing spike in hate crimes across the country. An arson attack destroyed a shed at their home in Efford. The perpetrators left a note <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-36737529\">which read</a>: \u201cGo back to your country next be [sic] your family.\u201d</p> <p>Ewa Banaszek, 22, said the experience had stayed with her and her family but they were trying to get on with their lives and had received support from the local community.

I told Hannah [Brotherstone], who arranged the fundraising, how overwhelmed we were. We now have the money and we are going to put cameras up around the house and this will help to pay for them.</p> <p>\u201cSince the incident we have tried to just get on with our life. The attack will always be in the back of my mind, but people have been supportive.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Cuerden, hate crime manager for Victim Support in Wales, said a media focus on hate crime had led to a positive impact in encouraging victims to speak out. </p> <p>\u201cIt has made people feel empowered to come forward and report what has happened to them. I think because of that we are getting a truer picture of the scale of hate crime,\u201d he said. \u201cResearch shows that it is underreported \u2013 50% of people wait until it gets more serious before they consider reporting and instead they tend to normalise incidents. But this attention on hate crime has made them feel able to report, which is a positive thing.\u201d</p> <p>Iolanda Viegas, a councillor for the Portuguese community in Wrexham, north Wales, said people had been heartened by the support they were receiving from their neighbours and from the police in the aftermath of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cThe police have come along to tell us what to do if these incidents happen, they have talked to people about what a hate crime is and what they should do if they are targeted. And many people in the wider community are helping. At least we feel we are not alone and that someone will help us.\u201d</p> <h2>Embassy breakdown of reported xenophobic incidents since the referendum</h2> <p><strong>Poland </strong>31 incidents reported as hate crimes. As well as the killing of J\u00f3\u017awik they include eight assaults, including attacks on Polish men in Yeovil, St Ives and Leeds; seven attacks on Polish homes and businesses; and four cases of abusive graffiti, including messages scrawled on the front door of the Polish Cultural Association in Hammersmith, west London, and on a war memorial in Portsmouth. The 31 cases include six reports of fresh abuse in longstanding complaints about intimidation from neighbours that predate the referendum.</p> <p><strong>Lithuania </strong>10 incidents of alleged hate crimes, five of which are being investigated by the police.

The Coalition received Deloitte\u2019s report on Friday.</p> <p>Joyce said he and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, would take a submission to cabinet, while the assistant minister Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker was working on \u201cbringing something formidable forward\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesman for Hartsuyker would not comment on whether a compromise of 18-19% was being considered.<br></p> <p>He said the Coalition understood working holiday makers were a vital source of labour, particularly in the agriculture and tourism sectors.</p> <p>\u201cThe review of working holiday visas is considering this issue alongside a broad range of related issues to ensure that policies supporting the seasonal and temporary labour market protect vulnerable workers and keep Australia globally competitive into the future,\u201d Hartsuyker said.</p> <p>Before July\u2019s federal election, the Queensland Liberal National party MP George Christensen had threatened to resign if the backpacker tax was not dropped \u2013 a threat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/18/george-christensen-predicts-coalition-will-axe-backpacker-tax-after-threats-to-quit-lnp?CMP=soc_567\">reported</a> only in recent days.</p> <p>On Monday, Christensen predicted on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gchristensenmp/?hc_ref=SEARCH&amp;fref=nf\">Facebook page</a> the tax would go, although he used a rate of 31.5% instead of 32.5%.</p> <p>\u201cThe 31.5% backpacker tax is soon to go, meaning local farmers will still have access to a workforce. We are in there, fighting for outcomes like this every day.\u201d</p> <p>Joyce said he had had meetings with Christensen, whom he described as a \u201cgood bloke\u201d and a \u201cstrong player within the National party\u201d.</p> <p>Joyce \u2013 who himself crossed the floor 28 times to vote against his party \u2013 said he wanted to ensure he could \u201ckeep our team together\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through this situation before,\u201d Joyce told the ABC. \u201cBob Katter was a strong player within the National party and he did leave and that is the last thing I want. </p> <p>\u201cI want to make sure we keep our team together. I know George believes we are a vastly better alternative to the Labor-Greens-independent alliance, which is what you are going to get if the Coalition is not there. We have had a crack at that.</p> <p>\u201cI know George is not going to say, \u2018well that\u2019s a better form of government\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Morrison said he had had discussions with colleagues, including Christensen, but again warned savings would have to be made elsewhere if the tax was changed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/coalition-delays-backpacker-tax-by-six-months-but-wont-commit-to-scrap-it\">Coalition delays backpacker tax by six months but won't commit to scrap it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf there are changes to be made, it is my view as treasurer they will be made in a way that does not disadvantage the budget,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>Morrison said Christensen had told him the statements attributed to him at the weekend were made well before the election.</p> <p>The Queensland tourism minister, Kate Jones, said the latest international visitor data showed the tax was already turning backpackers away before it is even introduced.</p> <p>\u201cSince the tax was announced we have seen working visa holiday visitor nights down by close to 9% in Queensland,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn the year to June 2016, Queensland recorded 12.3m backpacker visitor nights down from 13.5m in the 12 months to June 2015.</p> <p>\u201cWe also saw the total number of backpackers visiting Queensland drop from 338,000 to 331,000 over the same period.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan Brooke-Barnett, a spokesman for Ausveg, the body representing vegetable growers, said the industry could \u201clive with\u201d a rate between 15% and 19%, which would be internationally competitive.</p> <p>\u201cWe are keen to see review as quickly as possible,\u201d Brooke-Barnett said. \u201cWe want take the heat out of the policy and we have a firm commitment from government there will be some kind of resolution. An internationally competitive rate would be between 15-19% and we could live with that.\u201d</p> <p>He warned backpackers were planning their travel for the next 12 months and informal feedback to the industry from backpackers and growers was that the policy would affect their plans.<br></p> <p>Last week Ausveg was in Canberra to lobby the government and met a number of National party MPs as well as the Greens and independents, including Jacqui Lambie.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend former prime minister Tony Abbott has been explaining to European conservatives why they should <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/tony-abbott-lets-fly-at-russia-and-eus-lax-border-control-in-prague/news-story/b184ffd903508b62c99982bff115a3da\">heed Australia\u2019s success in controlling its borders</a>.

Instead, here are the three lessons Europeans should take.</p> <h2><strong>Costs too much</strong></h2> <p>The reality is that most countries won\u2019t be able to use Australia\u2019s techniques to stop people movements due to the number of arrivals and the prohibitive expense involved.</p> <p>It is true that Australia has had <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/nation-reviewed-robert-manne-comment-asylum-seekers-2706\">success in stopping the boats</a> through disrupting people smugglers\u2019 business model. This has involved turning back boats to Indonesia, offshore processing and the use of detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea based on a policy that boat arrivals will never be resettled in Australia. Australia has shown that government can influence the number of arrivals through policy settings.</p> <p>However, Australia\u2019s success is not replicable in most other countries. It can only be attempted by the richest of countries which have low refugee numbers.</p> <p>Per capita, the financial cost is enormous. This week\u2019s Australian National Audit Office report details a cost of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-13/immigration-dept-criticised-by-audit-office-offshore-centres/7839902\">$573,111 per person per year</a> for holding on Manus Island and Nauru. Australia spends more than <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\">$1bn per year on offshore processing</a> for fewer than 2,000 people. This is not a model the EU can emulate with migration flows of <a href=\"http://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-204311-deaths-2443\">more than 200,000</a> in January to May this year alone.</p> <p>It is also worth mentioning the non-fiscal costs related to this policy. Australia\u2019s international relationships have been effected, particularly with Nauru and Papua New Guinea where Australia is accused of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-18/governor-slams-neo-colonialist-png-asylum-seek-deal/5977560\">neo-colonialism</a> and, crucially, with rising power Indonesia where issues around migration have <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-20/indonesia-relationship-at-low-point-labor-says/6560952\">created friction</a> in one of Australia\u2019s most important relationships.</p> <p>The detention of refugees has a demonstrably high cost for those in detention. The Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/publications/forgotten-children-national-inquiry-children\">National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention</a> is unequivocal on the negative impact of prolonged detention on detainees\u2019 mental and physical health.</p> <p>The bottom line is that you can\u2019t stop people movements of the scale occurring in Europe by adopting Australia\u2019s border policies.</p> <h2><strong>Migration can work</strong></h2> <p>The second lesson to be taken from Australia is more positive: it is that mass migration can really work.</p> <p>The Australian experience shows the economic and cultural benefits of mass migration. From a small white settler society at the end of the second world war, Australia has been transformed to a vibrant multicultural nation. Statistics show that <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/3412.0Media%20Release12014-15\">28% of the population was born overseas</a> \u2013 with at least <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/2071.0main+features902012-2013\">another 20%</a> the child of an overseas-born parent.</p> <p>This is a dramatic change and results have been broadly positive. For example, Australia is one of only three countries in the world where <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/children-of-migrants-outclassing-the-locals-at-school/story-fn59nlz9-1226136191182\">children of migrants</a> score better at school than children of non-migrants.</p> <p>Australia has reaped the economic benefits of migration. Tracing Australia\u2019s history, George Megalogenis links <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/george-megalogenis-on-australias-second-chance/6794052\">periods of economic growth to times when Australia was open to migration</a>. The current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, drew this lesson: \u201copenness and multiculturalism based on mutual respect is what has defined most of the most successful societies in the world\u201d.</p> <p>When Europeans worry about the impossibility of integration of those with different cultural or religious backgrounds, Australia is a salutary case study of what is possible.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s under control</strong></h2> <p>The final lesson to be drawn from Australia is that the second lesson is tied to the first: to achieve societal acceptance of mass migration, the public has to be convinced that the process is under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/22/the-claim-that-locking-asylum-seekers-up-in-nauru-and-png-saves-lives-is-bogus\">The claim that locking asylum seekers up in Nauru and PNG saves lives is bogus | Philippe Legrain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the fascinating lesson from John Howard\u2019s prime ministership. The prime minister who took such a hard line on border security was also the one who oversaw significant increases in overall migration; in 2007 the number of permanent migrants hit 191,000: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-27/berg---immigration/4394382\">the largest cohort since the second world war</a>.</p> <p>He understood this truth: that to build acceptance of mass migration, governments have to convince the public that the process is under control.</p> <p>The core aim of Australia\u2019s migration program is that it is orderly. South Sudanese who wait patiently in refugee camps can be resettled through a humanitarian program. The announcement of 12,000 places for carefully checked and screened Syrian refugees was welcomed. By contrast, news reports of people arriving \u201cuninvited\u201d by boat taps into the national neurosis about being overrun by swarms from the north.</p> <p>At a time when a huge number of people are on the move and where very few countries accept long-term resettlement, we need to think about what we can do to help prepare our populations to understand and respond.</p> <p>In this context it\u2019s vital to draw the right lessons from Australia\u2019s experience.</p> <p><em>Melissa Conley Tyler is the national executive director of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. </em></p>",

  "<p>The ABC\u2019s two-part documentary, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/howard-on-menzies-building-modern-australia/\">Howard on Menzies: Building Modern Australia</a>, is an ambitious enterprise. It seeks to establish the centrality of the Menzies years in the creation of modern Australia, thereby emphasising the crucial importance of Robert Menzies himself in building the Australia of today.</p> <p>This program is a work of historical and political revisionism. Its target is the view, expressed most forcefully <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/10/21/gough-broke-menzian-torpor-keating\">by Paul Keating</a>, that the 1950s was a time when Australia remained locked in the past in a self-induced stupor, brought about by a failure to recognise that the time of the British empire was over.</p> <p>Keating\u2019s rhetoric is both anachronistic and an expression of a sectarian view of the world that was long dead by the 1990s. There can be no doubt that Australia became modern between 1949 and 1966, the year Menzies retired as prime minister.</p> <h2>Australian modernity</h2> <p>Two examples, neither mentioned in the documentary, of events in 1966 are emblematic of the coming of Australian modernity. One was the introduction, just after Menzies\u2019 retirement, of <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/decimal_currency\">decimal coinage</a>. Gone forever were the days of dinars, zacs and tres.</p> <p>The other was the closing of Sydney\u2019s <a href=\"http://aussietheatre.com.au/features/venue-histories/the-tivoli-theatre\">Tivoli Theatre</a>. This marked the funeral rites of Australian vaudeville, once dominated by Australia\u2019s greatest comic genius, Roy Rene.</p> <p>The documentary captures this transformation to modern Australia quite well in two ways.</p> <p>One is its depiction of the growing affluence of Australian society under Menzies, as Australians sought a home of their own and consumer goods.</p> <p>The other was in the <a href=\"http://australianpolity.com/australian-polity/the-liberal-view-of-higher-education\">Menzies\u2019 education revolution</a>, whereby the commonwealth government assumed responsibility for funding universities and began to provide money for nongovernment schools.</p> <h2>Menzies\u2019 advances</h2> <p>Modern Australia would be both addicted to consumer goods and increasingly come to see education as the panacea for its problems. What was dying was an older version of Australia that existed largely to supply the metropolitan part of the empire with primary produce.</p> <p>It also included a vision of Australia as a rural civilisation in which ordinary people could own their own small farm. That vision was finally put to rest in the 1950s.</p> <p>Australia was confirmed as an urban civilisation, which nevertheless would become wealthy by selling mineral products to Asia. Menzies\u2019 role in the creation of that new order is confirmed in terms of the way in which he <a href=\"http://www.joshfrydenberg.com.au/siteData/uploadedData/Frydenberg%20-%20Speech%20-%20The%202014%20Sir%20Robert%20Menzies%20Lecture%20-%2014%20August%202014.pdf\">opened up trade with Asia</a>.</p> <p>Menzies\u2019 great virtue, which can be seen by watching him in this documentary, is that he was not in a hurry, as compared with, say, Gough Whitlam.</p> <p>Menzies\u2019 demeanour and carriage were those of someone who was relaxed and comfortable, who was willing to make what changes needed to be done, but would not force the rate of change as do many 21st century politicians. For him, liberalism had its traditional Australian meaning of good government.<br></p> <p>It is often forgotten that when Menzies came to power in 1949 Britain was still a major destination for Australian exports, and those exports were largely primary produce. The shift away from trade with Britain occurred during the Menzies years, and Australia adjusted accordingly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1db21a0cee22128aa2b1cf2a0d1d0acfbafcb18c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db21a0cee22128aa2b1cf2a0d1d0acfbafcb18c/0_0_2424_3200/758.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Menzies\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Menzies, the longest-serving Australian prime minister, adopted a \u2018steady as she goes\u2019 approach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Auspics/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, it might be argued these changes would have occurred under whatever government was in power and that a Labor government would have been more progressive. That would be to read today\u2019s politics back into the 1950s.</p> <p>Labor was far more supportive of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/archives/80days/stories/2012/01/19/3415230.htm\">White Australia</a> than the Liberals; there is a lovely scene in the documentary in which Labor leader Arthur Calwell gives the big NO to Asian immigration. The Labor party of the 1950s was not a party of educated individuals; it was locked into the past far more than the Liberals.</p> <h2>Explaining history</h2> <p>There are two facets of any attempt to explain history. One is composed of long-term social, economic and cultural changes. The other is the day-to-day events, especially in the world of politics.</p> <p>In the first facet, this documentary succeeds in portraying very well the way in which Menzies played a key role as a midwife of modern Australia.</p> <p>In the second area it might be seen as being less successful. One reason for this is that when one looks at political change it is always complex.</p> <p>Books can deal with this complexity; documentaries by their nature must reduce complexity to simplicity. For example, I cannot recall a single reference to the Country party in the documentary \u2013 and yet the Country party played a crucial role in Menzies\u2019 political career.</p> <p>If any event holds the key to Menzies\u2019 long term as prime minister it was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_1954\">1954 election</a> and its consequences. This did not seem to be treated adequately in the documentary.</p> <p>There is discussion of the <a href=\"http://petrov.moadoph.gov.au/royal-commission.html\">Petrov Affair</a>, presumably because it provides good footage, but no real explanation as to why the defeat was so devastating for HV Evatt and the consequences so dire for Labor.</p> <p>Here, it seems to me is the prime example of the benefit of Menzies\u2019 \u201csteady as she goes\u201d approach. Labor tore itself apart because of two men who were in too much of a hurry, Doc Evatt and Bob Santamaria.</p> <p>In 1952 and 1953 it really looked as if Labor was certain to win in 1954. This raised both Santamaria\u2019s and Evatt\u2019s expectations, which, among other things, encouraged Santamaria in his task of \u201cpermeating\u201d the Labor party in the hope a Labor government would be able to put into place his utopian scheme of re-Christianising Australia.</p> <p>Defeat devastated both men and helped create the circumstances under which Menzies was presented with the <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/alp_split\">Labor Split</a>. John Howard is right, Menzies\u2019 calm hands on the ship of state ensured his government calm waters with a light breeze, while the clash of personalities of Evatt and Santamaria pushed Labor towards the rocks.</p> <p>Howard is also correct in emphasising that a united Labor would have won back government. The claims by journalist Greg Sheridan that Labor was unfit to govern and had a number of senior figures who were closet communists only make sense when it is realised Sheridan is a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2015/s4280608.htm\">one-time Santamaria operative</a>.</p> <p>Documentaries unfortunately cannot help but simplify. Once one allows for this, one can only say that Howard has achieved his goal of linking Menzies with the changes that created, for better or for worse, a new \u201cmodern\u201d Australia.</p> <p>Menzies was not opposed to change; for example, he welcomed the advances of modern science. But he also understood that not all change is good. Unlike later politicians he did not seek to rush Australia into the future.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/gregory-melleuish-8479\">Gregory Melleuish</a> is an associate professor in the school of history and politics at the University of Wollongong, New South Wales.

  "<h2><strong>\u2018What lies beyond the wall is worse than death. It is a wasteland. It is the end\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Finally, a really great episode! The show decided to stop being oblique about its intentions and murky about its existential philosophy and offered up a solid hour where themes of motherhood, family, imprisonment and faith reverberated throughout disparate storylines. Each storyline featured a major conflict between someone in power and a subordinate, in which the lesser person took control. The fights between Nick and Alejandro, Madison and Alicia, and Ofelia and the ghost of her mother signified that the next generation has to take over in order to survive.</p> <p>For Nick that means taking the best interests of the colony into his own hands, even if that isn\u2019t what Alejandro, the founder and leader, wants. When one family goes missing and the colony doesn\u2019t exchange Oxycontin for water with Marco and his gang at the supermarket, Nick knows the warlord will come looking for them. It takes a junkie to know a junkie. Alejandro doesn\u2019t let anyone leave and ends up in a quarrel with Nick, telling him he never asked to be put in a position of power and doesn\u2019t want it. He\u2019s also just waiting for some sort of spiritual awakening that he\u2019s convinced is on the horizon. </p> <p>Nick says: \u201cYou\u2019re waiting for faith to work, for the dead to wash the world clean. The danger is now. It\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Nick eventually goes behind Alejandro\u2019s back to attempt to make the meeting with Marco happen. His new lover Luci doesn\u2019t want him disobeying either her or Alejandro, so when Nick ventures out of the colony and Marco spots him on the rooftop, marking it as their home, he\u2019s going to be in very big trouble. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018I understand grief, but this is a bit extreme\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Eileen, the mother of zombie bride Jessica who Strand offed at the end of last episode, is so upset she knocks on his hotel door and stabs him right in the gut. And just when everything was going so well! They had planted crops, they got the generator working, there was even a clean bar, surfing lessons, and all the ice they could eat. It was like a regular Peroni commercial. </p> <p>In order to get medical supplies to save Strand, Elena takes Madison to Marco\u2019s Gang Supermarket and Looting Spoils Emporium. Elena\u2019s nephew Antonio is a member of the gang and she wants to trade with them, and maybe convince him to join his brother Hector back at the hotel. It would seem like the big event of this episode is the trip to the supermarket and the intel that Madison gets about Nick, but I think that isn\u2019t looking far enough into the future. The real big incident is when Madison locks up Eileen \u201cindefinitely\u201d for stabbing Strand and says that if anyone raises a hand to someone else, they get thrown out of the hotel. I have a feeling that pronouncement is going to come back to haunt her.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I would have done anything for you. That is love\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Well, we finally figured out what happened to Ofelia \u2013 she took off in a pickup truck. Yup, that\u2019s it. Now she\u2019s off on her own, remembering the time that guy proposed to her and then moved to New Mexico and she decided to stay with her parents. But we already know how it ends because Ofelia told this story to Nick in a previous episode. Where was our spoiler alert? </p> <p>But it\u2019s not the fianc\u00e9 that\u2019s important, it\u2019s her mother. She recalls the conversation they had when her mother told her that her father had seen so many awful things he still had nightmares. She wanted to spare Ofelia from a life where she was a part of all that evil. Too bad she failed, because now everyone is living that life. But Ofelia\u2019s mom tells her that the way they managed was to stick together, and as Ofelia remembers this she says that she finally understands and drives her truck toward the US. Wait, does that mean she\u2019s going back to the hotel to be with her new \u201cfamily\u201d, or does that mean she\u2019s abandoning them? Is she going to look for her father who might still be alive? What is her decision?</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Turn it off. The whole world can see it\u2019 </strong></h2> <p>The biggest conflict of the episode, and the season really, is the one that has been slowly building between Alicia and Madison. Alicia feels like her mother has always neglected her to take care of her father and Nick. Madison returns from the supermarket frantic to find Nick. (Seriously, did she think that rushing a bunch of Mexican gang members for information about her \u201cratty-haired gringo\u201d son was a good idea?) She powers up the generator to turn on the sign at the top of the hotel, trying to signal to Nick but also signaling their presence to anyone who can see it. </p> <p>Alicia has to take control the situation and talk some sense into her mother. Earlier, in the van on the way to the supermarket, Madison told Elena not to give up on her nephew, who joined the gang and wouldn\u2019t come live at the hotel. She\u2019s speaking like the mother of a junkie who never gave up on her son. But Alicia lets her know that is time to give up. Nick chose to go live out in the chaos of the apocalypse and she can\u2019t sacrifice their safety in order to woo him back. Alicia has chosen to stay with her and make things work, and it\u2019s time that Madison make a home for her.</p> <p>She relents and shuts the sign off, but not before Travis, seemingly having left his own son behind, sees it and starts to make his way toward the hotel. Even the cliffhanger at the end was subtle but good. </p>",
  "<p>Last week, after 78 years of life in Australia \u2013 most of them happy and productive, the final few marred by dementia \u2013 Kurt Kuhn passed away. He was our grandfather. He was our father. He was loved deeply by his family. But years before we came into the picture he was, in the vernacular of the times, a \u201crefo\u201d.<br></p> <p>At the age of nine he came to Australia from Vienna with his little sister and their parents. They were Jews fleeing the Nazis, and they arrived here by boat. In the years and months leading up to their escape, their home had turned against them. After the Nazi annexation of Austria, Kurt\u2019s father Otto, a pastry cook and baker, had been humiliated on the streets of Vienna. He was thrown into a concentration camp for weeks in order to intimidate him and his family into leaving. It worked. </p> <p>To many Australians during the 1930s and 1940s, central European Jews were foreign and strange. At least, in the days of the White Australia policy, they were pale. But they ate peculiar food, and they had weird beliefs about their weird food, and God, and how to dress. According to some Christians they were even responsible for killing Christ. They were supposed to be miserly, clannish and alien.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/19/newly-leaked-nauru-reports-detail-harrowing-accounts-of-sexual-abuse-and-self-harm\">Newly leaked Nauru reports detail harrowing accounts of sexual abuse and self-harm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such prejudices were common, especially in elite circles. Then, as now, wealth and power were often associated with self-satisfaction. Unless association with them brought personal advantages, people who were different were regarded as inferior or dangerous. After all, racism against Jews and especially against southern Europeans after the second world war helped divide workers against each other and undermine union organisation and solidarity.</p> <p>Although matzah balls and gefilte fish were regarded with the same suspicious attitude that some Australians now have for halal snack packs, there was food from the old world Australians ate with gusto \u2013 cakes and biscuits. Otto was a highly skilled pastry cook and baker and eventually set up a cake shop in Bondi. During school Kurt also worked in the shop. Unlike most members of his generation, he went to university. While studying chemical engineering, he still had to get up at 2am on Saturdays to help with baking.</p> <p>Kurt was thorough and precise. After university, he began a 40 year-long career at the Gas Company, eventually heading its laboratory as a senior technical manager.</p> <p>His family came to Australia to survive, make a life, get work and in doing so made significant contributions to Australian society.</p> <p>The refugees on Manus and Nauru want to do the same. So do others who are keen to come to Australia.</p> <p>Capitalism will always generate economic crises. Despite them, it is workers who generate social wealth. Working people \u2013 regardless of skin colour \u2013 do not \u201ctake\u201d jobs, they create them. More workers mean more potential wealth. </p> <p>\u201cRefo\u201d was a straightforwardly racist, pejorative term. Now Australian governments use more sophisticated language like \u201cunlawful boat arrivals\u201d and \u201casylum seekers\u201d to denigrate refugees. The rightwing mass media and populist politicians both in and outside mainstream political parties, and the fascist fringe are cruder with their mendacious ravings about \u201cqueue jumpers\u201d, \u201cdeliberate self-harm\u201d and \u201cthreats to the Australian way of life\u201d. Regardless of the terminology, the underlying racist logic is the same.</p> <p>That logic led to the deaths of Omid Masoumali, Reza Barati, Fazel Chegeni, Hamid Kehazaei, Ali Ahmad Jafari, Reza Alizadeh and Mohammad Nasim Najafi. All died as a result of murder, medical neglect or suicide during detention or its aftermath. They were imprisoned in off and onshore concentration camps set up, run and paid for by Australia. </p> <p>Justified by hypocritical appeals to humanitarian motives, like the desire to prevent drownings at sea, our governments have used many of same repressive, violent and inhuman techniques as the regimes that refugees escaped from in the 1930s, and are still fleeing today.</p> <p>The self-serving economic and political logic of Australia\u2019s treatment of the children, men and women, who are hanging on interminably in camps has led to rape, other physically abuse, denial of healthy living conditions, the mental torture of being denied a future, and callous treatment by bureaucracies and individuals with authority.</p> <p>The Coalition and Labor are both committed to sustaining and intensifying racist attitudes to those currently imprisoned. Now \u201cboat people\u201d largely means Muslims and Arabs. Portraying refugees as threatening bogiemen distracts attention from attacks on our living standards and civil rights. As in the post-war years, it divides workers and creates a false sense of unity with employers, in the face of contrived \u201csecurity threats\u201d at home and abroad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kurt, his parents and sisters only spoke German when they arrived here in 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the war. Their presence did not endanger anyone in Australia. </p> <p>As a Jew, Otto\u2019s previous nationality had been revoked. He was not Austrian or German. Like so many fleeing today, he and his family were outcasts. In Australia, as an \u201cenemy alien\u201d Otto had to report to the police weekly. Compared with today\u2019s security paranoia about refugees, and their persecution by Australian governments, that wartime foolishness looks trivial.</p> <p>Neither European Jews on the run from Hitler nor refugees seeking haven in Australia today are threats. In 78 years, when the lives of the children we\u2019re currently detaining have blossomed and faded, do we want to look back, as our family has this past week, in awe at their contributions?</p> <p>The alternative is to reflect aghast at our wastefulness, at the way our fear and ignorance so many years ago caused us to destroy such wonderful, human potential.</p>",

  "<p>The Somali American community in St Cloud, Minnesota, condemned on Sunday the mass stabbing attack at a mall the night before, as the immigrant population confronted longstanding tensions and unconfirmed reports emerged of the suspect\u2019s identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">FBI investigates Minnesota mass stabbing as 'potential act of terrorism'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Police have not yet named the suspect, who wounded nine people on Saturday night at the Crossroads Center mall, and whose attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/18/minnesota-mass-stabbing-mall-fbi-terrorism-investigation\">is being investigated as \u201cpotential act of terrorism\u201d</a>. But Ahhmed Adan, a Somali immigrant, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Sunday that police had told him the night before that his son, Dahir Adan, had died the night before. </p> <p>None of the nine injured people suffered life-threatening injuries, and the only fatality of the attack was the suspect, who was shot dead by an off-duty police officer.</p> <p>Police did not mention the attack on the mall, Adan said, but they seized photos and other materials from the family\u2019s apartment. Adan said his son came to the US 15 years ago and was a student at St Cloud Technical and Community College. He added that he had \u201cno suspicion\u201d that his son might have considered such an attack.<br></p> <p>Within hours of the attack, in which the suspect reportedly spoke of Allah, members of the Somali American community began to see anti-immigrant and Islamophobic messages directed toward them online. The virulence increased when an Islamic State-run news agency claimed credit for the attack; the terror group has previously claimed credit for attackers with whom it had no contact.</p> <p>A leader of the community, Abdul Kalane, said he fears how those online messages will translate into the real world, especially since Dahir Adan was his neighbor. Kalane said he had moved to a new building at the beginning of the month, and met Adan in the parking lot. Though he didn\u2019t know Adan well, he said he believed he was in his 20s and had moved to the United States at a young age.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I heard that the guy who did this was a member of the Somali community, I was so devastated, because I know what\u2019s going to happen. The repercussions, the retaliation,\u201d Kalane told the Guardian. \u201cI was shocked, because the guy lives in the same building I live in. And even though we don\u2019t know the full picture, we are actually devastated by this. It\u2019s really tragic.\u201d</p> <p>St Cloud is home to a growing Somali Muslim community, largely made up of refugees feeling the country\u2019s civil war. In January, the local paper <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/immigration/2016/01/24/fact-check-somali-student-numbers/79062702/\">reported</a> that about 20% of St Cloud\u2019s students came from homes where the primary language spoken at home was Somali.</p> <p>Not everyone has been accepting of the new arrivals. Last year, Somali students at one local high school staged a walkout to protest discrimination after a Somali student was labeled as \u201cIsis\u201d on snapchat. A nonprofit called <a href=\"http://www.unitecloud.org\">#UniteCloud</a> later formed to help bridge the gap between the Somali community and the more established, mostly white St Cloud residents.</p> <p>Natalie Ringsmuth, a white Minnesotan who co-founded the group with Haji Yusuf, said they had long feared something like this could happen.</p> <p>\u201cA some point in our community, we knew that the tensions were so high that somebody from either side of the equation was going to commit an act of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re here, but we\u2019ve mentally prepared for this.\u201d</p> <p>Somali community leaders held a press conference Sunday afternoon to plead to plead for unity. Activist Lul Hersi said she had feared for her one of her sons when she heard about the attack, and was relieved when he arrived home that night. She called it a \u201cdark day\u201d that the community would never forget.</p> <p>\u201cWe condemn the acts of yesterday. It was an individual and we don\u2019t know what motivated that individual,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s unite as one Minnesota. Let\u2019s take love instead of hate.\u201d</p> <p>Community leader Hassan Yussuf said he hoped the city\u2019s recent progress wouldn\u2019t be derailed. \u201cSt Cloud has done a lot of hard work to come together, all of the leaders, and that should not be broken by this incident,\u201d he said. \u201cThis incident should not be used to spread hate. It should be used to bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the absence of confirmed facts, at least one anti-immigrant group, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/act-america\">Act! For America</a>, seized on the attack for political purposes. The group posted a link about the stabbings with a question: \u201cMore refugees, anyone?\u201d</p> <p>Jaylani Hussein, the executive director for the Minnesota chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, said central Minnesota has a history of anti-Muslim organizing. He pointed to a string of incidents dating back years, including visits by <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/anti-muslim-speaking-circuit-runs-through-rural-minnesota/375924701/\">well-known anti-Muslim speakers</a> and a<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/anti-muslim-billboard-posted-near-st-cloud-taken-down/369177621/\"> recent billboard</a>, eventually removed, that read \u201cCatholic Charities Resettles Islamists, Evil or Insanity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just random people being upset and acting randomly.

  "<p>Denise Ho\u2019s struggle against the Communist party of China began at 5.58pm on a Sunday afternoon.<br></p> <p>It was as the Hong Kong Cantopop queen watched aghast as live television images showed police fire the first of 87 canisters of teargas into a sea of pro-democracy demonstrators, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/28/kong-kong-police-teargas-pepper-spray-pro-democracy-protesters\">a botched bid to quell their protest</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand by and just watch everyone fight,\u201d the 39-year-old pop star recalls of the clashes in September 2014 that sparked the former colony\u2019s umbrella movement street occupation, two years ago next week. \u201cI just had to stand up and to say something.\u201d</p> <p>Stand up she did.</p> <p>Over the coming 79-days, Ho made daily excursions to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/world/asia/hong-kong-occupy-protests.html?_r=0\">the main protest camp in Admiralty</a> and became one of the uprising\u2019s most influential and glamorous backers: a celebrity cheerleader who threw her stardom behind the historic bid to wrestle democratic concessions from authoritarian Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cThese students are not fighting for lollipops for themselves... they are fighting for Hong Kong people,\u201d she told <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1634254/canto-pop-star-denise-ho-vows-fight-democracy-despite-mainland\">one interviewer</a>. \u201cAs adults ... we must fight for them.\u201d</p> <p>Fast-forward two years and Ho \u2013 a petite pop icon famed for her theatrical stage shows and tear-jerking hit such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSOJJEtxNPw\">Angel Blues</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dECcBXBphBE\">We Stand as One</a> \u2013 has transformed herself into a respected pro-democracy campaigner whose outspokenness has earned her the adoration of fans and the wrath of China\u2019s communist rulers.</p> <p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t planned at all for me,\u201d the singer said during an interview with the Guardian at a recording studio on the south-side of Hong Kong island, reflecting on her switch from artist to activist.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f8a7fac81631102b9966abc289b6b418ad9218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f8a7fac81631102b9966abc289b6b418ad9218/0_102_3807_2285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Ho is arrested and escorted by police officers during the clearance of Occupy Central Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Ho is arrested and escorted by police officers during the clearance of Occupy Central Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Schifres/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denise Ho Wan-sze was born in Hong Kong in 1977 but grew up in Quebec, after her family emigrated when she was 11.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was the fear of the return to China,\u201d she says of her parents\u2019 decision to abandon the British colony in the lead-up to the 1997 handover. \u201cA lot of people were leaving at that time.\u201d</p> <p>Months before Hong Kong\u2019s return to China, the dream of pop stardom lured the budding singer back to the city of her birth. She appeared on a television talent contest and caught the eye of one of the judges, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/12/27/hong-kong-remembers-anita-mui/\">Anita Mui</a>, a Cantopop diva some called Asia\u2019s Madonna.</p> <p>\u201cShe took me in as one of her disciples,\u201d Ho recalls of how Mui, an outspoken artist who backed the 1989 Tiananmen protesters and died prematurely of cancer in 2003, helped kickstart her career.</p> <p>Nearly two decades later Ho has built a loyal following in her native Hong Kong, recording more than two dozen albums while simultaneously carving out a career as a television and film actress. In 2007 she provided the Cantonese voice-over for Bart Simpson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/24/animation.family\">The Simpsons Movie</a>. <br></p> <p>Until relatively recently, Ho had also been building a following over the border in mainland China, releasing her first Mandarin-language record, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzeCS9CJ-BQ\">Nameless Poem</a>, in 2010. By 2014, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/asia/hong-kong-stars-face-mainland-backlash-over-support-for-protests.html?_r=0\">the singer said</a> her mainland audience accounted for about 80% of her income. <br></p> <p>The outbreak of the umbrella movement \u2013 and Ho\u2019s decision to join its ranks \u2013 threatened to thwart the singer\u2019s attempts to break the lucrative mainland Chinese market.</p> <p>Incensed at the police\u2019s attempts to crush those demonstrations, Ho became a regular face at the protest camp. Along with fellow Cantopop star Anthony Wong she recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na2mR9mvDoU\">Raise your Umbrellas</a>, a song that would become one of the movement\u2019s anthems.</p> <p>\u201cStanding on the frontlines, we are filled with courage even though the future is grim,\u201d they sing in one verse. \u201cWho would have guessed that to see through the lies we must open our eyes in the smoke of teargas?\u201d</p> <p>Most local pop stars declined to join the protests for fear of angering Beijing and losing their access to the mainland, Jason Ng recalls in his book about the demonstrations, Umbrellas in Bloom.</p> <p>\u201c[But Wong and Ho] demonstrated their steely backbones by risking their careers for social justice, and at the same time amplified the deafening silence of all the other Cantopop stars who had gone missing in action,\u201d Ng writes.</p> <p>Challenging the Communist party so publicly was always likely to have a price. The South China Morning Post warned Ho was committing <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1634254/canto-pop-star-denise-ho-vows-fight-democracy-despite-mainland\"> \u201ccareer suicide\u201d</a> by standing up to Beijing. <br></p> <p>And sure enough the counter-attack came. <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2014-10/22/c_1112936392.htm\">One hostile editorial</a>, published by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, backed calls for a boycott of artists such as Ho who had defied Beijing by taking to the streets. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can eat our food and smash our pots at the same time,\u201d it sniped. </p> <p>Earlier this year the attacks escalated after she <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1944688/canto-pop-star-denise-ho-meets-dalai-lama\">met Beijing\u2019s nemesis, the Dalai Lama</a>, and posted a photograph on social media.

In this sense Hong Kong is becoming just like mainland China \u2013 because that is how it works in mainland China. They do not need to give you any reason for whatever decisions they make.\u201d <br> </p> <p>Ho voices such fears in <a href=\"http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/author/index/16633897\">regular columns</a> for outlets such as the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, urging fans and readers to stand up for their political rights.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe all have a responsibility to defend this city\u2019s core values,\u201d she wrote in one recent article. \u201cDo not say you have no choice. Everyone has a choice.\u201d</p> <p>As the second birthday of the umbrella movement nears, Ho says she feels frustrated at how many continue to call it a failure. She blames that on an obsession she believes Hong Kong\u2019s education system has with quantifiable results.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are trained to think this way, that if we do something that doesn\u2019t give us an immediate result then that means we have failed ... [But] that\u2019s not how it happens anywhere in the world, especially when you are facing such a big machine that is the Chinese Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Ho describes the three-month-long protests as a historic awakening for the semi-autonomous city\u2019s youth, the first step on an uncertain but essential quest for democracy. </p> <p>\u201cThis generation has changed because of the umbrella movement, and I think that is something that nobody dreamed of ... for the past 30 or 40 years in Hong Kong,\u201d she says. <br></p> <p>For a while after the protests, Ho says she pondered running for a seat in LegCo, Hong Kong\u2019s 70-member legislature, to which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout\">a number of umbrella movement veterans</a>, including the <a href=\"http://time.com/4479970/hong-kong-nathan-law-legislature-demosisto-democracy/\">student leader Nathan Law</a>, were recently elected in what was seen as a stinging rebuke to Beijing.</p> <p>But the singer decided not to swap song-making for speech-writing, preferring to use her art to spread a message of hope and solidarity that might help heal the growing frustrations of Hong Kong\u2019s youth.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to think what comes after this rage,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, going back to doing my music and putting these thoughts into songs ... that is my role, I think.\u201d<br></p>"
