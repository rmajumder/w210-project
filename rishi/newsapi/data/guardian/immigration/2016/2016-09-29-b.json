  "<p>After months of bashing the German chancellor on the campaign trail, Donald Trump declared that Angela Merkel was his favorite world leader.</p> <p>In an interview with a local reporter in New Hampshire, the Republican presidential nominee proclaimed: \u201cI think Merkel is a really great world leader.\u201d Though, he added, \u201cI was very disappointed that, when she, this move with the whole thing on immigration, I think it\u2019s a big problem and really, you know, to look at what she\u2019s done in the last year and a half. I was always a Merkel person. I thought really fantastic. But I think she made a very tragic mistake a year and a half ago.\u201d </p> <p>Trump was criticizing the German chancellor\u2019s openness to taking refugees from Syria. Despite the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in that country, Trump has long warned of the danger of taking in refugees, whom he has compared to the Trojan Horse.</p> <p>The statement marks a change in tone from Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Merkel on the campaign trail. </p> <p>In December, after Merkel bested him to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/angela-merkel-time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2015\">Time\u2019s Person of the Year</a>, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/674587800835092480\">tweeted</a> she was \u201cruining Germany\u201d.

In August, he said, \u201cHillary Clinton is running to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and we\u2019ve seen how much crime and how many problems that\u2019s caused the German people.\u201d </p> <p>He has also seen parallels in nativist opposition to Merkel in Germany in local elections and his own cause, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">telling a crowd in North Carolina</a> in September, \u201cSee what happened to Angela Merkel? They had a massive defeat recently in the elections.\u201d</p> <p>However, Trump has praised Merkel in the past.

There\u2019s a universal sense of satisfaction that the Dogs enter the game as <em>underdogs</em>. After three consecutive finals wins against significant odds, the Dogs fans much prefer it this way. Stuff the bookmakers. After what this team has endured this year, we know they can do anything. The Bulldog Tragician summed up the mood perfectly; <a href=\"http://www.bulldogtragician.com/the-tragician-blog/why-not-us\">Why not us</a>?</p> <p>The consensus is that Luke Beveridge\u2019s boys aren\u2019t just writing their own history, they are writing their own fairytales.

  "<p>Vulnerable asylum seekers are at risk of being \u201cfunnelled\u201d out of Scotland and away from family, friends and legal representation under detention plans that are being challenged by politicians and campaigners. </p> <p>The Scottish government and local Scottish National party MPs have called for \u201curgent clarity\u201d about Home Office proposals to build a short-term holding facility near Glasgow airport to replace the controversial Dungavel immigration removal centre.</p> <p>Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, said at the beginning of September that the centre in Lanarkshire, which has been condemned as \u201cbarbaric and inhumane\u201d and has been the focus of numerous protests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/08/dungavel-immigration-detention-centre-will-close-says-minister\" draggable=\"true\">will shut towards the end of 2017</a>. The announcement is believed to have taken the Scottish government and the asylum sector by surprise. </p> <p>Groups including the Scottish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Detention Action said they were worried that the short-term airport facility, where individuals can only be held for a limited period, will result in asylum detainees being taken away from their support networks.</p> <p>There is no long-term centre north of Lincolnshire, so those removed from Scotland will be many hours\u2019 drive away from friends and family. They will also face jurisdictional difficulties as they find themselves under a different legal system. This means they may need to abandon any pending legal challenges in the Scottish courts and find new representation in England.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, Renfrewshire Council will discuss a series of motions noting the lack of consultation over the proposals \u2013 which still require planning permission \u2013 and expressing similar concerns. </p> <p>Kenny MacLaren, the deputy leader of the council\u2019s SNP group and one of the local councillors for the proposed area of the new centre, said: \u201cSimply moving the centre doesn\u2019t address the concerns of many campaigners about the inhumane treatment that detainees have received at Dungavel.\u201d</p> <p>He said a number of constituents had already approached him with their concerns. \u201cThere is a danger that a new centre so close to the airport will result in rapid transfer of detainees, moving them further away from their families, friends and communities and making it harder for them to challenge their deportation.\u201d</p> <p>Naomi McAuliffe, Amnesty\u2019s Scotland programme director, told the Guardian: \u201cThe context is the Brexit momentum behind restricting freedom of movement and the implementation of the Immigration Act 2016, which is about finding, reporting and deporting \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019. I\u2019m increasingly pessimistic that this new facility is about funnelling people down to England away from their friends, networks and importantly, legal representation in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>The UK government has argued that the closure of Dungavel would mean \u201ca significant saving for the public purse\u201d because the new facility would provide easy access to London airports, from where most removals occur.</p> <p>Kate Alexander, the director of Scottish Detainee Visitors, said there was little evidence to show that short-term facilities led to people being removed more quickly. The most recent figures for Larne House, Northern Ireland\u2019s short-term holding facility, showed 44% of inmates were moved to another detention centre.</p> <p>She said that, in contrast with longer-term facilities, short-term units operated with no equivalent rules regarding the protection of inmates, resulting in concerns about conditions and, in particular, the treatment of women.</p> <p>The Scottish Refugee Council said a previous guarantee that Dungavel would no longer detain children resulted in families being moved to England.</p> <p>The SNP MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, Gavin Newlands, said he was waiting for a meeting with Goodwill to discuss the proposed move to his constituency, which he has noted \u201craises issues locally as well as on the UK government\u2019s immigration policy\u201d.</p> <p>The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has told the Scottish parliament: \u201cI think what all of us would want to see is a system that replaces Dungavel that is more humane than it, not less humane.\u201d</p>",

Numbers have risen steadily every year since 2008, in the wake of the Baby P child protection scandal.

  "<p>My aunt Mercy Heatley, who has died aged 94, was an innovative child psychiatrist in the Oxfordshire family and child guidance service and an indefatigable campaigner for peace, disarmament and the NHS.</p> <p>Mercy was born in Craigavad, Northern Ireland, daughter of Geoffrey Bing, a teacher, and his wife, Irene, who founded Rockport prep school in the town. After attending this school as one of only four girls, she went on to Howell\u2019s school in Denbigh, north Wales. In 1939 she was admitted to Somerville College, Oxford, to study PPE. After interrupting her studies to drive lorries for the war effort, she switched to medicine with the support of a then junior don, the later Nobel prize winner <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1964/\">Dorothy Hodgkin</a>, who became a lifelong friend. While still an undergraduate, Mercy married <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/08/guardianobituaries.highereducation\">Norman Heatley</a>, a biochemist and member of the Oxford team whose work on penicillin helped to save countless lives in the second world war.</p> <p>From 1948 Mercy juggled parenting her five children with a career as a consultant psychiatrist, a rare combination in those days. She still found time for voluntary activities, which included an interest in teenage refugees, displaced by war in Europe and being helped by the <a href=\"https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/heritage-culture-and-recreation/archives-and-history/surrey-history-centre/surrey-history-centre-help-for-researchers/archives-and-history-research-guides/from-vision-to-venture-the-story-of-ockenden-international\">Ockenden Venture</a>. At her house in Old Marston, Oxford, one would meet refugees and former psychiatric patients. Mercy would break the ice by giving a 30-second biography of each guest to every other guest, after which conversation flowed.</p> <p>As her career developed she specialised in autism, and in the 1970s she pioneered, with the teacher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/21/sheila-coates-obituary\">Sheila Coates</a>, the idea of integrating children with autism into mainstream classrooms. This practice was a key recommendation of the Warnock report in 1978, and became a model for practice nationally.</p> <p>Mercy became more politically active during the Thatcher governments and was a staunch opponent of any privatisation in the NHS, a strong supporter of the Greenham Common women and of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.</p> <p>She achieved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/18/2\">national prominence</a> in 2002 when, as part of the Peace Tax movement, she withheld part of her income tax in protest at the prospect of bloodshed in Iraq. When proceedings were inevitably taken against her, Mercy calculated that a bench of magistrates would not wish to imprison an 80-year-old retired doctor who made her case with great politeness and sincerity. As a result, the proceedings were adjourned many times and Mercy received enormous publicity. Eventually a well-wisher paid what was owed and she was spared prison.</p> <p>Norman died in 2004. Mercy is survived by her four children, Rose, Christopher, Jonathan and Tamsin, and six grandchildren. A fifth child, Piers, predeceased her.</p>",
  "<p>The real financial winner in music this year may not be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen\">Bruce Springsteen</a>, or any of the artists who have been touring the stadiums and enormodomes of the world. It will probably be a group who have massively increased their worth without singing a note. Or their key member being alive. This year, Michael Jackson\u2019s estate looks set to make close to $1bn (\u00a3769m).</p> <p>The Jackson estate was already hugely lucrative \u2013 it generated $115m last year, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/dead-celebrities/#27838f416a51\">according to Forbes</a>. That made it far more profitable than the estates of other dead superstars with lasting musical legacies: the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/2-elvis-presley/#62d408744937\">Elvis Presley estate</a> made $55m in 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/4-bob-marley/#3a7457ad67b6\">Bob Marley estate</a> recorded revenues of $21m. The reason for the Jackson estate\u2019s spectacular success was one amazing deal: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sony-michael-jackson-atv-music-publishing-750m\">sale of its remaining 50% stake</a> in Sony/ATV music publishing to Sony Corporation for $750m \u2013 so expensive because ATV had been the publisher for the vast majority of the Beatles\u2019 catalogue. And the profit was enormous: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/14/topstories3.arts\">Jackson had paid $47.5m for ATV in 1984</a>.</p> <p>As the great superstars of rock and pop pass on, estate management has become a huge business. And the claimants to that business are manifold. David Bowie, a man ahead of the curve in looking after his financial interests, might well have prepared thoroughly, but you only need to look at the ongoing court battles over who should benefit from the estate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a> \u2013 exacerbated by the fact that he left no will and had no known children \u2013 to see how a badly managed estate can cause chaos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e/0_0_1752_2432/720.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jackson.\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Branca is, along with John McClain, co-executor of the Jackson estate. He was the singer\u2019s lawyer, on and off, for 26 years from 1980, during which time Jackson was the biggest pop star on the planet. Branca was reappointed eight days before Jackson died, having negotiated his return during rehearsals for what would have been Jackson\u2019s comeback shows. And Branca has steered the estate\u2019s business interests over the past seven years to make it the most commercially successful celebrity estate in the world. He and McClain, rather than Jackson\u2019s children, parents or siblings, make all the commercial decisions around the assets \u2013 which include Jackson\u2019s recordings, his songwriting, his share of Sony/ATV, his image rights and his name rights.</p> <p>Refusal is key. Immediately after Jackson\u2019s death, the estate had to address the debts he had run up in his lifetime, so there was a flurry of activity: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-jackson-s-this-is-it\">This Is It</a> documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/15/michael-jackson-the-immortal-world-tour-review\">Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Immortal tour</a> and two documentaries directed by Spike Lee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/bad-25-spike-lee-review\">Bad 25</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/michael-jackson-journey-from-motown-to-off-the-wall-review-sspike-lee-documentary\">Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey From Motown to Off the Wall</a> \u2013 all got the green light, and proved highly profitable. But, says Branca, \u201cWe say no to almost everything that is pitched to us. I just have a basic philosophy, as I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, where I only do things that I would want to watch or listen to. If we don\u2019t believe it is going to be of the highest artistic quality, we don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Here, the estate acts as if for an artist who was still alive, but they need to be realistic about their role. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 John [McClain] and I are not Michael Jackson,\u201d says Branca. \u201cThere is only one Michael Jackson, so we would never pretend that we could substitute our judgment for his.\u201d</p> <p>The key to making an artist posthumously successful lies in the preparations they made when they were alive. \u201cIt all starts with the will,\u201d says Gregor Pryor, a partner at legal firm <a href=\"https://www.reedsmith.com/\">Reed Smith</a>. \u201cSome artists make very good wills and do a really good job of planning for their death. And others don\u2019t.\u201d A music business insider, speaking anonymously, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/freddie-mercury\">Freddie Mercury</a>\u2019s will has become the standard by which other artist legacies are judged. Aware he was dying, Mercury appointed Queen\u2019s manager Jim Beach as executor of his will and his estate. \u201cOther estates, once they have got through the chaos, will want to work towards the steady state that Queen had from the day Freddie died,\u201d the insider says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30/0_0_3000_3258/921.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Estate management is not only an issue for rock stars \u2013 classical musicians, too, need special attention, because the fundamentals are the same. Jeff Liebenson, of the New York music law firm <a href=\"http://www.liebensonlaw.com/\">Liebenson Law</a>, represents the estate of the classical pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/31/vladimir-horowitz-original-jacket-collection\">Vladimir Horowitz</a> and explains what happened when his widow, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, also passed away. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that when the estate goes to family members, these are often people who are not that familiar with the music business,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are understandably very emotional and have various issues among and between each other. That can make it very difficult for them to move forward together. In the Horowitz situation, there was no family to inherit it. There were designated beneficiaries, charities and academic institutes in the will.\u201d</p> <p>Allan Steckler has worked on the Horowitz estate for 12 years, as well as the Arturo Toscanini estate for 25 years, and previously worked in classical labels and Apple Records in the US. He has overseen the Horowitz estate in a way that would be familiar to those running the Johnny Cash estate, for example: finding previously unreleased recordings of artistic worth, and overseeing their release into a hungry market, the biggest project being the 42-disc collection of Horowitz\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall between 1951 and 1978. \u201cThe challenge with dealing with a deceased artist is keeping them in the public view,\u201d says Steckler. \u201cOnce an artist passes, unless somebody does something to keep the name in front of the public, they will totally fade away.\u201d</p> <p>It is common to view record companies as ghoulishly exploiting the deaths of stars, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOkb58YbtQo\">as depicted in the Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture</a>, where Morrissey castigates greedy labels: \u201cReissue! Repackage! Repackage! Re-evaluate the need.\u201d And it is true that sometimes, with artists who have not left behind a wealth of high-quality unreleased material, but scraps and odds and ends \u2013 and whose estate is bequeathed to people in need of money \u2013 the material that emerges sullies their legacy. But it rarely plays out the way Morrissey suggests, and sometimes the labels can even be helpful.</p> <p>Steve Davis, who was director of catalogue at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/emi\">EMI</a> from 2000 to 2009, gives the example of what they did for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/30/kirsty-maccoll-birthday-album-reissue\">Kirsty MacColl</a>\u2019s family.

Cally Callomon is a former creative director at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/mar/23/island-records-fifty-simon-reynolds\">Island Records</a> who has been running the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/05/nick-drake-requiem-for-a-solitary-man\">Nick Drake</a> estate since the late 1990s. Both Drake\u2019s parents are dead, leaving only his sister, Gabrielle, involved. She approached Callomon to manage the estate because she was unable to dedicate the time that it needed.</p> <p>Callomon\u2019s approach was to manage the Drake estate as if he were a living artist. The licensing of Drake\u2019s song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/25/popandrock4\">Pink Moon</a> for a Volkswagen ad in 1999, and a Radio 2 documentary narrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a> in 2004, helped to make the singer considerably more successful posthumously than in his lifetime. \u201cGabrielle got it immediately. This idea of not celebrating or commemorating the death of an artist, but really starting from a complete rebirth of an artist.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Jackson estate, they understand that saying no is more important than saying yes. \u201cGabrielle is a very rare creature and she understands the power of saying no,\u201d Callomon says. \u201cIt\u2019s about waiting for that thing that, when you say yes to it, it makes sense.\u201d They regularly turn down biopic ideas. \u201cTo make a film, however lucrative that would be, I think it would kill something and that would be unforgivable in my book.\u201d Instead, Gabrielle will occasionally approve use of her brother\u2019s music in films or the theatre for free if she likes the script or director, as she is keen to encourage new talent.</p> <p>They have also restricted how much unreleased material has been put out beyond Drake\u2019s original three studio albums \u2013 limiting them to one compilation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/22/way-to-blue-review\">Way to Blue</a>), two compilations with unreleased tracks (Made to Love Magic and A Treasury) and his pre-Island home recordings (Family Tree).

I think Jeff Buckley\u2019s music deserves better than that.\u201d</p> <p>Music fans will now be waiting to see what happens with the cases of Bowie and Prince. Bowie\u2019s back catalogue was already subject to a carefully planned reissue programme before his death, beginning with the Five Years box last September, and followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/david-bowie-who-can-i-be-now-1974-1976-album-box-set-review\">the Who Can I Be Now? set last week</a>.

  "<p>The head of Germany\u2019s largest business group has said German firms will not push for a free trade deal between the EU and Britain after Brexit, despite the number of cars and quantities of other goods they sell in the UK.</p> <p>In remarks likely to be seen as increasing the chance of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d excluding Britain from the EU single market, Markus Kerber, head of the BDI, dismissed claims that German companies would not tolerate trade tariffs after Britain leaves, and said Germany\u2019s relations with the rest of the bloc were more important.</p> <p>\u201cI have read a lot of articles in the British press saying Germany would be a relatively soft negotiator because 7.5% of German exports go to Britain,\u201d Kerber <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgkz2\">told BBC Radio 4\u2019s today programme</a>. \u201cWell, 7.5% is a big number \u2013 but 92.5% goes somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>Leading pro-Brexit politicians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/boris-johnson-uk-aiming-start-eu-brexit-talks-early-2017\">including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson</a>, have argued that economic imperatives \u2013 the German cars, French cheese and Italian wine sold in the UK \u2013 would oblige the EU to offer Britain a favourable trade deal, including some compromise on control over free movement which Theresa May has said is Britain\u2019s first priority.</p> <p>But, much as German manufacturers valued good relations with UK customers, Kerber said, it was \u201cextremely important to us not to lose or alienate other European markets\u201d.</p> <p>He said the level of \u201cpolitical ill-will\u201d against Britain on the continent was \u201cmuch, much bigger than economic rationality\u201d \u2013 in part because the bloc\u2019s single market and eastward expansion had been \u201ccore UK strategies\u201d and it was now \u201cexactly those countries whose migrants are causing headaches in Great Britain\u201d.<br></p> <p>Ultimately, Kerber said, there was \u201cno difference, for the BDI, between the political view and the economic view\u201d. Pointing to huge investments made by German carmakers in central Europe, he said: \u201cFor us, the single market, eastern Europe and freedom of movement \u2013 they are all one deal, that is inseparable.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Japanese carmaker Nissan, said on Thursday that his company would demand a UK deal offering compensation for any eventual trade costs resulting from Brexit before it committed to more investment in its Sunderland plant. </p> <p>\u201cIf I need to make an investment in the next few months and I can\u2019t wait until the end of Brexit, then I have to make a deal with the UK government,\u201d Ghosn said at the Paris car show. \u201cIf there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for carmakers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation.\u201d </p> <p>In a speech seen as confirming his preference for a hard Brexit, Britain\u2019s trade secretary, Liam Fox, on Thursday hailed Britain\u2019s chance to become a full independent member of the World Trade Organisation after Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\">and said</a> leaving the EU was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the UK to trade with the rest of the world, particularly developing markets.</p> <p>A survey of the EU-27 by the Bloomberg news agency also revealed unanimous opposition to the UK remaining a member of the single market if it refused to accept freedom of movement.</p> <p>Positions in Brussels and the other EU capitals were hardening, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/-hard-brexit-looms-as-28-red-lines-turn-deeper-shade-of-scarlet\">the survey found</a>, with even traditional allies such as Ireland now insisting Britain should not be allowed to \u201ccherry pick\u201d in upcoming exit negotiations.<br></p> <p>Several countries are demanding Britain end up with \u201cinferior\u201d terms to those it currently has, while others want it to keep paying into the EU budget in exchange for whatever benefits it does get. Some countries, particularly in central Europe, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/eastern-bloc-countries-will-uphold-citizens-rights-to-live-in-uk\">threatened to veto</a> any Brexit deal that does not guarantee the rights of their citizens to live and work in the UK.<br></p> <p>Kerber said an agreement curbing EU immigration while retaining privileged access to the single market was impossible, and the arrangement the British government appeared to be seeking was \u201cnot what the continental Europeans are willing\u201d or even able to give.</p> <p>\u201cIf British decision-makers look very hard at what it is and what it will be that they get, there is no other option than the hard exit,\u201d he said, adding that that might be better than \u201ca fudge in the middle that does not work politically and would leave uncertainty lingering on\u201d.</p> <p>Separately, the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said before a meeting with Johnson in London that the EU referendum had been won by demagoguery, lies, half-truths and exaggerations. He said he was sure Europe could survive, and could only hope for the same for Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThe United Kingdom and the European Union have just been victims, in June, of one of those fits of demagoguery,\u201d Ayrault said. \u201cBrexit will jeopardise neither the European Union, I am sure, nor the United Kingdom, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>He said Brexit was \u201crooted in lies, exaggerations and caricatures, we must remember. I say this with all the more tranquility because the promoters of Brexit after the referendum admitted, on leaving the ship, that their promises were not sustainable. The supreme irony is that they left the burden of the negotiation to a prime minister who campaigned to stay in the union.\u201d</p>",

But now writer-director Richard Tanne has addressed this with a gently likable, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater\">Linklaterish</a> movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRssm7V5-VE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eRssm7V5-VE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s all about Barack and Michelle\u2019s first date in the summer of 1989, when the future president met his (do I mean \u201cher\u201d?) future spouse in Chicago. This date took in an art gallery, sandwiches in the park, a political meeting and a trip to the movies \u2013 culminating in the legendary first kiss on a bench outside the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store, now commemorated by a plaque.</p> <p>Parker Sawyers is an eerily close likeness for the lanky, conceited, cigarette-smoking young Barack, a Harvard law student doing a summer associate programme at the prestigious a Chicago firm where he is mentored by beautiful, smart Michelle, played with charm and self-possession by Tika Sumpter.</p> <p>Tanne has taken the accepted version of events and imagined the dialogue, ingeniously crafting a traditional romance within a walking-pace, real-time narrative, complete with meet-cute, breakup and makeup. Michelle is unimpressed by Barack\u2019s swagger, disconcerted by the hole in the floor of his old car \u2013 and not exactly enamoured by the cigarettes he is smoking, though doesn\u2019t mention it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"827e6bd66b192dd5fedb5c9660da647afb8dfb64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827e6bd66b192dd5fedb5c9660da647afb8dfb64/350_0_426_533/400.jpg\" alt=\"The road to the White House starts here \u2026 Southside With You\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to the White House starts here \u2026 Southside With You</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They talk about Michelle\u2019s hard-working idealistic parents, about Barack\u2019s troubled background and his drunk dad. Tanne imagines a later scene in a bar where she challenges him directly on not facing up to his emotions. They talk about their ambitions and Barack irritates her with a misjudged, patronising homily about how she\u2019s obviously not fulfilled at work. One subject they do not discuss is whether a woman should give up her career to be a wife and mom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelle and Barack wouldn\u2019t be the first couple who revealed most about themselves on the first date</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If these people were fictional characters, they would almost certainly have an encounter with white racists, from which they would emerge shaken but determined, and brought closer together by the trauma. Not here. But on this point, Southside With You becomes interestingly, almost meta-textually sophisticated. Barack and Michelle do indeed encounter racism \u2013 on the movie screen. He takes her to see Spike Lee\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/do-the-right-thing\">Do the Right Thing</a> (again, this really happened, encouraged by a rave review from celebrated Chicago critic Roger Ebert), where they watch the brutality of bigoted cops. Then out in the lobby, while Barack is in the men\u2019s room, Michelle is quietly mortified to run into her (white) bosses, who she fears will think the less of her professional credentials, in apparently going on some simpering date with a co-worker.</p> <p>When Barack returns, a tense four-way conversation begins, and Barack smoothly finesses this boss\u2019s objection to the violence that concludes the film, suggesting that it was a safety valve and that the aggressor would have anticipated the existence of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d to minimise damage. That cleverly imagined scene puts on show Obama\u2019s political acumen, diplomacy and instinct for negotiating with the white world. And it demonstrates all the nuances of race, class, gender politics and professional prestige far more interestingly and effectively than the usual \u201cracism\u201d moment.</p> <p>Did it all happen just like that? Well, of course not. It is all a bit too good to be true and there are times when Southside With You has a TV movie feel. Tanne\u2019s dramatic licence means bringing in years of conversation and hindsight and compressing them into a few hours \u2013 but interestingly, perhaps it is closer to the truth than first appears. Michelle and Barack wouldn\u2019t be the first couple who revealed most about themselves on the first date, before coupledom and marriage made them invisible to each other.</p>",

Labour is in the midst of the same crisis as its sister social-democratic parties across Europe, with one twist: as evidenced by all those new members, it is also home to the kind of new, insurgent politics we\u2019ve seen with Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the Bernie Sanders campaign in the US etc. Time spent this week at Momentum\u2019s A World Transformed event in Liverpool reminded me that a great deal of Labour and the left\u2019s future lies with some of the people involved (I\u2019ve written a column about this, out later today), but a watershed moment is probably going to be a long time coming. </p> <p>As things stand, most of what we know takes the form of negatives: that the politics of New Labour are dead, that Labour is dangerously estranged from its old working class base, that the party is pretty much finished in Scotland. What happens next is unclear: my own belief is that it will have involve Labour embracing changing the voting system, creating a politics beyond work and the worker, and understanding that amassing a critical mass of support will involve other forces and parties. All this will take time.</p> <p>For now, maybe think about it like this. Jeremy Corbyn is not going to be the next prime minister.

Many politicians are also keen to explore similar themes, Jonathan Reynolds MP immediately springs to mind.</p> <p>The question is: how can this sort of radical thinking be combined with in-depth understanding of voter preferences and electoral strategy to come up with a plausible program for government?</p> <p>I think there is hope.

How many widespread MP rebellions have there been on policy issues? Have there been any? Instead the disquiet comes from Corbyn's perceived lack of leadership skills \u2013 that he has no coherent media policy, that shadow cabinet meetings are a shambles, that communication within the party is poor, that he lacks drive, that no one is really clear what they're supposed to be doing, and, worst of all, that there is a lack of solid, well-thought-through policy. </p> <p>Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but the converted aren't enough to win a general election.

But for all the talk of him being a 'man of the people', it's not clear that humility is one of his natural characteristics.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed0224e4b06a91384dbca4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/james-walsh\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T12:03:58.657Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Poll: Can Labour win under Corbyn?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019re trying out a new poll tool.

They deserve what so many of them demand: hope, but not zeal.</p> <p>Yet Corbynism makes too much of its principles, too little of the practical politics they so despised in Blair and Brown.

  "<p>Governments have launched a crackdown on the rampant billion-dollar trade in rosewood timber that is plundering forests across the planet to feed a booming luxury furniture market in China.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) summit on Thursday placed all 300 species of rosewood under trade restrictions, meaning criminals can no longer pass off illegally logged species as legitimate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2016/May/wildlife-crime-assessed-globally-for-the-first-time-in-new-unodc-report.html\">Rosewood is the world\u2019s most trafficked wild product</a>, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, accounting for a third of all seizures by value, more than elephant ivory, pangolins, rhino horn, lions and tigers put together.</p> <p>With a beautiful deep red glow, it is the traditional wood used for elite, classic-style \u201chongmu\u201d furniture in China: one huge carved bed was on sale recently for $1m. But due to explosive demand from China\u2019s fast-growing middle class, the rosewood trade has soared since 2005, multiplying 65 times in value and now worth $2.2bn a year. </p> <p>As a result, the forests of south-east Asia have been rapidly emptying, peaking in 2014. Traffickers are now targeting more than 80 other countries across the tropics where rosewoods grow, particularly in west Africa but also central America. China\u2019s rosewood imports from Africa soared sevenfold between 2010 and 2014, according to a <a href=\"http://forest-trends.org/releases/p/hongmu-consumption-boom\">report from Forest Trends</a>, with $216m of west African rosewood imported in the first half of 2016 alone. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5130c7586b9a81ae13cd886251ac1c3e0e79552e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5130c7586b9a81ae13cd886251ac1c3e0e79552e/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loading rosewood on to trucks at the port of Toamasina, Madagascar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loading rosewood on to trucks at the port of Toamasina, Madagascar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Illegal gangs move swiftly from country to country, felling all the trees they can find and creating devastating boom-and-bust cycles, said the report. \u201cWhen trees become scarce in one place, or authorities strengthen controls, the shady networks quickly move to another country and the deadly cycle of corruption, violence and forest destruction starts anew,\u201d said a <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/report/cycles-of-destruction\">statement from Environmental Investigation Agency</a> (EIA), a Cites participant. </p> <p>China imported 2m cubic metres of logs and wood in 2014, according to the EIA. This is equivalent to millions of rosewood trees as only the dark, dense heartwood is used: 70-80% of the tree is often wasted. </p> <p>The devastated forests left behind also no longer provide the charcoal and traditional medicines used by indigenous communities. \u201cIt is at the heart of our rural communities,\u201d said Niger\u2019s Cites delegate. \u201cThe demand from Asia threatens directly threatens their livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa Handy, at the EIA, said: \u201cWe are really thrilled [with the new Cites protection]. It\u2019s really in the nick of time to save them from extinction. The trade has exploded exponentially in the last decade. Now it really comes down to enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of protecting the entire Dalbergia genus of rosewood is that criminals can no longer pass off illegal rosewood as one of the previously unprotected species. \u201cOfficials have great difficulty in distinguishing between species,\u201d said Guatemala\u2019s delegate to Cites. \u201cIt is very difficult for people who are not experts, and even sometimes for the experts themselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis [summit] will be remembered for rosewood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">pangolin protection</a>,\u201d said Brazil\u2019s delegate, who said there would have been nothing left within three years without action.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d091a4e2faadc567ccd2f8b0e2d6ba2df33ae45c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d091a4e2faadc567ccd2f8b0e2d6ba2df33ae45c/0_323_5220_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong customs officials with confiscated Honduras rosewood log\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong customs officials with confiscated Honduras rosewood logs, part of a 92 tonne shipment found in four 40ft shipping containers originating in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Hofford/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Cites summit also applied new protection to an African rosewood from another genus, known as Kosso, which grows in the dry forests of west Africa. It was barely exported in 2009 but exploitation has since soared and it is now is now the main rosewood timber imported by China. \u201cThe forests have been emptied,\u201d said Benin\u2019s delegate to Cites.</p> <p>Some rosewood species can still be logged under the new rules, but will require permits that should only be granted if it is deemed sustainable. The rules could be revisited in the final Cites session next week, but this is unlikely. Rosewood is also used to make some musical instruments, such as guitars, but the new rules will not prevent musicians travelling with their instruments.</p> <p>The new protections enter into force in 90 days, but need action by individual nations to have an impact. In 2013, Cites gave similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/12/protection-madagascar-trees-logging-trade\">protection to every rosewood species in Madagascar</a>, where rampant logging was taking place.</p> <p>However, the EIA says the Madagascan government has failed to carry out its enforcement commitments and, in May 2016, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on Madagascar to end corruption and \u201cfight the illegal trafficking of natural treasures\u201d.</p>",

It also raises new questions about the deadliness of the virus. The man\u2019s 73-year-old father died of organ failure, even though he had been relatively fit and healthy.<br></p> <p>The deceased man was a US national who had emigrated from Mexico in 2003.

  "<p>When I got up this morning I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d go to bed with a vision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zach-galifianakis\">Zach Galifianakis</a> sharting in a swimming pool. There\u2019s nothing in my medicine cabinet or on my liquor shelf that can help me right now.<br></p> <p>In December 2015, I reviewed Jared Hess\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/don-verdean-review-bible-belt-satire-has-audience-begging-for-deliverance\">Don Verdean</a> and, after suffering through it and his previous catastrophe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/29/gentlemen-broncos-film-review\">Gentlemen Broncos</a>, I vowed I would never see one of Hess\u2019s movies again. Had I known Hess was the director of Masterminds when my editor gave me this assignment, I would have fibbed and said I had an evening dental appointment. Frankly, a tooth extraction without painkillers would have been far more enjoyable.</p> <p>Galifianakis, who is funny in other projects, is at his most broad and unbearable, stretching a yokel accent beyond all credibility as \u201cdumb guy\u201d David Ghantt. He works for an armoured car company and lives in a trailer with his nag of a fiancee Jandice (Kate McKinnon). He yearns for excitement, and when flirty Kelly (Kristen Wiig) joins the company, then flames out and is fired, he is smitten. Kelly\u2019s loser pal Steve (Owen Wilson) convinces Kelly that she can probably charm David into being the inside man for a vault heist. One marginally entertaining robbery sequence later and these dopes have somehow lifted over $17m in cash. David skips to Mexico to wait for the heat to die down, and that\u2019s when the infighting begins.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIkzuXDhCcQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zIkzuXDhCcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIkzuXDhCcQ\">Watch the trailer for Masterminds</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Masterminds is (very) loosely based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1997_Loomis_Fargo_robbery\">an actual criminal case</a>, but it soon becomes evident that the movie isn\u2019t too concerned with sticking to the facts. Though Jared Hess and his usual co-writer Jerusha Hess did not write the screenplay, each scene is, as usual, more concerned with wacky outfits, crazy hair and the performers all making weird faces. (Jason Sudeikis plays an idiotic hitman with a moustache \u2013 his character description is essentially, \u201che\u2019s got a moustache! Isn\u2019t that <em>nuts</em>?!\u201d)</p> <p>To give some credit, when you get performers like this together, an occasional joke emerges. Galifianakis does well with physical comedy, and there\u2019s a moment where he tries to break a door down and accidentally injures Wiig that is so chaotic it becomes high art. Kate McKinnon especially is hard to dislike, because she reads each of her lines as if she\u2019s being beamed in from outer space. There\u2019s no real <em>reason</em> for her to do this, but Lord knows there\u2019s nothing else for her to do with this asinine story, so why the heck not? She\u2019s fun to watch when she appears on screen, but this still didn\u2019t stop me from praying for a meteor to strike the screening room and put me out of my misery. The bad parts (eg most of the film) are really that bad.</p> <p>Masterminds is a bit of an interesting case study, as it is basically a Coen brothers film but put through a mechanism that removes all the wit, visual style or excitement. In its place are tortuously dull set-pieces, rambling dialogue and banal stagings. The movie ends with a clip of newsman Tom Brokaw reporting on the actual event from 1997. It\u2019s a Hail Mary hope that reminding audiences this is kinda-sorta based in truth will in some way stamp the film with importance. The whole effort is really just a theft of your time.</p> <p>\u2022 Masterminds is released in the US on 30 September</p>",

  "<p>Britain is one of the worst countries in Europe at integrating asylum seekers into the labour market, unnecessarily increasing their dependency on the welfare system, a report has found.</p> <p>Under British law, asylum seekers must wait for 12 months before applying for a work permit \u2013 the longest waiting time in Europe, according to <a href=\"http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/43505/Study_fromRefugeesToWorkers_2016_Vol_2.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">research from the Migration Policy Centre (MPC)</a> in Italy, and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German thinktank.</p> <p>Even after the 12-month threshold, they are often unable to access the labour market because they cannot be self-employed or set up a business. They can also only apply for jobs within a small band of professions for which many lack the qualifications to apply.</p> <p>Even when asylum seekers are granted refugee status, researchers found that they are effectively discouraged from seeking work. The limited 28-day window which they have to find private accommodation is too short for them to find work and then earn the wages they would need to pay for a deposit on a rental contract.<br></p> <p>\u201cDue to the brevity of this period, there is a strong incentive to secure housing and out-of-work benefits rather than employment,\u201d the report says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T09:59:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2016-09-29T09:59:19/embed.html\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>This dynamic means that they are less able to contribute to the British economy, Joscha Schwarzw\u00e4lder, one of the report\u2019s authors, said in an interview. \u201cOne reason for letting asylum seekers work is that they will not have to rely on social benefits and there will be less costs for the budget,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAnother argument is that early access to the labour market is key also for the longer-term labour market integration. In other words, if asylum seekers remain inactive for a prolonged period of time because they are prevented from accessing the jobs market, they will have more difficulties in finding employment once their asylum claim has been settled. Hence, a preventive approach might also create more costs in the longer term.\u201d</p> <p>Moe, a Syrian graduate currently seeking asylum in the UK, agreed that the restrictions made him less likely to be able to contribute to the British economy in the long term. \u201cI was told: \u2018Do not work. Do not even do voluntary work,\u2019\u201d he said. </p> <p>Moe, who asked for his surname not to be published, continued: \u201cThe problem for me is that I\u2019m a freelancer. If I continue to turn down client requests while I wait for my application, I won\u2019t have any clients by the time my application is processed. It\u2019s been almost six months since I applied, and I haven\u2019t even been assigned a case worker, which is the first step in the process after the initial screening.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Hale, the CEO of Refugee Action, a charity that helps to integrate refugees in Britain, said <a href=\"http://www.refugee-action.org.uk/assets/0001/3854/letrefugeeslearnfullreport.pdf\">a lack of English lessons was also hindering the process</a> (pdf). \u201cEnglish lessons are the first crucial step in enabling refugees to integrate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely frustrating for many refugees in Britain that there is a severe shortage of English classes. The annual cost of English classes is around \u00a31,600. This is repaid in just six months when refugees gain employment at the national average wage.\u201d</p> <p>The MPC report also suggested that the Swedish and German policy of allowing asylum seekers to work early on in their application process was key to easing them into the formal economy. It also encouraged more training schemes for refugees, which it said led to better employment rates, and found that places that offered more secure housing tended to see higher refugee employment. It also found merit in Scandinavian schemes that provide economic incentives to employers who give jobs to refugees.</p>",

  "<p>This week\u2019s biggest film release in the US is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/14/deepwater-horzion-review-mark-wahlberg-toronto-film-festival\">Deepwater Horizon</a> \u2013 a film that, despite its title, is neither an underwater sequel to Event Horizon nor a delicate coming-of-age story about waifish teens growing up in rural Sweden. It\u2019s the very real, very tragic tale of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/deepwater-horizon-film/2016/sep/21/deepwater-horizon-anatomy-of-a-disaster\">2010 oil rig explosion that killed 11 people</a> and caused an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">environmentally catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a>. Mark Wahlberg stars as Mike Williams, the chief electrician aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the man tasked with saving as many of its occupants as possible. The film is the latest in a parade of gritty, true stories hitting cinemas as we stumble into the fall awards season.</p> <p>It was only a few weeks ago that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/12/sully-clint-eastwood-hudson-river-plane-crash-ntsb\">audiences were exposed to Clint Eastwood\u2019s Sully</a>, another dramatization of a simple hero thrust unwillingly into a position to have to rescue dozens of people. That\u2019s how we like our real-life protagonists \u2013 stoic, grimly determined and covered in motor oil. We also like them to suffer for their good works. Poor Sully lands an airplane on the Hudson river, no one dies, and he still gets chastised by those damn bureaucrats (please read in gravelly Clint Eastwood voice) when he gets home. Brave Mike Williams survives the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but those dastardly oil barons at BP (please read in nasally Dave Schilling voice) don\u2019t go to jail.

I lobbied my editors for a page break, just in case, but I was denied.</p> <p>The Imitation Game is but the most recent addition to the grand tradition of the British based-on-a-true-story film. Imitation Game\u2019s hero, brilliant mathematician Alan Turing, is also a reluctant hero, as in the American tradition. He suffers the slings and arrows of a system that does not understand him nor is willing to recognize his contribution to the war effort. His cracking of the Enigma code is crucial to the Allied cause, but because he was gay, the military history books relegated him to footnote status <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/jun/19/theenigmaofalanturing\">until very recently</a>.</p> <p>So, what\u2019s different between Alan Turing and Sully Sullenberg besides differing tastes in facial hair? First of all, Alan Turing knows he\u2019s brilliant. What propels him to continue working on the machine that would help break the code and to defy superiors who doubted his efforts is self-belief. Turing\u2019s lack of social graces in the film means that he often says what he is thinking, which is that he knows better. It\u2019s safe to say the protagonist of Deepwater Horizon lacks this rarefied air. This is not to say that the average British hero is some strutting peacock and the American is a stern puritan. It\u2019s notable only in that it\u2019s a subversion of audience stereotypes and expectations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b0c1c1ef6c58bf0b3fc34cc5b952399339afa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b0c1c1ef6c58bf0b3fc34cc5b952399339afa2/0_311_4849_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Made in Dagenham glorifies the unionization of labor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made in Dagenham glorifies the unionization of labor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more pressing in this analysis is the contrast between the man of action and the man of principle, or in the case of the 2010 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/30/made-in-dagenham-film-review\">Made in Dagenham</a>, the woman. Made in Dagenham does not have explosions, gunfire or sweaty dudes covered in grease. Sally Hawkins stars as a fictional character plopped into the true story of a workers\u2019 strike at a Ford motor company sewing plant in the Dagenham area of London. Note that a protagonist was invented for the purposes of dramatizing this story. In order to make a movie out of a collective social action, a person had to be invented. Similarly, the Sally Field film <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/04/culture.features\">Norma Rae</a>, an American film about the labor movement, fictionalized Crystal Lee Sutton.</p> <p>Norma Rae is something of an outlier in American film in that it\u2019s a movie that glorifies the unionization of labor rather than exalting the \u201clone survivor\u201d story that we Yankees crave, while the British routinely revel in films like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984\">Pride</a>, about LGBT activists who get involved in the 1984 British miners\u2019 strike. Pride is an unabashed ensemble piece about how collective action can uplift people of all stripes. Modern Britain does seem to be becoming less and less amenable to progressive ideas, but there still remains that kernel of the European fascination with democratic socialism. In these British films, the system is still the enemy, but it can only be defeated with a group effort. </p> <p>When the story is one of individual effort, British film tends to focus on the criminal figure \u2013 Roger Daltry in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/10/last-days-of-prison-breakout\">McVicar </a>or more recently, Tom Hardy as the Kray brothers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/legend-review-tom-hardy-on-double-duty-in-cartoonish-krays-biopic\">Legend</a>. It\u2019s no coincidence that British true-story films that do well in America are usually ones that narrow their focus to one transcendent figure \u2013 King George VI in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/the-kings-speech-review\">The King\u2019s Speech</a>, Margaret Thatcher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/05/the-iron-lady-film-review\">The Iron Lady</a>, or Alan Turing.

They start by mounting the smartphone or camera on a tripod, because a stable image looks better than one created with an unsteady handheld camera.</p> <p>They also make sure that their subject \u2013 especially if it\u2019s just one person speaking to camera \u2013 is well lit. Digital cameras produce good results when there\u2019s plenty of light: your sunny holiday snaps probably look great. They struggle in low light conditions, often producing images that look grainy due to digital \u201cnoise\u201d. They also struggle with high-contrast lighting, though experts can use manual controls to exploit that.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a beginner, the best free option is a well-lit, white-walled room, but try to declutter the background. Putting a desk lamp above and behind the camera is better than nothing. If the result looks harsh, put some greaseproof paper or tissue paper in front to soften the light. (Keep paper well away from incandescent bulbs: they get hot.)</p> <p>Neewer makes a range of dimmable, battery-powered LED light arrays that you can fit into a camera hot-shoe or mount on a tripod. They\u2019re cheap \u2013 they start at around <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neewer-Bestlight-Adapter-Olympus-Camcorders/dp/B00HF35QW2\">\u00a320</a> to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dimmable-Digital-Camcorder-Panasonic-Samsung/dp/B004TJ6JH6/\">\u00a330</a> \u2013 and work well, but there are several alternatives. (Batteries are usually not included: buy rechargeables.)</p> <p>Serious YouTubers often work hard to capture good quality sound, and high-end microphones like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0002PSCQM/\">Rode NT1-A</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PR-40-Professional-Studio-Vocal-Microphone/dp/B002OSQ9TC/\">Heil PR40</a> are often conspicuous. However, even a cheap lapel mic like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lavalier-Microphone-Smartphone-Canon-Camera/dp/B00MPDYGBE/\">Boya BY-M1</a> (\u00a314.99) will produce better results than a built-in mic, partly because it\u2019s much closer to your mouth. Alternatives include gaming headsets and some earbuds, if you don\u2019t mind wearing them.</p> <p>You can also use a camera, make a separate digital recording, and combine the sound and visuals later. Most video editing programs, including Windows Movie Maker, can do this.</p> <h2><strong>Use what you have</strong></h2> <p>Rather than buying a new camera, get your son to experiment with devices that you already own. Any laptop with a built-in HD webcam \u2013 one that shoots 720p video \u2013 should be good enough to start with. If it doesn\u2019t produce good results even in decent lighting (some of them don\u2019t), you can buy an external USB webcam. If it\u2019s the sound that\u2019s the problem, try an external microphone such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ZH4STB6/\">BM-800</a> (\u00a317.99) or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006DIA77E/\">Blue Microphones\u2019 Snowball iCE</a> (\u00a348.98).</p> <p>When buying a webcam, look for Full HD resolution \u2013 one that shoots 1080p video. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-C920-Pro-1080p-Webcam/dp/B006A2Q81M/\">Logitech C920 HD Pro</a> is popular with YouTubers, and reasonably priced at \u00a357.98. There are cheaper alternatives, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PAPALOOK-Microphone-Recording-Broadcasting-Compatible/dp/B01GYFOXK2/\">Papalook PA452</a> (\u00a319.99). The<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-C525-HD-Webcam-Black/dp/B01BGBJ8SQ/\"> Logitech C525</a> (\u00a330.79 or \u00a344.99) would also work well, though it only does 720p video.</p> <p>Most smartphones can do the job, too, especially if you can add an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+microphone\">external microphone</a>. The smartphone should be mounted on a small tripod, such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01JBTPYZG/\">Everesta Flexible Octopus</a> (\u00a311.99), for stability. Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+tripod\">lots of alternatives</a>. Either way, it must be horizontal. On YouTube, vertical videos are an abomination.</p> <h2><strong>Moving up</strong></h2> <p>Digital cameras generally produce better-looking results, and from a photographic point of view, they are more versatile than smartphones.</p> <p>They have three drawbacks. First, they\u2019re relatively \u2013 and sometimes absolutely \u2013 expensive. Second, not many have microphone sockets, so you may have to record sound separately. Third, you can\u2019t see yourself talking, unless you get one with a hinged screen that flips up or swivels around to face the front.</p> <p>I asked Gordon Laing, of <a href=\"http://www.cameralabs.com/\">CameraLabs</a> fame, for advice. I\u2019d just watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrtUPWs__Dk\">YouTube review</a> that he did with Doug Kaye, a professional photographer who uses a top-level system. Gordon said that, for his end, he\u2019d used the webcam in his laptop, with the mic built into his earphones. It\u2019s good, but the video shows the difference in quality between the two approaches.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find any cheap digital cameras with microphone sockets and articulating screens. The old <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikon-Coolpix-P7800-Compact-Digital/dp/B00F062MI2/\">Nikon Coolpix P7800</a> looks ideal if you can find one second hand. I picked up an original <a href=\"http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_m/\">Canon EOS M</a> mirrorless when Argos was clearing them out for \u00a3200, but it doesn\u2019t have an articulating screen.</p> <p>The GoPro Hero 2 also had a microphone socket, and you can add an <a href=\"https://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/gopro-external-microphones\">external mic</a> to some of the Hero 4 cameras. This should appeal to YouTubers who make action videos, but it\u2019s not the best thing for talking heads.</p> <p>Asked for a good compact, Gordon suggested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Camera-20-3/dp/B00NLBGCZW/\">Canon PowerShot G7 X</a>, which you can find discounted to \u00a3379 now the Mark II version is out. At that price, you might as well get a DSLR that shoots professional-standard 1080p YouTube video. There\u2019s a huge selection with mic inputs.</p> <p>Gordon adds: \u201cFor me the holy trinity for high quality one-man vlogging are a screen that can flip to face you, an input for an external microphone and a decent-sized sensor that can smoothly track and refocus on a face. Most modern cameras have two out of three, but surprisingly few complete the hat trick. Canon\u2019s triple-digit EOS DSLRs manage it, but there\u2019s no need to go for the latest 750D or 760D: the earlier 700D and even 650D have everything you need.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2> <p>Start with a laptop or a smartphone. If it\u2019s a laptop, try the built-in webcam, and upgrade to an external webcam such as the Logitech C920 HD Pro when you need it. If it\u2019s a smartphone, mount it on a tripod and look for a good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smartphone+microphone\">external microphone</a>. In both cases, think about buying an external light such as one of the Neewer models.</p> <p>In theory, you could buy a digital camera, but affordable ones don\u2019t have microphone sockets. However, you might be able to find a cheap second hand Nikon Coolpix P7800 or Canon EOS M for use with an external microphone.</p> <p>A DSLR can provide professional results, but it may be several years before it\u2019s worth buying this sort of kit. Happily, successful YouTubers can earn enough to pay for it themselves.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

Border Force staffing has risen since this division of the Home Office was created in 2012. But only a few months ago, on these pages, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/apr/01/border-staff-cuts-terror-attacks-immigration\">Lucy Moreton</a> of the ISU, the union for borders, immigration and customs, complained about poor morale and intolerable pressure on her members, especially in Dover and Calais and at Heathrow. The UK has 5,000 customs staff and Border Force has 8,000: a very lean operation by international standards. The Home Office will have to recruit. </p> <p> That\u2019s pretty much what Mark Harper, former immigration minister, told an audience at the <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications\">Institute for Government</a>.

Administering work permits is going to be complicated under whatever system emerges, and will bring a lot more intervention in firms\u2019 recruitment schemes. Some say policy logic leads back to where former home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/apr/26/immigrationpolicy.humanrights\">David Blunkett</a> found himself 12 years ago, introducing identity cards \u2013 at a cost then of up to \u00a33.1bn.</p> <p> Theresa May\u2019s line when she was at the Home Office was that visa charges ought to cover the cost of immigration and border control. But today\u2019s gap \u2013 income from visas at \u00a31.3bn and spending at \u00a31.8bn \u2013 can now only grow. </p> <p> Also, migration control is likely to bring more work for the police. That might be impossible with today\u2019s staffing levels: police numbers have been cut by 14% since 2010.</p> <p> Some Leavers were libertarians, claiming that emancipation from the EU would see government further reduced.

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\">relaunched a leadership</a> that was staring into the abyss. Consider what has happened since he last took to the podium at Labour conference. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">voted to leave the EU</a>, a prime minister who seemed unassailable was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union\">toppled</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-obituary\">Jo Cox</a> was brutally killed, and Labour collapsed into its worst internal crisis since its foundation. Corbyn\u2019s speech yesterday had two key aims: to bring a divided party together and to appeal to a public that regards Labour\u2019s current situation as a baffling mess. He is a leader who has sustained a relentless media onslaught and a revolt from almost the entire parliamentary party. Perhaps Elton John\u2019s I\u2019m Still Standing would have been an appropriate song to welcome the re-elected Labour leader to the stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/28/jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-today-interview\">Jeremy Corbyn speech: Labour MPs should 'end trench warfare' and get behind socialist vision - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He could have been weakened.

Here was an attempt to challenge a false dichotomy. Yes, protest and campaigning plays a crucial role \u2013 but Labour\u2019s purpose, above all else, is \u201cabout winning power in local and national government to deliver the real change our country so desperately needs\u201d.</p> <p>When he spoke of Labour\u2019s proposals on the economy, it was technical but none the worse for that. The left\u2019s perennial weakness is appearing amateurish, prizing slogans over substance. There were concrete proposals: a national investment bank, investment in infrastructure, a new settlement for business. With self-employed people set to eclipse the number of public sector workers, finally there was a bold appeal for their support: a recognition that they value their independence, but not the insecurity, with an offer of social security and the finance to allow \u201csuccessful innovators\u201d to \u201cgrow their businesses and generate employment\u201d.</p> <p>Most striking perhaps, was the determination to tackle head-on an issue that has dogged his leadership since his very election: patriotism. Patriotism is not a concept that many metropolitan leftists are terribly comfortable with. They regard it as a euphemism for bigotry, xenophobia and imperialism. But to millions of working-class English people (Scotland and Wales are well served by their respective patriotisms), it matters a lot \u2013 and they feel the left is contemptuous about it. This was a speech infused with patriotism. \u201cA Labour government will never accept second best for Britain\u201d must become a line repeated ad infinitum. There was a patriotic case for tax justice: \u201cThere is nothing more unpatriotic than not paying your taxes \u2013 it is an act of vandalism.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Much of it was aimed at the faithful. That's fine. But the focus \u2013 the fixation \u2013 must be on building broader appeal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And there was calibration. A passionate defence of migrants was balanced with an acknowledgement that concerns over immigration must be acknowledged. The referendum result was accepted \u2013 Labour is toast in many of its natural constituencies if it does anything else \u2013 and now the party wants a just Brexit.</p> <p>Though one good speech is not enough on its own, there is now a platform that can be built on. Labour\u2019s woes are not all the product of the machinations of the mainstream media (who are not going to change their ways) or the parliamentary party (who are not a homogenous bloc). The leadership team, which did not expect to win last year, made mistakes in communication and strategy that cut through and caused damage. That damage must be undone if Labour is not to suffer the sort of election rout that would discredit the left for a generation.</p> <p>Much of it was aimed at the faithful. That\u2019s fine, for few outside that group will watch the whole performance. But the focus \u2013 indeed the fixation \u2013 must be on building broader appeal. Labour has long haemorrhaged support among older people \u2013 how will it reverse a trend fatal to its political prospects? Its economic policies are becoming much clearer to wonks. The task now is to make the way forward clear to voters, in ways that can be digested on the doorstep. What exactly is its vision for, say, someone on \u00a325,000 living in small-town Britain?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/the-real-lesson-from-corbyns-victory-you-cant-hold-back-history\">The real lesson from Corbyn\u2019s victory? You can\u2019t hold back history | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rhetoric will certainly rouse the hundreds of thousands who have flooded into the party, but still it may feel alien to millions. Labour\u2019s leadership must now use this speech as a launchpad to develop a clear, coherent, optimistic vision for the Britain they want to build. Concise messages that hammer away at viable solutions should be repeated as mantras \u2013 just as the Tories do so successfully.</p> <p>There is hope, for what appeared impossible just weeks ago \u2013 uniting the party \u2013 seems far more achievable. There have been fewer harsher critics of Corbyn than <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/73205/john-woodcock-told-accept-%E2%80%98democratic-decision%E2%80%99\">John Woodcock</a>. He praised a \u201cwell-delivered speech \u2026 with a firm direction\u201d. In the afterglow, sceptical MPs may well feel reassured enough to retake their shadow ministerial posts. There can and should be compromise, for in truth, the ideological divisions are less profound than they were in the 1980s. The bigger concerns, MPs will tell you, are competence, priorities and effective communication.</p> <p>Labour has endured a summer of pain, but if that sorry period has forced leaders to confront their weaknesses, it could ultimately be to their advantage. After Liverpool, there is a moment for clarity. All sides must seize it. Together they will decide whether the party can achieve political triumph or suffer terminal decline.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 September 2016 to clarify a sentence.

  "<p>Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn\u2019t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French.</p> <p>And then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">17 million people voted to leave</a>. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife\u2019s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn\u2019t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed \u2013 or thanked, depending on your view \u2013 for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window \u2013 the remedy of leaving \u2013 in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost,<strong> </strong>a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. \u201cLike the monks on Iona,\u201d as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, \u201cilluminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.\u201d</p> <p>And no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence \u2013 fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. \u201cHere I am, Ishmael,\u201d he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. \u201cEvery man\u2019s hand is against me.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who has done more on this,\u201d he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU \u2013 \u201cbut Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hannan\u2019s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. \u201cWhen I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,\u201d Carswell told me recently, \u201cI thought, \u2018Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.\u2019\u201d Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was \u201cradicalised\u201d, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. \u201cOn the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn\u2019t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. \u201cThe broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,\u201d said Michael Gove. \u201cThey took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren\u2019t.\u201d Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan\u2019s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. \u201cYou have got to have hard arses,\u201d the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, \u201cwho are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don\u2019t mind being unfashionable.\u201d<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his own way, he is an idiot savant. So locked up in his world, he can\u2019t see what's on the end of his aquiline nose</p> <footer> <cite>Gawain Towler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The other explanation, however, is that in the climactic moment \u2013 when Brexit was put to the people \u2013 it wasn\u2019t Hannan and his debating points that carried Britain out of the European Union, but a smaller, darker, set of instincts altogether. The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">posters about Turkey joining the EU,</a> were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit \u2013 mostly about deregulation and sovereignty \u2013 was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. \u201cIn his own way, he is an idiot savant,\u201d said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSo locked up in his world that he can\u2019t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks \u2013 like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide \u2013 and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/775996023873429504\">If you\u2019re told that \u2018Brexit was all about immigration,\u2019 you can be almost certain that you\u2019re talking to a Remain voter,</a>\u201d ran a sample, recent tweet.</p> <p>For the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers \u2013 a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century \u2013 will always be a breathtaking thing. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge of the nerd,\u201d one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. \u201cI was in awe of it.\u201d But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. \u201cNone of these people are builders, they are destroyers,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThey are frightening people. They are like arsonists.\u201d If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life\u2019s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself.

A few old-stagers from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/05/referendum-eec-europe-1975\">1975 referendum on membership</a> fought on \u2013 isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods \u2013 but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate</a> on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. \u201cWe have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,\u201d she said. The \u201cBruges speech\u201d established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against.</p> <p>Hannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen\u2019s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street.</p> <p>\u201cI remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,\u201d he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest.</p> <p>The CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. \u201cThere were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,\u201d she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. \u201cHe was clearly the leader,\u201d said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. \u201cI mean this in the fondest possible way,\u201d said Littlewood, \u201cyou could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d/0_353_2731_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher deliver her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 19xx.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher delivers her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 1988 in which she warned against a European superstate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan\u2019s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate.</p> <p>Hannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight.<strong> </strong>Britain in 1979 was a revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in Peru spoke like that.\u201d Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan\u2019s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher,<strong> </strong>first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. \u201cThe expat mentality is belonging to the old country,\u201d Scruton told me, \u201cand the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.\u201d</p> <p>At Oxford, Hannan\u2019s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan\u2019s speeches \u2013 as his writings are now \u2013 were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King\u2019s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world\u2019s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. \u201cA Hannan soundbite does stick with you,\u201d said Littlewood. \u201cHe does make you think.\u201d</p> <p>The Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary.</p> <p>In Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson\u2019s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\">European Foundation</a>. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. \u201cDon\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,\u201d said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. \u201cThis was a radicalised streak of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>The job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. \u201cFor us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,\u201d Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. \u201cHe was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,\u201d Gove told me. \u201cSome people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.\u201d Hannan was 24 years old.</p> <p>For all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum.</p> <p>Largely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave\u2019s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees \u2013 led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. \u201cBusiness for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,\u201d Theresa Villiers told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/72_0_3474_4342/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\">Dominic Cummings</a>. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. \u201cThis was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.\u201d</p> <p>Business for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. \u201cWe did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,\u201d said Hannan.</p> <p>Eighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling\u2019s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. \u201cIt is funny,\u201d she told me. \u201cAlmost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life\u2019s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Business for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols \u2013 the Queen\u2019s head on a fiver \u2013 that touched the nerves of millions of people.<strong> </strong>Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn\u2019t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of \u201creform\u201d; \u201cfundamental reform\u201d if they were feeling brave. \u201cWhatever weasel words,\u201d Reckless told me. \u201cDan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan\u2019s age \u2013 he was now 26 \u2013 and his polished,<strong> </strong>bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. \u201cI was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to come out if we can\u2019t,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Conservative party activists loved it, but Hannan\u2019s bold language alarmed party headquarters. <strong>\u201c</strong>I was told that he was a fanatic,\u201d said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan\u2019s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams. We are realistic. There is something in his life that affected him</p> <footer> <cite>Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once inside the heart of the EU, Hannan set about discrediting it. A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and \u201cthe more naughty stuff\u201d of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan\u2019s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim,<strong> </strong>but he did not relent. \u201cI was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,\u201d he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan\u2019s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. \u201cThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,\u201d Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White, an MEP from Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular, told me. \u201cThere is something in his life that probably affected him.\u201d</p> <p>From day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People\u2019s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron \u2013 then a leadership contender \u2013 that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.)</p> <p>Concentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. \u201cOur goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,\u201d Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. \u201cIt should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.\u201d But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards \u2013 even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. \u201cThe view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,\u201d said Gove. \u201cWhatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.\u201d</p> <p>One new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.\u2019\u201d Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to \u201centryists\u201d and \u201cTrots\u201d for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain\u2019s lost place in the world. \u201cThey are grammar-school imperialists,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cA hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan says such insults have never bothered him. \u201cIt passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,\u201d he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. \u201cI think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.\u201d Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America\u2019s \u201cEuropean\u201d drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom &amp; Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta.</p> <p>Operating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George\u2019s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as \u201ctuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring\u201d. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the \u201csupreme exemplar of that in his generation\u201d.</p> <p>For years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/04/conservatives.speeches\">William Hague\u2019s so-called \u201cforeign land\u201d speech </a>in 2001. The speech\u2019s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party\u2019s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: \u201cThere is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don\u2019t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it all by stealth,\u201d he thought, \u201cand they will get to where they want to go.\u201d<strong> </strong>Cameron\u2019s new-look party was determined \u201cto stop banging on about Europe\u201d and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories.</p> <p>In November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron\u2019s office to resign from his duties in Brussels \u2013 he was the party\u2019s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. \u201cI said \u2026 I just think you\u2019ve made the most terrible mistake,\u201d Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. \u201cI\u2019m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,\u201d Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d/0_0_3228_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.

He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: \u201cWho will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?\u201d He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People\u2019s Pledge.</p> <p>Like other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People\u2019s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party \u2013 it had mainly Labour staffers \u2013 and didn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People\u2019s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors.</p> <p>Europe was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. \u201cOh God, so annoying,\u201d is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. \u201cConstantly demanding to see the prime minister.\u201d Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People\u2019s Pledge, and Hannan\u2019s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. \u201cMore and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.\u201d</p> <p>With the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People\u2019s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg\u2019s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think offering the referendum was a good idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach \u2013 the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum \u2013 on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron\u2019s ability to reform the EU.</p> <p>\u201cDan was basically, \u2018He is not going to do it. Don\u2019t believe him,\u201d Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning \u201cno\u201d side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system \u2013 an impressive-sounding \u00a3250m \u2013 and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,\u201d Hannan said.<strong> </strong>But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, \u201cNo to A/V\u201d won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than \u00a3650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in \u00a320,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around \u00a3220m. \u201cCrispin,\u201d as a friend told me, \u201chas the common touch of a Medici.\u201d)</p> <p>The new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. \u201cWe needed each other,\u201d he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless \u2013 Hannan\u2019s closest friends in politics \u2013 celebrate Reckless\u2019s byelection win for Ukip in 2014.

Dan in a sense provided us with that message.\u201d Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, while the deliberately crude figure of \u00a3350m per week, to describe Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott\u2019s successful A/V strategy.</p> <p>Hannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip \u2013 one month apart \u2013 in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage\u2019s dominance of the party.<strong> </strong>A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. \u201cI spoke to Boris and made my pitch,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.\u201d (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At least three of Gove\u2019s memorable soundbites \u2013 including people being \u2018fed up with experts\u2019 \u2013 were thought up by Hannan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan\u2019s work was more or less done. \u201cTwenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,\u201d said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave\u2019s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. \u201cDan would often express views that I had myself,\u201d said Gove, \u201cwhich he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.\u201d At least three of Gove\u2019s more memorable soundbites \u2013 about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists \u2013 were Hannan lines.<strong> </strong>Villiers borrowed freely from her friend\u2019s speeches. From needling and courting one or two \u201couters\u201d in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit.</p> <p>He took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. \u201cDominic is very puritan about these things,\u201d said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V \u2013 \u201cWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d \u2013 substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn\u2019t go to bed until midnight the following day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the Monday after the vote, at around six o\u2019clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. \u201cThe story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. \u201cYou guys have been shouting \u2018racist\u2019 for so long,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t listening to what we were actually saying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivOOM0PbNps\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ivOOM0PbNps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Christiane Amanpour interviews Daniel Hannan</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. \u201cHe was very uncomfortable and very angry,\u201d Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/for-the-first-time-in-my-life-i-feel-ashamed-to-be-british/\">\u201cHe has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,\u201d Parris wrote.</a> \u201cI find him a bit scary,\u201d he said, when we spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. \u201cCan you see how patronising that is?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, remainers are saying basically, \u2018These thicko, working-class bigots weren\u2019t listening to you. And let me now tell you \u2013 having ignored them \u2013 let me tell you what they really think.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the \u201coffshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrep\u00f4t\u201d that he longs us to be. Hannan\u2019s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market.<strong> </strong>He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan\u2019s gift. \u201cEven if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,\u201d said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan\u2019s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. \u201cI think we are in the calm before the storm,\u201d she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn\u2019t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. \u201cTalking to people who voted leave \u2026 \u2018back\u2019 was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, \u2018I want to take our country back.\u2019 Back to what?\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent \u201ca personality change\u201d.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the have-nothings \u2026 They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren\u2019t the same as us, are detached from us.\u201d</p> <p>Like Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union \u2013 around trade and sovereignty and democracy \u2013 in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what most people are bothered about,\u201d he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don\u2019t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.\u201d Farage said he didn\u2019t hear much about Hannan\u2019s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. \u201cIt is another disconnect isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. \u201cIt was the independence issue,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the idea of self-government.\u201d I told him that \u2013 as a citizen of the same country \u2013 I still didn\u2019t really get it. I couldn\u2019t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. \u201cIt\u2019s a big philosophical difference,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBetween the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of \u2018trust the people\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be rude. \u201cWe are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.\u201d</p> <p>We were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan\u2019s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. \u201cIt is the great migration of our time,\u201d said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. \u201cHow many of them are on benefits?\u201d, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply.</p> <p>After lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn\u2019t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard.\u201d And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.\u201d Hannan paused. \u201cCheer up my friends.\u201d The lunchers laughed. Sunshine poured in. The cataclysm could not be felt. \u201cListen to the drone of the bees in lavender, and ask yourself where in the world would you rather be?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

Trump had long falsely claimed that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, an accusation widely considered to be a racist dogwhistle. Although Trump only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/16/trump-obama-birth-certificate-clinton\">recently acknowledged</a> that Obama was born in the United States in an event at a Washington hotel, he falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for the conspiracy theory\u2019s origin. He since said that he only acknowledged Obama\u2019s actual birthplace in order to \u201cget on with the campaign\u201d.</p> <p>Trump also introduced a new conspiracy theory to the campaign on Wednesday night when he accused Google of somehow colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cGoogle search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,\u201d the Republican told a cheering crowd of supporters in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Neither Google nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment on this accusation, which seems to stem from a report in Sputnik News, a Russian state propaganda outlet. The reference to Google did not appear to be ad libbed as it was in Trump\u2019s prepared remarks.</p> <p>Also, at the rally, Trump unveiled a new accusation towards Clinton, whom he has repeatedly attacked as \u201ca globalist\u201d, by saying she was a \u201cvessel for special interests ... who want to strip [the United States] of its status as a sovereign nation\u201d. Although the former secretary of state has long favored immigration reform as well as number of free trade agreements, there is no evidence that she has ever supported stripping the United States of its sovereignty.</p> <p>However, Clinton is facing scrutiny over her complicated marital history. After Trump publicly congratulated himself for not bringing up former president Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities in Monday\u2019s debate, his campaign has cited them in talking points in an attempt to rebut past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">crude statements about a beauty queen</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/alicia-machado-miss-universe-weight-shame-trump-speaks-out-clinton\">Alicia Machado, Miss Universe weight-shamed by Trump, speaks out for Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, which included calling her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d for her weight and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d in reference to her Hispanic heritage, were brought up by Hillary Clinton in Monday\u2019s debate. Trump owned part of the Miss Universe pageant at the time.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/781271665955180544\">talking points distributed</a> to Trump surrogates on the topic, they were told to change the topic to Monica Lewinsky and included the line \u201cMr Trump has never treated women the way Hillary Clinton and her husband did when they actively worked to destroy Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers.\u201d In interviews on Wednesday, Trump surrogates repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-campaign-quietly-shouts-about-clinton-sex-scandals-n656466\">brought the subject up</a>. Trump himself tried to cast himself as an ally of Machado in an interview with O\u2019Reilly. He repeatedly said \u201cI saved her job\u201d and added in seeming regret: \u201cI helped somebody and this is what you get for helping somebody.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton spent the day campaigning with former rival Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. The two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-rally\">tried to appeal to millennial voters</a> by repeatedly touting Clinton\u2019s proposal to reduce the cost of college tuition. Clinton is facing declining enthusiasm among millennial voters who were one of the key groups in the winning coalition forged by Obama in his election victories. According to<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/781176300820201472\"> a recent poll</a> conducted by ABC/Washington Post only 49% of voters under the age of 40 said they were likely to vote in November. A similar poll in 2012 put that number at 71%. The Democratic nominee also held two fundraisers on Wednesday, one of which featured an appearance from Massachusetts senator and progressive Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>The leading third party alternative to Clinton and Trump suffered his own embarrassment on Wednesday. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for the White House, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/gary-johnson-cant-name-foreign-leader-aleppo-moment\">unable to name a single foreign leader</a> he admired in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews. He referred to his inability to come up with a single name as \u201canother Aleppo moment\u201d. This was a reference to a televised interview several weeks ago when the former two-term governor of New Mexico, having been asked \u201cWhat would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?\u201d on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/aleppo-gary-johnson-syria-war-question\">responded with the question \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d</a>. Johnson seemed unaware of the Syrian city which has been long under siege in the midst of that country\u2019s civil war and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/aleppo-two-hospitals-bombed-out-of-service-syria-airstrikes\">the site of numerous atrocities</a> by the Assad regime and its allies.</p> <p>The candidates will return to the campaign trail on Thursday by meeting voters in states that they are long familiar with from the primaries.

They are <em>willingly </em>ignorant.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the logic of racism, to dispossess the racist even of their own humanity and their sense of it, and above all to dispossess Muslim from their own lived Islam, from its own contested cultural debates, from its own expansive and endlessly deep heritage, from its own linguistic lineage. </p> <p>The \u201cMuslim\u201d has come to be a hollowed, emptied term that functions as a trigger for white anxiety. Little surprise then, when you add Muslim next to another anxiety-laden word \u201cimmigrant\u201d, the result equates to half the country reaching out for the treadmill\u2019s emergency red stop button. </p> <p>Modernity\u2019s pace seems too quick for some, but the keen reader would have noted that in my opening agreement I put the Muslim in scare quotes. I do this for a reason. The word \u201cMuslim\u201d belongs to a conversation born out of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d. I distinguish it from the quote-less everyday Muslim whose complex life is beyond the headline and Hanson\u2019s narrow parameters. </p> <p>Any one simplified and generalising statement about Islam betrays the religion and its communities\u2019 diverse contests, betrays Muslims\u2019 internal debates on how to best articulate Islam\u2019s universality. Whereas, the \u201cMuslim\u201d functions in a pure simplicity. It simply means <em>them</em>. It represents an abject figure that has to be excluded from the circle of us so to imagine a supposed pure integrity of our culture.</p> <p>In my own experience, the everyday Muslim has no problem with Australia. In fact, they are infuriately, to a fault, in love with this country. In love to the point that they maintain hope that its democratic value will correct its racism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/we-cant-build-a-progressive-political-agenda-without-tackling-bigotry\">We can\u2019t build a progressive political agenda without tackling bigotry | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have little sympathy for these moderates and their \u201cheartbreak\u201d at the poll\u2019s results, for I agree with the poll precisely for the opposite reason. The \u201cMuslim\u201d, not the Muslim, is a threat because it stands for a 200-year racial paranoia that threatens to expose the undemocratic truths of this country\u2019s racism, threatens to unleash the violent whiteness that lurks within, that lurks looking for an excuse to sprout its head. </p> <p>Consider, how,  in <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/immigration-and-religion-2\">another Essential poll</a> in 2014, only 17% of people voted that we should prevent immigration based on one\u2019s religion. Add the word \u201cMuslim\u201d the number significantly rises. Does this increase not exactly expose how the word \u201cMuslim\u201d functions as a trigger to suspend reason, suspend values, suspend realities. Who is betraying the the myth of the secular: Muslim immigrants or those who wish to empower the state to socially engineer our religious make up? </p> <p>The poll I fear has little to do with realities or values and everything to do with the reciting the racial scripts that are prepping us to suspend the very thing that hinders the acceleration of Australia\u2019s racism: the myth we are not racist. It becomes easier to be only after it becomes acceptable to say. So, yes. Stop the \u201cMuslim\u201d. </p>",

That suit was settled. Both suits allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior but failed to act to stop him. </p> <p>The August complaint was filed supplementally against Gonsalves and also against the city of El Cajon for failure to prevent Gonsalves\u2019s harassment and for retaliation Greer experienced after the first suit. The second suit also alleges that Gonsalves did all of this despite knowing that Greer was \u201ca sexual assault survivor who suffered from PTSD\u201d.</p> <p>According to court documents, Olango came to the US from Uganda with his family as refugees in 1991, when he was 12. The family then settled in California.<br></p> <p>Agnes Hassan, a refugee from Sudan, told reporters that she and Olango had been in a refugee camp together. \u201cWe suffered so much with the war in Africa, we come here to suffer again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Both the El Cajon police department and the El Cajon police officers\u2019 association, the police union, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>"
