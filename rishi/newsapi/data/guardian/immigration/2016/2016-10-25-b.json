  "<p>Prince Charles and Waitrose have been criticised by health campaigners for the high level of sugar in Waitrose Duchy Organic ice cream. </p> <p></p> <p>The ice cream \u2013 sold exclusively at Waitrose \u2013 contains almost twice as much sugar as some other brands.</p> <p>It was singled out by researchers as an example of the differing levels of sugar in exactly the same kinds of foods which appeal to children. </p> <p>Action on Sugar is urging companies to support <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/industry-attends-phe-briefing-on-reduction-and-reformulation\">Public Health England\u2019s voluntary reformulation programme</a> to help tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, which it claims is the biggest public health crisis facing the UK. </p> <p>The survey of foods commonly consumed by children including breakfast cereals, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, confectionery, pastries, ice creams and chocolate spreads shows that products containing less sugar are in plentiful supply. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/21/sugary-soft-drinks-increases-diabetes-risk-study-autoimmune\">More than two sugary drinks a day greatly increases diabetes risk, study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, Duchy Organic vanilla ice cream, with 14.5g of sugar per 100g, was found to have 84% more sugar than Asda\u2019s \u201csmart price\u201d vanilla ice cream, with 7.9g sugar.</p> <p>Duchy Organic is a partnership between Waitrose and Duchy Originals, founded by the Prince of Wales. Waitrose is the owner of the brand licence and is responsible for product formulation under that licensing agreement.</p> <p>Data was collected by visiting Aldi, Asda, Co-operative, Lidl, Marks &amp; Spencer, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose using the <a href=\"http://www.foodswitch.co.nz/content/about-foodswitch\">FoodSwitch app</a> to collect data on nutritional information. The survey was carried out during August and products were checked again during September. <br></p> <p>Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and an expert advisory team member of Action on Sugar, said: \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s sugar levy announcement in March must be regarded as his swansong as chancellor. </p> <p>\u201cAt a stroke, he concentrated the mind of sugar-happy soft drink manufacturers seriously to consider reformulating their products to an acceptable level. </p> <p>\u201cAs Action on Sugar\u2019s research shows, many food manufacturers got the message, too. All, and Prince Charles in particular, should now follow their lead. The added bonus is that they will have dramatically aided the health of millions of people, let alone the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Waitrose said the Duchy Organic vanilla ice cream was an \u201cindulgent\u201d treat not aimed at children, adding: \u201cThe sugar content is clearly labelled and we sell a range of vanilla ice creams with a significantly lower sugar content, which our customers can choose if they want a healthier option. </p> <p>\u201cReducing sugar is a top priority and we have an extensive reformulation programme to achieve this, which has already included significantly reducing sugar in chilled juices, cereals, yoghurts, soups, cordials and fizzy drinks.\u201d</p> <p>Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist and researcher at Action on Sugar, said:<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>\u201cUnhealthy foods are the biggest cause of death and disability in the UK and it is time the food industry took their responsibility for this seriously. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/young-children-copy-parents-sugary-drinks-study-suggests-fizzy\">Young children copy parents' sugary drinks habits, study suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey now need to make this a priority and ensure children are not eating three times their daily maximum intake of sugar.\u201d</p> <p>Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chair of Action on Sugar, said reformulation was one of the most effective ways of reducing sugar and, if done properly, meant the UK could lead the world in this area. </p> <p>\u201cWe therefore urge the prime minister, Theresa May, to fully support it and commit the government to both fat reformulation, as it\u2019s the biggest source of calories than sugar, and to start restrictions of marketing, advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods.\u201d<br></p> <p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-retailers-urge-mandatory-cuts-to-food-sugar-levels\">leading retailers</a> criticised the government\u2019s watered-down childhood obesity strategy just days after its publication, arguing it would be better if ministers imposed mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food rather than leaving it up to voluntary initiatives by manufacturers.<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article and the headline were amended on 25 October 2016 to clarify that Duchy Organic is a partnership between Waitrose and Duchy Originals, founded by the Prince of Wales.

He said the suspects had no connection to the Serbian state but did have ties to an unnamed third country.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, was expected in Belgrade to hold talks with Serbian leaders in the wake of the arrests, <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=99505\">according to reports</a> from the Serbian capital.

  "<p>Tony Abbott\u2019s local campaign director, Walter Villatora, has called on Malcolm Turnbull to ensure there are genuine plebiscites for all New South Wales party members rather than pandering to lobbyists and party powerbrokers.</p> <p>Villatora, the Warringah conference president who has long been campaigning for changes to the rules governing Liberal preselections, is maintaining pressure following the state council meeting last weekend which saw the prime minister\u2019s motion for wider democratic reforms defeat Abbott\u2019s motion for plebiscites.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s motion passed unanimously and resolved to reform the NSW division based on the Victorian branch, which introduced plebiscites.<br></p> <p>It also resolved to increase female participation, improve training for candidates and improve policy participation.

The right wing has generally been more supportive of plebiscites, though leading moderates Turnbull and Baird are key supporters. </p> <p>A former NSW president, North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, said after the conference there had to be safeguards on plebiscites to ensure branch stacking did not occur.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to stop people who will join the party just to influence the preselection, never be seen at a branch meeting, never to be seen working on election campaigns and never to be seen again after we have had a preselection,\u201d Zimmerman told Sky News.</p> <p>Villatora said he would be looking to the party leadership to ensure the state council motion was not a delaying tactic.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe only acceptable model is a true plebiscite, not the attempt to maintain the control of lobbyists and powerbrokers of 40% central control and an arbiter to judge other members to determine who is a genuine member,\u201d Villatora said.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to look to leadership to ensure that Saturday\u2019s motion was not an obvious ploy to kick the can down the road as another delaying tactic but is a binding convention all genuine members can look forward to, a binding \u201cone member, one vote\u201d convention that will unite the party.\u201d</p> <p>Villatora described the momentum for change in the party as \u201cunstoppable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason we have seen this progress is due to the pressure rank-and-file members have exerted on party and the leadership of the prime minister, Tony Abbott, John Howard, NSW premier Mike Baird, Angus Taylor, and General Major (rtd) Jim Molan,\u201d Villatora said in a statement. </p> <p>NSW party president Kent Johns would not comment on issues up for discussion at the convention but he said the resolutions ensured that \u201ceverything was on the table\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is to arrange the convention and make sure everyone has a say and out of it, we will become a stronger party and a better party,\u201d Johns said. </p>",

In May, the band re-released Walking on a Dream in the United States and it hit number one on the Billboard dance songs chart.

The radio started playing it because people started requesting it. We\u2019ve been very fortunate \u2026 songs don\u2019t often come back around.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI do believe if you put a positive thought into the universe it\u2019ll come back around, a bit like a message in a bottle.\u201d</p> <p>Littlemore\u2019s hair is silver now but his face is childlike. His manner is calm and open, verging on guileless. Conversation circles pleasantly but persistently back to his favoured topics of nature, hallucinogens, dream states and plant wisdom. You suspect he really does believe his band\u2019s success is the result of happy thoughts in bottles. </p> <p>\u201cIn the States, people thrive on positivity,\u201d he says. \u201cI find it sad that [cynicism] still permeates the culture [in Australia]. I had a bit of that \u2018tall poppy\u2019 thing when I was 20, 21. I was expecting some more nasty journalists on this trip and everyone\u2019s been really wonderful, so I think if you\u2019re putting out a positive message, it\u2019s hard for people to call you nasty names.\u201d</p> <p>Both Littlemore and singer Luke Steele are based in Los Angeles. In December, Steele will don the duo\u2019s outlandish costumes and begin touring. Littlemore won\u2019t be joining him \u2013 he never has. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be away from my wife and my life. I like creating, it\u2019s all I like doing. I know fans will be like, \u2018fuck you, you don\u2019t tour, you let us down\u2019 but it was never my intention to tour. It gets messy and all the rest of it.\u201d</p> <p>Special guests on the record include Henry Hey and Tim Lefebvre from David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar band, Wendy Melvoin from Prince\u2019s Purple Rain-era Revolution band, and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. \u201c[Fleetwood Mac] has always been a big influence. Lindsey was allegedly a fan, which I still don\u2019t believe, but he came down with his son to the studio and it was very natural and so wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>How to rectify a lacklustre second album? Make the third blindingly bright. On Two Vines, Empire of the Sun return to the form of their first album, continuing their voyage out to strange new worlds. Visually and conceptually, that is. Musically, it is neither strange nor new: shimmery and trebly with beats that flutter and pulse instead of pound. On some tracks Steele\u2019s voice is robotic with autotune and in photos the duo has retreated even further into airbrushed artificiality. </p> <p>In the video for High and Low, Littlemore appears momentarily as a many-armed Indian god before the clip segues into a sequence that looks a lot like the Honda ad. \u201cAlice D you\u2019re on your way up,\u201d sings Steele though it sounds like \u201cLSD\u201d.

The second album for me was a little paper-thin; it didn\u2019t warm my soul in the way moments on the first do. I wanted to focus on harmony, melody and a message.\u201d</p> <p>That message is about nature. \u201cWelcome to the garden of unearthly bliss,\u201d opens the press release. \u201cThrough the waterfall of dreams, beyond the white light of the ice curtain lies a lush, green world where childlike innocence and ancient wisdom are one. Enter, Empyrean pilgrims\u201d. </p> <p>It was fans who named themselves \u201cEmpyrean pilgrims\u201d, Littlemore clarifies. As for the rest of the delusional high drama \u2013 such as appointing Steele \u2018Emperor\u2019 and Littlemore \u2018Prophet\u2019 \u2013 he says it was \u201cinitially a reaction against the \u2018stare at my shoes\u2019 generation\u201d. Then it gathered steam. </p> <p>\u201cWe thought it\u2019s not for us to decide what a 12- or 13-year-old kid will like. We\u2019re going to build something worthy of their imagination and dreams. While we might look quite ridiculous when we dress up, [imagination has no limits] for your 10-year-old self. We were very excited by the prospect of being on that kid\u2019s bedroom wall.\u201d</p> <p>But how does Littlemore reconcile a message about nature with songs created using studio technology? \u201cTo capture something that\u2019s purely natural or naturalistic is not necessarily possible with Empire,\u201d he admits. \u201cInevitably, with a band that gets successful and finds its place \u2026 there comes a pressure about a repeat performance and this sort of thing. I just like to take the opportunity to talk about things I actually want to talk about rather than, like, our new costumes. I really just want to talk about nature.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Empire of the Sun\u2019s new album Two Vines is out on 28 October</em></p>",

  "<h2><strong>Preamble</strong></h2> <p><em>Final, Azteca Stadium, Mexico City, Mexico, Sunday 21 June 1970</em></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s beginning to look like Brazil will realise their dream of becoming the first country to win the World Cup three times, and take home the famous Jules Rimet Trophy for keeps.</strong> They\u2019re hot favourites to win this afternoon, and little wonder: en route to the final they\u2019ve scored 15 goals in five matches, beaten the reigning champions England, seen off the ghosts of 1950 by finally defeating Uruguay at a World Cup, and raised the bar to such an extent that their two most memorable moments are misses, for goodness sake, Pel\u00e9 nearly scoring from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia, and freezing the Uruguayan keeper in amber during the semi with an outrageous dummy, rounding him on one side while the ball went t\u2019other, before finally yanking a shot inches wide. Can anyone stop this famous forward five of Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson and Jairzinho?</p> <p><strong>If anyone can, Italy are your men, for the 1934 and 1938 champs are looking to bag Jules Rimet for good as well.</strong> The current European champions eased their way through qualification, with Luigi Riva, a newly crowned Serie A champion with Sardinian minnows Cagliari, scoring seven times. After a quiet start in the group stage, they\u2019ve reached the final after pelting four goals past hosts Mexico and the highly fancied West Germans. The only problem has been keeping midfield maestro Gianni Rivera happy. Coach Ferruccio Valcaregga doesn\u2019t much like the cut of the Milan star\u2019s jib, it would seem, preferring Sandro Mazzola of Internazionale, who it was thought had been brought to Mexico merely as cover for Rivera. When he replaced Rivera at the start of the tournament, so abrasive was the Golden Boy\u2019s response to being dropped that he was nearly sent home. But as things have panned out, Mazzola\u2019s been playing the first half of the knockout games, with Rivera coming on for the second. What a carry-on. And to think Valcaregga is paid to make decisions! It\u2019s a decision of sorts, I suppose, and eight goals in two games suggests it\u2019s working, but you have to wonder how this might pan out now we\u2019re down to the nitty gritty.</p> <p><strong>Whoever plays, this final is being viewed as a battle for the philosophical heart of soccer, the flair and panache of the south Americans versus the wily catenaccio of the Azzurri. </strong>Broad brush strokes, of course - Italy\u2019s eight in the last two matches, again - but it\u2019s not totally unfair. Either way, it\u2019s expected to be a close one, with Brazil fancied to edge it, much as they did against England. Though in fairness the contest would be a damn sight harder to call if it wasn\u2019t being played in this heat and altitude, especially as G\u00e9rson, the brains of Brazil, is on 40 gaspers a day.</p> <p><strong>Valcaregga has made another decision! And it\u2019s to keep that preposterous Mazzola-Rivera <em>staffetta</em></strong> <strong>(relay) policy going: </strong>Enrico Albertosi, Tarcisio Burgnich, Giacinto Facchetti, Mario Bertini, Roberto Rosato, Pierluigi Cera, Angelo Domenghini, Sandro Mazzola, Roberto Boninsegna, Giancarlo De Sisti, Luigi Riva.</p> <p><strong>Brazil, a teamsheet which conjures up so many vivid images it reads like a modernist poem: </strong>Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Clodoaldo, Brito, Piazza, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o, Pel\u00e9, Rivelino. So much depends on Brazil, glazed with rain water. It\u2019s a humid, oppressive afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>The highest of high noons: 12 midday.</p> <h2>Buildup</h2> <p><strong>A heady atmosphere in the Azteca, then, which is filled to the brim, 112,000 people. </strong>Sailing off into the ether are four humongous beachball-balloons, one bedecked in the blue-and-green of Brazil, another in the Italian tricolore and therefore totally out of sync with the national team strip, and a couple with huge Mexico 70 logos stamped on them. That brazen branding\u2019s going to give someone at Fifa ideas.</p> <p><strong>The players line up to get their photos taken, Brazil looking grim faced, the weight of expectation weighing heavily. </strong>The scene quickly descends into mayhem. Bedlam bedlam bedlam. The pitch fills with some official-looking folk, and very many unofficial-looking folk. An awful lot of photographers and assorted hangers-on. The World Cup final\u2019s going to kick off in less than 60 seconds, for goodness sake, will you all please bugger off!</p> <p><strong>Amid the madness, </strong><strong>Pel\u00e9</strong><strong> swooshes around warming up, completing several little circles to make one big, baroque, semi-circular swoop of the field, a one-man whirling waltzer.</strong> Attempt to avoid clich\u00e9s all you like, but just try watching him move without picking up a samba earworm. Speaking of resorting to stereotypes, up the other end of the field, the Italians are huddled around several severe gentlemen in trenchcoats, looking for all the world like they\u2019re striking an import-export agreement which won\u2019t necessarily involve passing through any of the major designated ports.</p> <h2>First half</h2> <p><strong>Handshakes between captains Giacinto Facchetti and Carlos Alberto, the latter winning the toss and insisting the teams switch direction. And with the field quickly swept of clingers-on, we\u2019re off!</strong> Boninsegna gets the ball rolling. It\u2019s not long before Italy lose the ball and Jairzinho is skittering down the right. Pel\u00e9 goes down looking for a free kick, but he\u2019s full of sauce.</p> <p><strong>2 min: </strong>Pel\u00e9\u2019s full of energy, too, and speedily exchanges passes with Tost\u00e3o down the inside-left channel. For a second it looks like he\u2019ll break clear, but Bertini is covering and passes back to the keeper. Italy waste no time in tearing down the right themselves, the ball eventually being shuttled inside to Riva, who unleashes a rising heatseeker towards goal. What a shot! Felix tips over magnificently. The corner is an easy one for the keeper. What a start, though.</p> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Bertini hacks down Pel\u00e9 as the latter chases after a sliderule Carlos Alberto pass down the right. What glorious hoodlummery. Free kick. G\u00e9rson looks to bend it, but slips as he takes, and his low left-to-right curler is easily gathered by Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Everaldo hares down the left and sends a daisycutter to the near post. Albertosi gathers, but looks to have carried the ball over the touchline for a corner. It\u2019s not given, though. This is a high-octane start, and Brazil are almost immediately coming back at Italy, down the middle at pace after Jairzinho picks up a loose Domenghini pass from the right wing. He\u2019s clattered to the floor on the edge of the D by Facchetti. Another free kick.</p> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 dummies. Rivelino blooters the set piece onto the roof. Haw.</p> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Mazzola exchanges passes with Riva to advance down the inside left, but his eventual shot is weak and wafts into the arms of Felix.</p> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Carlos Alberto floats a cross into the Italian area from the right. At the far post, Albertosi should let it fly out for a goal kick but panics and punches behind. He\u2019s not the only one not quite on his game; Rivelino, after that free kick, now hits a corner miles into the sky and straight out of play on the other side.</p> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Rivelino slips on the turf and skitters across it on his arse. An undignified climax to an undistinguished start.</p> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> A bit of space for Riva down the left, but with men in the middle he has a rush of blood and shoots speculatively from the corner of the box. That\u2019s not beating Felix from there.</p> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Italy have settled into this a little bit now. Domenghini tries to score from the best part of 40 yards while out on the touchline, some respect please for the love of god. The shot pings off poor Wilson Piazza\u2019s coupon and out for a corner on the left.</p> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Mazzola slides the corner back to Facchetti, who floats the ball into the box. It\u2019s punched clear by a jabbering Felix, but only to Mazzola, whose first-time shot is blocked and balloons out towards De Sisti, who is clattered by Pel\u00e9. Free kick, 35 yards out, just to the left of goal. Brazil line up a wall, but there\u2019s a laughably large gap in their defence to its right. Mazzola floats the ball over the head of the lurking Boninsegna, and right onto the forehead of the onrushing Riva, who really should score from a slight angle, 12 yards out. Instead his effort loops over the bar. That\u2019s an appalling miss, really, and nearly as bad as Brazil\u2019s defending.</p> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Clodoaldo misjudges a high pass down the right, allowing Domenghini to make good down the wing. He rolls the ball inside to Boninsegna, the Italians three on three. But with Riva to his left, he decides to tiptoe through two challenges on the edge of the box and his glory run is halted by Piazza, who tackles him with his big arse.</p> <p><strong>18 min: GOAL!!! Brazil 1-0 Italy</strong> Tost\u00e3o drops a shoulder down the left and whips a cross in towards Pel\u00e9, but it\u2019s headed back and out for a throw by the stooping Facchetti. The Italians do not heed the warning. Receiving Tost\u00e3o\u2019s throw, Rivelino leans back and loops a high cross into the box, Pel\u00e9 getting the jump on Burgnich and clattering a majestic header into the bottom right, Albertosi late to react. That\u2019s Brazil\u2019s 100th goal in World Cups. Not bad timing, eh? Pel\u00e9 is lifted into the air by Jairzinho\u2019s bearhug, and punches the sky three times. You\u2019ll see that celebration again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7dce70daa325bf087ee988e7195c9fb9fbfb715/0_25_5322_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9, right, leaps above Tarcisio Burgnich to head Brazil in front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b13be83f4a5942126434836d4b3ed33396d9c1c5/18_0_1386_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9 celebrates Brazil\u2019s opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Hilariously, and preposterously, Brazil make no effort whatsoever to regroup for the kick off, and are all buggering around deep in their own half when Italy get the ball moving again. The ball\u2019s flicked out to Domenghini, who powers down the wing, cuts inside, and hammers a low shot towards the bottom right, Felix doing well to claim. That was staggeringly inept.</p> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> G\u00e9rson sends a crossfield ball to the right for Carlos Alberto, who ten yards from the touchline and with the angle preposterous, decides to go for the spectacular. He achieves it: a spectacularly awful slice off the side of his boot straight behind and into the crowd. He has the chutzpah to look down and blame his footwear. At least there\u2019s plenty of time left in which to showcase better technique, Carlos.</p> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> After a period of sterile Brazilian possession, a cock-up. Everaldo passes back down the left wing to Piazza, who sidefoots inside to Brito. Brito attempts to flick a casual one back to the left for Clodoaldo, but Riva nips in to block the lazy pass and hare after it down the middle. Felix comes out of his box, wallops clear, and waves angrily at his defence. Don\u2019t. Do. That. Again. Or else!</p> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> It\u2019s raining, the sun\u2019s gone, it\u2019s humid. Bah. Domenghini embarks on a Power Run down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s upended by Jair, but the referee waves play on, perhaps thinking the Italian had slipped over on the greasy turf. Then Mazzola, from the left, lifts a diagonal ball towards Riva at the far post, but Piazza is ahead of the striker, rises to head, dummies, and lets the ball bounce out of play. Italy have finally woken up.</p> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Free kick to Brazil, 20 yards out on the left, level with the left-hand side of the area, after Bertini scythes through the back of Rivelino. The Italians line up a five-man wall. Rivelino shapes to have a shot, but sprints straight past the ball. Pel\u00e9 rushes in and chips a perfectly weighted ball after Rivelino. The five Italians spin and turn then crash to the floor like pissed-up circus performers. Rivelino, on the run, shapes to whip a cross into the middle, where G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho and Tost\u00e3o are lining up to belt home from six yards. But he hesitates for a fatal microsecond, allowing the ball to skid off the turf and out for a goal kick, despite a desperate late lunge. Such a clever pass from Pel\u00e9, though, threaded along a route to the left of the wall and the right of Rivelino, inviting the cross.</p> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Italy so nearly cleave Brazil in two. From the centre circle, Domenghini slides the ball forward to Riva, who with his back to goal 30 yards out plays a first-time flick onward to Mazzola, and gets clattered by Piazza for his trouble. The referee waves play on, as Mazzola is clear of the backtracking Tost\u00e3o and advances towards the area, but on the edge of the D, Brito slides in majestically. He\u2019s not letting that ball get past.</p> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Pel\u00e9 goes on a meander down the inside-right channel, and is upended by Burgnich. He rolls over on his side once, then executes two head-first roly-polies, all in one smooth Olympic-gymnast-standard movement, a technique that comes with a difficulty tariff of 6.0. Applause. The Italian is shown the yellow card, and doesn\u2019t seem to care very much. Brazil\u2019s trainer trots on with bucket and sponge to attend to Pel\u00e9, but is angrily told to chip off by the referee, who furiously flaps his hands in the dismissive style. Pel\u00e9 is still on the floor moaning, but there\u2019s naff all wrong with him, the big gurner.</p> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Rivelino\u2019s resulting free kick finds the top-left corner. Of the stand behind the goal. That\u2019s the worst free kick ever taken in a World Cup final, surely. Rivelino looks down at his wet boot, and the soft turf, but is fooling nobody.</p> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Mazzola sends a long, speculative ball towards the Brazilian box from the halfway line. Riva, his back to goal, is tugged back by Piazza on the edge of the area. Free kick to Italy, on the right-hand edge of the D.</p> <p><strong>30 min: </strong>Bertini knocks it left to Riva, who skelps it straight at the Brazilian wall, and makes a desperate claim for a handball penalty. No dice. The ball comes back to Bertini, who lifts a fairly aimless snapshot high and wide right.</p> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Italy are snapping away at the heels of the Brazilians. Boninsegna slides in on G\u00e9rson and offers him his hand by way of apology, but the Brazilian\u2019s not having it. Brazil look slightly shaken, though. Boninsegna turns Piazza 25 yards out then fizzes a low ball just right of goal. The not-always-dependable Felix had it covered all the way.</p> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> From the restart Felix reverts to type, throwing an awkward ball out wide to Carlos Alberto, who sees it balloon over his head for a throw to Italy. As the sun comes out, Mazzola takes up possession from the throw and slides the ball left to De Sisti, who draws three men before twinkletoeing the ball back inside to Mazzola. From a standing start, Mazzola turns on the burners and dances past three challenges, flicks a quick one-two off De Sisti to his left, then powers into the box and takes a shot from a tight angle. But Brito and G\u00e9rson have crowded round him, and the ball\u2019s blocked out for a corner. From the set piece, Felix, mopping up his own mess, sends a punch almost to the halfway line.</p> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Some space for Clodoaldo down the right. He whips a cross into the box and finds Pel\u00e9, eight yards out, but O Rei heads over, and he\u2019s offside anyway. The king\u2019s crown slips.</p> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> A mad scramble on the edge of the Italian area. Jairzinho bombs down the middle and attempts a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. On receiving the return, he\u2019s stopped mid-flight by Burgnich\u2019s sliding tackle, but still manages to nick the ball down the inside-left for Pel\u00e9, who immediately flicks one back into the middle for Tost\u00e3o. The forward breaks into the box before hitting a weak cross-cum-shot in the general direction of the left-hand corner and the onrushing Jairzinho. Italy hack clear.</p> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Rivelino drops a shoulder to glide past Bertini down the inside right. As he cuts inside, Bertini is so wrongfooted he inadvertently performs the splits across the skiddy turf. That might make a couple of bobbles on the pitch. Rivelino pokes an awful effort miles left of the target, and as high as a house to boot. He gets pelters from the bench. A full and frank exchange of views ensues. His shooting has been hilariously poor so far.</p> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Riva sends a weak daisycutter a couple of yards wide right. For all Italy\u2019s intricate build-up play, Felix hasn\u2019t had much to do.</p> <p><strong>37 min: FARCICAL GOAL!!! Brazil 1-1 Italy.</strong> Pel\u00e9 looks to turn Burgnich in the Italian area, but the defender\u2019s having none of it, banging an interception upfield with no little authority. Everaldo chases back down the Italian right flank to collect, turning the ball inside to Piazza, who floats a needlessly dangerous chip across his back line. It drops towards Brito, who has Riva nearby but still enough time to deal with the problem. He doesn\u2019t, though. He heads inside to Clodoaldo who, unaware Boninsegna is lurking, attempts an adventurous blind backflick out towards Piazza, still on the Brazil left. Boninsegna intercepts and, though never quite in control, barrels clear down the inside right. Brito is coming over to meet him from the middle, while Felix races rashly out of his box. Cue komik kutz on the edge of the D, and proof that Brazil really did learn nothing from all that fannying around on 23 minutes. Brito\u2019s sliding challenge, coming in towards Boninsegna from the left, is weak and mistimed, the ball clattering off his heel and into the middle. His useless contribution has also had the effect of taking Felix out of the game, the keeper having turned up to the melee a millisecond too late. Felix puts the brakes on and attempts to change direction, but he knows the game is up. Boninsegna scampers after the ball and, although Riva gets in the way with a view to nabbing the goal himself, wraps his left leg around his cheeky team-mate to hook the ball into the bottom right of the empty net. He races off with arms out wide before being smothered by Domenghini and Mazzola. Riva doesn\u2019t join in, the mardy get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e85853ffc8241bc38a0e9e1535618ad54aa77c91/0_359_5390_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Boninsegna, centre, hunts down the loose ball after the Brazil goalkeeper Felix\u2019s challenge, before equalising for Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Brazil try to respond immediately, Rivelino bursting down the left and winning a free kick, then swinging a dangerous-looking ball down the corridor of uncertainty before Albertosi punches clear.</p> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> The sun is shimmering now. Mazzola instigates a gorgeous sweeping Italian move from deep, jigging his way out of trouble near his own area down the left before clipping a ball out to Facchetti, who shuttles the ball up the flank to Boninsegna. Facing back down the pitch, he draws two Brazilian players and, with the full knowledge he\u2019s going to be cleaned out by Carlos Alberto, plays a reverse ball down the wing to Riva, who makes good for the box and wins a corner off Brito, the defender doing well to stop the striker taking a shot. Back upfield, Carlos Alberto and Boninsegna are both receiving treatment, the former having been clocked in the coupon upon clattering the latter. The pair respectfully apologise to each other like adults, proving that this game really can be beautiful even when the participants are wantonly fouling each other.</p> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Nothing comes of the corner, despite Mazzola\u2019s promptings. Brazil flood upfield, Rivelino threatening to break clear down the right. Now it\u2019s Pel\u00e9\u2019s turn to prompt, and he sets up the onrushing G\u00e9rson, who screws a poor effort wide left.</p> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Domenghini launches a low, rising shot straight at Felix, who nearly dives all around it, but eventually gathers midway through the pudding course.</p> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Rivelino is booked for a petulant backflick on Bertini, who has come from behind to whip the ball off his toe. Bertini holds his thigh. For a second, it looks like the referee is going to show the Brazilian a red \u2013 the card\u2019s in his hand, visible to all \u2013 but he ostentatiously flashes yellow to all four stands. But then lhe ets Rivelino see the red card, pointing to the bench as if to say: \u201cOne more like that, son, and you\u2019ll see this one too.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Brazil 1-1 Italy, though it probably should be Brazil 2-1 Italy!</strong> So how\u2019s this for a farcical end to the half? Despite Rivelino\u2019s booking for retaliation, the referee has awarded a free kick to Brazil for the original Bertini challenge. Very strange. From the left touchline, G\u00e9rson loops a high ball into the area. It drops over the head of an out-of-position Burgnich, who falls backwards as the ball lands at Pel\u00e9\u2019s feet, ten yards out, level with the far post and with only the keeper to beat. But instead of playing on, Pel\u00e9 throws his hands up in disgust. Why\u2019s he pausing?! It\u2019s half-time, that\u2019s why! The referee\u2019s blown his whistle early \u2013 45 minutes aren\u2019t quite up \u2013 and Pel\u00e9 is understandably beside himself with the rage! He still manages to convert, despite the red mist, flicking the ball into the bottom-left corner and clattering Cera, coming across to cover, on the shoe while he\u2019s at it. Cera gets right up in Pel\u00e9\u2019s grille to remonstrate, pointing at his instep, and Pel\u00e9\u2019s suddenly surrounded by a raging sea of blue shirts. Nobody\u2019s got a clue what\u2019s going on, until the referee, ball wedged under his armpit, strides through the melee and wanders off the pitch for a fag and a cup of tea.</p> <h2>Second half</h2> <p><strong>And we\u2019re off again! </strong>No changes, which is something of a surprise as Valcareggi was expected to continue with this <em>staffetta</em> malarkey, and replace Mazzola with Rivera at the break. Understandable, perhaps, because Mazzola had an excellent first half, but remember this policy saw Italy score four times in both quarters and semis, so it\u2019s a brave decision. Brazil set us in motion again.</p> <p><strong>46 min: </strong>Valcareggi\u2019s nearly vindicated from the off, as Mazzola picks the ball up deep and flicks the ball to Domenghini, who slides a long pass up the inside-left channel for Boninsegna. The forward shuttles it on immediately, into the path of Mazzola who has kept surging forward. Everaldo steps in to poke back to Felix, just as it looked like Mazzola would break into the box.</p> <p><strong>47 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is sent striding clear on the overlap. He fires a ball straight through the six-yard box. Pel\u00e9 slides in at the far post, but misses the ball and clatters his wrist on the post.</p> <p><strong>50 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson clips a high ball down the middle, into the Italian area. Pel\u00e9 stumbles as he tussles with Facchetti, then races off after the referee, miming a tug on his sleeve. The big man\u2019s bopping around with the heat on. It really wasn\u2019t much of a challenge.</p> <p><strong>52 min: </strong>Burgnich upends Pel\u00e9 in the roughhouse fashion, 30 yards out on the right. Rivelino takes what Hugh Johns on ITV calls a \u201cfast-bowler\u2019s run-up\u201d and batters a rising, swerving shot towards the right of goal. Albertosi parries it with strong arms, and Italy hack clear. Brazil come straight back at them. G\u00e9rson goes on a Power Jog down the inside right. His one-two with Tost\u00e3o on the edge of the box doesn\u2019t quite come off, but the ball loops towards Pel\u00e9, who is obstructed by Burgnich as the Italian attempts an overhead clearance. Indirect free kick! Or, as the caption has it: <em>tiro indirecto</em>!</p> <p><strong>53 min: </strong>On ITV, Bobby Moore thinks it should be a penalty for dangerous play. But t<em>iro indirecto</em> it is. Pel\u00e9 feathers the ball to the right for G\u00e9rson, who blooters hopelessly into the Italian wall. Insult is nearly added to injury as Facchetti breaks upfield along the left. The ball\u2019s funnelled inside and across the pitch to Domenghini, bombing in acres down the right. He hammers a shot towards the bottom-left corner. Everaldo comes across, sticks a boot out, and nearly deflects the thing into the bottom right. That was inches away. Domenghini waves both of his fists, then pumps them, in frustration. Rosato heads a weak effort over the bar from the resulting corner.</p> <p><strong>55 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson is looking increasingly dangerous, a testament to his daily multipack cheroot regime. Again he bursts down the inside right, again a one-two with Tost\u00e3o doesn\u2019t quite come off. He was very nearly clean through on goal there.</p> <p><strong>56 min: </strong>Rivelino twists on the ball through 360 degrees, takes a couple of steps down the inside right channel, drifts inside, then hoicks an effort over the bar. Italy go up the other end through the increasingly attack-minded Mazzola, who has a sortie down the inside-right flank himself and shovels a poor shot miles over from distance. This is good to-and-fro stuff, and not wholly predictable, even if Brazil are gaining a little momentum.</p> <p><strong>58 min: </strong>Rivelino begins a determined sashay towards the Italian box, drifting in from the left. He\u2019s scythed down by Bertini, who cuts his feet off with one cynical swish from behind. Pel\u00e9\u2019s free kick from a central position 25 yards out is a new Worst Of All Time, some going given Rivelino\u2019s attempt half an hour earlier, shooting off at a 45-degree angle towards the top-right corner of the stand behind the goal. A place-kicker in rugby would struggle to set a ball off along that flight. Ee, he\u2019s a poor lad.</p> <p><strong>59 min: RIVELINO HITS THE BAR! </strong>Another free kick for Brazil, just outside the area, after Facchetti linked arms to do-se-do Jairzinho out of a one-two with Tost\u00e3o. <em>Tiro indirecto!</em> From the edge of the D, G\u00e9rson knocks the ball to the right for Rivelino, who twangs the crossbar with a rising thunderer. Goal kick. Bobby Moore reckons it\u2019s the first time Rivelino has used his right foot all tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t use it more often!\u201d Especially the way he\u2019d been shooting up to this point.</p> <p><strong>61 min: </strong>Brazil are becoming the dominant force now. Pel\u00e9 looks to dance round Burgnich down the right and into the area, but he\u2019s barged off the ball and is appealing to the referee by waving his hands in the air as he falls backwards. <em>Tiro directo!</em> Rivelino batters it over the bar and is battered himself by Riva as he\u2019s taking it. Another <em>tiro directo!</em> Riva looks astonished and disgusted at the same time, an Italian speciality. Rivelino skelps the second effort into the wall, a trick G\u00e9rson repeats with the loose ball.</p> <p><strong>63 min: </strong>An increasingly rare sojourn upfield for Italy as Boninsegna finds space down the left and loops a cross to the far post for Riva, who bangs a header into Everaldo\u2019s back from a tight angle, a couple of yards out. The corner\u2019s met by Mazzola, whose header sails along a gentle parabola towards Felix. The keeper skips into the air in the style of a morris dancer after one mead too many, and punches a feeble effort a couple of yards to his right. Fortunately Carlos Alberto is on hand to sweep up. \u201cWhat an incredible man to have behind you if you\u2019re a defender in this brilliant Brazilian side,\u201d notes a tinder-dry Hugh Johns.</p> <p><strong>65 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the middle of the park. He\u2019s been running the show since half time, only moving upfield since the restart, after which the Italians have had no time to formulate one of their trademark defensive lockdowns. Clever G\u00e9rson. Clever Brazil. He sets a move in motion down the right, Clodoaldo feeding Carlos Alberto, who whips a cross towards Tost\u00e3o at the far post. The forward can\u2019t control his header, which screws well wide left.</p> <p><strong>66 min: THIS HAS BEEN COMING!!! Brazil 2-1 Italy. </strong>G\u00e9rson has the run of the park all right. His beautiful reverse ball sets Everaldo on a probe down the inside left. Jairzinho takes up possession and makes for the edge of the D. He\u2019s tracked by Facchetti, who sticks a toe in. The ball breaks to G\u00e9rson, who has been loitering in the middle. He takes two little taps to the left, before twisting and walloping a mid-height cross-shot into the right-hand side of the net. Boninsegna slid in with a tackle, while Albertosi flung himself across goal, but neither made it in time. G\u00e9rson races off with arms aloft, a cheesy grin across his boat. Reserve keeper Ado leads a delegation off the bench to celebrate the achievement. Brazil are 24 minutes away from becoming world football\u2019s first three-time champions!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e9e69a16fdc0e2269863c37955432dfcbb03b42/0_286_2080_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rivelino (11) embraces goalscorer G\u00e9rson celebrate after Brazil\u2019s second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PLP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>67 min: </strong>Straight from kick off, Domenghini is brought down by Everaldo along the right touchline, 12 yards from the byline. The Italian gets up and attempts to beat Felix at his near post with an outrageous attempt. The effort\u2019s outrageous all right, sliced straight out of play, ten yards to the right of goal. He walks back upfield with his head hung low, abjectly defeated and humiliated. Pel\u00e9\u2019s reign as taker of Worst Free Kick Of All Time has lasted all of nine minutes.</p> <p><strong>68 min: </strong>The stunning G\u00e9rson eats up most of the pitch as he scampers down the inside right. He rolls a pass inside to Tost\u00e3o, who attempts to turn Facchetti but fails and executes a rather embarrassing dive instead. Italy move upfield through Domenghini, who is checked by Pel\u00e9. He responds by shoving the Brazilian in the chest. Pel\u00e9 falls backwards like he\u2019s catching a cannonball, then rather absurdly grabs his left shin as he hits the ground. The ref clearly considers this a whole load of nonsense, and ostentatiously refuses to allow Pel\u00e9 to receive any treatment, ordering the bald guy with the bucket and sponge back off the field for the second time. And just like before, Pel\u00e9\u2019s soon back on his feet again. Good old ref.</p> <p><strong>69 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson has been brilliant since the restart, having kept his cards close to his chest for so long, though whether he\u2019s within his rights to attempt to score from 40 yards now is a moot point.</p> <p><strong>70 min: </strong>Domenghini leaves a leg in as Pel\u00e9 glides past. Pel\u00e9 flips himself miles into the air, a triple pike with salchow and a difficulty tariff of 34. This is gloriously petulant behaviour all round. The referee can\u2019t be bothered with any of it, and simply gestures that they\u2019re to get up and stop behaving like a couple of spoilt brats.</p> <p><strong>71 min: SURELY THE CLINCHER!!! Brazil 3-1 Italy. </strong>From the resulting free kick, just to the left of the centre circle, G\u00e9rson left-foot-wands a raking crossfield ball into the area towards Pel\u00e9, level with the right-hand post. Burgnich is completely lost. And beaten. He turns around to see Pel\u00e9 rise above him. Pel\u00e9 plants a header down and across the face of the six-yard box. Jairzinho races in and thighs the ball into the bottom-left corner, evading the desperate lunges of Cera and Albertosi. He tries to finish with a flourish, but his wild hoof becomes a fresh-air swipe, and the ball makes its own way in, almost apologetically. That\u2019s a goal in every game of the finals for the Botafogo striker, who races off in the arms-aloft G\u00e9rsonian style, before sinking to his knees in prayer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9566c004e9186709fc47242e525fe7c3dc2f5561/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho celebrates after walking the ball into the net for his side\u2019s third goal, making him the first player to score a goal in every game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolls Press/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2345620fc4bc5e0c7434d9182139b79f11304fe/0_0_4159_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jairzinho slides on to his knees as his team-mates rush to join him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>72 min: </strong>To illustrate the ragged mental state of the normally impervious Italians, as they kick off, six of them are loitering around the centre spot, like folk waiting for the bus home. Perhaps they want to get on the bus home. They look broken. This has been a G\u00e9rson masterclass. He attempts to replicate his goal by launching another left-footed stinger from the edge of the area, but it\u2019s straight at Albertosi.</p> <p><strong>74 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson walks through the centre circle with the ball at his feet. We\u2019ve got to the stage where nobody even bothers to challenge him.</p> <p><strong>75 min: </strong>Rivelino is checked by De Sisti on the left-hand edge of the area. Free kick. Before it can be taken, a limping Bertini falls in the centre circle and is replaced by Juliano, the first substitution in any World Cup final. G\u00e9rson taps the free kick to the right for Pel\u00e9 to embarrass himself with a witless blooter that\u2019s high and miles wide right.</p> <p><strong>76 min: </strong>Mazzola, so quiet this half, turns on the burners down the inside left, and attempts a one-two on the edge of the area with Riva, but the striker can\u2019t control. Mazzola\u2019s hands rise towards his temples in impotent frustration, though his irritation surely isn\u2019t anything on that of Rivera, still tethered to the bench.</p> <p><strong>78 min: </strong>G\u00e9rson slides Rivelino clear into the left-hand side of the area. He takes a first-time hack at the ball, screwing it well left of the target.</p> <p><strong>79 min: </strong>Mazzola cuts in from the right and feeds Boninsegna, who turns and looks for the bottom left from the edge of the D. It\u2019s accurate, but without power. Felix saves comfortably, which is a phrase for the ages. Brazil break upfield. Tost\u00e3o pokes Pel\u00e9 clear into the area. Pel\u00e9 should score, but his sidefoot towards the right-hand side of the net is smothered brilliantly by the desperate Albertosi. The flag\u2019s up, so none of this counts, a real shame for the keeper, who\u2019d just won a personal showdown with the best player in the world.</p> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>The last chance for Italy to get back into this match, perhaps, is squandered. Juliano, from a position down the inside right, scoops a clever pass forward towards Mazzola, who is screaming for the ball in space, 25 yards from goal in the centre. He turns, and has time to shoot, but takes a second too long and is forced to drift to the right and clip a cross into the mix instead. There\u2019s a brief stramash involving Riva and Boninsegna, the latter eventually thrashing a wild effort miles over from the left-hand side of the box, but by then the Brazilians were swarming around and the door of opportunity which had opened momentarily for Mazzola had long been slammed shut.</p> <p><strong>83 min: </strong>A few passes in the Brazilian half for Italy, but Riva and Boninsegna are far too ponderous. Brazil show them how it\u2019s done, Everaldo springing forward on a no-nonsense run and nearly getting in a shot on goal from a tight angle down the left. He wins a corner, planting his studs into the keeper\u2019s nut as he does so.</p> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> As Albertosi receives a wet sponge to the head, Boninsegna is replaced by Rivera. So much for the half-time <em>staffetta</em>.</p> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Rivera gets his first meaningful touch, 25 yards from goal. He drops a shoulder past G\u00e9rson, but Everaldo is quickly across to get a foot in. Six minutes for the European Player of the Year with his side two down, what chance does he have?</p> <p><strong>86 min: THE ICING ON THE CAKE, THE BOW ON THE BOX, THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT! Brazil 4-1 Italy.</strong> What a thing of beauty this is, nothing short of a masterclass, football\u2019s pinnacle finally reached, Brazil planting the flag. The Italian substitute Juliano hares down the right, but Tost\u00e3o takes the ball off him like candy from a baby suffering from heat exhaustion and altitude sickness despite only being in the pram for 11 minutes. Tost\u00e3o dispatches the ball back to Brito, who rolls it forward to Clodoaldo. The ball\u2019s clipped in a short-range triangle, first Pel\u00e9, then G\u00e9rson, then back to Clodoaldo \u2013 cue TV caption \u2019<strong>41</strong> - who drops and raises his shoulders like a laughing policeman, tying Rivera, Domenghini, De Sisti and Juliano up in knots. He strokes the ball wide left to Rivelino who, inside his own half, curls a pinpoint pass down the line to Jairzinho. Just ahead of the box, the striker cuts inside past Italian captain Facchetti, then clips the ball across Cera to Pel\u00e9, facing goal in front of the D. Burgnich closes him down, but Tost\u00e3o \u2013 who\u2019s made it all the way upfield after starting the move and is now behind Burgnich, also facing Pel\u00e9 \u2013 gives the King the eyebrows to the Brazilian right. Pel\u00e9 takes the hint and rolls a perfect ball out wide; it sits up, allowing Carlos Alberto to evade the despairing lunge of Rosato, who has fruitlessly attempted to come across and block, and skelp it into the bottom corner past Albertosi. Only two outfield Brazilians were not involved in that move \u2013 Everaldo and Piazza. With a beautiful symmetry, only two Italians, Mazzola and Riva, were completely out of the picture and can therefore wash their hands of it. God almighty, what a move, what a strike, what a final statement to make in a World Cup!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a229511dae33f7c415e50156f5a889b0809583/99_0_2801_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto, right, scores Brazil\u2019s fourth goal at the end of a wonderful team move.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7754866fdcb82fb8dd0118a9eb1a884b235da640/0_141_2848_1708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Alberto celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Alberto celebrates his strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ce6d3597640b78f88020973ed205a9a7171d98/0_413_2320_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian players\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazilian players celebrate after the goal which finished Italy off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>87 min: </strong>As the Brazilians cavort behind Italy\u2019s goal, the Mexican television caption \u2013 <strong>ANOTADOR! SCORER! *4 CARLOS ALBERTO</strong> \u2013 washes out the entire picture. It\u2019s almost as though we\u2019ve reached the end of the reel, this is the end, we can go no further, Brazil have finished off football as well as Italy. Where else can the story be taken from there?</p> <p><strong>88 min: </strong>Carlos Alberto is surrounded by photographers \u2013 on the pitch! Finally they bugger off and we restart. Rivera has a resigned shot which Felix swallows up without fuss. Pel\u00e9 sends another ball goalwards from the halfway line, but this time it\u2019s a gentle backpass. Rivelino goes on a determined run down the inside-left channel and is upended when he makes the box by Juliano. If this was 0-0, that\u2019d be a penalty, but the referee decides to show Italy some mercy. Brazil deserve to win, and have been so good during the second half that the three-goal margin doesn\u2019t particularly flatter them. And yet this excellent Italian side doesn\u2019t deserve to be spanked in the biggest match of all by a margin of four.</p> <p><strong>90 min: </strong>There\u2019s been plenty of bloody awful shooting in this match, and perhaps the most egregious hack has been saved for last, a Domenghini shank which nestles in row Z, but only after rebounding from the seats behind. The crowd refuse to give the souvenir back. Time\u2019s up, but the referee refuses to blow until a ball\u2019s on the pitch. This is farcical. Eventually a new orb is presented to him. He hands it to Rivelino to give to Felix.</p> <p><strong>90 min +2: </strong>This is bedlam. Now the original ball has been dispatched back onto the field of play! One fan pops out of the stand and goes on a speedy skitter down the Brazilian right, which is better than some of the Italians have managed. Felix restarts the game and Rivera nearly takes his ankles out with a petulant lunge. The ball\u2019s hoicked upfield, in the general environs of another encroaching punter who\u2019s sporting a sombrero and poncho. \u00a1Arriba! At which point referee Rudi Glockner raises both arms ...</p> <p><strong>IT\u2019S OVER!!! BRAZIL ARE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD FOR THE THIRD TIME, AND WILL GET TO KEEP THE JULES RIMET TROPHY!!! Brazil 4-1 Italy. </strong>Within seconds of the final whistle, Pel\u00e9 is mobbed. Hundreds of fans are on the field. Firecrackers crack their fire. Pel\u00e9 is lifted shoulder high.

  "<p>The Irish food industry on both sides of the border in Ireland will be devastated if Brexit requires common external tariffs between Ireland and the UK, former taoiseachsJohn Bruton and Bertie Ahern have warned.</p> <p>They said they expected the UK\u2019s departure from the customs union would entail massive bureaucracy, higher costs and the re-imposition of customs controls on the border. </p> <p>The two former Irish prime ministers, who were giving evidence to a House of Lords select committee inquiry into the impact of Brexit on Anglo-Irish relations, said they did not believe EU laws on the single market gave EU negotiators a great deal of latitude on tariffs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/ireland-ideal-home-european-banking-regulator-brexit-dublin\">Ireland is 'ideal home' for European banking regulator after Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ahern, the prime minister from 1997 to 2008, said he did not know of a single person in Ireland who welcomed Brexit and highlighted how the imposition of an external trade tariff could cripple the food industry and undermine a 40-year trend towards greater economic integration between the UK and Ireland. \u201cThe complexity of this is a nightmare and we might as well as accept that fact,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Bruton, who was prime minister from 1994 to 1997, said new customs arrangements were likely to be \u201ca smuggler\u2019s charter\u201d as people tried to take advantage of lower or higher tariffs on either side of the border. He warned: \u201cUncertainty is the enemy of commerce and legal uncertainty is even more the enemy of commerce.\u201d</p> <p>The relationship between the British and Irish food processing industries was critical since it was so interconnected, Bruton said, pointing out that 30% of the milk produced in the north was processed south of the border while 40% of the chicken produced in the south was processed north of the border.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe supply chain of the food industry is exceptionally interconnected and, if we get into a situation where the common external tariff has to be imposed, that will require us to introduce customs controls of some kind to collect that tariff and, on the UK side of the border, people would have to certify the origins of the produce.\u201d</p> <p>Ahern pointed out that the Tesco supermarket chain took 60% of its cheese and 84% of its chicken from Ireland. The two-way trade of milk is worth \u00a31.5bn per year. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThe inter-relationships are enormous. Tariffs could cripple a huge amount of the food industry; the bureaucracy would be enormous \u2013 the amount of people involved, the add-on costs of running that kind of system. My concern is people would start going elsewhere for markets and it would really work totally against the entire industry and that would be a huge loss. </p> <p>\u201cGroups like the Kerry Group are 40 years in existence and they have built enormous connections between Ireland and the UK generally. To set up a whole bureaucratic system with high tariffs would cripple the industry and that would be devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Bruton added that \u201ca lot of busy lawyers\u201d were going to make money when different standards on the production of goods and services started to apply on either side of the border. Other areas of difficulty he highlighted included Ireland\u2019s integrated electricity market, fisheries policy, the EU open skies programme, cross-border university research and the disruption posed to EU institutions based in the UK.</p> <p>Ahern rejected the idea that the Irish border could act as the border for the whole of the UK to prevent EU citizens making their way into the UK over the Northern Ireland border. The two men suggested landlords and employers might have to undertake checks at the behest of the UK government to ensure EU citizens had not entered the UK illegally through Ireland.</p> <p> Ahern said it would be a huge concern for the Irish peace process if a border was established with customs posts. \u201cIt would have been easier if more thought had been given to this before the referendum had been initiated and during the referendum campaign itself,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Bruton warned that the UK debate on its Brexit negotiations might appeal to the people of Peterborough and Sunderland, but urged UK ministers to focus on what might be good for the whole of the UK. </p> <p>The committee also heard from Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, the Conservative former trade minister, who expressed fears that the economic and political ramifications of Brexit could be more serious for Ireland than for Scotland, adding that he did not believe there was any serious understanding of the scale of the problem in either France or Germany.</p> <p>In a sign of the potential tensions between Ireland and the UK, the Irish government announced it would bid to host the European Banking Authority which, it said, would have to leave its London location after Brexit.</p>",

The appeals court disagreed, potentially opening the way for other species to be protected due to long-range climate forecasts. </p> <p>\u201cThe service need not wait until a species\u2019 habitat is destroyed to determine that habitat loss may facilitate extinction,\u201d <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/10/24/14-35806.pdf\">the judges\u2019 ruling states</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that climate projections for 2050 through 2100 may be volatile does not deprive those projections of value in the rule making process.

  "<p>We have become used to 2016 lurching between the extremes of ridiculousness and despair, so it should come as no surprise that the conclusion to draw from the last two weeks is that snack foods are our saviours. Serious stories now go hand in hand with total nonsense: this year is an episode of The West Wing co-written by Adam Sandler \u2013 and far from being the endangering foodstuffs we have been conditioned to believe, it turns out snacks may be our only hope.</p> <p>Last week saw Gary Lineker speak out passionately against the media coverage of refugees, which is perhaps surprising given that, outside of football, the most notable thing Gary Lineker has spoken out in favour of is crisps. He was roundly attacked; the Sun demanded that he be sacked for failing to be impartial, given that he is a BBC host. But this was on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/sack-gary-lineker-tweet-the-sun-culture\">Twitter feed</a>. He didn\u2019t open Match of the Day coverage by saying \u201cWhat a week in the Premier League! We\u2019ve got all the goals coming up, but firstly, isn\u2019t it time we started forcing all British people to house five refugees? Let\u2019s start with the Royal Family. That\u2019s right, I think we should open up the gates of Buckingham Palace and fill every room with a refugee. And now, Stoke v West Ham\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\">the silver-haired spud salesman has grasped something that his critics have not</a>. The Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express and Sun joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-dental-tests-verify-age-david-davies\">MP David Davies in questioning the precise age of refugees</a> arriving in the UK. It is dehumanising. What\u2019s worse is that How-Old.net, the age recognition software being used by the Mail to judge child migrants, was knocked out by Microsoft developers as a \u201cfun app\u201d. One that was, the company was forced to declare, \u201cnot intended to be used as a definitive assessment of age\u201d. I hope these people don\u2019t discover snapchat filters any time soon or they might lose their minds altogether. We\u2019ll be treated to headlines like \u201cSOME REFUGEES HAVE THE ABILITY TO SWAP FACES, BECOME DOGS AND VOMIT RAINBOWS\u201d.</p> <p>To illustrate the idiocy, Nick Clegg\u2019s former press officer Ben Rathe put David Davies\u2019s face into the app and calculated his age at 58. It must have been a blow, given Davies is 46. Based on the logic bouncing from parliament to the press, we should now be testing all MP\u2019s ages by examining their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/david-davies-mp-have-a-look-at-my-teeth-whats-the-problem\">dental records</a> and speculating about why they might be lying. No doubt there will be some on the \u201cloony left\u201d who will say that MPs have \u201chad hard lives and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been through\u201d; honestly, it\u2019s political correctness gone mad.</p> <p>When refugees are at a distance it\u2019s easy to be compassionate. Even Red Top Troll King himself, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2034538/luvvies-always-have-a-voice-but-who-on-tv-dares-speak-up-for-the-rest-of-us/\">Kelvin MacKenzie</a>, admitted that the image from Aleppo of injured five-year-old Omran Daqneesh haunted him. To the extent that he commissioned a painting of Omran by the artist Jolyon Madden. We\u2019ve all been there \u2013 you find something moving, you commission a painting. I know one wall of my living room is taken up by a mural of the end of Toy Story 3. Weird paintings aside, as soon as it comes to offering sanctuary for refugees, basic decency is lost. And that\u2019s all Lineker was calling for: turning abstract compassion for war victims into a practical response. Sections of our press have been embarrassed by the spokesman for crisps.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t, however, the first instance of the public face of food making more sense than anyone else on a serious issue. Last month Donald Trump\u2019s son \u2013 Donald Trump Jr \u2013 found himself at the centre of a snack-based storm. (The fact that he is called Donald Trump Jr is of no surprise given his father\u2019s sense of self-worth. I think Jr should just count himself lucky that he\u2019s not called \u201cMini-Me\u201d or \u201cMy Balls Made This\u201d.)</p> <p>Trump Jr proved himself to be something of a chip off the old block when he claimed refugees might be potential Isis recruits, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">\u201cpoisoned Skittles in a bowl\u201d</a>. Thus forcing a spokesperson for Skittles to issue the following statement: \u201cSkittles are candy. Refugees are People. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s an appropriate analogy\u201d.</p> <p>Then his father made the same sweet mistake. In his now notorious conversation with Billy Bush, Trump said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-arianne-zucker-sexual-assault-groping\">in reference to actress Arianne Zucker</a>, \u201cI\u2019ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her\u201d suggesting the Don is more concerned about his breath than being thought of as a sex pest. The minty pervert was quickly denounced by the company, which made it clear: \u201cTic Tac respects all women. We find the recent statements and behaviour completely inappropriate and unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>And so it seems that the only people you can trust with serious political issues are spokespeople for snacks. I don\u2019t think we should stop here either. Based on recent events, I think representatives on snacks should be consulted on all major world news. What does the Milkybar Kid think we should do about Syria? Is the Fox\u2019s Glacier Mints polar bear worried about climate change and its impact on his natural habitat? And will someone, for the love of Freddo the Cadbury frog, please find out if Yellow and Red, the talking M&amp;M\u2019s from the cinema, favour a hard Brexit?</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.nishkumar.co.uk/\">Nish Kumar</a> is on tour in the UK now </em></p>",

I felt really anxious and I knew I was in for a long night of no sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Later, in a victim impact statement, she said: \u201cThe fact that I do not know his intentions worries me. Why would someone attend my home address in the dark to sit and watch from the other side of the road?</p> <p> \u201cI felt the same way on this occasion as I did back in 2008 when Howard kept leaving things outside my address and knocking on my door wanting to speak to me.</p> <p> \u201cI am still on edge now. If I see a car or a person walking past that I do not know \u2026 my mind starts racing as to what could be going on.</p> <p> \u201cWhat worries me the most is that I believe Howard to be unpredictable. What could he do next? I am constantly thinking about the ifs and buts, as I do not know what he is capable of or what he may decide to do next to me or my family.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI understand that he has to be released at some point. I am concerned he will come back and start terrorising me. Or if he can\u2019t get at me, will he start terrorising my lads?</p> <p> \u201cI really feel he should be tagged so his movements can be monitored, and the safety of my family can be ensured.</p> <p> \u201cI just wish he would leave me alone so I can get on with my life. I have had enough to worry about and just want to enjoy my family life.\u201d</p> <p>She first became aware of her stalker in 2008 when he called at her home and bombarded her with messages and a Christmas card adorned with love hearts.</p> <p>Later, after being given a police warning about his behaviour, Wilson sent her a series of letters posted from different parts of the country.</p> <p>The campaign ended with a card sent from Portsmouth in which he wrote: \u201cHa ha ha, you can\u2019t catch me.\u201d</p> <p>Fergus, who now runs a charity in her son\u2019s name, thought she had heard the last of Wilson until he appeared at her home late at night on the August bank holiday Monday.</p> <p> The James Bulger Memorial Trust supports young people who are disadvantaged by being victims of crime, hatred or bullying.</p>",

It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year.</p> <p>If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities.

  "<ul> <li><em>Warning: this article contains some spoilers.</em><br></li> </ul> <h2>Hated in the Nation</h2> <p>Hated in the Nation is Black Mirror\u2019s excursion into public shame: it takes a series of targets who have brought disapprobation upon themselves. One is a columnist who slates a disabled person; another, an X Factor style judge who scorns a nine-year-old; a protestor who pretends to urinate on a war memorial; a politician so closely modelled on George Osborne that it made me feel nostalgic for a pre-Brexit age, when he was the summit of Tory obnoxiousness. They all find themselves in the eye of a Twitter storm, only this time it\u2019s for real \u2013 the anger doesn\u2019t crescendo then vanish. Instead, it culminates in violence so agonising that a person would slash her own throat with a broken bottle of Merlot to hasten it.</p> <p>There is a poignant description at one point of what it feels like to be in the eye of such a storm: \u201cIt was like having a whole weather system turn against me. If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness.\u201d It\u2019s a morality tale. If you want to hate, audibly, you must accept that hatred causes pain. Having done so, you yourself are as despicable as the person you despise. It\u2019s a simple and symmetrical world, one which sees the age before social media as prelapsarian, and yearns for us all to realise so we can return to a better time.</p> <p> When you\u2019re actually in a social media storm, you amplify the porousness between the virtual and the real. I\u2019ve been in two, once when I failed to properly respect breast milk as liquid gold, another time when I defended protesters who spat at a Conservative party conference (what I actually said was \u2026 oh never mind). In both cases, people online were printing public appearances I was planning to make, and telling others to throw eggs at me; someone published the name of my children\u2019s school and told people to go spit at them. It was the wrong school, but the point stood: my children had come into play. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9e8c1bc96bb71f6114d740f12ebc5b0828aba1/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If there\u2019s a million people talking about how they despise you, it\u2019s like a mental illness\u2019 \u2026 Hated in the Nation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever I described these events, I always underlined the threats at their most extreme, even though I knew this confected rage would never result in anything. I exaggerated the sabre-rattling, to bring to life how unpleasant the experience was. So we were all colluding \u2013 they were pretending their violence and I was pretending to believe in it \u2013 because without the backstop of action, they were just hysterics in their underpants and I was oversensitive. </p> <p>This is the fascinating space of modern shame: precisely, that it has no consequence, that the intensity of its spleen is a function of its meaninglessness, that the overstatement is partly driven by a suffocating sense of inauthenticity. It is to a baying mob what clicktivism is to activism; you can\u2019t persuade anyone you\u2019re serious unless you actually turn up. Hated in the Nation went to the least interesting place, where sofa hate transmutes by a <em>deus ex technica</em> into reality. It would have been more telling to explore the intensity generated by its impotence.</p> <p><em>Zoe Williams</em></p> <h2>Men Against Fire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47037b12061924149988fb54840bf87397b9376e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47037b12061924149988fb54840bf87397b9376e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men Against Fire Season 3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The soldiers\u2019 language very obviously evokes the arguments used against refugees in the real world \u2026Men Against Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see them as human,\u201d an army officer says of a group of fugitives, shortly before her subordinates kill several. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take them out if humankind is going to carry on in this world.\u201d</p> <p>If it had been made 10 years ago, Men Against Fire could have been a metaphor for the way western soldiers dehumanised and alienated local communities during the Iraqi and Afghan invasions. But in 2016, it feels more like an examination of contemporary discourse on refugees and migrants, and of how governments and the media alike use propaganda to turn the public against foreigners.</p> <p>Men Against Fire centres on a squad of American troops tasked with exterminating several hundred outlaws hiding in what seems to be the Dutch countryside. To dehumanise their prey, the soldiers uniformly refer to them as \u201croaches\u201d, and describe individual roaches as \u201cit\u201d, rather than her or him. And to ensure they never develop any fleeting sympathy for the enemy, the soldiers are fitted with special brain implants. On first impression, the setup seems far-fetched. But it ends up feeling uncannily close to home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2720e7f8cd7bbdda215257be08d166fe520ed14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2720e7f8cd7bbdda215257be08d166fe520ed14/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feels like deja vu \u2026 Men Against Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feels like deja vu \u2026 Men Against Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Maidment/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The soldiers\u2019 language very obviously evokes the arguments used against refugees in the real world. \u201cFor every roach you save today, you condemn god-knows-how-many to misery tomorrow,\u201d says the officer, in what to me felt like deja vu. In Hungary last month, ahead of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/hungarian-referendum-slam-door-migrants-new-era-europe\">referendum on refugee policy</a>, I listened to politicians telling villagers that if you let in one refugee today, there will be thousands tomorrow. You also hear similar arguments from western politicians about rescue missions in the Mediterranean: if you start saving people, Home Office ministers have argued, you\u2019ll only attract more of them. Even the word \u201croach\u201d mimics the vocabulary used by Katie Hopkins in the Sun.</p> <p>To some, the idea of hunting migrants might seem too unlikely a metaphor. But we already have vigilantes hunting people on the Bulgarian border. During the Hungarian referendum, one campaigner suggested shooting migrants arriving from Serbia. And once people realise that fences and walls don\u2019t stop migration, I am sure there will be more mainstream calls for even more violent responses.</p> <p>Brain implants certainly sound beyond the realms of current possibility. Then again, perhaps our empathy has already been subliminally suppressed by other means. <a href=\"http://budapestbeacon.com/featured-articles/we-must-stop-brussels-referendum-booklet-warns-hungarians/38777\">In Hungary, the government\u2019s recent anti-refugee ad campaign was the largest in the country\u2019s history</a>.

How many people would really, given the chance, play an interactive horror experience delivered via a cybernetic implant that has to be shot into your neck \u2013 an implant that will hack your brain, discover your deepest fears and project them in front of you as part of an immersive augmented reality nightmare? That seems like a very niche audience. But then, five years ago, who would have thought 500 million people would download <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pokemon-go\">a game</a> that involved chasing imaginary creatures down a high street before trapping them in an imaginary ball? Charlie Brooker has always taken our consumer technology obsessions to the very edges of twisted fantasy \u2013 and we usually catch up in the end. </p> <p>In Playtest, then, American dudebro Cooper Redfield sets off to travel the world, a non-stop selfie tour through India, Thailand and Italy, before he crashes down in London, bored and alone. Straight after hooking up with tech journalist Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen) on a Tinder-like dating app, he finds his credit cards have been cancelled (coincidence? Hmm) and needs to make money fast \u2013 when she spots a job ad asking for volunteers to test a new video game. The next thing we know he\u2019s being whisked to the development studio in a beautiful manor house. It turns out this is the home of visionary game developer Shou Saito (clearly modelled on Metal Gear creator <a href=\"http://www.universityherald.com/articles/41750/20160926/hideo-kojima-slams-metal-gear-survive-zombies-game-development-gameplay-demo-vid-gets-22-856-dislikes-fans-agree.htm\">Hideo Kojima</a>), who is famed for his dark horror adventures. He\u2019s got a new project on the go \u2013 the aforementioned AR nightmare-fest. Desperate for cash, and clearly not too bright, Cooper agrees to be a guinea pig, and Saito\u2019s assistant Katie injects the AR device into his spine. She explains that he\u2019ll begin to see things that aren\u2019t really there \u2013 computer generated figures and objects that look real, but can\u2019t touch or hurt him. Sure, whatever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charlie-brooker-someone-threatened-to-smuggle-a-rifle-through-customs-and-kill-me\">Charlie Brooker: 'Someone threatened to smuggle a rifle through customs and kill me'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For extra fun, he\u2019s taken to a nearby hunting lodge. Naturally, he begins to experience subtle moments of dread: a painting of the mansion on the wall suddenly has a light showing in an upstairs window, then a figure. A spider runs across the floor, and Cooper recoils. The system is probing his fears. From this point, things get more disturbing: as the AI mines his mind\u2019s darkest recesses, we discover that Cooper\u2019s dad recently died from early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and his father\u2019s gradual loss of cognitive functions is what really terrifies our hero. </p> <p>It is, at times, genuinely creepy, especially as Cooper\u2019s laddish confidence disintegrates as his computer-rendered terrors slowly crush his resolve. It\u2019s also a rich tapestry of video game in-jokes. Resident Evil is ever-present: Cooper\u2019s surname is Redfield, a reference to the siblings Chris and Claire Redfield from the series. Plus, the fact that the whole thing is a human experiment in a hunting lodge recalls the mansion laboratory setting of the original Resident Evil. The Silent Hill games are here too, in the emphasis on hallucination and psychological collapse, and when Katie yells \u201c<em>would you kindly</em> open that door\u201d to Cooper, she\u2019s alluding to the dark adventure Bioshock. It\u2019s a compelling meta-narrative on gaming conventions and experiences.</p> <p>But the target is unfocused. Is it AR technology that we are to fear? The pseudo-visionaries that peddle invasive technologies as brave new worlds? Or the way social media encourages a narcissistic fixation with our own personalities? Maybe it\u2019s all of these. But as a cautionary tale, Playtest mostly operates like the torture porn series Hostel: dumb young dudes do stupid stuff for fun and money, which they should have thought through more carefully first.</p> <p><em>Keith Stuart, the Guardian\u2019s Games Editor</em></p> <h2>Nosedive</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b33a24a8b3a79471319c8779d2e05117bcad451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b33a24a8b3a79471319c8779d2e05117bcad451/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bubble of bullshit that so closely resembles our own world \u2026 Nosedive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bubble of bullshit that so closely resembles our own world \u2026 Nosedive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dettmann/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of all the episodes of this digital dystopia, Nosedive is the most analogous with our own world (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charlie-brooker-someone-threatened-to-smuggle-a-rifle-through-customs-and-kill-me\">David Cameron and pigs aside</a>). Over the course of watching, I was interrupted on my iPhone by a Tinder match. Afterwards, I checked Instagram, and beforehand I\u2019d turned on airplane mode to avoid constant Twitter notifications.</p> <p>Nosedive charts the attempts of Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s Lacie to improve her social media ranking in order to live in an exclusive, hip apartment community. Except that social media rankings here become IRL rankings, too: a sort of caste, or class, system. It\u2019s not a huge jump to think how social media could assist in the injustices of our existing hierarchies \u2013 some people here are downrated just because their ratings are already low.</p> <p>The ranking system most resembles Instagram, with a little help from augmented reality contact lenses. But the real-world impact of one\u2019s star rating most closely resembles Uber, for which drivers can have their work terminated if their rating drops below 4.6. The sort of pleading seen here for favourable feedback feels all too common from an Uber driver swivelling around at the end of a trip.</p> <p>Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/22/joe-wright-film-director\">Joe Wright</a>\u2019s universe is all pastel shades, to ram home the sycophancy and saccharine nature of so much yoga-posing and so many uneaten cupcakes overlaid with so many Amaro filters. And details are perfectly rendered: Lacie snaps a photo of a latte and describes it online as \u201cHeaven! x\u201d before she even tries it, then grimaces when it touches her lips. The world drawn here is a bubble of bullshit, yet so closely resembles our own.</p> <p>It\u2019s beautifully, dryly observed. A social media reputation consultant remarks to Lacie that: \u201cStrangers like you, so that\u2019s a plus.\u201d (Note: that job exists in our own world).

They were different songs which happened to share a title, but the sentiment was the same. And although set in 1987, Charlie Brooker uses the episode San Junipero to riff on the same idea: that love can transcend everything.</p> <p>As the episode opens we meet Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis), a geek with glasses and more than a passing resemblance to Molly Ringwald. Getting to know the downtown scene of San Junipero for the first time, she heads to the local nightclub for a retro night out immediately signposted by the DJs playlist: Belinda Carlisle, the Bangles and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGtf9QfITQw\">Robbie Nevil</a>.</p> <p>In the pink and blue light of the club she meets Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who sits next to her to dodge an eager ex-boyfriend. Soon the two are pulling Janet Jackson moves on the dancefloor and Kelly is making a pass at Yorkie, which she deflects. The next time they see each other, Kelly\u2019s dressed as Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan and the two hook up. Then Kelly disappears. </p> <p>The closer you look at this rendering of 1987, something seems a bit off. Everything points to the spectre of another reality rippling through the neon. There are cigarettes which can\u2019t be tasted, mirrors that don\u2019t crack when they\u2019re punched. The pop culture that surrounds Yorkie\u2019s 1987 speaks to other worlds and split personalities: the Lost Boys, Max Headroom, Fake by Alexander O\u2019Neal. And of course the multi-textual 80s we loved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/05/netflix-hit-stranger-things-highlights-tvs-trend-for-nostalgia\">Stranger Things</a> is also present (I counted references to Pretty in Pink, Weird Science and The Terminator but I\u2019m sure there are more). As Yorkie pursues Kelly through different years (1987, 1997, 2002) we realise that time is as illusive as her paramour. \u201cTry a different time,\u201d Yorkie is advised by one of Kelly\u2019s ex\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p> <p>This is a sci-rom where everyone is anaesthetised against feeling anything, except, incidentally, love. But it isn\u2019t the Time Traveller\u2019s Wife: what Brooker presents is time travel as a tonic for assisted living. In the present day, Yorkie is hooked up to a life support machine and Kelly is a woman in her autumn years. Life after death exists as a void without a god. San Junipero is instead the hedonistic haven, a virtual reality where the dying hook into a Matrix-like motherboard of their Greatest Hits past. Brooker says a lot of things here, about atheism, tolerance, euthanasia and the spirit, but it\u2019s his ability to capture the purity of new love that stays with you.</p> <p><em>Priya Elan</em></p> <h2>Shut Up and Dance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb6a324629d49214960249d07805019db472c5d/0_32_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrifyingly plausible \u2026 Shut Up and Dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have some bad news about Shut Up and Dance: it\u2019s not really science fiction.

Idomeni and Calais \u2013 at the southern and northern edges of continental Europe \u2013 were by far the largest such camps, each home to 9,000 or more. But there are others: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/serbia-refugees-hungarian-border-macedonia-bulgaria\" title=\"\">in Serbia, for instance, on the border with Hungary</a> \u2013 one of the first frontiers in Europe to be fenced with razor wire.</p> <p>These places are grim, chaotic and threatening, especially for women and children, who often travel alone. In Idomeni, before it was cleared, I sat with a Syrian man who had that morning tried to hang himself, unable to bear watching his family suffer another day. I heard tales of nightly knife fights on the edges of the camp; of traffickers abducting children into slavery. When it rained, rivers of mud poured through the flimsy tents. But I also understand why some people prefer to stay in such camps than go to official centres, where conditions may be no better and the prospects for escape much worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de96727af7791673c7c2557972487f92e8735b0/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A food queue at the Idomeni camp, in Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marko Djurica/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here, by the border, there\u2019s hope,\u201d a young man in Idomeni said to me before it was razed. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving here until the border opens.\u201d</p> <p>He did leave, of course; there\u2019s nothing there now but green fields ruffled by wind. What\u2019s gone \u2013 destroyed almost without trace in just a few days \u2013 was, like Calais, becoming a small town, with shops and falafel stands and internet cafes, barber shops,&#xa0;language classes and even a TV station, sending stories from Idomeni out to the wider world. And as in Calais, hundreds of international volunteers \u2013 some from&#xa0;mainstream NGOs, but many self-organised \u2013 made life more bearable, providing everything from food and information to childcare, friendship and concern.</p> <p>The main reason for wanting to stay near the border, or the Channel, is obviously to cross it: the opportunities, and the traffickers, are there. But, without wanting to romanticise it, Idomeni, like Calais, was for some of its residents also a kind of home: a place where they had a little agency in their daily lives, and where despair was tempered by a sliver of hope that the border would open, or that they could somehow slip through and move on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message to Europeans is: 'Look, we\u2019re taking control.' The message to refugees is: 'Don\u2019t come.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s that hope, above all, that the razing of of such camps shuts down. The existence of these squalid shanty towns is a symptom of Europe\u2019s failure to manage the refugee reception crisis, as well as migration more broadly; closing them does nothing for the underlying problem. In France, as in Greece, the process is driven by politics \u2013 the wish to clean the place up, disperse the people, make them less visible \u2013 rather than any plan for meeting the needs of refugees, or managing mass migration from the global south. The message to Europeans is: \u201cLook, we\u2019re taking control.\u201d The message to refugees is: \u201cDon\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>Dispersing people may reduce local resentment, but it also undermines empathy. Since Idomeni was cleared there\u2019s been far less media focus on the plight of the 60,000 people still stuck in Greece. But most of those evicted from the camp are still sheltering in derelict factories and warehouses, or tents pitched on hard gravel where snakes slither in and rainwater floods through.</p> <p>One family I know spent several weeks in hospital because their two small daughters developed blood poisoning from insect bites. Some prefer to sleep on the streets rather than live in Greece\u2019s derelict industrial infrastructure, out of sight and out of mind, cut off from volunteers and local populations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4h6jj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2465281\"            data-video-name=\"Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police over 'Jungle' break up \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56d477b6e4b0e3887170f3b2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/29/160229CalaisFire_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11281581&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/29/calais-shelters-on-fire-refugees-police-clash-jungle-break-up-video\">Calais shelters set on fire as refugees clash with police - video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And though the closure of the camp was meant to undercut the people smugglers, they are, if anything, doing an even more thriving trade.

But if the experience of Idomeni is anything to go by, many will slip away from Calais rather than subject themselves to an uncertain asylum process, which is unlikely to send them where they want to go, and may well return them to danger or extreme poverty. Some will find their feet, legally or illegally, in French cities and towns. Some, including children, will fall victim to traffickers. And, unless Europe works to open safe routes for refugees, unofficial camps will continue to spring up across the continent, with all the risks and dangers of Idomeni or Calais.</p>",

Built in the colonial style of the 1800s, the grand old place illustrates several chapters of the Island\u2019s story. As sugar prices have fallen (one of the Island\u2019s main exports for decades), the large estates - the Domaines, have invested in tourism. Former chateaux have become restaurants and marginal land close to the coast or amidst the hills has been given over to golf courses and hunting reserves and a few areas remain as nature reserves. </p> <p></p> <p>My first visit was to the Black River Gorges Reserve, in search of one of the island\u2019s best known survivors, the pink pigeon.

Coastal resorts here are set amidst mangrove-fringed inlets in the largest lagoon system on the island, and I was able to visit the tiny speck in the ocean known as Ile aux Aigrettes. Here I got my first sense of what those sixteenth century sailors must have witnessed when setting foot on Mauritian soil for the first time: I was on land that was 100% authentic Mauritian forest. Here, black Ebony trees, corkscrew palms and olivewoods formed a low, cyclone-resistant canopy. This resilient forest provides shelter for the Telfair skink, a rather bold and curious lizard the size of a squirrel, and the exceptionally rare Mauritius fody, a red-headed finch that is for some reason known locally as \u201cColins\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>My guide showed me a modest tree nursery and some giant tortoises, which seemed indignant at being encouraged to pose for photos. The Mauritian giant tortoises are extinct; these leathery animals have been introduced from the Seychelles to spread seeds and \u201cgarden\u201d the native forest with their constant grazing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f68f43effeb03e9aeb6af1ae44028245bfb832e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f68f43effeb03e9aeb6af1ae44028245bfb832e9/0_8_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ile aux Aigrettes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ile aux Aigrettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next morning, I drove to the nearby Le Domaine de l\u2019Etoile, again another fragment of natural forest with trees rare enough to stop a motorway construction. The leaf-strewn forest of sturdy buttresses again includes black ebony - so nearly eradicated. On some of the trunks, I could still the motorway route daubed in red paint. A few of the tarmac-stoppers exist as only a handful of specimens. Sadly, some of these groups are all-male and thus presumably doomed.</p> <p>Like most of the reserves on the island, hunting brings in significant income; something I\u2019m ambivalent about. I feel uncomfortable at the thought of killing for pleasure, yet left unchecked, the introduced deer and boar would do further damage the forests. Careful management brings much-needed income to add to that from horseback and quad bike safaris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d62daff462357a129cf6f3cfcbe550d0e085cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d62daff462357a129cf6f3cfcbe550d0e085cdd/0_115_667_885/377.jpg\" alt=\"The Mauritian Kestrel, arguably, once the world\u2019s rarest bird of prey.

This \u2018island\u2019 amidst the cane has been protected by geography: in this case, the modest yet still impressive hills of granite that form the Bambous Mountains and hint at the island\u2019s distant volcanic past. With luck, I\u2019m here to photograph one of the rarest birds of prey on the planet: the Mauritian kestrel<em>.</em> The dainty bird, slightly smaller than our familiar European bird, relies on small birds and geckos for prey. In the 1970s, the Mauritian kestrel\u2019s number was reduced to just four individuals as a result of habitat loss and use of chemicals such as DDT. Increased protection and the work of the the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and international conservation agencies means there are now over 400 \u2013 a rare success story.</p> <p>As we trekked up the hillside, every movement over the canopy had me lifting my camera to my eye. Mainly, though, I just saw mynah birds (introduced from India) and fruit bats, until a flash of russet caught my eye. There was a kestrel looking down from a large makak tree \u2013 clearly a well-used vantage point. We watched each other for ten minutes before it soared effortlessly away and I lost it against the patchwork of trees in the distance. </p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9e5a719d224d5a24093891c1e0ab3ff68b969a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9e5a719d224d5a24093891c1e0ab3ff68b969a/0_31_667_645/500.jpg\" alt=\"One of the rarest birds of prey on the planet, the Mauritian kestrel, relies on geckoes and small birds for prey.\" width=\"500\" height=\"484\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the rarest birds of prey on the planet, the Mauritian kestrel, relies on geckoes and small birds for prey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Aspinall/www.triggerfish.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p></p> <p>Out of sight of the tourist destinations is a country that has begun a very important national conversation about its future and the kind of society and land it wishes to be. Twenty years ago most of the cane was cut by hand and standards of living were poor for the majority. Now, after a brief boom in the textile industry, most young people want to work in the emerging IT sector and look back on toiling in the fields as the old Mauritius - the \u201cthird world Mauritius\u201d - that it plainly no longer is. At over 1.3 million, the island\u2019s population is now stable, but it still ranks as one of the most densely populated countries on the planet, given its forty-odd-mile size from top to toe. As the country emerges from dependency on fluctuating sugar prices it will be very interesting to see the direction it takes and whether tourist development is shunned for a more cautious and ecologically-sensitive model.</p>",
  "<p>There was something of a knife-edge feel to the news this week. Months of apprehension over the outcome of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\" title=\"\">US election</a> seemed to have given way to discussion about how comprehensively, rather than if, Hillary Clinton will win the presidential vote on 8 November.

And a short distance to the east, in Brussels, representatives of the EU and Canada agonised over a bilateral trade deal, seven years in the negotiating, which looked like it might be completely derailed by a Belgian province over concerns about the market for pork products.</p> <p>In Iraq, where an uneasy alliance of regional factions advanced on the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, there was also a feeling of distraction, as though all parties were already contemplating battles to come rather than those at hand. Our cover story this week concerns one such force, the Kurdish fighters known as the peshmerga, who have returned to reclaim the lands they lost to Isis two years ago and who now dream of building their own nation state in fragile northern Iraq. From outside Mosul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-chulov\" title=\"\">Martin Chulov</a> reports.</p> <p>In Nigeria, a controversial music video shone a revealing light on growing cultural tensions between the country\u2019s Muslim and Christian populations. There\u2019s better news from Kenya, which is making strong progress in enabling better lives for its young people, but less encouraging dispatches from Ethiopia and Venezuela, where respective governments have been flexing their muscles to suppress citizens\u2019 protests.</p> <p>Elsewhere we visit Gibraltar, the British financial services enclave that faces an uncertain future after Brexit. And from the UK a Guardian investigation has resulted in a tax office investigation into the rights of vulnerable workers employed in the so-called gig economy.</p> <p>The Weekly Review hears from Mexico, where a trio of female rap musicians are spearheading a popular fightback against a wave of violent crimes against women. We get down and muddy at an Australian country truck festival, and hear about the Arctic cities where melting permafrost is structurally undermining many buildings.</p> <p>Culture has an interview with the willowy Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki, on the fast track to prominence after having stolen the show in the recent BBC TV adaptation of John Le Carre\u2019s The Night Manager. There\u2019s also a revealing glimpse of the unexpectedly eclectic architecture of Tehran.</p> <p>Rugby league aficionados (I know there will be many of you among our southern hemisphere readers) may enjoy an interview on our Sports pages with England captain Sam Burgess, a star of the game\u2019s Australian NRL competition.</p> <p>To round things off, Gaby Hinsliff laments the demise of good old-fashioned cash in favour of ubiquitous digital payments.

For me, it turned into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/masters-degrees\">master\u2019s course</a> in land-use politics and basic ecology. The Frampton Flora came about when publisher Anthony Cheetham (then at Century) asked for my opinion on a stash of Victorian flower paintings that had been discovered in the attic of a Gloucestershire manor house. The pictures were remarkable, and so was their origin, painted communally by the female members of a single family. The book that followed, part album, part cultural history, is the only one to have reached the top of the nonfiction bestseller lists. Weeds began with an invitation from Profile to do a cultural history of outlaw plants. I was beginning another contracted book at the time, but put it on ice because I had an immodest conviction that I was the writer who knew most about this subject, and wasn\u2019t about to let anyone else do a botched job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0854521b65208ebc6bc900acc608b5174894e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0854521b65208ebc6bc900acc608b5174894e5c/0_0_3500_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I could envisage being mired in the economic history of cotton and corn\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"611\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I could envisage being mired in the economic history of cotton and corn.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My latest, The Cabaret of Plants: Botany and the Imagination, began in a similar way. About the time Neil MacGregor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/sep/13/radio-4-a-history-of-the-world-in-100-objects\">History of the World in 100 Objects</a> was riding high, my agent suggested that I should try a history of the world in a hundred plants. I wasn\u2019t drawn. There were already umpteen books along those lines, and even with a new twist I could envisage being mired interminably in the economic history of cotton and corn. But the idea burrowed into my mind, sending out tendrils to all manner of unexplored memories and unresolved questions. After a while I had conceived the idea of a collection of quirky biographies of plants that had changed the way we think, a perspective on the vegetal world that has always seemed to me the most respectful and fascinating. </p> <p>I think suggestions from outside act on my imagination like a magnet on iron filings, reorientating scattered material so that it all points in the same direction, and setting an internal compass for future attentiveness. So I revisited the times I\u2019d spent with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/andrewmotion.featuresreviews\">Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cdancing\u201d daffodils</a> in the Lake District, only this time with the focus on how and why this particular flower had affected him so. I took my enthralment with prehistoric portrayals of animals into new areas, asking what cave artists had made \u2013 or not made \u2013 of the vegetation of their world. And gradually an underlying theme began to emerge, of plants as organisms that were autonomous and intelligent and the creative tension that had long existed between this revelatory idea and the tradition of plants as inanimate goods. I realised I had been nibbling the edges of this notion for most of my working life \u2013 it just needed a nudge from outside to make the pieces fall into place. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28835cb06c4f7292b2d41764b41c8a909d826f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28835cb06c4f7292b2d41764b41c8a909d826f3a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A field of daffodils originally planted by Wordsworth in Cumbria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A field of daffodils originally planted by Wordsworth in Cumbria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the 1850s Europeans had their first news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/may/02/rachel-sussman-oldest-plants\">welwitschia</a>, a Namibian desert plant whose single pair of leaves can live for 2,000 years, grow to immense size but remain in the permanently infantilised state of a seedling. Ten years later Charles Darwin had revealed the barely credible devices orchids used to conscript insect pollinators, including the launching of pollen-laden missiles. In a world of such remarkable organisms why shouldn\u2019t there be a fly orchid dangling real flies like <em>Bluebottlia buzztilentia</em> in Edward Lear\u2019s surreal Nonsense Botany? Lear\u2019s bionic vegetables were botany\u2019s reductio ad absurdum, the last tarantellas of a century in which plants had been just about the most interesting things on the planet. It wasn\u2019t a fascination confined to the scientific elite. The general public had been agog, astounded by one botanical revelation after another. In America the discovery of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/05/tc-boyle-california-giant-sequoia-forest-wilderness\">ancient sequoias of California</a> in the 1850s drew tens of thousands of pilgrims, who saw in these giant veterans proof of their country\u2019s manifest destiny as an unsullied Eden. (There were throngs of rubberneckers and partygoers too: 19th-century botany was far from sober-sided.) Similar numbers flocked to Kew Gardens in west London, where one of the star attractions was an Amazonian water lily whose <a href=\"http://www.lookandlearn.com/blog/25162/a-giant-water-lily-inspired-the-structure-of-paxtons-crystal-palace/\">leaves were so brilliantly engineered that their design became the model for the greatest glass building</a> of the 19th century. What these moments of excited attention shared was not so much a simple pleasure in floral beauty or the promise of new sources of imperial revenue (though these were there too) but a sense of real wonder that units of non-conscious green tissue could have such strange existences and unquantifiable powers. Plants, defined by their immobility, had evolved extraordinary life-ways by way of compensation: the power to regenerate after most of their body had been eaten; the ability to have sex by proxy; the possession of more than twenty senses whose delicacy far exceeded any of our own.

I was reading a book by Isabel Allende, travelling around Argentina - I'm so sorry I've forgotten it - and it talked about it in depth. And it led to me doing other bits of research when I was in America. It's the sort of film you want Ang Lee to make. </p> <p>I've always been interested in Chinese culture as well - it's extraordinary history, really. We've got a really gorgeous Chinese actor in the cast of Oil, and she makes these jokes about how innovative the Chinese are but how bloody minded they are within that. I love that - I find it fascinating. It feels like there's an infinite past to Chinese culture - I suppose because it's so other to my own life and personal experience.

I'm very strict with myself about being as honest as I can be in my acting which sounds very self-aggrandising, I don't mean it to be, but people pay a lot of money to see your work so I feel duty bound. And that can mean sometimes your heart breaks a wee bit, but you recover as with all heartbreak. </p> <p>I think by the end of the run, you just feel you can't go there again, you can't go there any more. Most of the characters I play are up against it in some way or another, but that's nothing compared with what people cope with on a daily basis, being homeless on the streets of London or whatever. So you crack on. It's hard to constantly receive news of someone's death, or that your child is in danger... sometimes you're having to tell the story of your worst nightmares. And you have to go there. But remain a level of mental health - it's a funny old business.

  "<p>It was the morning after the EU referendum and Aneta Duchniak wondered if she would have many British customers.

The West Yorkshire town voted by a margin of 66.3% to leave the EU. Many of her regulars are Yorkshire folk who have taken a shine to her delicate <em>pierogi</em> dumplings and hearty borscht soups. Many of them wanted Britain to leave Europe, she says, and yet they made a special effort to come in afterwards to tell her it wasn\u2019t personal.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018We want to support you, it\u2019s nothing against you, it\u2019s against Brussels controlling us,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cLots of my regulars voted to leave. One of them even told me she has a Polish cleaner. Roger, who comes in all the time for a cup of tea, voted out and he says he worked with lots of Polish people when he was a miner.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/work/britain-is-failing-to-meet-un-goals-on-gender-equality---dont-ca/\">The government estimates</a> there are 984,000 Polish nationals living in Britain \u2013 an increase of 141,000 on 2014\u2019s figures. Unlike other immigrant communities, the Poles are well spread out across the country, with Polish food shops popping up everywhere from Inverness to the Isle of Wight. By local council estimates, as many as 10,000 are now settled in Wakefield, which is home to various Polish beauty parlours and hairdressers, estate agents, off-licences, dentists and doctors and a string of Polish delis set up by enterprising Kurds. One night last month, the Tequila club on Westgate was advertising \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_polo\">Disco Polo</a> Night Sexy Friday\u201d.

She has spent the last decade working her way up the career ladder, starting in a freezing-cold meatpacking factory, taking in stints as a picker and packer and in office admin, and ending with her dream job as a head chef in a hotel.</p> <p>Piekarz \u2013 whose sister Anna Warecka recently moved from Germany to Wakefield to work at Duchniak\u2019s \u2013 delights in British life, particularly what she calls \u201cyour shortcut words\u201d. She likes how \u201cthank you\u201d becomes \u201cta\u201d \u2013 \u201cand Darren becomes Daz and Gavin becomes Gaz\u201d. But what she loves most is British food. \u201cI love making pies and I love eating pies,\u201d she says, \u201cand I love Sunday dinners and English breakfasts.\u201d</p> <p>She is now better at cooking British food than her native Polish cuisine, and has no intention of returning home. After a decade in Britain , he is firmly woven into British life, with her son enrolled at a local primary school and many British friends.</p> <p>It was the year Piekarz arrived in Britain that many first noticed that people like her were suddenly serving our coffee and renting houses on our streets. Had anyone else\u2019s corner shop turned into a <em>Polski sklep,</em> a colleague wondered, 10 years ago. Who else had employed a Polish plumber? And who had tried <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704515904576075521026203578\">\u017bubr\u00f3wka</a>, that lethal vodka with the bison grass in it, which could now be bought at every off-licence?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43afbfe67be5bd6688b0c1870d69c170c291dd5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43afbfe67be5bd6688b0c1870d69c170c291dd5e/958_998_4961_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I love Sunday dinners\u2019 \u2026 Agnieszka Piekarz who has just taken a job as head chef at a hotel in Wakefield, West Yorkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love Sunday dinners\u2019 \u2026 Agnieszka Piekarz, who has just taken a job as head chef at a hotel in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Poland joined the EU in May 2004 \u2013 along with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia \u2013 there was little fear or fanfare about what their membership could mean for Britain. The government certainly wasn\u2019t worried. Tony Blair\u2019s administration estimated that no more than 13,000 of these new Europeans would seek a new life in Britain each year from 2004. They were using a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21682810\">prediction</a> made by Christian Dustmann, an academic at University College London, which worked on the (incorrect) assumption that other large countries in the EU, in particular Germany, would also open up their labour markets.</p> <p>It soon became clear that Dustmann\u2019s estimate was hilariously \u2013 or catastrophically, depending on your view \u2013 wrong. Between May 2004 and June 2007, 430,000 Poles applied to the Home Office worker registration scheme, joining the 69,000 Poles already in Britain, pre-EU enlargement. As the scheme was voluntary, the true figure was thought to be much higher. In July 2006, the respected Polish newspaper Polityka estimated that 1 million Poles had moved to the UK.</p> <p>It was this last figure that prompted the Guardian to produce a special edition welcoming what we called a \u201cbenign invasion\u201d of eager and biddable Poles to our rainy island. That and a desire to counteract stories in the rightwing press about Poles eating swans and koi carp from Britain\u2019s ponds, and Polish labourers bedding down in portable toilets to save on rent. So, for one day only, the Guardian\u2019s newspaper masthead was in Polish and we published a whole spread in G2 <em>po polsku</em>, which aimed to answer all the questions Poles might have about British life but were too afraid to ask, such as: why do your sinks have two taps? Why do you wear so little on a night out? And where are your plumbers?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41148ac25ab612929c9aa80f9c92b2d4cfb298e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41148ac25ab612929c9aa80f9c92b2d4cfb298e5/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Polish food shop, owned by Kurds, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Polish food shop, owned by Kurds, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But for how much longer will the UK be a favoured destination for Poles seeking adventure or a new life? Germany is now officially the No 1 spot for Polish expats, since Angela Merkel lifted restrictions on access to the labour market in 2011, according to Poland\u2019s ambassador to Britain, Arkady Rzegocki. \u201cThe United Kingdom was, with Ireland, the first place to allow Poles to work but for the last four years Germany has been the top destination, because Poles can now work there,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Poland\u2019s conservative government is also on a drive to encourage its expats to return home and have babies, says Rzegocki. He cited a new <a href=\"http://neweasterneurope.eu/articles-and-commentary/1909-the-family-500-poland-s-new-child-benefit-programme\">child benefit programme called 500+</a> which gives Polish families a monthly allowance of 500 z\u0142oty (about \u00a3100) for all second and subsequent children up to the age of 18, including those already born.</p> <p>Kamil Moczy\u0144ski, a dentist in Wakefield since 2010, said the benefits for Britain of Polish immigration had been clear, particularly the \u201cvery high number of university-educated migrants like doctors, nurses, IT specialists, architects and others\u201d.</p> <p>Poland has benefited, too, he says, noting that even on the minimum wage in Britain, Polish workers can save money to send home to poorer relatives; but Polish society has suffered greatly, and not just from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/grajewo-poland-brave-ones-leave-others-feel-inferior\">extreme shortage</a> of qualified workers in some areas.</p> <p>\u201cCan you imagine the situation that at least one person from almost every Polish family lives and works in the UK? Men left their wives and children, speak with them on Skype and visit them once, sometimes twice, a year. It\u2019s also quite common that both parents move and leave their young children with grandparents for a few months, sometimes even years. If they had another choice they would never move. For many Polish families, immigration is the biggest tragedy in their lives and they have no choice.\u201d</p> <p>Moczynski never intended to stay long but seven years on, he has bought a house, started a family and applied for British citizenship. He has not suffered any abuse post-referendum, but thinks it is \u201cjust a matter of time. Unfortunately, incidents of xenophobic abuse directed against Poles are common and rarely reported. After Brexit, many immigrants feel unwelcome and unsafe.\u201d</p> <p>It was big news in Poland last month when <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-37374579&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1477474006161000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFB8EbnZEtwMneZtfihJdqef859MA\">two Polish officers were deployed</a> on the streets of Harlow following the murder of Arkadiusz J\u00f3\u017awik, 39, who was beaten to death in the Essex town in a suspected racially motivated killing. At a vigil for Jozwik, two Polish men were assaulted. Such xenophobic brutality is hardly the best advert for moving to Britain \u2013 especially when combined with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/27/brexit-polish-centre-london-reeling-after-graffiti-attack\">racist graffiti</a> sprayed on Posk, the long-standing Polish Cultural Centre in west London, and the laminated cards reading \u201cLeave the EU \u2013 no more Polish vermin\u201d reportedly delivered to Polish people in Huntingdon, north-west of Cambridge. For many Poles, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote was a horrible wakeup call. Julita Festejo, who wrote a piece in the original Polish edition, says: \u201c I felt like I was a part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch\">David Lynch</a> movie; the perfect version of my life, which is finally seen for what it is really was \u2013 a lie, a nightmare. It felt personal. Brexit was an anti-immigration vote \u2013 a vote against me.\u201d</p> <p>In July, one of the few Poles to be elected to public office in the UK quit. In an <a href=\"http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/latest/Councillor-quits-over-comments-against-foreigners-e19032f6-19c3-4a65-9c9b-54dc2b1bfabd-ds\">open letter</a> given to the local paper, Mariusz Waluk, who had served on Penrith council over the past year and employs 15 people in his elderly care company locally, cited animosity towards Europeans post-Brexit as one reason for his departure from local politics.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cMy decision was finalised after the Brexit vote, when comments arose from various leave supporters who expressed disappointment that all foreigners were not being made to leave the very next day, and similar sentiments.</p> <p>\u201cI have lived in the UK for more than 10 years now and currently work with English, Scottish, Irish and French nationalities and, as such, hope other people can grow to understand that race, religion or creed pale into insignificance against strength of character and a genuine, honest and hard-working personality.\u201d</p> <p>It was a dismaying signoff. Yet many academics believe that, in another 10 years, the Polish community will be totally assimilated. Dustmann, who has spent the past 13 years explaining his dodgy prediction, says: \u201cOverall migrants from Poland are very well educated, young, and have a high labour-force attachment. They easily assimilate and will be indistinguishable in the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>Although hundreds of thousands of Poles will never go home, others are taking their British experiences elsewhere. Festejo watched Brexit unfold from her new home in Canada, where she moved earlier this year with her British husband and son, after 13 years in London. She is determined to look on the bright side. \u201cI\u2019ll be forever grateful for the opportunities that Britain gave me, for those who treated me like I was one of them, for the truly amazing 13 years that I felt British in my heart. And that\u2019s the Britain I want to remember and tell my British son about, not the post-Brexit Britain, the Britain of today.</p> <p>\u201cI now live in a country that is defying the anti-immigration sentiments, the nation that welcomes not only economic immigrants, but also refugees \u2013 Canada. And here, I\u2019m going to give my newly adopted country everything I have, just like I once did for the UK.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 11 November 2016 to correct the spelling of some Polish words and names.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>One thing I\u2019ve learned from seven years of watching Bake Off is to keep a close eye on The Quiet One. I dismissed Andrew as an also-ran in week one when he didn\u2019t know which way up a Jaffa Cake goes; and when his week two gingerbread structure was themed around punting at Cambridge, I rolled my eyes so hard they were practically filo pastry. In week three he served up a woven basket made of bread that was also FULL OF BREAD, but I was too caught up in the fascinating backstory of the animals in Val\u2019s Ark to fully appreciate it. <br></p> <p>Andrew plodded along for a few more weeks, turning out perfectly presentable bakes that earned an appreciative nod from Paul and Mary, but never quite managed Star Baker. The pressure continued to rise like an over-proved dampfnudel, but while everyone else was blowing their cream horns and flailing around like cats in a bathtub, Andrew was biding his time. </p> <p>Then, in week seven, his ice cream mousse cakes were served up on a miniature ferris wheel and I realised that Andrew Smyth, 25-year-old aerospace engineer from Northern Ireland via Derby, was a TOTAL BAKING ASSASSIN. Tom\u2019s hipster picnic didn\u2019t stand a chance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c153a3a60666b002c2dc40b4d58dffd1bb2ea2c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c153a3a60666b002c2dc40b4d58dffd1bb2ea2c7/0_79_4289_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew\u2019s ice-cream mousse cakes were served up on a miniature ferris wheel \u2026 Tom\u2019s hipster picnic didn\u2019t stand a chance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew\u2019s ice cream mousse cakes were served up on a miniature ferris wheel \u2026 Tom\u2019s hipster picnic didn\u2019t stand a chance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love Productions/Tom Graham/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After that, Andrew was on a (Swiss) roll. In Tudor week, his ingenious Leonardo da Vinci-inspired geared pies turned like steampunk pastry cogs, and the fondant horses on his showstopper were created with a mould he made from a toy horse. After that mechanical marvel, it was easy to overlook his rotund knight (Henry VIII in his later years, perhaps?) packing a massive phallic caramel lance. </p> <p>Engineers are my favourite kind of Bake Off contestant: nothing is ever half-baked, and it\u2019s all about practice, planning and precision. Even his disasters were timed to perfection; if you\u2019re going to forget to turn your oven on for 15 minutes, make sure it\u2019s the week Val\u2019s Bakewell has a soggy bottom, and her showstopper entirely failed to amuse Paul\u2019s bouche. Likewise, if your semi-final puff pastry is a crumbly mess, take a deep breath and make it again, and pray that Selasi\u2019s will be worse than yours (it was, poor Selasi).</p> <p>It\u2019s not just me who thinks Andrew deserves to win this year\u2019s Bake Off \u2013 2014 finalist Richard Burr agrees. \u201cAndrew\u2019s attitude in the tent has been wonderful. He\u2019s faced victory and defeat with such good humour.

Plus he\u2019s a fellow challenger for \u2018Never trust a skinny chef.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In a show that has no shortage of charm, kindness and joy, Andrew manages to bring a bonus ray of sunshine to the Bake Off tent. He\u2019s clearly so delighted to be there, how can you not want to nudge him over the finish line? </p> <p>Andrew has had a couple of close calls, but he\u2019s stayed focussed, kept himself in the game \u2013 and will pull it out the bag when it truly matters. If he can avoid a total meltdown in the Grand Final, and draw on his engineering skills for the queen of all showstoppers, he might just walk away with the Bake Off crown. Just don\u2019t forget to turn the oven on.</p>",

Well, in 1876, the election actually was rigged, and the aftermath of that contest sheds light on what could happen in America in the next few years.</p> <p>The 1876 election pitted New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Samuel J Tilden, against Rutherford B Hayes, the former Republican governor of Ohio. On election night, some southern states, including Florida and Louisiana, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wUMiCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=tilden%20florida%20south%20carolina&amp;f=false\">tried to throw the election to Hayes</a>, even though it was clear that Tilden was winning. Moreover, when the electoral college met in December, three states submitted fraudulent returns, which meant that neither candidate had a majority.

The party hoped to reform both the American financial system and the country\u2019s labor laws. While 13 congressmen doesn\u2019t seem like many, it was nearly 14% of the national vote. Not only did both Democrats and Republicans lose seats \u2013 the rise of the Greenbacks meant any hope Hayes had of gaining traction in congress was lost.</p> <p>More recently, look at the reaction in 1964 after Lyndon Johnson cruised to an unprecedented victory over Barry Goldwater.

  "<p>The Indian-born wife of a Scottish former lance corporal who was facing deportation from the Highlands has been granted leave to remain in the UK. </p> <p>Gloria Macleod, whose husband Robert grew up in Dingwall and now works in Dubai, was denied entry to the UK at Inverness airport in September, despite holding a valid visa. The couple have two daughters, who are British citizens. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Her passport was confiscated and she was threatened with deportation within days, facing the prospect of leaving Siobhan, 11, and 10-year-old Meaghan in the care of their elderly grandparents.</p> <p>Macleod\u2019s local MP, Ian Blackford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/scottish-visa-dispute-threatens-separate-mother-children\">described the visa dispute as \u201cmadness\u201d</a>.

The family, who had been living in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dubai\">Dubai</a>, where Robert works as a security manager, returned to Dingwall in July, where Siobhan and Meaghan enrolled in the same primary school attended by seven-year-old Lachlan Brain.</p> <p>Although Gloria, an Indian passport holder, possessed a UK C-Visit passport, which is valid for 10 years, the couple decided that she should apply for permanent residence to allow her to remain in Scotland while the girls attended school and Robert continued working in Dubai.</p> <p>After advice from the visa office in Dubai, acting on behalf of the UK immigration service, that her application had to be made in person, Gloria briefly left the UK to complete her application process. But when she returned she was denied entry. </p> <p>After Blackford\u2019s intervention, Macleod was given a stay of removal until the UK immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, formally responded to the SNP MP\u2019s inquiry about the case, and the Home Office have now granted her a 30-month visa.</p> <p>Macleod described herself as \u201cdelighted\u201d, adding: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the quick turnaround from the Home Office in issuing my visa and appreciate the help from everyone involved.\u201d </p> <p>Blackford said: \u201cThis has been a huge trauma for the family. Gloria already had a visa that gave her the right to be in Dingwall when immigration officials sought to remove her right to reenter the country.

When we escaped, we were picked up by an oil exploration boat and then brought to a Singapore refugee camp. We stayed there for two months and took a plane to America. Before that, I grew up in Saigon. The aftermath of the war left us stranded. </p> <p>We belonged to the side that lost the war and my family was persecuted. My parents were put in jail for different reasons: my father for being part of the South Vietnam government and my mother for having too much money. In the last days of the war, my parents had decided to split the six children up in different trips so that some of us might survive. </p> <p>My brother left in 1975 with my dad\u2019s cousin during the evacuation and arrived in Virginia. He was 13 years old. Five years later, it was our turn. My younger sister and brother boarded another boat in 1981. We were among more than 700,000 Vietnamese boat refugees who successfully sought asylum in other countries; countless died at sea. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/immigration-america-story-bangalore-dream\">Why I came to America: chasing my dream \u2013 and the man I loved | Meera Nair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the army barracks-turned-refugee camp in Singapore, everyone slept on the floor, crammed in like sardines. The Singapore refugee camp was different because one could only get there if a boat rescued you at sea. Almost every day, news about survivors reached the camp. Some nights, I listened to the wailing of those who survived mourning the deaths of their loved ones. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t know the term \u201cstateless\u201d but understood the precariousness of our situation. At least for our broken family, something went right. After a few weeks, we knew we would be going to America. My eldest brother was in the US and had just been accepted at Princeton. The alumnus who interviewed him heard about our arrival in the camp and got their church to help sponsor us.</p> <p>The pain of being split up without knowing whether we would ever be together again was immense. My family was separated for 17 years, and I don\u2019t think we ever healed from that split. I vaguely remember landing at the Los Angeles airport for arrival processing. After that, we had to take another flight to Richmond, Virginia. Everything about that trip is blurry. I was so nervous about what awaited us. One of the more pressing fears was the new life that we now must start. Not knowing a word of English was just terrifying.</p> <p>Again, I struck luck. My high school had two teachers, one of whom was a Vietnam vet, who had applied for the necessary credentials to teach all us refugees English as a second language. I am grateful to Mrs Morgan and Mr Forsythe for their compassion as teachers for helping me learn a new language. </p> <p>Our little family moved the next year to Houston, Texas. My sister, brother and I worked 20-30 hours a week each in order to pay for rent and food. The hours needed to be split up because it was easier for employers not to have to pay insurance and such. My jobs were all in the same strip mall; I just walked from one job to the other. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/american-dream-immigration-home\">I used to joke that I was allergic to America. Now, it's my home | Rose Hackman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was very much driven by the fear that I would not graduate from high school, so I studied fervently. For us refugees, it was always clear that education was the key to surviving. I crammed for the SAT thanks to my brother\u2019s insistence and made it into Harvard, despite not knowing what it was a few months back. </p> <p>I had the same second-hand winter coat with a broken zipper for all four years of college because I couldn\u2019t afford a new one. The weather was just another challenge in the set of new challenges. I cannot extol enough the strengths and wants of my alma mater, but I know that I learned tolerance in one of the best environments. Diversity at Harvard allows for its strengths and builds its champions.</p> <p>Today, I am very lucky to have a family and freedom to assist those who are in need. I co-founded and became the president of Pacific Links Foundation, a US-based nonprofit that fights the cross-border trafficking of Vietnamese youth. From a youth who was stateless, I am now able to assist those who get stranded crossing borders.</p> <p>I owe America a big debt for opening its arms to stranded people like my family and me. As painful as it was for me to endure the challenges of a wartime survivor, it seems to me that the world is in worse turmoil today. We will need to do even more to help those who are stranded. We cannot be a great nation, a leader, if we ignore the world around us.</p>",

The 2004 election, which saw George W Bush re-elected despite the mounting unpopularity of the Iraq war, saw an explosion of unfounded conspiracy theories that Republicans were in cahoots with the manufacturers of electronic voting machines and would never lose an election again. (The theory fell apart as soon as Democrats retook control of the House of Representatives two years later.)</p> <p>This year, a hard core of Bernie Sanders supporters remains convinced that the senator from Vermont was cheated out of the Democratic presidential nomination by the underhanded maneuvering of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2013 despite the fact that Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/\">won 3m more primary votes</a>.</p> <p>American history is hardly lacking in examples of real voter manipulation and electoral skullduggery, especially in the segregation-era deep south. To this day, the US electoral system is widely viewed as an <a href=\"http://kimalex.blogspot.com/2004/12/jimmy-carter-on-npr-air.html\">anomaly</a> in the western world because of persistent problems with the reliability of its voting machinery, frequent bureaucratic incompetence, the lack of uniform standards from state to state or even county to county, the systematic exclusion of <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/felony-disenfranchisement/\">more than 6 million felons</a> and<strong> </strong>ex-prisoners, and the tendency of election officials to adopt rules that benefit their party over democracy itself.</p> <p>Until 2000, though, these issues were not widely aired in public. Then the battle over Florida ripped a veil off a dysfunctional system and offered an opportunity not just for meaningful electoral reform \u2013 a slow and frustrating process \u2013 but also for new forms of political warfare unseen since the darkest days of the segregation era in which the electoral process itself became fair game, particularly for the Republicans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7457c2bbdb7242882d04cec113b8c9a50a47473c/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney Nicole Pollard, Judge Charles Burton and attorney John Bolton review questionable ballots for the 2000 presidential election in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rhona Wise/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It began, perhaps, when the hand recount of punch card ballots requested by Al Gore and the Democrats \u2013 something both parties had routinely pressed for in previous contested elections \u2013 was recast by many leading Republicans in their talking points as a form of \u201c<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0011/22/ip.00.html\">slow-motion grand larceny</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Then, in Missouri, Republican Senator Kit Bond took one look at African American voters in overcrowded precincts in St Louis casting ballots beyond the official poll closing time \u2013 something that has since become standard practice in many states \u2013 and denounced what he called a \u201c<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122543\">major criminal enterprise</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Soon, a narrative took hold that Democrats were habitual vote-stealers \u2013 something that was indubitably true in the days of Boss Tweed in 1860s New York but now took the form of a racist dog-whistle because the voters under most suspicion were black or Latino. Within a few years, politicians such as Sarah Palin were openly distinguishing \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/10/rep-says-liberals-hate-real-americans-014797\">real Americans</a>\u201d \u2013 meaning white Republicans \u2013 from the rest, and states under Republican control were passing voter ID laws to crack down on a problem \u2013 voter impersonation fraud \u2013 that experts have repeatedly found to be <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/2016/10/18/analysis-heres-why-vote-fraud-is-less-likely-than-being-struck-by-lightning/\">rare to non-existent</a>.</p> <p>As the federal courts have now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/31/north-carolina-voting-rights-law-republicans-november-elections\">begun to find</a>, the effect of these laws has in fact been to discriminate against groups of voters \u2013 the transient, the elderly, students and the poor \u2013 who are much more likely to support Democrats.</p> <p>Given the level of mistrust, rank-and-file members of both parties have increasingly come to define democracy by the elections their side wins, and any other outcome as prima facie evidence of theft and corruption.</p> <p>Royal Masset, a former political director of the Texas Republican party, once described how he would receive <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2007/04/a-republican-his-mother-and-voter-id/\">dozens of calls</a> from disappointed candidates after election day complaining about some unsubstantiated outrage, usually involving illegal immigrants or lightning-rod political figures such as Jesse Jackson. \u201cHuman beings do not accept defeat easily,\u201d he observed in 2007.</p> <p>If Trump is different, it is only because he began complaining about vote-rigging months before election day and because he threatens to depart from the tradition that says you fight as hard and as dirty as you want, but only until the final results come in.</p> <p>The sheer volume of his complaints, however, may be doing his prospects little good: a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/21/trumps-election-rigging-claim-will-backfire-heres-the-evidence/?tid=pm_politics_pop_b\">fascinating</a> American National Election Study survey conducted in 2012 shows that people are less likely to vote when their faith in the integrity of the system has been shaken, and much more likely to vote if they think the ballots are counted fairly.

Don't play it at all. <br />2. Every time you don't play, put the cost of a lottery ticket into a jar. <br />3. Decide how frequently you want to &quot;win&quot; -- the longer you are willing to wait, the bigger the &quot;payout&quot; will be. <br />4. Open the jar after your planned interval. If you can wait months or years, it becomes a nice chunk of change! <br />5. Go wild and spend your winnings. Just don't forget to donate a small portion of your &quot;winnings&quot; to the sort of charitable causes that rely on lottery funding.</p> <p>Yes, this is exactly the same as having a piggy bank.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>It was the question of not washing your jeans that really got you going<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86104017\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12906835\" title=\"View realdoge\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12906835\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for realdoge\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12906835\" title=\"View realdoge\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">realdoge</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/86104017\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2016 7:53pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I don't understand not washing jeans.

It seems the consensus following Brexit is that they\u2019re the marginalised white working class; the people who have been left behind by modernity, who feel alienated by the \u201cliberal metropolitan elite\u201d. I\u2019m a white man from the north-east, living in strongly Brexit-voting Middlesbrough, so you might expect me to tell you all off for looking down on us from your ivory towers. But the truth is that this outbreak of \u201cthe poor proles can\u2019t help it\u201d is both incorrect and patronising.</p> <p>The working class mostly lack our own voices in the media. Instead, we are reported on. This reporting seems, even now, to believe that the true working-class identity is, as Kelvin MacKenzie put it in the 1980s, \u201ca right old fascist\u201d. Culturally insular, not interested in or smart enough to understand real news, generally afraid of people not like him (it\u2019s always a him).</p> <p>Migrants and native people of colour are stripped of their right to a <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/09/28/why-we-have-to-take-white-working-class-peoples-fears-seriously/\" title=\"\">working-class identity</a>, and even cast as the enemy of the \u201creal\u201d (ie white) working class. I spoke to Marsha Garratt, a working-class, mixed-race woman who heads up the <a href=\"http://www.allinyouthproject.com/aboutus\" title=\"\">All In Youth Project</a>, and she was cutting about the \u201cunderreporting of positive stories of solidarity between all members of the working class, including ethnic minorities\u201d. <a href=\"https://mediadiversified.org/2016/10/20/the-migrant-led-strikes-of-the-past-can-inform-our-present-and-future/\" title=\"\">Working-class history is migrant history</a>, but we ignore that because it does not match what we believe to be authentic.</p> <p>Likewise any of us who are white and born here, but refuse to blame migrants for the result of government policies, are cast as the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d even if we\u2019re earning the same amounts and living in the same towns. Working-class identity becomes necessarily and by definition anti-migrant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not the only people with concerns. It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once everyone who doesn\u2019t fit is excluded, those who remain are transformed from real people into weaponised stereotypes to be turned against those who resist the advance of jam-obsessed fascism.

It\u2019s just that everyone else seems to have them on our behalf, out of the charity of their hearts. The white middle classes are just as likely to be disturbed by brown faces or foreign accents as the white working classes are, but they are generally educated enough to realise they can\u2019t just come out and say it. Working-class poverty, framed as the result of the strains these new arrivals place on our generous social safety net, provides the cover for them to object to immigration even though they are unharmed by it.</p> <p>But our other \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d \u2013 such as school and hospital funding, benefits and disability payments, the crushing of industries that formed the backbones of our local economies \u2013 are ignored or dismissed out of hand. They are cast as luxuries, an irresponsible \u201ctax and spend\u201d approach, or they are turned back on us as evidence of our own fecklessness and lack of ambition. When we say \u201cwe need benefits to live because you hollowed out our towns in pursuit of a flawed economic doctrine,\u201d we are castigated for being workshy, and told we only have ourselves to blame. If we alter our complaints to blame foreign people it\u2019s a different story. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all been sold to private landlords,\u201d gets nothing. \u201cI can\u2019t get a council house because they\u2019ve all gone to bloody Muslims,\u201d gets on the front page of the tabloids.</p> <p>Just as we are given identities as good or bad working-class people based on whether we adequately perform our roles as good little workers or whether we insolently insist on being disabled, unemployed or unionised, so our authenticity as working-class people depends on our use for political ends. Are we salt of the earth yeomen, or skiving thickos milking the system, or drains on the already stretched infrastructure? That all depends: are we kicking out immigrants or privatising a clinic today?</p> <p>If we only matter to politicians when we can be used as to defend old bigotries about hordes of eastern Europeans stealing our women and poisoning our jam, then we don\u2019t matter at all.</p>",

He also claims Dre was behind a gun attack in a Hollywood club in August 2014, in which Knight was shot multiple times.</p> <p>The reason for Dre\u2019s alleged animus, Knight claims, is that when Knight and Dre ended their business relationship in 1996, Dre agreed to a lifetime management agreement, entitling Knight to 30% of Dre\u2019s earnings for the rest of his career. The fresh suit is claiming that percentage of Dre\u2019s income from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/28/apple-buys-beats-dr-dre-music-streaming\">the $3bn sale of headphone company Beats to Apple</a>, and his profits from Straight Outta Compton. </p> <p>The suit claims that Cle Sloan \u2013 one of two people Knight alleges tried to attack him on the night Carter was killed \u2013 was hired to \u201chandle the Suge Knight problem\u201d on Straight Outta Compton, and he in turn brought in 100 gang members as security. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/suge-knight-sues-dr-dre-alleging-murder-for-hire-plot-w446498\">According to Rolling Stone</a>, Howard King, acting for Dre, said in a statement: \u201cGiven that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge\u2019s lawyer has lots of malicious-prosecution insurance.\u201d </p> <p>Universal Music as reportedly not yet responded to the latest legal action.</p>",

There are fears it will use the government\u2019s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/29/english-universities-ranked-gold-silver-and-bronze\">new teaching rankings</a> \u2013 expected to grade institutions \u201cgold, silver or bronze\u201d \u2013 to judge the \u201cquality\u201d of institutions.</p> <p>The move, which vice-chancellors say they had been fearing since Theresa May became prime minister, has caused dismay in universities. According to Universities UK, the vice\u2011chancellors\u2019 umbrella organisation, overseas students bring more than \u00a310.7bn to the UK economy and non-EU international students make up 13% of universities\u2019 revenues.</p> <p>Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, says: \u201cTrying to restrict the numbers of international students coming into this country because they contribute to migration numbers makes no sense. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/14/most-britons-do-not-see-foreign-students-as-immigrants-survey-shows\">British people don\u2019t see students as migrants</a> \u2013 or as a problem.\u201d</p> <p>He says stopping a university recruiting overseas students would \u201cbe an absolutely devastating blow\u201d. \u201cIt would hugely reduce diversity, which really matters. It would reduce standards, as we need to recruit the best students wherever they are. And the financial effects would be serious \u2013 you would see wholesale job losses.\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety is escalating behind the scenes that the Home Office may want to use the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/02/teaching-excellence-framework-university-tef-student-data-higher-education\">Teaching Excellence Framework</a> \u2013 the new system for ranking universities\u2019 teaching \u2013 to decide which universities to cut.

How do you measure quality of teaching in a way that isn\u2019t challengeable in the courts? You use the Teaching Excellence Framework. But some of the Russell Group do very badly on the TEF. And that means there is potentially a very big fight coming.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Byrne, president and principal of King\u2019s College London, says King\u2019s supports the TEF, but says: \u201cThere\u2019s no rationale for linking it to the regulation of international student recruitment as it was not designed for this purpose. It would damage the UK\u2019s attractiveness as a study destination in what is a very competitive global market place.\u201d</p> <p>King\u2019s has high admissions standards that are equally rigorous for domestic and international students, he says. \u201cPlaces at our institution are in great demand from students of outstanding quality around the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3befd870c07a6f1a3ddf9eca7f524470571402b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3befd870c07a6f1a3ddf9eca7f524470571402b1/0_267_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valerie Amos in front of Soas sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Amos: \u2018Soas is a specialist, niche university.

It would be completely wrongheaded. Barely any of it refers to international students, who are mostly postgraduates.\u201d</p> <p>The TEF will rank university teaching based on factors including numbers of leavers who land graduate-level jobs and how students rate their institutions in the <a href=\"http://www.thestudentsurvey.com/\">National Student Survey</a>. This last measure is likely to hit some members of the Russell Group hard, because they have not scored well in the NSS in the past. This year the LSE, which consistently ranks highly in other league tables, dropped six percentage points in the NSS and was the lowest-performing major university, excluding small and specialist institutions. Any move to restrict LSE\u2019s international recruitment could have a huge effect, as overseas students make up <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/world-ranked-universities-most-international-students\">70%</a> of its student body.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says the Home Office probably thinks using the TEF to judge quality is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. Hillman, who negotiated with the Home Office about the importance of international students during his time as special adviser to former higher education minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\">David Willetts</a>, says: \u201cThey know very little about universities. So piggybacking on an existing education department measure would seem to make sense.\u201d He says the Home Office is rigidly elitist about higher education, and likely to be unaware of the potential impact of such a policy on some of Britain\u2019s most famous institutions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/29/english-universities-ranked-gold-silver-and-bronze\">English universities to be ranked gold, silver and bronze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her speech, Rudd insisted she was \u201cpassionately committed to making sure our world-leading institutions can attract the brightest and best\u201d, but added that \u201ca student immigration system that treats every student and university as equal only punishes those we should want to help\u201d. Hillman, however, comments: \u201cThe \u201cbrightest and best language is really pernicious. They mean: \u2018We don\u2019t mind future world leaders like Bill Clinton coming here but we really don\u2019t want anyone else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Valerie Amos, director of Soas University of London, which is also expected to come some way down the TEF rankings because of its NSS results, says that although Soas is committed to the student experience and teaching quality, \u201cI worry the TEF is a rather blunt instrument\u201d. She adds: \u201cI worry about the concept of differentiation. We are a diverse sector. Soas is a specialist, niche university. We don\u2019t teach science and engineering. That means we don\u2019t feature in certain rankings because of our size.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office told Education Guardian: \u201cWe will be consulting on what more we can do to strengthen the system to support the best universities, and those that stick to the rules, to attract the best talent. The consultation will invite views on how courses and institutions could be differentiated and we will use the feedback to inform our decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Battle lines may be drawn next week when the issue is due to be debated by vice-chancellors at a board meeting of Universities UK. There is likely to be little schadenfreude. Vice-chancellors fear that if one institution suffers big cuts it could harm the reputation of the whole sector abroad, especially if that institution is one of the UK\u2019s big hitters.</p> <p>Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, who has tweeted under the hashtag #loveinternational since the EU referendum, called a staff meeting after Rudd\u2019s speech to denounce the \u201cdisturbing intolerance\u201d coming from the Home Office. He warned that relationships were already being soured abroad, telling staff that the university\u2019s India office had sent him a local news article with the headline \u201cFive reasons to revisit your UK college plan\u201d.</p> <p>Shellard said: \u201cLast week the Turner prize winning artist and De Montfort University graduate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/17/david-shrigley-life-lessons-really-good\">David Shrigley</a> unveiled his new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/29/david-shrigley-really-good-fourth-plinth-trafalgar-square\">sculpture on Trafalgar Square\u2019s fourth plinth</a>: it was a giant thumbs up. After Ms Rudd\u2019s speech it may well appear to the world that we are showing a very different finger. Because you can\u2019t use the kind of rhetoric that we have seen idly.

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>There were two big events on the Brexit horizon this week, and both \u2013 as often happens with EU-related stories \u2013 took place in Belgium.</p> <p>One, inevitably, was in Brussels, where Theresa May took part in her first EU summit since becoming prime minister, a slightly testy affair not helped by May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-uk-centre-of-european-decision-making-until-brexit\">saying the UK hoped</a> to remain at the centre of EU decision-making until it left. </p> <p>This brought a frosty response from some other countries, with Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrats in the European parliament, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When somebody wants to leave a club, it is not normal that such a member wants to decide about the future of this club.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps as a slightly mischievous response to this anger, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-brexit-negotiations-language-french\">report emerged later in the summit</a> of a supposed proposal by Michel Barnier, the French ex-foreign minister running the talks for the European commission, to stage all negotiations in French. This would not happen, Downing Street swiftly responded.</p> <p>Later in the week saw Wallonia receive more coverage in the UK press than at any time since Lord Castlereagh was in the Foreign Office, in 1812.</p> <p>It came after the parliament of the French-speaking part of Belgium <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\">blocked a planned EU-Canada trade deal</a>, seven years in the making, prompting Canada\u2019s trade minister to walk out of talks. </p> <p>This has, as you might expect, prompted some speculation as to whether the Walloons \u2013 or any other among the 27 parliaments who will all have a veto \u2013 could similarly scupper a post-Brexit UK deal.</p> <p>May has rejected this, telling the Commons on Monday \u2013 to some hoots of scepticism from the opposition: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To those who suggest that these difficulties have a bearing on our own future negotiations, I would remind them that we are not seeking to replicate the existing model that any other country has in relation to its trade with the European Union. We will be developing our own British model.</p> </blockquote> <h2>View from Europe</h2> <p>The general view from elsewhere within Europe was nicely summed up by two quotes from anonymous senior EU officials, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-summit-idUKKCN12I1ZW\">talking to Reuters</a> before the Brussels summit.</p> <p>One said: \u201cThere\u2019s a surprising degree of consensus. No one wants to give the Brits an opening.\u201d The other was more blunt still: \u201cHow this is going to end, no one knows. For now, the train is heading towards a wall.\u201d</p> <p>And things did not get much more amicable once the EU leaders sat down to a long dinner \u2013 after which, at around 1am, May finally got her chance to speak.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, warned May about her seeming intent on a \u201chard Brexit\u201d in which immigration controls were prioritised at the expense of access to the single market.</p> <p>\u201cI have said it very firmly to her. If Theresa May wants a hard Brexit, the negotiations will be hard,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, cautioned against any British hopes of some sort of bespoke deal: \u201cI refuse to imagine a Europe where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens are not.\u201d</p> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>Or more specifically, in Downing Street, where May hosted a distinctly frosty meeting with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to give them a chance to air their views on Brexit. </p> <p>This was the joint ministerial committee, a long-neglected forum for the devolved administrations, now hastily revived by Downing Street, complete with the slightly ambiguous promise that the leaders will have \u201ca direct line\u201d to the Brexit secretary, David Davis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7b3541200f384332e84b30404b45c3bdde30f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b3541200f384332e84b30404b45c3bdde30f53/950_0_2166_2709/800.jpg\" alt=\"Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Brexit minister Michael Russell leave No 10 after a \u2018frank exchange of views\u2019 with Theresa May\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Brexit minister Michael Russell leave No 10 after a \u2018frank exchange of views\u2019 with Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two-hour meeting saw Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/nicola-sturgeon-says-brexit-meeting-was-deeply-frustrating\">Nicola Sturgeon, emerge to declare it</a> a \u201cfrank exchange of views\u201d, diplomatic speak for discussions that ended just short of blood being spilled.</p> <p>Sturgeon was withering about May\u2019s lack of an apparently coherent plan for Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t know any more now about the UK government\u2019s approach to the EU negotiations than I did before I went in to the meeting,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Asked if she was undermining the UK\u2019s negotiating position with the EU, Sturgeon replied: \u201cI can\u2019t undermine something that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Ouch.</p> <p>There was more scorn for May after she delivered a Commons statement about the Brussels summit, which spoke hopefully of creating \u201ca powerful new relationship that works both for the UK and for the countries of the EU\u201d.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused May of \u201cthreats, hectoring [and] lecturing\u201d the EU, adding: \u201cThe rest of the world looks on and concludes: Britain hasn\u2019t got a clue.
