  "<p>If there was a high point in the reputation and significance of fact checkers, wonks and poll crunchers it came during the 2012 US presidential campaign. It was the election where former president Bill Clinton held court at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Miami for just under an hour. </p> <p>Such was the avalanche of statistics that night that fact check site Politifact called it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">Our Clinton Nightmare</a>\u201d, bemoaning the \u201ceffort required to run down his many statistics and factual claims, producing little for us to write about\u201d.<br></p> <p>The numbers just rolled off Clinton\u2019s tongue \u2013 4.5 million private sector jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs, 250,000 more people working in the auto industry, 3 million young people between 19 and 25 insured for the first time, health care costs rising at under 4%. \u201cLook,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?_r=0\">he said to the faithful</a>, \u201chere\u2019s what really happened.

Here\u2019s what really happened.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">Housing affordability, inequality, and our flatlining household incomes | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the first Twitter presidential election, and thus the first campaign to feature the instant fact-check. It was the election in which Barack Obama cited fact checkers in the <a href=\"http://debates.org/index.php?page=october-22-2012-the-third-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">third presidential debate</a> to counter Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Obama had gone on an \u201capology tour\u201d.</p> <p>It was also the election in which the poll aggregators such as Nate Silver had put down their glasses by the time of that third debate, and called the race for Obama. It was the election where insiders such as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Peggy Noonan came to grief, believing their finger on the pulse was <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/11/05/monday-morning/\">more accurate than the polls</a>.</p> <p>It was a total victory for the wonks, the fact checkers, the poll crunchers.</p> <p>Four years later we have Donald Trump winning the Republican Party nomination with a record number of fact-checked lies, the British voting to leave the EU despite all advice to the contrary, the local ABC\u2019s own fact-checking unit being axed and Nate Silver\u2019s <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hey-at-least-the-cavs-might-not-get-swept/\">538 statistical site</a> even getting the result of the NBA final series wrong.</p> <p>What the hell? With this seeming failure has come no small amount of glee from progressives. While poll analysts and fact checkers are not the same, they do work on the same side of the street, and are the cause of much angst among progressives, which would seem odd given progressives as a rule generally perform better on fact checks.</p> <p>After the recent Australian federal election, Fairfax\u2019s Matthew Knott reviewed the media\u2019s coverage, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016-opinion/election-2016-the-uncomfortable-truth-is-the-media-got-it-wrong-how-did-we-do-it-20160705-gpzatm\">in which he admitted</a>, \u201cThose political reporters not too hubristic to engage in self doubt are asking: did we get it wrong? Did we, as a collective, miss the story?\u201d</p> <p>The story that was seemingly missed was not a policy or a hidden funding cut, but the margin of victory by the LNP. But really, who gives a damn? If you think the prime role of your job as a journalist covering an election is to predict the results, then there is a lot more wrong than just whether or not your prediction was faulty.</p> <p>But the devotion to polling and prediction is also a concern for progressives because inherently polls \u2013 and thus their analysis \u2013 reinforce the status quo. As US political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg has noted, the growth of public polling has been \u201cmost damaging to the political fortunes of the groups that represented the interest and aspirations of the working classes\u201d.</p> <p>Without polling, politicians can only gauge voters\u2019 moods on certain issues either through meetings with constituents, letters or through observing political actions such as protests, strikes or rallies. Polls can give equal weight to the attitudes of the uninterested and the politically active.</p> <p>For the progressive wonks the worry is not so much about advocating policies or programs that are detrimental to society, but whether the need for data and evidence means your arguments are being ignored by those who matter (itself an issue for debate) and that secondly you are pushing the debate towards the centre \u2013 and also being part of the movement that then pushes that centre ever more to the right.</p> <p>Among the most common strawman arguments is that the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s ascendancy prove that relying on fact-checking and wonks is doomed to failure. And there may be truth in that, but I\u2019ve yet to hear anyone suggest that facts should be the only weapon used in a debate. No election \u2013 not even the fact-checking triumph of 2012 \u2013 has ever been won on the basis of who told the fewest lies. Similarly no policy debate has ever been won just because a group of experts did a review and someone tweeted a graph.</p> <p>If you are arguing that there needs to be action on climate change, yes you\u2019re going to need more than a graph to do it. But you\u2019re also going to struggle without one. A concept as divorced from most people\u2019s lives as is climate change needs at the very least to be fought with data \u2013 especially when the opposing side is doing its best to suggest their data shows there is no need to worry. Among the most influential examples was the ultra-wonky documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Did the film win the debate? Did its numerous graphs on climate change lead to global action that saw a price on carbon? Well no, but that\u2019s not to say nothing was gained \u2013 more perhaps that progressives have a tendency to discredit their victories. Australia did implement a price on carbon.</p> <p>Now perhaps the reason the ALP subsequently lost the 2013 election was because there was too much of an emphasis on data and economic neoliberalism and not enough talk of values. Or perhaps the main reason we no longer have a price on carbon is because the ALP lost the election after three years fanning a dumpster-fire of internal division.</p> <p>Who can say. But the wonk critics do also have a point. Despite what the authors of books such as Freakonomics might attest, economics neither explains everything in life nor persuades. Fact-checking is particularly useless at countering prejudice. A graph on the improvement of GDP from immigration is unlikely to switch the votes of people from Trump or One Nation hostile to the very idea of foreigners.</p> <p>While there may be some objective centrists, I would argue in Australia the progressive wonks \u2013 and I put myself in this camp \u2013 write as much with passion for a cause as they do with passion for facts. When I write an article to dismiss the claims regarding the numbers of welfare recipients, I don\u2019t do it from some neutral point of view. I do it because people are lying in order to hurt the most disadvantaged in society. I\u2019m not going to ignore the lie\u2014and using facts to counter it is not I would argue some anodyne approach.</p> <p>The adherence to data can easily lead the wonks to prefer the safety of the status quo. This was something I was conscious of when arguing against the Abbott plan for extending paid parental leave to full replacement-wage level for 26 weeks. I argued that such a plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/10/abbotts-paid-parental-leave-will-do-little-to-bring-women-to-the-workforce\">would do little to increase women\u2019s workforce participation</a> (the aim of the policy), and that the money would be better spent on child care. I could see the moral argument that paid parental leave should be paid regardless of the parents\u2019 income, but I could also see the moral argument that governments should aim to improve the standard of living for women with children. For me the better policy response was in broader childcare policy rather than an expanded PPL. </p> <p>But the risk \u2013 as soon as you suggest factors such as the size of a budget deficit should be considered \u2013 is that such an approach will always see you favouring a more centrist position. Consider for example the common argument about government spending and the size of the budget. During the last election campaign Anthony Albanese argued that \u201cspending is higher as a proportion of GDP today than it was under the global financial crisis\u201d. The ABC\u2019s fact-checking unit <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/fact-check-is-government-spending-today-higher-than-gfc/7459392\">found that statement to be incorrect</a> because in one year during the GFC government spending was marginally higher.</p> <p>This set off quite a debate \u2013 especially online involving economist Stephen Koukoulas, who argued the ABC fact checkers had taken far too narrow a view of what constituted the GFC period. And yet to what end was the fight? Do progressives really care that the ALP spent less than an LNP government? Doesn\u2019t that merely reinforce the conservative position that smaller government is better?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/close-call-how-the-pollsters-got-the-election-result-right\">Close call: how the pollsters got the election result right | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Progressives love to blame themselves. Rare is an election defeat by the ALP that does not result in great internal angst, gnashing of teeth and writing of books charting what went right and what needs to be done. Such self-reflection certainly is preferable to the view that it is always the other side or the media which that is at fault \u2013 or even worse, that voters are to blame. But the anti-wonk fight is a futile one. Progressives should not give up on the facts, if only because doing so cedes the space to the conservative forces.<br></p> <p>The wonks themselves need, however, to watch whether their work is merely perpetuating a status quo due to a fear of the bold, or a disinclination to countenance an upset, or because the lines within which they fight have been laid out by the conservative side. </p> <p>But mostly they need to be wary that their adherence to the data can see them lose sight of the greater truth: that despite what some might have thought in 2012, facts \u2013 whether they be on GDP, climate temperatures or any other data \u2013 are not the only truth in life, or politics.</p> <p><strong>This is an edited extract of an essay that appears in the <a href=\"https://www.mup.com.au/items/190003\">spring issue of Meanjin</a>, out 15 September.

But a population growth of 40,000 residents a year has led to a build-up in state bureaucracy and given rise to fears of urban gentrification.</p> <p>Asked by pollsters which issues had most influenced their votes, <a href=\"http://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-09-18-LT-DE-BE/index.shtml\">Berliners in the west and the east</a> listed social justice, the local economy and the state of the education system above the management of the refugee crisis.</p> <p>The month of campaigning in the German capital was dominated by rising rental prices and the ongoing fiasco of the new Berlin Brandenburg airport rather than refugees or fear of terror attacks.</p> <p>Unlike most capitals in Europe, Berlin has higher public debts than other big cities such as Munich or Hamburg and continues to be subsidised by richer states around Germany.</p> <p>M\u00fcller took over from Berlin\u2019s long-term mayor Klaus Wowereit two years ago, after previously serving as party leader and senator. A more managerial figure than the often exuberant, openly gay Wowereit, M\u00fcller initially enjoyed high popularity ratings.</p> <p>Yet, after 15 years of Social Democrat rule, Sunday\u2019s result is a sobering step down from the 30.8% the party enjoyed at the height of the Wowereit era \u2013 and the 61.9% achieved under late mayor and ex-chancellor Willy Brandt. Like the CDU, the Social Democrats gained their lowest share of the vote in Berlin ever. In the history of modern Germany, no party has previously won an election with a similarly poor result.</p> <p>The Pirate party, a band of internet freedom activists who managed to enter parliament in 2011, dropped below the 5% threshold.<br></p> <p>But the result will hurt Merkel\u2019s CDU most. After defeats for the Christian Democrats in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Westphalia and Baden\u2013W\u00fcrttemberg, the Berlin result is the fourth blow in a row for the centre-right party, which came close to gaining an absolute majority at federal level only three years ago.</p> <p>For the party leadership, it has become hard to ignore a pattern behind the results. In all four elections, established parties shed votes while the upstart AfD, founded in 2013, managed to achieve double digits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da2f7aa1435e20916def8abdf2d103aff4e684d3/0_134_4239_2544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate Frank Henkel casts his vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorg Carstensen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As in the three previous votes, the CDU\u2019s mayoral candidate in Berlin, Frank Henkel, got punished even though the party tried to distance themselves from their own chancellor\u2019s stance over the refugee issue.

  "<p>Some birds pop up when you least expect it. On August bank holiday I went for a walk to my coastal patch, along with assorted relatives and a very boisterous dog. Bird-wise, apart from a high-tide roost of a thousand <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/redshank\">redshanks</a> along the river Brue, things were relatively uneventful.</p> <p>But as we were strolling back to the car, a small bird flew up onto a protruding twig along a hedgerow, and posed in a way that made its identity virtually certain.</p> <p>A glance through my binoculars confirmed that it was indeed a <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/whinchat\">whinchat</a>.

Late August and early September see a steady trickle of whinchats passing through southern Britain, on their way down to west Africa from their breeding grounds further north. They return in April, when they look a lot smarter: a male that stopped off here last spring was absolutely immaculate, especially compared with the dowdy juveniles we see in autumn. </p> <p>My very first Somerset whinchats appeared a year or so after we moved down here. My neighbour, Mick, had photographed a mystery bird that he\u2019d asked me to identify. Not a whinchat, as it turned out, but a female wheatear \u2013 one of several he\u2019d seen on nearby Blackford Moor. A swift bike ride led me straight to a couple of <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/wheatear\">wheatears</a>, flashing their snow-white rumps as they pranced around a newly cut field.</p> <p>But the real bonus was no fewer than ten whinchats; five perched on bales of hay, and the others on the reeds along the rhynes \u2013 the narrow water-filled ditches that form field boundaries on the Somerset Levels. Why they were all concentrated in this one place was obvious: the surrounding fields had been cut for silage several months\u2019 earlier, leaving just short grass.</p> <p>Short grass means far fewer insects, the vital energy supply for all migrants as they prepare to leave our shores for the long flight to Africa. Haymaking \u2013 partly because it occurs later in the season, and partly because the bales are left on the land rather than being wrapped up in black plastic like giant rabbit droppings \u2013 is better for insects, and so far better for the wheatears and whinchats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/02/fitting-last-stronghold-whinchat-country-diary\">A fitting last stronghold for the whinchat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was only later that I discovered that whinchats used to nest in good numbers on the Somerset Levels \u2013 until as recently as the 1980s there were as many as 150 breeding pairs here. Yet now there are none. It\u2019s a stark reminder that, while we seem to be able to create the right habitat for wetland birds, we still struggle with those species that need wildlife-friendly farming to thrive.</p> <p>Today, we think of whinchats as birds of the uplands: denizens of the wild and windy moors, where they nest on gorse (\u201cwhin\u201d being an old name for that plant). But as my friend <a href=\"http://www.ben-macdonald.co.uk\">Ben Macdonald</a> has pointed out, this is yet another example of the way our view of a particular bird shifts as it declines.

Authorities in St Cloud noted that they did not yet have evidence about the attacker\u2019s motives.

Corbyn and McDonnell opposed \u201cCameron\u2019s bombing of Libya and Blair\u2019s invasion of Iraq\u201d, but did these gentlemen offer up an alternative strategy? It doesn\u2019t require a great deal of acumen to be opposed to miscarriages of justice, extended detentions, unequal pay, gender inequality, racism, tax avoidance by the super-rich, the bedroom tax, the present government\u2019s welfare reforms, and mismanagement of the NHS.</p> <p>It does require \u201cleadership\u201d to come up with solutions to these iniquities, and to address the very great problems facing the nation, including the challenges following the Brexit vote, our poor productivity, the weaknesses in our economy, our trade imbalances, our infrastructure weaknesses, the housing crisis, future funding for the NHS, the deficit, the energy sector, climate change, the tensions in Northern Ireland, and the gulf between rich and poor. Is the current Labour leadership enunciating coherent policies to address these issues in a way that the electorate is finding convincing? Or do the leadership find it easier to stay within their comfort zone, and concentrate on yesterday\u2019s issues, such as unilateral disarmament and Orgreave?<br><strong>Barry Mellor</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Bravo to Ronan Bennett for saying it, and to the Guardian for printing it: leadership is not just about being \u201cstrong\u201d. Bennett points out that \u201cstrong\u201d leadership has given us a series of disastrous failures abroad, from Iraq to Libya. Jeremy Corbyn opposed all those wars, which makes him \u201cright\u201d rather than \u201cweak\u201d. But what about leadership in the Commons? Corbyn has been accused of being a \u201cweak\u201d leader because he does not come across as a fighter. He is not forceful enough, even in countering the attacks from his own benches. In other words, he is not a \u201cstrong\u201d leader \u2013 and therefore not a leader at all. The truth is that the slanging matches that pass for parliamentary \u201cdebate\u201d these days are just as dysfunctional as the wars we have been fighting abroad. The government has made a record number of U-turns since Corbyn was elected. These were not the result of battles at prime minister\u2019s questions, because that is not how politics works. A good leader is not necessarily someone who puts up a good fight, but someone who commands respect. Jeremy Corbyn commands respect because he has integrity. That is what makes him a leader.<br><strong>Timmon Wallis</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 An excellent piece of reminiscence from Ronan Bennett on what constitutes \u201cleadership\u201d. And to those who made the right call he could have added Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP who retired in 2005 as father of the house and who consistently had the guts to make the right call, usually finding himself in the same lobby as Corbyn. On Iraq and the Falklands war (remember the Belgrano?), to name but two. And to face the same denigration.<br><em>Benedict Birnberg</em><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ronan Bennett suggests that the key to good leadership is being on the right side of the argument even when unpopular. He is wrong. A successful leader clearly articulates a direction and goals already felt by many to be necessary, gives confidence that they are achievable, and inspires unity of purpose. In a democracy, this means winning the support of party, leadership, and a majority of the electorate. It is here that Jeremy Corbyn is failing. He is right when he says that strong leadership has nothing to do with starting wars, which are often a distraction from weakness.<br><strong>Jim Pettman</strong><br><em>Anglars-Juillac, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Are Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans for \u201corganising academies\u201d for Labour party members (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/jeremy-corbyn-plans-academies-to-train-labour-activists\" title=\"\">Corbyn promises academies for activists</a>, 14 September) the same as those Tom Watson has been working on and announced on 12 September in <a href=\"http://www.tom-watson.com/oneyearon\" title=\"\">his report on his first 12 months in office as deputy leader</a>? Is this another example of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s problem as a leader \u2013 the first among equals \u2013 in not acknowledging the role of his colleagues in an effective shadow cabinet?<br><strong>Rosemary Ross</strong><br><em>Harpenden, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I read Ronan Bennett\u2019s column with growing interest and agreement. Many times friends have called my sanity into doubt because I have surely joined the lunatic fringe in supporting Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. These two men have their leadership qualities questioned every day of the week by their dissenting MPs, social media and the press, and manage to rise above the vitriol \u2013 they have taken the flak and are still standing, and that says it all about resilience, courage and determination. And yes they have made the right calls in the past, and yes that is why they are appealing to a large swathe of the public. Corbyn showed real leadership quality at prime minister\u2019s questions last week on the retrograde move to bring back grammar schools. If he wins the leadership contest, let\u2019s hope this ushers in a respectful, unified party. <br><strong>Judith Daniels</strong><br><em>Great Yarmouth, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 When Labour lost elections in 2010 and 2015 it was rightly accused of not listening to the views of many of its actual and potential voters. Election defeats, the rise of Ukip and the Brexit vote are all telling us that large numbers of people are discontented. Now I\u2019m witnessing another kind of \u201cnot listening\u201d \u2013 the constant demeaning of the people who support Jeremy Corbyn. This seems very similar to the \u201cnot listening\u201d to people\u2019s concern about immigration prior to the 2010 election and the \u201cnot listening\u201d to concerns about the EU before the referendum.</p> <p>Among the liberalish left, why would we not be listening? Perhaps mainly because opinion formers fear that Corbyn (or what he stands for) can never win power. This seems similar to the view surrounding Trump\u2019s early stages on the campaign trail. But look where he is now. Another fear is that his support is \u201chard left\u201d. But look more carefully at where his support is coming from. Much of it is from young people. Listening to a young woman speaking in defence of him on Question Time on Thursday, it is impossible to imagine her \u2013 and, I suspect, many like her \u2013 as \u201chard left\u201d.</p> <p>What I hear is not from the \u201chard left\u201d but from those who see there is much going wrong with our country. The growing increase in inequality, the favouring of those who have wealth, the apparent inability of government to bring to account corporations that avoid tax, the fallout from the 2008 crash hitting, through austerity, those least responsible for it while the banks benefit from public subsidy.</p> <p>So shouldn\u2019t we be trying to understand what it is that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters are telling us rather than obsessing over the man himself?<br><strong>Dave Duggan</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p>",
  "<p>There is an admirable calm in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> that contrasts immensely with the bluster and hysteria that has come to dominate a lot of the political discourse in Europe. So when on Saturday <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-drops-the-we-can-do-it-slogan-catchphrase-migration-refugees/\" title=\"\">she distanced herself from the \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d</a> (we can do it) slogan she\u2019d so often repeated about the refugee crisis, many wondered if the chancellor had lost her confidence. Merkel may not be called \u201cMutti\u201d that often any more. Yet she remains Europe\u2019s towering figure. She also appears rather lonely at the top. In fact, Germany as a whole looks lonely these days, as it deals with the monumental task of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/germany-unveils-integration-law-for-refugees-migrants\" title=\"\">integrating more than a million refugees</a>, whose arrival last year up-ended politics and triggered much national soul-searching.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/angela-merkel-marine-le-pen-europe-destiny\">Angela Merkel and Marine Le Pen: one of them will shape Europe\u2019s future | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t be under any illusion that diplomacy, whether at the European summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/bratislava-summit-donald-tusk-urges-eu-leaders-not-to-waste-brexit-crisis\" title=\"\">in Bratislava</a> or in New York, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/united-nations-criticism-refugee-crisis-plan-human-rights\" title=\"\">UN summit on refugees</a> opens on Monday, will offer much relief. Germany will basically need to cope on its own. If I had to bet, I\u2019d say its chances are good. This is arguably the single most important challenge Europe faces: overcoming the shock of seeing huge numbers of victims of the world\u2019s chaos turn up in cities and regions previously sheltered from external disruption. Germany stands at the heart of this test, and its neighbours are watching closely.</p> <p>There is no lack of gloomy predictions. Nor is schadenfreude entirely absent when Germany\u2019s European partners wring their hands at the refugee problem. (France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, stooped low last year when he publicly smirked at suggestions Merkel should get the Nobel peace prize for welcoming refugees.) No small amount of criticism has been levelled at Merkel from populists across the continent, as well as from within her own party and governing coalition. Much less vociferously highlighted are the reasons why Germany may just succeed.</p> <p>Of course, public mood can swerve in unpredictable directions. Amazing scenes of Germans applauding refugees as they got off trains were swiftly forgotten after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/cologne-sex-assault-attacks-case-collapses\" title=\"\">Cologne New Year\u2019s Eve attacks</a>. That\u2019s not to say German civil society isn\u2019t deploying impressive efforts to make sure the migration phenomenon ends on a positive note.</p> <p>On a recent study tour of \u201cGermany and the refugees story\u201d organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation, I met incredibly dedicated social workers, NGO representatives and city or regional officials in Cologne and Stuttgart. Many did speak of the difficulties they encounter, not least the bureaucratic hurdles that stand in the way of easing refugees into the labour market after they\u2019ve taken German language courses. But what struck me was how upbeat most of these interlocutors wanted to appear. Merkel may want to play down \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d, but those words have nevertheless said something about the nation\u2019s state of mind. One outstanding example of can-do spirit comes from a business in Stuttgart called Lapp Group, which has taken 12 young refugees into apprenticeship programmes. Hearing these smiling young men from Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea describe how they intend to make the most of this chance helps dispel doubts. The Lapp family, who founded this electric cable producing firm in the 1950s and still run it, are keen to take their proud share of a nationwide effort.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/germany-unveils-integration-law-for-refugees-migrants\">Germany unveils integration law for refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as Germany reinvented itself after the war, and just as it achieved reunification, this is seen as a defining moment in the country\u2019s history. The Lapp family\u2019s role may be small in the wider picture, but it certainly makes the word \u201csolidarity\u201d sound less empty than it does in much of the rest of Europe.</p> <p>If any country can succeed in coping with a massive influx of&#xa0;refugees, surely this is it. Stuttgart\u2019s lush residential neighbourhoods and its industrial powerhouses point to Germany\u2019s thriving economy. And the prosperity and stability of Germany\u2019s institutions are key assets in the integration effort. Unemployment is at its lowest since 1990, and trade surpluses are at a record high. As Armin Laschet, deputy federal chairman of Merkel\u2019s CDU party, puts it, the question isn\u2019t so much whether Germany can afford financially to deal with the refugee equation, \u201cit\u2019s whether our society can get to grips\u201d with the new situation.</p> <p>Globalisation is widely faulted for breeding populism. But Germany has dramatically benefited from globalisation, thanks to its exports. What is at stake here has more to do&#xa0;with adapting to new forms of diversity, as the country imports population groups. This is the first ever wave of Arab immigrants to Germany, whose Muslim community had since the 1950s been essentially composed of Turkish \u201cGastarbeiter\u201d (guest workers).</p> <p>The positive side is that Germany has none of France\u2019s historical hangovers in dealing with Arab immigration. The less positive side is that it took decades for Germans to accept that Turkish workers and their families would stay and become full citizens.</p> <p>It\u2019s been said German officials have tried to paper over the magnitude of the task \u2013 including when information was scant about the Cologne attacks. But it\u2019s hard to deny that managing public perceptions is as important as setting up education, housing and work for the newly arrived. This sits at the centre of Merkel\u2019s numerous \u201ckeep calm\u201d messages. It is also at the centre of Germany\u2019s revived interest in European defence and security. Merkel is acutely aware that if terrorism rears its head again, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/germany-bavaria-police-attacks-munich-ansbach-wurzburg\" title=\"\">as it did this summer</a>, the nation\u2019s quest for a new sense of cohesion might quickly be shattered.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s strengths in addressing its refugee challenge can be easily overlooked. The reasons why Merkel repeated \u201c<em>Wir schaffen das</em>\u201d so often have not suddenly vanished \u2013 even if she\u2019s toned down the message. But just as Europe needs Germany to succeed in integrating refugees (otherwise populists will benefit everywhere), the&#xa0;country needs Europe to act collectively to make sure the conditions for integration aren\u2019t thwarted by violence. Loneliness is something it can\u2019t afford.</p>",
  "<p>As we hurtle toward the Labour party conference, our attention diverted only momentarily by the Liberal Democrats, engaged not so much in a conference as a seaside book festival, it is time to consider what happens after Jeremy Corbyn wins the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\" title=\"\">leadership election</a>. We have to assume that he will win, but since freak events have become the political norm, picture waking up a week hence with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/owen-smith\" title=\"\">Owen Smith</a> as leader. He would have won by promising to be exactly like Corbyn on all matters of policy, but younger, more approachable, and <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-leadership-hopeful-owen-smith-8803113\" title=\"\">better at getting laid</a> (more precisely, he told the Daily Mirror that he had fought off hundreds of lads to get his wife, so he \u201cknew how to win\u201d.

Owen Smith! That\u2019s who).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labour-leadership-contest-one-result-five-scenarios-corbyn-smith\">Labour leadership contest: one result, five possible scenarios</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith has not set out a moderate, centrist alternative and would not have a mandate to deliver one. This is not his fault: moderate, \u201celectable\u201d Labour has no innate identity at the moment and only defines itself against others; it is against inequality, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-to-call-for-unity-equality-and-successful-exit-from-eu\" title=\"\">unlike Theresa May</a>, really means it; it is internationalist and open, but not in a George Osborne-y way; it is anti-austerity, but not like one of those lunatic Corbynistas; it is pro-immigrants but, in the interests of realism and winning back its heartlands, anti-immigration; it is strongly in favour of winning elections. It would have taken a truly extraordinary, mercurial, charismatic individual to turn all that into a credible political programme, and Smith should never blame himself that he wasn\u2019t that.</p> <p>Returning to the more likely scenario, Corbyn is leader, probably with a lower number of votes, which he will ascribe to the NEC rules on who received a ballot paper, but a larger proportion. It is in anticipation of this probability that a number of rather aerated attacks on the Corbyn phenomenon came out at the weekend: the Mail on Sunday described a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3794817/Secret-summit-wipe-Watson-Corbyn-cabal-plans-political-execution-deputy-leader-Downton-mansion-lorded-TUC-bosses.html\" title=\"\">\u201csecret summit\u201d in a \u201cDownton mansion\u201d</a> at which Corbyn and his \u201ccabal\u201d plotted the \u201cpolitical assassination\u201d of Tom Watson and general secretary Iain McNicol. It is true that the leader of the opposition held a meeting, which a number of people attended who would reasonably be called his allies, some of them even in his employ; and they got the address right, though Esher Place is actually a training centre and is no longer used for the oppression of a service class in Downton-style dinner parties. Regrettably, it was sourced from someone who was not there, and was wrong in every other particular.</p> <p>The Sunday Times, meanwhile, picked up the evidence of Dispatches, airing on Monday night, which claims to show secretly filmed footage of Momentum groups plotting to infiltrate the Labour party and deselect MPs. What it actually shows is a bloke who isn\u2019t a Momentum member, wishing he could deselect his MP, and a woman named Jill Mountford, from the Alliance for Workers\u2019 Liberty, giving out ruthless, Trotskyite ideas such as \u201cfight for what you believe in\u201d.</p> <p>Taken together with the levels of despair and animosity within the parliamentary Labour party, encapsulated in Alan Johnson\u2019s sorrowful conclusion that the <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-have-got-to-recapture-the-labour-party-otherwise-its-dead-and-finished-3r30ghb7g\" title=\"\">Labour party must be recaptured or face extinction</a>, it is plain that the warring parties have to re-evaluate.

This, as anyone can tell you who turned themselves blue in the face doing the same to Ukip, will never work. I remember a Ukip councillor opining on Facebook that foetuses with a disability should be compulsorily aborted, because they were simply unaffordable. Surely that would eject them from reasonable discourse? Surely Nigel Farage wouldn\u2019t be asked on Question Time for the 14th time?</p> <p>The fact is, any group clustered around conviction politics will contain people with unbelievable views; you will find Greens in favour of a one-child policy and Conservatives in favour of repatriating second-generation immigrants. To fixate on them is unfair, but that\u2019s politics; the more serious problem is that if you can only see a party or a group where it manifests most clearly the things that you hate about it, you will never reach any understanding of why people love it. Most Momentum members would not want to put a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/angela-eagles-constituency-office-vandalised-after-leadership-bid-launch\" title=\"\">brick through Angela Eagle\u2019s window</a>, or threaten to throw acid in anyone\u2019s face, or have any great enthusiasm for deselections, if some better solution, such as establishing shared values and working on them together, could be reached.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Labour MPs who will not work with Corbyn must set up or occupy another party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Revelling in the worst of the fringes prevents any meaningful connection with the best. How bizarre this must look to the untrained observer, that an army of new activists arrives and they are dismissed en masse as revolutionaries. Most of them want nothing more radical than to spend less than 70% of their wages on rent; Trotsky would laugh them out of town. For Corbyn\u2019s part, he needs to do more than simply deny that deselections are part of his plan: he needs to look like a man who genuinely wants to understand what people like about Dan Jarvis. He needs to be able to give his victory speech without mentioning the size of his mandate; it is not the language of unity. It is like avoiding a pub brawl by pointing to your four gigantic friends.</p> <p>If none of this is possible \u2013 if the Corbyn camp is already seeking conciliation, and the resistance is simply implacable \u2013 they need to move beyond it, and fast. The Labour MPs who will not work with Corbyn must set up or occupy another party \u2013 there was talk of using the Cooperative party as such a vehicle. Those who remain in Labour will have to drop the betrayal narrative and build a story that doesn\u2019t rely on, but crucially doesn\u2019t preclude, working with others. Even if a snap election is not called in May, it will not wait until 2020; the opposition does not have time for a fight to the death. It must rescue the convictions that are still alive.</p>",

Her aim in this pre-campaign period is to present herself as credible, to move away from divisive positions and to re-position herself as a kind of calm, unifying authority. She said she would run a \u201cjoyous\u201d campaign.

We really had no idea how old he was or what his backstory was \u2013 but were all a bit crushed when we found out he had got married one summer. He said he wanted us to think like adults, and what music to the ears of a micromanaged country girl that was. His classes were magic. No one in my family had even considered law as an option, and I had plenty of frank feedback about it being out of my league. Mr Behan was very supportive.</p> <p>Mr Behan continued to inspire generations of girls from that school, a very modest but academically successful convent school in Kerry.

She made us look at things in a different way. </p> <p>She had a voice that boomed across the classroom and some feared the woman, but not us in the know. In my head, she was always dressed in smart, no-nonsense blouses and tartan skirts with bright red lipstick. I have taken much of what she taught me through my adult life, and now as a teacher myself I find myself \u201cdoing a Mrs Kiloh\u201d. A few years ago, she and I crossed paths and I had the pleasure of meeting her son Bruce. I told Bruce how his mum made me want to teach and how special she made us all feel. A few days later, Bruce called and sent me a photo of a recipe I\u2019d written and given to Mrs Kiloh about 39 years before \u2013 he told me that every family birthday she would get out the Dutch crunch recipe and have a plate freshly baked on the table.</p> <h2>\u2018There was a rumour she was an Iranian princess\u2019</h2> <p><em>Rebecca, 35, on Dr Habib</em></p> <p>Dr Habib was a passionate teacher. She told us we must care about maths like we did our favourite pop group \u2013 at the time I thought that was ridiculous. She set us twice as much homework as the top sets for GCSE and told us that she had predicted us all A*s. Every weekend we would do extra algebra tests from a book that must have been 50 years old. They would take hours and I resented it. </p> <p>But she also baked cakes for us and cried once (I think when I didn\u2019t do my homework and was being a petulant teen). Back then, I thought it was crazy. Now I wish I had told her what an amazing teacher she was and how her commitment and passion enabled me to get that A* in a subject I found hard. </p> <p>There was also a rumour that went round the school that she was an Iranian princess. I wish I knew what happened to Dr Habib \u2013 I think of her often when teaching my own students.</p> <h2>\u2018In our last year, he taught us university economics\u2019</h2> <p><em>Neve Hristova, 35, on Robert Bateman</em></p> <p>My favourite teacher was Mr Robert Bateman, who taught me economics and business studies while at Worksop College between 1998 and 2000. He was an extraordinary teacher who came at his students with a firm belief in their intelligence and ability to learn. I was a scholarship student who had just travelled from Bulgaria for sixth form college. He was the first teacher who made me believe I could really excel in a strange new environment, and that I had things to bring to the table, despite my acute case of being poor and foreign. <br></p> <p>I remember the way he would conduct his lessons. In our last year, he basically took us through economics theory taught at first-year university, lecture-style, and we were encouraged to ask questions. He didn\u2019t stint on his praise when we got things right, nor his ire if we were playing stupid. He made economics relatable and fun. <br></p> <p>He also wrote the best, most encouraging report card I ever received at college. I still have it, tucked away in an old economics textbook that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of.</p> <h2>\u2018I actually joined the Labour party because of him\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Williams, 36, on Mr Foley </em></p> <p>I had some great teachers at Haydon Comprehensive, Northwood, but none so tolerant of my arrogance and constant baiting of his left wing views. He taught me economics at A-level and I got an A. I would love for him to know that his views, always offered in a lighthearted non-condescending manner, had an impact on me later in life. I have actually joined the Labour party and switched from my rightwing economic views. He always had wise words, which I pass on. I miss and remember the Friday-afternoon \u201cgraveyard slot\u201d lessons. He, along with some other great A-level teachers ignited my academic interest.<br></p> <h2>\u2018She is the only teacher who wrote \u201crubbish\u201d across my essays\u2019</h2> <p><em>Michael Cooke,58, on Janet Peacock</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d794f69da5975faf6a1b70bb801f9500acd16344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d794f69da5975faf6a1b70bb801f9500acd16344/0_495_1175_705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cooke has been searching for his teacher Janet Peacock for 30 years\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cooke has been searching for his teacher Janet Peacock for 30 years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cooke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ms Janet Peacock was an Englishwoman who taught me in the third form at Cornwall College, Montego Bay, Jamaica between 1970-71. I remember her ruthless honesty \u2013 she is the only teacher who both praised and also wrote \u201crubbish\u201d across my essays. She taught me think critically and to observe my own landscape and culture at a time when colonial education was still predominant in Jamaica. I now live in the UK and have tried for 30 years to find Ms Peacock and to say thanks. </p> <h2>\u2018He introduced me to the beauty of literature\u2019</h2> <p><em>Joan Opie, 60, on Mr Coleman</em></p> <p>My English teacher, Mr Coleman, was amazing. I was a shy child with a passion for reading, literature and poetry, who had just failed the 11-plus and was sent to the local secondary modern school in Redcar. For some years I secretly read poetry in my bedroom, hiding it behind a comic. As a working-class child there would have been nothing but torment and ridicule from my six siblings if they\u2019d known.<br></p> <p>Mr Coleman was the first person I met who had a similar passion. He introduced me to classic literature, which I absorbed and came to love. During the first term at Coatham County Modern School he read The Lady of Shalott to the class. I was mesmerised by the language and the way he expressed it. It is still my favourite poem today and I continually read and listen to it. Mr Coleman introduced me to the beauty of literature; something I have now passed to my daughter, who has just published her first book. </p> <h2>\u2018Twenty years later, the sparkle in his eye was contagious as ever\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Borek, 62, on Frank McQuay</em></p> <p>Frank McQuay was the first teacher at MJ Hobbs School in Hampton, Ontario, to even notice me as an individual, and to teach me that being distinct from the herd just made me an individual rather than an outcast. <br></p> <p>As a small and socially awkward grade eight student, prone to ridicule and occasionally bullying, he paired me with \u201cbig Pete\u201d, a large lumbering teen who had already been held back twice. Impressive as was his size, he also drove his own car to school, and was somewhat of an adult to us. Big Pete, (who became an electrician) needed a bit of help with \u201cbook learning\u201d and quite easily accepted my informal tutoring. I in turn enjoyed his unvoiced protection from any teasing. I only realised that this ploy was purposefully established by Mr McQuay a decade later. I met him some 20 years later and the sparkle in his eyes was as contagious as ever. A few years later, I found out he had passed and vowed that I would pay forward whatever intangible lessons he had taught me.</p> <h2>\u2018He let me ignite flash powder during the school play\u2019</h2> <p><em>Clive, 68, on Mr Griffiths</em></p> <p>Mr Griffiths, headteacher of my primary school in Waterloo, Merseyside, around 1957, was my inspiration. I asked him what the term \u201cimpedance\u201d meant (on a pair of old headphones). He gave me a book called The Foundations of Wireless and suggested it would provide the answer.</p> <p>It more than answered my question; it set in motion a fascination for radio engineering that would take me to more than 30 countries, installing radio stations. What I remember most about him was his humanity. In an era of the cane, he was an enlightened head and no corporal punishment happened in his school. He also permitted me to demonstrate my early knowledge of chemistry: I ignited flash powder during the school play and filled the hall with smoke. As a result of being inspired by him to follow a career that I loved, when I became a teacher myself I tried to do the same for my students. It paid off \u2013 the father of one of my ex-pupils phoned me to thank me for teaching his son how to code in Basic: he ended up with Google, in California. </p> <h2>\u2018We wore what we liked and went barefoot everywhere\u2019</h2> <p><em>Richard Tagart, 60, on Tony (Gerald Anthony) Lowther</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6f75adc7d622ea3c20fa8ba7c7a35551250f5b/0_0_1032_1456/709.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex &amp; operated from 1971 until well into the 1990s (moving to new premises in Mayfield in 1981). \u201c\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Tagart\u2019s teacher Tony Lowther \u201cThe school was just outside the village of Jarvis Brook, near Crowborough in East Sussex.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Richard Tagart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The son of a brigadier in the British Indian army and graduate of Trinity College Cambridge, Mr Lowther taught me for English and RE at Earnley School and was headmaster of Rotherfield Hall school, both of which I attended between 1969 and 1974. <br></p> <p>He had a wonderfully irreverent way of bringing literature and Bible stories to life. Rotherfield Hall was modelled on AS Neill\u2019s Summerhill and gave us the freedom to find out who we were, rather than trying to stuff us into predetermined moulds. We were on first-name terms with all adults, wore what we liked, did what we liked (except for having to go to class) and went barefoot everywhere all the year round. A truly unique education. <br></p> <p>I remember his sense of humour. We had a home farm and he was delighted that our new pigs were mating, announcing \u201cWe\u2019ve got sex in the pig sties!\u201d \u2013 without seeing my mother standing just out of sight. </p> <p>After university, I worked at my old school for several years before going to work overseas and stayed in touch with him until his death in 2008.

His father was an executive at Cathay Pacific \u2013 \u201cI think I have a deep guilt at having taken so many flights,\u201d he says \u2013 and his experience of other cultures encourages him to think that if people can be persuaded there are different ways of living without our overweening dependence on fossil fuels, we can switch rapidly to those other modes. \u201cYoung people see this,\u201d he says, as their exposure to the internet gives them a broader viewpoint of other cultures. \u201cMy grandfather doesn\u2019t believe in it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/18/deliciously-stella-clean-eating-instagram-comedian-bella-younger-interview\">Deliciously Stella: the Instagram sensation serving up raw Kinder eggs on avo-toast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His sense of urgency has deeply personal roots as well.

Al Gore\u2019s 2006 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/17/documentary.algore\">An Inconvenient Truth</a> won an Oscar, but was a documentary, beautifully paced and shot, but essentially the filming of an hour-long standup lecture. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/20/the-age-of-stupid-review\">The Age of Stupid</a> looked and sounded different, but underneath was much the same format, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pete-postlethwaite\">Pete Postlethwaite</a> narrating an impassioned polemic against rampant consumerism.

  "<p>This interview was meant to happen months ago, but was cancelled at the last minute, rescheduled and then cancelled again, and this carried on all summer. When at last we meet, Malia Bouattia&#xa0;apologises with consummate elegance, blaming pressures on a diary over which she has \u201cno control at all\u201d. I have a strong suspicion that this is not true. She offers it without a trace of unease, and I&#xa0;can\u2019t decide whether the grace of what I\u2019m sure is a&#xa0;deceit is really quite impressive, or offputting. In fact I can\u2019t recall ever feeling so&#xa0;many powerful but contradictory emotions about someone I&#xa0;have only just met.</p> <p>Bouattia\u2019s manner can be almost glassily cool, but I think that\u2019s to hide how nervous she is, and the vulnerability is very touching. But the next minute she can become formidably impressive, and fill me with admiration, and seconds later become maddening. By the end I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m ranting at her like a lunatic. \u201cFor the record,\u201d I yell, \u201cthis has never happened before! I am not in the habit of shouting in interviews!\u201d I am dying of embarrassment when I leave, and at a loss to explain why this&#xa0;happened.</p> <p>Bouattia, 28, has had to deal with so much anger by now that you might think she would be immune to it, but I don\u2019t think she is. Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\" title=\"\">she became president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in April</a> she served two years as the union\u2019s black students\u2019 officer, during which she rejected a motion condemning Isis. She was promptly branded a terrorist sympathiser by the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\" title=\"\">who chose not to report that her only objection to the motion was its poor wording</a>, which she wanted to correct. The deluge of death threats necessitated police protection, but still were nothing compared with the uproar her presidential election provoked. That Bouattia is the first black woman and first Muslim to be elected NUS president was lost in Fleet&#xa0;Street\u2019s frenzy to dig up old comments she had made that \u201cproved\u201d she was antisemitic.</p> <p>She had described the University of Birmingham as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\" title=\"\">\u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and on another occasion referred to \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media outlets\u201d.</a> More than 300 Jewish leaders complained. \u201cThis was a few years ago and I was talking about quite a particular context where there were a lot of activists that were very vocally supportive of the state of Israel and its actions. I was part of the Palestine society that, for most of the years that I was involved in it, was just trying to exist as a society let alone actually build solidarity, so it was because of that opposition, the constant tension and having disruptions for events that were taking place \u2026 you know, holding solidarity demonstrations and having opposing ones with Israeli flags flying, speakers being heckled. I wasn\u2019t being critical of the number of Jewish students or the size of the Jewish society at Birmingham. It was very much in relation to the opposition to any kind of Palestine solidarity efforts that were taking place.\u201d</p> <p>She clarifies that she simply meant that Birmingham\u2019s student union had the biggest and most vociferously Zionist Jewish society, and that she was referring to media outlets that promote a heavily pro-Israeli line, not evoking the old conspiracy theory about Jewish control of the media.</p> <p>Bouattia thinks the real reason for all the animosity is not antisemitism, but the radicalism of her leftwing politics. Though not a Labour member, she is a big fan of Jeremy Corbyn, and believes it was her promise of a bolder political agenda that won her the election. \u201cWe need action, and we need it now, and we need it differently to what we\u2019ve had before. We can\u2019t come to the table trying to compromise any more. That hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>But Bouattia\u2019s political ambitions go way beyond campaigning against education cuts or fee hikes. \u201cWe want a sense of international solidarity. We don\u2019t sit in a bubble. We have international students, migrant communities, and we can\u2019t sit by and be silent when spaces for education are for us to be critical of the systems, and of this country\u2019s role in escalating international crises, and escalating oppression of other groups. Liberation campaigns relate their work back to global movements for justice and solidarity, and we\u2019re much stronger when we\u2019re united.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I find this both quite touching and perfectly appropriate from a student politician. But judging from an average turnout in student union elections of just 18%, the majority of undergraduates don\u2019t. I was a bit of a student political hack, and within that small world Bouattia is perfectly recognisable. To the overwhelming majority of seven million NUS members, however, her views and values, even the language she uses, are incomprehensible. If they don\u2019t share her commitment to fighting global injustice, but care about how to pay their rent instead, shouldn\u2019t their union leader confine herself to representing their interests?</p> <p>But the NUS is fighting on all fronts, Bouattia says, and it campaigns just as hard on education issues as, say, Palestinian rights. I wonder how much time she has ever spent in the company of apolitical students who came to university for the football, beer and toga parties, and are bewildered and alienated by NUS motions calling for the abolition of all prisons. Why does she think, I ask, that student voter turnout is so low?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6bb8a594b1bdfa90531c9bd2ee9de3621b0af9/0_23_4248_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malia Bouattia, speaking at an NHS demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Armstead/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s necessarily low if we compare it with voter turnout more generally.\u201d After I run through the average turnout for general, mayoral and devolved parliaments, she takes a new tack.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I think that when we think about the context in which we\u2019re in, where there\u2019s active demonisation of being politically active, you\u2019ve got the Prevent agenda [the government counter-terrorism programme to combat radicalisation], which is, like, actually hunting down students that choose to be politicised, particularly those who are racialised. We\u2019re at a time where things like the Prevent agenda quite explicitly target black and Muslim activists. I\u2019m seeing the realities of that, which is a turn away from taking political action. There is a total fear that they\u2019re going to be deported, and this is what they go home to. Their&#xa0;parents will tell them, \u2018You\u2019re going to end up in Guant\u00e1namo. You could end up deported to a homeland you\u2019re linked to, but have never even visited. You could end up having all your doors shut. You could end up being thrown out of university.\u2019 These are very real questions that people have to think about.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not this is true, it still fails to explain why more than 80% of NUS members don\u2019t even turn out to vote. But I am struck by the scale of influence Bouattia accords to&#xa0;Prevent. Even if it frightened every single Muslim student away from politics, that would still only account for about 5% of NUS&#xa0;members.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you see the Prevent agenda is not just simply targeting Muslims \u2013 as though an incredibly racist policy could even distinguish between the Muslims and non-Muslims. One black man with a beard and another, they all become Muslims, so, by extension, any racialised person becomes a target. And actually the agenda is targeting far more than that. It\u2019s a wider-reaching attack on politicised people and groups, anti-austerity activists, anti\u2011fracking activists, there\u2019s a whole host of people that this extends to now.\u201d Does she think Prevent\u2019s intention was always to target&#xa0;all forms of activism, and to use radicalisation as a convenient excuse to conceal grander ambitions?</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do believe that. I do believe that is has incredibly racist intentions, and intentions to crack down on people\u2019s civil liberties. I do believe&#xa0;that.\u201d</p> <p>If she could abolish Prevent today, what would she do to combat radicalisation? \u201cI would propose looking at the state of our foreign policy. And we\u2019ve cut every space of constructive engagement, like youth centres. Cost of living\u2019s increased, employment prospects are low, access to university is becoming ever harder. Even if people have accessed higher education, they\u2019ve accumulated vast amounts of debt. And have they had a positive experience, being forced to engage with content that doesn\u2019t relate to them, and perhaps is psychologically destructive? When we look at the incredibly Eurocentric curriculum, where people don\u2019t see themselves in what they\u2019re studying, and can\u2019t relate to it, and feel that their European counterparts hit the ground running, they can\u2019t see themselves advancing in the subjects.\u201d</p> <p>Bouattia says she has no ambitions for a political career, and sees her future in academia instead, which may be for the best, as I\u2019m not sure how her anti-radicalisation strategy would go down on the doorstep. But if her politics would strike most British voters as extreme, they make more sense from the perspective of her own life experience.</p> <p>Until the age of seven, she had a blissfully happy childhood in Algeria, but in the civil war academics became targets for abduction and murder, and the family fled to Birmingham. Taken in by Christian ministries, they found themselves in an alien world of brussels sprouts and a language Bouattia could not speak. She was fluent within two months, but remained desperately homesick, and consoled herself by drawing the Algerian map all over everything at school.</p> <p>After studying a degree in culture studies she read an MA in postcolonial theory at the University of Birmingham, before becoming the NUS black students\u2019 officer and then president. \u201cBut I think the sense of displacement is still with me. When Daily Mail articles are written, and quite racist, Islamophobic trolls come after you over social media, you\u2019re very much reminded that people don\u2019t feel you belong here. My parents took us out to access a better space of education, to be better equipped to go back to Algeria and give back.\u201d Her election was widely celebrated in Algeria, and she goes on: \u201cThat made me more at ease with all that I do here, and how it feeds into the bigger picture, because at times when you\u2019re so intricately involved in something locally, you start to wonder how does this fit into the bigger picture? How does this fit into the wider struggle?\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she worries that the antisemitism row has diminished her power as president. \u201cNot necessarily. Not so far,\u201d is a surprising answer, but she says that she thinks the controversy raised the profile of the NUS, and provided new platforms for her \u201cto put out our vision of the future\u201d.</p> <p>Does she think she has ever said anything antisemitic? \u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, and if my words were misinterpreted, then in future I\u2019ll take the time to make sure I break them down and explain them.\u201d Are there any comments she has made in the past that she would not now say?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not saying it again, it\u2019s about just breaking them down to explain what I meant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e604b1cdb07808f41aa137e918fe268f270f5/0_300_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Cardiff university prote against a planned lecture by Germaine Greer in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Jewish critics still maintain that she is antisemitic. Others argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. Bouattia maintains that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted her, and are wrong. I think this would be a perfectly defensible position for her to take if only she applied the same principle when student unions invoke the NUS\u2019s no-platform policy. I want to talk to her about Germaine Greer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university\" title=\"\">who Cardiff University students\u2019 union demanded be no platformed last year</a>, owing to her views on transsexuals. This is when the argument begins.</p> <p>Most graduates of my age, I say, are appalled by a campus culture that no-platforms a speaker for holding opinions some students might find offensive. If someone cannot bear to be exposed to challenging views at university, what are they doing there? \u201cIt\u2019s a case of seeing those ideas as spreading forms of hatred.\u201d Does she think that Greer spreads hatred? \u201cI support the union\u2019s right to no-platform her. To hold transphobic views spreads hate.\u201d</p> <p>But Greer has repeatedly stated that she does not hate transsexuals, is not critical of their choices, and couldn\u2019t care less if anyone wants to reassign their gender. She simply does not share the belief that a man who decides to live as a woman was female all along, or that surgical procedures can wholly reassign gender.</p> <p>Now a woman sitting at what is known as the liberation desk in the office, who works on campaigns for LGBT, black, female and disabled students, gets involved. What Greer thinks she means is not the point, she says; the trans community consider her a \u201cfascist\u201d, the NUS respects their view, ergo Greer is a fascist.</p> <p>But Bouattia doesn\u2019t accept that just because some Jewish people consider her antisemitic, that means she is. Why, then, does she not accord this principle to anyone else? \u201cThis is the NUS policy,\u201d she repeats. It\u2019s like talking to a speaking clock. I suggest that when a policy ends up branding Greer a fascist, it\u2019s time for an urgent policy review. Universities exist as places where people engage with ideas, and learn; they are not meant to be sealed panic rooms, are they? \u201cThis is the NUS policy.\u201d</p> <p>While I get more and more worked up, Bouattia just smiles placidly. I ask her to call her parents the next day and ask them if they, as senior academics, agree that Greer is too dangerous to be allowed to talk to students. When I email Bouattia later in the week, she doesn\u2019t respond, and the press officer tells me she is out of the country and uncontactable.</p> <p>I get the impression that Bouattia is more fragile than the persona she presents. But perhaps, if one\u2019s own academic parents have been targets for&#xa0;assassination, the concept of safety on campus holds something different to mine.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who\u2019s ever watched toddlers playing in a sandpit knows that the concept of the death of the physical is vastly over-rated. These tiny tots \u2013 the very manifestations of Freud\u2019s self-obsessed, filterless id \u2013 will fixate on any worthless piece of plastic within their grasp, and will cut anyone who tries to come near it. \u201cMine!\u201d is the war cry of this generation (at least in their current, unsocialised guises). Physical objects are the simulacra of their mini selves, and ownership is their way of asserting control over their burgeoning sense of who they are. Like heck anyone\u2019s going to take that away from them.</p> <p>And yet there are predictions and bestsellers and trend look books that suggest that the future is not physical, but a clutter-free space in which we are surrounded by nothing but a handful of beautiful things.</p> <p>There are product makers who are trying with all their might to promote their versions of this streamlined, non-physical future by shaving off unnecessary extras. For example, earlier this month, Apple revealed its next generation phone. It does this literally every year. And literally every year, it crams more into something that fits into the palm of your hand. The current version has pixels on the screen that could have powered the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, at least part way. So that\u2019s a win for the end of stuff: iPhone has made a roomful of 50-year-old computers redundant.</p> <p>Apple is a kind of poster child for shearing off the unnecessary, shocking the status quo by making modifications to its products that seem genuinely to challenge the received wisdom about what a \u201ccomputer\u201d or a \u201cmobile phone\u201d actually is. With each groundbreaking release, its designers have successfully changed the public\u2019s perception by removing hard drives, memory towers and, now, the headphone jack. From now on, if you want to listen to music on your iPhone 7, you either use the same port as the charger, you use the enclosed adapter, or you do it wirelessly. Or you buy another adapter that lets you charge the device and listen at the same time.</p> <p>The public will have to jump in with both feet here. The company seems to know what it\u2019s doing; it predicted the USB revolution, the death of the CD-Rom, and has managed to get the power of a machine that took men to the moon into people\u2019s hands.</p> <p>On the surface, it seems that Apple is creating more, rather than less, physical stuff. Rather than lighten the load, the traveller\u2019s bag has become several wires heavier. But throw forward to a world where we connect to devices without wires at all \u2013 wireless charging stations, wireless headphones \u2013 and there is less, rather than more, to tote around. Apple has thrown the gauntlet down; now the rest of us must catch up.</p> <p>The classic 1984 Apple ad epitomises exactly this: the old, dark Orwellian army of worker drones is literally smashed to pieces by a revolutionary with high cheekbones wearing red hot pants and swinging a sledgehammer. Out with the old! Here is the new! To own an Apple product is to project a way of life that continually smashes the status quo.</p> <p>The Apple Way can never stop iterating or, in a recursive loop, it will have to smash itself. This is a lot to ask a device to do. And, in fact, the objects Apple sells have no inherent value. The company ensures that by inflating obsolescence with every year that passes \u2013 and every tantalising upgrade. And that is an invitation to discard.</p> <p>So much has been written about the minimalism promoted by Marie Kondo in her bestselling book <em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> that it would spill out of the doors and windows of a Tokyo flat. Her way of being rides the wave of anti-physical zeitgeist: get rid of things in your life that don\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d and live a more peaceful life in an empty house. It, and the cultures that are excited by it, are natural reactions to the overindulgences of the 20th century: insane accumulation and, ultimately, reality TV shows about hoarders.</p> <p>On the one hand, the fashion towards Kondo-style purging is the epitome of 21st-century capitalist privilege. Mercilessly discarding our physical surroundings in favour of inner peace will work for your joy factor, until you need to furnish a kids\u2019 party with paper plates and plastic cups. A cash-and-carry may not be the most personally fulfilling or joyful place to shop, but it is economical. And that one thrifty decision has filled your cupboards with 250-count napkins.</p> <p>On the other, the move to non-physical is a reaction to the modern economic condition. Young people can\u2019t afford their own homes and, if they can, they\u2019re scarcely larger than a shoebox. The fewer objects the digital nomad has, the less that has to be lugged around. But the post-physical generation who eat up the KonMarie Method, and the millennials for whom \u201chome\u201d equals a laptop and an internet connection, are faced with the death of the baby-boomer generation, the greatest demographic in history. And when that happens, they\u2019re going to have to hold every object that once meant something to someone whom they valued, and decide if it sparks joy or not.</p> <p>There is \u2013 or rather, there was \u2013 a pair of rose-coloured plastic vintage sunglasses on the shelf at the Oxfam branch on Nicolson Street in Edinburgh. There was nothing that set these specs apart from the rest on the shelf except that they were the only ones that had a white tag hanging from the temple on a piece of string. On one side, \u201cOxfam\u201d was stamped in a shade of lime green that, strangely, naturally matched the decade of the item it was attached to. On the other was a QR code, a boxy black and white icon. When it was read using an app on a phone, this physical manifestation of a hyperlink took the viewer through a wormhole that made the sunglasses infinitely more valuable than the rest.</p> <p>These sunglasses had been owned by a woman in her late 50s who had held on to them through various culls because she remembered wearing them around town in her 20s \u2013 specifically, on a seaside first date with a long-discarded boyfriend. They had had fish and chips wrapped in newspaper, and had walked along the waterfront before catching the bus back to town.</p> <p>All of this was precisely captured for the Shelflife project, a material cultures research study co-sponsored by the charity and the University of Edinburgh\u2019s art department. People who donated items to charity shops were asked to write down what it was, and examples of when they used it.</p> <p>Each physical object is part of a \u201cvalue constellation,\u201d reflected the project\u2019s lead, Chris Speed. In addition to observing how stories affected their price, Speed and his team were interested in unlocking what was in a person\u2019s mind\u2019s eye when they described the thing they were discarding. \u201cThere is extraordinary in the mundane,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A physical object becomes more valuable when the shared experiences are somehow expressed, and this is what the Shelflife project tried to do. And there are other examples of objects that even more explicitly represent collective meaning. After all, what is a society other than a collective agreement of the meaning of objects? The personal story attached to the tagged sunglasses make their value much greater in Marie Kondo\u2019s world. They probably have a greater meaning than the car iPhone charger you picked up at a service station because your battery was almost dead.</p> <p>But, in fact, an old, used iPhone wouldn\u2019t fly off the shelf in Oxfam any faster if it had one of Chris Speed\u2019s QR codes attached to it. The irony is that the mobile phone\u2019s social and intentional use is as an object of communication, but it\u2019s the sim card inside that may have more actual value than the phone itself. And even that only has value to the person using it. The device only represents potential, but that can\u2019t be realised without the other things that actually make it work.</p> <p>In fact, as our technological urges progress towards well-designed, physical objects that consolidate multiple solutions within single beautiful boxes, each device will be infinitely more precise, more connected and more smart. But this will render them infinitely more disposable \u2013 because they will be concepts, rather than objects.</p> <p>We will continue to absorb objects at the same rate as they\u2019re produced, quite possibly in greater quantities as the wheels of consumption are greased by compulsive clicks and same-day deliveries. But these objects will be transitory consumables, without inherent value \u2013 or \u201cjoy sparks\u201d, for those indoctrinated into the magic of tidying up \u2013 and won\u2019t last long enough to become as meaningful to us as the plastic personal identifiers that the children in the playground defend as if their little lives depended on them. As soon as our present is clear of clutter, our future will accidentally fill it.</p>",
  "<p>India has directly accused Pakistan of involvement in a deadly raid on a Kashmir army base that killed 17 soldiers, labelling its neighbour \u201ca terrorist state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/nine-indian-soldiers-and-four-militants-killed-in-kashmir-attack\">Sunday morning\u2019s attack</a> on the army camp near the disputed border with Pakistan was among the deadliest against security forces in Kashmir history, and sparked grief and anger across India.</p> <p>The death toll could yet grow, with about 35 soldiers injured, some critically.<br></p> <p>Four <em>fedayeen</em> \u2013 highly trained militants on what are essentially suicide missions \u2013 died in the three-hour assault on the base at Uri, near the militarised \u201cline of control\u201d that divides Indian Kashmir from the Pakistan-controlled side. </p> <p>The Indian army\u2019s director of general military operations (DGMO) said none of the four men was from the Indian side and that some of their equipment had Pakistani markings. </p> <p>It claimed they were members of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group alleged to have links to elements within the Pakistani government. </p> <p>About 13 or 14 of the soldiers died in fires started by the militants\u2019 incendiary ammunition, which consumed the temporary shelters and tents in which they had been sleeping. A rotation of units was under way, meaning more soldiers had been stationed on the base than usual, the DGMO said.</p> <p>Rajnath Singh, the Indian home minister, cancelled an overseas trip and held an emergency meeting on Sunday afternoon with top security officials. In a series of tweets, he accused Pakistan of responsibility for the attack.</p> <p>\u201cI am deeply disappointed with Pakistan\u2019s continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are definitive and conclusive indictions that the perpetrators of [the] Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped. Pakistan is a terrorist state and it should be identified and isolate as such.\u201d</p> <p>Condemning the \u201ccowardly\u201d attack, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he could \u201cassure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,\u201d he added.</p> <p>India\u2019s president, Pranab Mukherjee, said the country would not be cowed by the attack. \u201cWe will thwart the evil designs of terrorists and their backers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Former army officials and members of Modi\u2019s own party called for a more bellicose response than the largely diplomatic routes pursued after the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai or a January attack on a Punjab army base that killed seven.</p> <p>\u201cFor one tooth, the complete jaw,\u201d said Ram Madhav, the general secretary of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party. \u201cDays of so-called strategic restraint are over. If terrorism is instrument of the weak and coward, restraint in the face of repeated terror attacks betrays inefficiency and incompetence. India should prove otherwise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>No group has claimed responsibility for the assault and Pakistan has denied any involvement.

Before Sunday, separatist attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir had left 102 people dead so far this year, including 30 security personnel, 71 militants and one civilian, according to the South Asia Terrorism portal.</p> <p>Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir as their own and have fought three wars over the former princedom since partition in 1947. </p> <p>Sunday attack\u2019s came during a week of diplomatic wrangling between the pair. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has promised he will use a speech to the UN general assembly on Wednesday to \u201cemphatically highlight\u201d alleged human rights abuses against protesters by Indian authorities.</p> <p>Last week, Indian diplomats at the UN human rights council raised for the first time Pakistan\u2019s alleged mistreatment of its own separatists in Balochistan, a restive province in the country\u2019s south-west.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s attack is likely to prove a decisive blow to the latest tentative peace process between Islamabad and Delhi, which has been frozen since an attack in January by Pakistan-based militants against an air force base in Pathankot, Punjab.<br></p> <p>It appeared progress was being made when Modi flew to Lahore in December for a surprise meeting with Sharif, but disputes over the investigation of the Pathankot attack had chilled relations again. </p>",

The US on the political level committed some mistakes at least when they put the red line and then they didn\u2019t enforce that red line. So I think they should share that responsibility and they should admit more Syrians as refugees to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Even when refugees get on American soil, they face a lengthy wait to be cleared for asylum. Assil said he himself has cofounded a civil society group, cofounded a business and gained a job at a thinktank but is still in legal limbo, waiting on an asylum application filed in 2014. \u201cSo imagine how difficult it is for other people as well.\u201d</p> <p>Officials have said potential refugees are subject to a rigorous screening process that typically lasts two years and involves both in-person interviews and further vetting by the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the defense department and US Citizenship and Immigration Services and an examination of biographical and biometric data.</p> <p>Rouba Mhaissen, founder and director of the refugee initiative <a href=\"http://www.sdaid.org/about-us\">Sawa for Development and Aid</a>, said: \u201cWhen you hear \u2018110,000 to be admitted\u2019, this is amazing news, but between the moment this decision is taken and the moment these people arrive in the US, it can take up to two years.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest donor to refugee programmes and provides a third of the budget for the UN high commissioner for refugees. But politicians in Europe, where some 1 million people arrived last year, have expressed concern that Washington does not appreciate the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>Of the 110,000 that the US will admit in the coming year, 40,000 will come from the Middle East and South Asia. An additional 35,000 will come from Africa, 12,000 from east Asia, 4,000 from Europe and 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean. Some 14,000 slots do not have a refugee\u2019s place of origin specified.</p> <p>Mark Hetfield, president of <a href=\"http://www.hias.org/\">Hias</a>, which was created in New York in 1881 and is the oldest refugee agency in the world, said: \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised at the number increase but it\u2019s not nearly enough given what we should be doing or what we have done in the past. We have ceded leadership on this issue to other countries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/fear-forces-refugees-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-camp-return-conflict-zones-human-rights-watch-warns\">Fear forces refugees in world\u2019s largest camp to return to conflict zones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The system has become dominated by security apparatus and agencies, crippling the process and crying out for leadership from the White House, he added. </p> <p>In Canada, by contrast, prime minister Justin Trudeau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/world/americas/syria-refugees-arrive-in-canada.html\">has welcomed new arrivals at the airport</a> with the words, \u201cYou\u2019re safe at home now.\u201d If the US matched Canada\u2019s intake of refugeees in proportion to its population, the annual figure would be 250,000.</p> <p>Hetfield said: \u201cI think the president has been very reactive and not paid attention to refugee policy until this year. If Obama had done four years ago what he is doing now, I think we would be in a much better place to respond to refugees. But now he\u2019s very limited in what he can do.\u201d</p> <p>Washington also has been condemned for its passive approach to people fleeing a surge in violence in Central America. It announced last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/central-american-refugees-costa-rica-obama-administration\">Costa Rica would offer temporary protection</a> to Central American refugees, as American efforts had been overwhelmed since 2012 by a fivefold growth of people leaving Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.</p> <p>The White House has defended its actions. Josh Earnest, its press secretary, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/29/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-deputy-nsa-strategic\">told a recent briefing</a>: \u201cThe United States has already stepped up to the plate and played an important leading role in the response, both in terms of providing more humanitarian assistance than any other country in the world, and we certainly are playing an important role here in accepting refugees from that conflict. The United States is obviously in a different place, literally, than countries in Europe. The United States is separated by a large ocean when it comes to these refugees.</p> <p>\u201cSo the situation that we face is different when it comes to this set of refugees. And the president does believe it\u2019s important for the United States to do our part. That\u2019s why we increased our ambition and admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. But I think the president certainly would like to see the United States continue to ramp up our commitment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Adam Smith is blunt and to the point when I call him to suggest an interview. I want to talk to him about the Real Junk Food Project, which he founded, and suggest doing it at the cafe he set up in Leeds which uses waste food and operates on a pay-as-you-feel basis. \u201cWhich cafe? There are 30 of them. And that\u2019s just in Leeds.\u201d</p> <p>Bluntness may well be Smith\u2019s defining characteristic. A chef by training, who had, by his own admission, a troubled childhood, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwCt_8pXb4&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rOiW1BA3J6zAeo9JhOO6E_s\">he set up the project only three years ago</a>, and it\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride since then. He reels off some statistics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 6,000-square-foot warehouse just here in Leeds and we\u2019re intercepting between two and 10 tons of food a day. It\u2019s just gone crazy. There are 125 Real Junk Food cafes worldwide now, not just in Britain, but in Israel and Australia and we\u2019re about to launch 16 of them in America.\u201d</p> <p>And, no, he doesn\u2019t have time to do an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about me,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even met half the people who\u2019ve set up the cafes. It\u2019s much bigger than me now.\u201d It is pretty big, it\u2019s true, but I go up to Leeds anyway and, in the warehouse, it becomes more obvious why the project has taken off so dramatically. There\u2019s a mountain of food. Marks &amp; Spencer cakes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates and punnets of grapes and tomatoes and posh crisps and jars of olives and out-of-date bottles of that well-known easily perishable food substance \u2013 water \u2013 and down one aisle, dozens of clear plastic bin liners all filled with bread.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bane of our lives, bread,\u201d says Keith Annal, the operations manager. \u201cThe supermarkets make so much of it. And then they chuck out so much of it.\u201d</p> <p>There are rolls and baguettes and bagels and croissants. There\u2019s poppy seed bread and granary bread and ciabatta and sliced white. They try to give away as much of it as they can but it\u2019s a challenge. Annal points to the van outside. \u201cI\u2019ve filled that twice already today. I got 22 boxes of fruit and veg from Morrisons \u2013 that\u2019s just three days\u2019 waste from one supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s all perfectly good food, which if they hadn\u2019t rescued it would now be rotting at the bottom of the bin. \u201cLook at those bananas,\u201d says Annal. \u201cNothing wrong with them.\u201d But then there doesn\u2019t seem to be much wrong with any of it, apart from the fact that it\u2019s packaged, and everything in a package has either a \u201cuse by\u201d or a \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly eye-opening seeing how much is coming out of a handful of supermarkets in one mid-sized British city. Leeds is just the start. The beginning, Smith hopes, of a global movement: to end food waste. Because, at the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/uk-tops-chart-of-eu-food-waste\">we throw away 15 million tonnes of food a year</a>, more than any other country in the EU, even those, like Germany, which have a bigger population than us.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s response has been to invent the concept of a Real Junk Food cafe. Send off for a welcome pack, sign an agreement and then feed people waste food. The only rules are that you must feed everyone, not just poor people, and customers should only pay what they feel the meal is worth. If they have no money, they can volunteer labour and skills instead. Because the project has done deals with certain supermarket chains \u2013 Sainsbury, Morrisons, Ocado \u2013 at a national level, the food is there, ready for the taking.</p> <p>At the back of the warehouse scanning the shelves for produce is Duncan Milwain. He\u2019s the partner in a law firm but got involved when he received an email from Smith asking for legal help setting up the company. He did that but then found himself being drawn in. \u201cWhen I began to see the volume of waste coming in, I just thought it was obvious that something had to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, Milwain gave up a day a week at his job and opened the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/18/cafe-pay-what-you-want-intercepted-ingredients\">Saltaire Canteen</a>, a Real Junk Food cafe in the upmarket town of Saltaire, a world heritage site and home to one of the largest collections of David Hockneys in the world. \u201cSome people were convinced we should be feeding the poor, not serving cake in the posh part of town, but it\u2019s about food waste, not poverty per se.\u201d</p> <p>Though there is poverty too. I hop in the van with Annal and boxes of cakes and bags of potatoes and loaves of bread and head off to Parklands Primary School in Seacroft. It\u2019s one of the most deprived parts of Leeds and it\u2019s been one of the first schools to sign up to a new initiative the Real Junk Food Project is pioneering called Fuel for School.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s what the headteacher, Chris Dyson, calls \u201cFunday Friday!\u201d, or a lively assembly involving karaoke-ing along to Take That and a fiendishly difficult times table competition. There are stars and certificates for the children and then, at the end, they and their families file out and there are five tables laden with food, free for anyone to take, in exchange for a small donation if they have it and nothing if they don\u2019t. It has the rather grand title of a \u201cfood boutique\u201d but it\u2019s making use of food that would otherwise go in the bin.</p> <p>\u201cWe love it,\u201d says Dyson. \u201cSome parents were a bit proud at first but now they\u2019re piling in. We never shut. We come in, in the holidays, to do this. There are families for whom it\u2019s a continuous struggle. They get access to food banks but that\u2019s only three times a year. It\u2019s brilliant to be able to provide a bit extra.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/354d250b661c9feed7c40016fc19e4388c0f541e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils from Richmond Hill Primary School, Leeds, with their headmaster Nathan Atkinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Floyd/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richmond Hill Primary, in another deprived bit of Leeds, is just a few miles away. Its head, Nathan Atkinson, took over in 2014 and, while he says it\u2019s \u201can amazing place\u201d with pupils speaking 48 languages, nothing he tried seemed to be working. I\u2019ve followed him from Seacroft, where he took part in the assembly, to Wigan, where he\u2019s speaking to a room full of headteachers. \u201cI\u2019d been in vulnerable schools, schools in special measures,\u201d he tells them, \u201cbut when we tried the same things here, they didn\u2019t work. We had good teachers, a good curriculum, but we realised the children weren\u2019t in a place where they were ready to learn.</p> <p>\u201cIt came to a head after one half-term, their behaviour was just atrocious, and we realised some of them hadn\u2019t had a hot meal in a week.\u201d The first thing he did was to buy toasters for every classroom, \u201cbut then I needed food. I\u2019d met Adam by chance and I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you open a junk food cafe in the school?\u2019 He was like, \u2018No thanks. But you can do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Richmond Hill, he explains, is a \u201cfood desert\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to buy fresh fruit and veg in the postcode. But half a mile away, it turned out was one of Leeds biggest wholesalers. \u201cWe jumped in the school minibus and straightaway they gave us 27 boxes of bananas and ten boxes of cucumbers.\u201d</p> <p>The school now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/15/hungry-pupils-breakfast-teachers-survey\">provides breakfast</a> every day to 650 pupils, has its own cafe and a weekly \u201cfood boutique\u201d. It has improved punctuality and attendance and helped build bonds between the parents and the school, he says. To showcase what was possible, he and the Real Junk Food Project fed 10,000 children across Leeds on one day last autumn, entirely with waste food. \u201cWe want to make food available to children,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple. Yet it\u2019s tragic that we have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The teachers in the room nod their heads thoughtfully. They\u2019ve been invited by Ann Fairhurst and Shirley Southworth, who\u2019d heard of Smith\u2019s success and decided to set up their own Real Junk Food cafe in Wigan. It\u2019s called Fur Clemt \u2013 Wigan-ish for \u201cI\u2019m starving\u201d \u2013 and when a friend of theirs told them about children going into school hungry, they decided to set up a Fuel for School too.</p> <p>They\u2019re another incredibly dynamic duo. They both have full-time jobs but set up the cafe in a community centre owned by the Wigan Warriors rugby league team and have become expert at sourcing fresh food from suppliers in the local area. The Real Junk Food Project has been supportive, but they\u2019ve largely done it themselves. As have Save the Date in Dalston, east London, Curb Kitchen in Southampton, the Trash Cafe Network in Gosport \u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>In one afternoon, I\u2019ve met half a dozen inspiring people who have taken Smith\u2019s idea and run with it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what drives people but for some reason a mountain of perfectly good food that\u2019s destined to end up rotting seems to have done the trick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e69f5761879b50cbec426a158a9269707b79e4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at the Saltaire Canteen, Saltaire, Yorkshire, one of the many Real Junk Food cafes nationwide.

It\u2019s a handsome Victorian model village and the cafe has big plate glass windows, discreet branding in shades of grey, scrubbed pine tables and a small notice explaining the pay-as-you-feel concept. I\u2019ve just missed lunch but I chat to Katie and Michael Tonks from Sheffield who are polishing off their croque monsieur, salad and what they describe as \u201cposh chips\u201d.</p> <p>How was it? \u201cDelicious. I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m always getting confused by the difference between \u2018use by\u2019 dates and \u2018best before\u2019 and I sometimes worry if I\u2019ve got something in the fridge that\u2019s a few days out of date.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here because, after a month or so of phone calls, texts and emails, I\u2019ve finally pinned down Smith. He turns up with his young son, Joshua, and the words that no interviewer who\u2019s travelled 200 miles wants to hear, \u201cI\u2019ve only got 15 minutes.\u201d He softens up when we actually start talking but it\u2019s calling a spade a spade that has probably got him as far as he has. There\u2019s no doubting his anger for what he considers \u201ccriminal levels of waste\u201d and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2014/mar/27/cafe-food-past-sell-by-date-video\">though it was a video on the <em>Guardian</em> website</a> that gave the Real Junk Food Project its first proper blast of publicity, he\u2019s reluctant to do anything that might be construed as courting the press. He declined to be photographed for this piece.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just so much going on. I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. I said right from the beginning that I wanted to feed the world and I haven\u2019t even started yet. We\u2019ve fed nearly half a million people in 30 months but there\u2019s so much more we can do.\u201d But the pace of growth has been exhausting. \u201cI\u2019ve just got off the phone with people in the South Korean government, because we\u2019re launching there. I get emails all the time from all over the world. Yesterday, in the space of about three minutes, we had emails from Indonesia, Spain, Canada, and Loughborough. It\u2019s non-stop.\u201d</p> <p>Why has it captured people\u2019s imaginations?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing complex about it. It makes sense. It\u2019s sustainable. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think that\u2019s why people get inspired. It\u2019s something they can do. If some kid from Leeds can do it, they can. I\u2019ve been in prison, I was in care, I\u2019ve been in mental health homes. I was on drugs and alcohol. I was found nearly dead in a car from a suicide attempt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about empowering people to change their own lives and when you do that, that\u2019s when a movement happens, and in the space of two years we\u2019ve had thousands of people around the world standing up and doing stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The idea came to him while he was working as a chef in Australia. He\u2019d worked his way up to head chef, on a big salary, in Melbourne, working all hours. And then, to extend his visa, he\u2019d gone to work for a few months on a farm. \u201cIt was February 27, 2013 and I\u2019d just seen the farmer get a delivery of a tonne of courgettes, freshly picked, that he was feeding to his pigs. I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just give this to charity?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I just don\u2019t have the cost and logistics to get it where it needs to go.\u2019 That\u2019s when it came to me.\u201d</p> <p>He returned to the UK, set up the first cafe in Armley, Leeds, often going skip-diving outside supermarkets to get ingredients, and for the first two and a half years, during which time his son was born, he didn\u2019t even take a wage. He was living off \u00a392-a-week tax credits. And, though he\u2019s persuaded many of the supermarkets to work with him, he\u2019s still angry about what he sees them doing: the waste that seems to be built into the system.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sick to death of the media and supermarkets who say it\u2019s all to do with consumers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/18/tesco-supermarket-food-waste\">It\u2019s nothing to do with them</a>. We didn\u2019t want this saturation of supermarkets on our high street selling food 24 hours day, manipulating us into purchasing more.\u201d</p> <p>France has recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets\">a law that bans supermarkets</a> from destroying unsold food. They have to give it to charity, or face a fine. It\u2019s a prime example of the kind of thing Smith believes ought to be introduced here but is bound up in exasperating bureaucracy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fed up being invited to Westminster and wasting my time with people who are creating targets for 20 years\u2019 time. It needs to happen now, on a local level. I think a lot of it is about grassroots education. There\u2019s a huge demographic of people who are completely uneducated about food.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Joshua has picked up an old-looking satsuma from the window display and put it in his mouth. There\u2019s no \u2018Joshua! Joshua! Put it down,\u2019 from Smith though. \u201cAre you going to eat the skin as well?\u201d he asks him. Joshua starts eating the skin. \u201cOK, well, your choice. Let\u2019s see how you get on with that. You won\u2019t do it again if you don\u2019t like it, will you?\u201d People are so fearful of food, he says. \u201cEighty people died from food poisoning last year, whereas 75 were hit by lightning. We\u2019ve probably got the safest food ever. It\u2019s about getting people to understand food.\u201d</p> <p>Then, to Joshua, \u201cHave you finished that?\u201d He has, skin and all. He\u2019s gnawing on a rock-hard stale loaf instead.

In 2010, deputy Richard Graber, a senior official in the Milwaukee deputies\u2019 union, alleged that Clarke aggressively confronted him, called him a \u201csick fuck\u201d and threatened to \u201ccome after him\u201d for questioning an order that deputies must work mandatory overtime after the high-profile death of a local child.</p> <p>\u201cClarke\u2019s profanity-ridden rant included yelling, pointing, and calling Graber \u2018waste,\u2019 an \u2018organizational terrorist,\u2019 a \u2018fucker,\u2019 and a \u2018cancer to the agency\u2019,\u201d according to an appeals court filing.

A federal appeals court said Clarke\u2019s behavior amounted to an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d but rejected an allegation from Graber that the mistreatment was because of his union activity.</p> <p>Inspector Edward Bailey, a spokesman for Clarke, declined to comment. \u201cThis county office does not involve itself in the current presidential race in any capacity,\u201d he said in an email.</p> <h2><strong>Joe Arpaio</strong></h2> <p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has over the past two decades become notorious as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/sheriff-joe-arpaio-the-most-lawless-lawman-in-america/359613/\">\u201cthe most unrepentantly lawless lawman in America\u201d</a>: repeatedly condemned by the courts, denounced by civil liberties advocates and forced to pay out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in compensation.</p> <p>Arpaio currently faces possible criminal charges for contempt of court for ignoring a judge\u2019s order in 2011 that his aggressive immigration patrols must stop racially profiling suspects.

Over the years, the school <a href=\"http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/2004/3-04/Globe2-23-04.html\">became notorious</a> for its severe punishment system, and was investigated repeatedly for allegations of abuse and mistreatment of students.

He never had any control over student discipline or instruction. He was in charge of ensuring there was food and bathroom supplies and things like that.

But Jones, who is also running for Congress as a Republican, has dialed down his enthusiasm after the Republican nominee\u2019s recent string of inflammatory remarks.</p> <p>\u201cHe has not personally or publicly endorsed any candidate, but has said he will cast his ballot for Trump given the only alternative is Hillary Clinton,\u201d Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Jones, said in an email.</p> <p>Jones was accused of sexually harassing a junior female deputy starting when he was a sergeant about 12 years ago, which he denies.

  "<p>I had been a massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a> fan since I was a student in Australia. Seeing him live in 2004, when I was about 18, changed the course of my life. It blew my mind how powerful and visceral he was on stage with the whole band, and especially with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ellis_%28musician%29\">Warren Ellis</a>. I\u2019d never seen such commitment to performance that wasn\u2019t contrived. It felt so natural, like they were really expressing the aggression and emotion in the music. I\u2019d been playing in bands since I was 14, but that concert inspired me.</p> <p>Later I moved to the US and joined <a href=\"http://warpaintwarpaint.com/\">Warpaint</a> as their drummer, we were asked to support Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for a number of dates on their 2014 tour. Although I was nervous and thrilled, I promised myself that if I met him, I wouldn\u2019t go and talk to him. It was a pact I\u2019d made with myself when we\u2019d played a festival on the same stage as another of my idols, a rock icon from the same era. I\u2019d said to him: \u201cGreat show, I love your stuff,\u201d but he was an absolute c-word to me. I was disappointed because it felt like he had gone out of his way to be grumpy. I didn\u2019t want to find out that Nick Cave was like that, too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before each show, the band would make fresh juice with a juicer Nick had in his room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first gig of the tour was in Denver, and I arrived a little earlier than my bandmates to set up and see Nick and his band do their sound check. By the time they\u2019d finished, I was hiding downstairs in our dressing room, with our tour manager, determined not to look like a fan-girl. But then I heard Nick in his loafers walking down the stairs to check if anyone was down there. He came in and introduced himself. \u201cOh, you\u2019re the drummer, the Australian one. I\u2019ve heard about you,\u201d he said, which completely broke the ice. There was no mystique. I realised he was just an Australian guy, like people I knew at home, in a band, who really cares about what he does.</p> <p>Nick might be known as the Prince of Darkness, but I was surprised and relieved at how sweet and talkative he was, and Warren, too. It made me realise that if a musical legend is at ease with their own talent, they can be warm and friendly, whereas those who struggle with their level of fame and feel pressured to live up to people\u2019s expectations can be spikier.</p> <p>We played six or seven shows together, but there wasn\u2019t a party atmosphere on the tour. Quite the opposite, in fact. Those guys have been through every single imaginable experience with every single substance, so before and after each show, they\u2019d just make fresh juice with a juicer Nick had in his room. I made him one once. I can\u2019t remember what was in it, but we both agreed it wasn\u2019t very nice \u2013 it tasted like sweet dirt.</p> <p>One night, on stage, I spotted Nick\u2019s unmistakable silhouette watching us in the crowd. And after the last show in LA, even though he probably knew a lot of people there, he took the time to thank us for playing with him. He turned to me and said: \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful drummer,\u201d and I replied: \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful human being.\u201d And I meant it \u2013 he really is. He has so much integrity, even though he\u2019s been around so long. It made me think it\u2019s possible not to be jaded and to commit to something for life.</p> <p><em>Warpaint\u2019s new album Heads Up is out on 23 September via Rough Trade Records </em><br></p>",

  "<p>An exclamation mark at the end of any title can often betray a sort of are-we-having-fun-yet? eagerness; two of them, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater\" title=\"\">Richard Linklater</a>\u2019s <strong>Everybody Wants Some!! </strong>(eOne, 15), suggest positively deranged levels of pep. Yet even as it surfs the antic party scene of American college life circa 1980, there\u2019s a sauntering, Zen-infused calm to the film that feels almost melancholic. Many have deemed it a pure nostalgia exercise, a film that treats its gaggle of pretty, randy fratboys and their retrograde social and sexual beliefs with uncritical, honey-dipped affection.</p> <p>Yet the film is more complicated: it may be rooted in one highly specific era, as opposed to the<a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/interviews/long-conversation-richard-linklater-cinema-time\" title=\"\"> time-lapse exercises</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/dvds-downloads-guy-lodge-boyhood\" title=\"\"><em>Boyhood</em></a> and the <em>Before Sunrise</em> trilogy, but it extends Linklater\u2019s fascination with people as inchoate beings. The camera participates in its characters\u2019 short-sighted revelry while exposing many of the personal stumbling blocks that could betray them when they\u2019re no longer princes of &#xa0;the universe \u2013 or at least of the baseball diamond. Linklater also looks upon the puppyish, peach-skinned beauty of these college athletes in a way that no jockish campus jaunt of the 80s would have done: a celebratory gaze, in one sense, but laced with awareness that this too shall pass. In the course of this alternately lovely and leery romp, at least one of those exclamation points curls into a question mark.</p> <p>No punctuation is aggressive enough for <strong>Green Room</strong> (Altitude, 18), a seismically nasty exercise in bloody backwoods horror that confirms all the ruthless technical strengths director Jeremy Saulnier demonstrated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/dvds-and-downloads-bad-neighbours-concussion-sopranos-blue-ruin\" title=\"\"><em>Blue Ruin</em></a> \u2013 with, sadly, none of that film\u2019s human texture. Pitting punk rockers against neo-Nazis in a confined, effortfully grisly fight to the death, it works up some efficient cat-and-mouse tension upfront yet runs out of complicating factors \u2013 for its characters and narrative alike \u2013 even before the halfway mark.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvMja-moAlE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wvMja-moAlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvMja-moAlE\">Watch the trailer for Author: The JT LeRoy Story.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Among the year\u2019s most ambiguously compelling documentaries, <strong>Author: The JT Leroy Story</strong> (Dogwoof, 15) digs under the hoax of Leroy, the nonexistent West Virginia hustler-novelist who briefly became the toast of the New York literary scene. Affording his outed inventor, Brooklyn writer Laura Albert, the chance to tell her side of this \u201cmyth\u201d, Jeff Feuerzeig\u2019s film is a feast of bizarre anecdotal detail \u2013 yet never fully questions its own questionability in taking the word of a famously unreliable narrator. Approach with fascination and caution in equal measure.</p> <p>Neither fascinating nor especially dangerous \u2013 despite the seemingly risky promise of an Afghanistan conflict comedy \u2013 <strong>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot</strong> (Paramount, 15) is a jaunty diversion, starring a game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tina-fey\" title=\"\">Tina Fey</a> as a green war correspondent plunged into the maelstrom of Kabul. There\u2019s a pleasingly acidic edge to some of the fish-out-of-water antics that ensue, but the film treads conservatively around any hot points of political or cultural interest. Pair it up with <strong>A Hologram for the King</strong> (Icon, 12) for a curious double bill of American civilians dazed and confused in the Middle East: starring Tom Hanks as a beaten-down businessman attempting to secure a major contract in Saudi Arabia, Tom Tykwer\u2019s adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/30/hologram-for-king-eggers-review\" title=\"\">Dave Eggers\u2019s novel</a> retains a sense of the author\u2019s skewed, semi-sweet whimsy, but its more probing philosophical questions mostly lie decoratively on the surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab0505ea3d6039fc3fd65d456d172328ec6e8745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0505ea3d6039fc3fd65d456d172328ec6e8745/198_0_1786_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalia Tena and David Verdaguer in the \u2018rather special\u2019 10,000 Km.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalia Tena and David Verdaguer in the \u2018rather special\u2019 10,000 Km.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the streaming-only front, Mubi.com once more comes to the rescue of a fine film overlooked by UK distributors.

  "<p>This boisterous thriller, which is based on real events, is the most mainstream film to date from Argentinian director Pablo Trapero (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/25/lions-den-film-review\" title=\"\"><em>Lion\u2019s Den</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/markkermode1\" title=\"\"><em>El Bonaerense</em></a>). The story of the well-connected Puccio family, which in the early 1980s used its links with the government to cover up a lucrative kidnapping business, this is told using the slick language of a Hollywood crime movie. Trapero negotiates with verve the uneasy juxtaposition between quotidian family life and something rather darker and more sinister.

On her first day working on <em>Quantum of Solace </em>she filmed her death scene, lying naked for two hours on Bond\u2019s bed, covered in black oil. It seems now that the experience gave her time to think.</p> <p>It\u2019s a hot afternoon in Soho and she is mixing a drink with the casual swing of someone just home from holidaying with her best friend; she\u2019s tanned, freckled, quick to laugh. At the weekend, for her belated 30th birthday party, she tells me she\u2019ll be performing TLC\u2019s \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d. Suddenly she\u2019s rapping. \u201cSee if you can\u2019t spatially expand my horizon. Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising\u2026\u201d And then my hands are clapping, because that\u2019s what happens to your hands when a girl spontaneously raps.</p> <p>We\u2019re at the <a href=\"http://www.deanstreettownhouse.com/\">Dean Street Townhouse</a> \u2013 and the sun has brought out celebrities like rain does snails. At every table is a doubletake. Arterton, her back to the room, seems profoundly at ease with herself, which makes her stories about the anger she suppressed \u2013 about her \u201cfreak-outs\u201d after bad experiences at work, about her decision to quit films altogether \u2013 all the more compelling.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjGkB_oWTe0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HjGkB_oWTe0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It happened slowly. Once, she remembers, she was working on a film where, apart from the make-up artist, she was the only woman on set. \u201cEveryone just behaved so badly, people were getting fired left, right and centre. It was just power, power, power.\u201d She hated it. \u201cAfter that, for a while I was doing \u2018Fuck You\u2019 work, because I was angry about the industry. I wanted to do these aggressive films to show that I was badass and could kill people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to do these aggressive films to show that I was badass and could kill people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2010 she told <em>GQ</em> she wanted to work with directors \u201cwho respect me, who don\u2019t just see me as a piece of ass\u201d, a quote which people, including Simon Edge at the <em>Express,</em> took umbrage at, inviting a \u201cleading critic\u201d to respond: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, she\u2019s not getting the Hollywood big bucks because of her acting skills. As far as the studios are concerned she is basically a cheap bit of British totty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo then there was a point, about four years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere I decided I couldn\u2019t do it any more.\u201d</p> <p>What is it to be an actor today? To be a star? Talent and skill aren\u2019t enough, nor is beauty, the ability to walk confidently from the sea in a bikini, or the ability to command a room. Nor good reviews. Nor an agent with claws. Your personality must be perfectly calibrated for a viral life. You must share the intimacies of your relationships and dinners online, and build a community of followers, rather than fans. Your quotes must be titillating, but not controversial, you must be at ease in both <em>Hamlet</em> and the <em>Mail Online</em>. Perhaps because she got thrown so far so fast \u2013 from a childhood in Gravesend with a welder dad and a cleaner mum, straight to Hollywood, Arterton is only now starting to take control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"577b5b56cb39702e291e3770f83fe140001fdb03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577b5b56cb39702e291e3770f83fe140001fdb03/240_0_642_774/415.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Arterton in The Girl with All the Gifts.\" width=\"415\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A gun-wielding Miss Honey\u2019: in The Girl with All the Gifts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was clearly a point where she appeared to take a deep breath,\u201d says film writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dannyleigh\">Danny Leigh</a>. She\u2019d done <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Byzantium </em>and <em>Hansel &amp; Gretel</em>: \u201cPretty dire films, probably pretty thankless experiences, and good examples of the assault course a young British actor has to contend with. But specifically, a working-class actor.\u201d</p> <p>While actors like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley\">Keira Knightley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan\">Carey Mulligan</a> stepped straight into serious cinema, Arterton debuted in <em>St Trinian\u2019s</em>. \u201cYoung, working-class British actors get funnelled either into soaps or TV drama or, if they make it into films at all, a very specific kind of social realism,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cCulturally they\u2019re seen as not having quite the dramatic heft or range of their middle-class peers. It also feels like it\u2019s somehow more acceptable to treat them as sex objects.\u201d</p> <p>Arterton then, though successful, was seen as \u201cchirpy\u201d and \u201cperky\u201d, \u201cand all those other grim clich\u00e9s about working-class young women\u201d, says Leigh. \u201cAnd it takes a very brave director to up-end that public persona.\u201d It\u2019s interesting, he adds, to look at the films she <em>didn\u2019t</em> do \u2013 especially <em>Under the Skin</em>, a film she was dumped from in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\">Scarlett Johansson</a>. Instead of the serious drama <em>Suffragette</em>, she was in the musical of <em>Made in Dagenham</em>. \u201cAnd one of the awkward things about <em>Suffragette</em> was it clearly aspired to be about the experience of working-class women, but then cast a middle-class actor to do it. I can see that same script with Gemma Arterton in the lead role, and I actually think it would have felt much more eloquent and true,\u201d he says. \u201cShe strikes me as far more intelligent than she\u2019s been allowed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Across the table, Arterton\u2019s accent slips endearingly between posh and not, and she talks with her hands about time passing. In 2010 she married Italian businessman Stefano Catelli. In 2015 she divorced him. She turned down parts, she learned French. It wasn\u2019t until Arterton realised there was another career to be had, where she didn\u2019t have to continue on a path paved with naked corpses, that she returned to film. Smaller films. Producing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e31a2ad60a544ade17848b21ea4667815deba7b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e31a2ad60a544ade17848b21ea4667815deba7b1/0_1730_6208_6550/948.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Arterton with bare shoulders, tanned, with pale pink lipstick and black and silver eye makeup\" width=\"948\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I decided to surround myself with people who \u201cget it\u201d\u2019: Gemma Arterton. <em>Make-up: Kim Brown at Premier Hair and Make-up using Bobbi Brown Cosmetics.

It was part of a bigger conversation, where women started sharing their stories on social media and in places like the <a href=\"http://everydaysexism.com/\">Everyday Sexism</a> project \u2013 a shift away from that accepting, heavy silence.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the question about regret is complicated. Ten years ago, when she was propelled from drama student to star (or \u201ccheap British totty\u201d), Arterton knows she wouldn\u2019t have lasted long if she\u2019d been as outspoken as she is today.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a different time, and not just for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I started talking about how I didn\u2019t enjoy parts of my job, and talking about body image, I got in trouble. So I stopped.\u201d</p> <p>But the more crap she saw, the more she felt dismissed, objectified, angry, the more she felt she had to speak out. And today, as she begins to produce her own projects, concentrate on theatre (later this year she takes on the notoriously difficult <em>Saint Joan</em> at the <a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/#BSVY2u3kjXugMXBJ.97\">Donmar Warehouse</a>), and turn down big-budget, arm-candy roles, she believes that journey, those shocks, were necessary for her to end up with a career she\u2019s proud of.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to conform and shut up. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been with women. Easier than putting yourself out there and having an opinion, to which someone might retaliate. I\u2019m sure there are people who don\u2019t want to work with me because they think I\u2019m difficult \u2013 \u2018one of those feminist girls\u2019 \u2013 but to be honest with you I don\u2019t want to work with them. And that\u2019s fine. Now.\u201d</p> <p>She finishes her drink. \u201cA revolution is happening, but in its own quiet English way, because people work fucking hard, and it\u2019s hard to live, and everyone\u2019s had enough of being fucked over.

With accepting that the natural way that humanity evolves is by moving about.\u201d</p> <p>Arterton plays the empathic teacher, a sort of gun-wielding Miss Honey to a zombie-fied Matilda. At one point in the film, the girl asks Considine why humans get to live, while the zombie \u201chungries\u201d have to die. Is it just because the humans got here first?

It\u2019s called <em>The Escape</em>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-cooper\">Dominic Cooper</a> plays my husband.

Smith not doing much, just trying to find his footing here. A left-right combo from Canelo that lands on Smith\u2019s guard but still manages to move him. Quite a show for Canelo so far. Smith is grinning through some of these punches but that\u2019s not a good sign. The right hand to the body is really hurting Smith. A dominant opening frame for the Mexican.

  "<p>When I was 18 I experienced my first UK winter. Growing up in tropical Singapore I\u2019d had the romantic notion of a short three months of snowy Dickensian rooftops and ice skating on village ponds before the sun and warmth returned with a bang on 1 March. Boy was I wrong. I missed being able to sow seeds, harvest fruit and potter around in shorts and flip-flops whenever I wanted.</p> <p>But one day, wandering home from uni along a grey road on a bleak February afternoon, I noticed a splash of colour in an abandoned front garden. In between the beer cans and plastic bags a clump of perfect crocus blooms had erupted from beneath the earth: an everyday miracle, returning year after year for the price of a bag of bulbs.</p> <p>I realised that if winter is the price we pay for the wonder of spring bulbs, it\u2019s almost worth it \u2013 and right now is the time to start ordering them. Look beyond the gaudy, DayGlo colours of some of the mass-market commercial hybrids and a world of primeval beauty awaits.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the species tulips. One of the very oldest in cultivation is the horned tulip, <em>Tulipa acuminata </em>with its elongated, wispy petals giving the blooms the weird \u201cspider-like\u201d shape that was so prized by the Ottoman sultans, who introduced the plant to the Dutch. Flame red at the tips fading to butter yellow, it is a real showstopper. If you are into cooler colours, the dwarf <em>T humilis </em>\u2018Alba Coerulea Oculata\u2019<em> </em>has ice-white petals that offset a steely-blue base on blooms just 10-15cm high. Both are perfect for a well-drained spot in full sun.</p> <p>If you are after something even bolder why not try the Afghan foxtail lily <em>Eremurus</em>? These towering beauties look like something straight out of a hotel lobby centrepiece, but given a warm spot will fire out flower spikes up to 2.5m tall in early June, coated in hundreds of tiny blooms, like giant bottle brushes. \u2018Helena\u2019 and \u2018Joanna\u2019 are excellent choices with rosettes of deep green leaves to complement their floral display.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have the luxury of a sunny plot, the dog\u2019s tooth violet <em>Erythronium dens-canis</em> forms a fairytale carpet of glossy purple-spotted leaves with blooms in pale pink and lilac. It even has a coveted RHS Award of Garden Merit, to testify to the good grower that is is.</p> <p>Similarly, if you have a small, shady garden (and not so small a budget) treat yourself to hardy orchids. Try <em>Calanthes</em> such as <em>C sieboldii</em> or <em>C tricarinata</em>, or slipper orchids like the super vigorous North American <em>Cypripedium kentuckiense</em> and its showier pink hybrid, \u2018Kentucky Pink\u2019. These look so exotic it is hard to believe they will shrug off sub-zero freezes to turn a dark, damp British border into a slice of Borneo each April amid the moss and ferns.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

For if my job has taught me anything, it is this: certain ingredients can deliver as much of a kick coming out as they did going in. A few years back one of my so-called rivals concluded a review of an especially spicy Sichuan place with the instruction to put the wet wipes in the fridge overnight. I am wishing now that I had recalled the advice a good 12 hours earlier.</p> <p>And yet I do not regret a second of my meal at <a href=\"http://www.somsaa.com/\">Som Saa</a>. Some eating experiences reveal their virtues like courtroom dramas, the evidence in support of the case building slowly. Others are like romances, the true loving emotion presenting itself in gentle, soothing waves. Dinner at Som Saa \u2013 it\u2019s the name of a Thai fruit, apparently \u2013 is neither of these. It\u2019s an action movie full of crash, bang and wallop. It\u2019s the friendliest slap around the chops; a throw-you-back-in-your-seat ride which draws you in and spits you out again at the end gasping and, if you\u2019re me, with your collar drenched. In response to chilli I break out in a sweat. At the finish I looked like I\u2019d taken a shower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cdcab3ba8808882e256be650c83a6bacfde12140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdcab3ba8808882e256be650c83a6bacfde12140/0_244_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A whole sea bass, curving on a plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies\u2019: sea bass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Som Saa started life last year as a Thai food pop-up in a filthy east London railway arch, but I didn\u2019t go. Too many pop-ups are people playing at grown-up restaurants, and who knows whether they\u2019ll ever be heard of again? This one, however, was clearly a proof of concept. The chefs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/22/chefs-who-are-loosening-the-old-school-thai\">Mark Dobbie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/10/som-saa-london-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Andy Oliver</a>, cut their teeth with Thai food oracle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/19/david-thompson-thai-recipes\">David Thompson</a>. Oliver later worked in a renowned Bangkok restaurant. Their partner front of house is Tom George, with experience at Hawksmoor and with the Polpo Group, which have together written the textbook on what modern, relaxed restaurant service should look like.</p> <p>So here they now are, following a crowd-funding campaign, located in a former fabrics warehouse just south of Spitalfields market. Naturally they don\u2019t take bookings, unless for tables of four or more. I thought of inventing a couple of friends I would later mislay so I could reserve, but decided in the end to be a good boy and queue at the bar.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I did, because the bar snacks are shamelessly, raucously, look-at-me brilliant. There are addictive bowls of toasted cashews with chilli and kaffir lime leaves, practically smoking in the dish in front of you. Better still is the jan naem \u2013 minced pork which has been fermented for four days with garlic and rice until it reaches a meaty lactic sourness. It\u2019s then pressed with fresh chillies and grilled. It is one of the best things ever done to the minced end of a pig.

There are distressed brick walls, for the sounds to bounce off, and rock-hard bits of panelling in whatever the eco-alternative to teak is these days. There are metal girders and high ceilings just to make sure the clamour echoes properly. At one point I joked that I was the oldest man in the room. Then I looked about and realised that I really was the oldest man there. Oh, for the sweet, untroubled hearing of the young.</p> <p>But again, for this food, I\u2019ll take the battering. Abandon any expectations encouraged by the tooth-achingly sweet offerings in Anglo-Thai restaurants. As this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/22/chefs-who-are-loosening-the-old-school-thai\">magazine reported a couple of months back</a>, there\u2019s a new take on Thai food gaining purchase in Britain right now and it\u2019s a green curry-free zone. The food wanders restlessly from north to south. It is a deliriously fearsome bash of fire and sour and salt and smoke; of the high ethereal waft of Thai basil and lemongrass, of mint and coriander and pungent fish sauces, and their own coconut creams to lend soothing depths where needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d578c3cda3e136ca79b399f4f381e78bec008fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d578c3cda3e136ca79b399f4f381e78bec008fd/516_433_4893_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duck soup: a shallow white bowl with green leaves and red chillies with a ladle on the edge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All hot and sour loveliness\u2019: duck soup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the specials board is a duck soup, complete with the offals. It is the worrying colour of dish water, an uncompromising grey; but it is the flavour of Technicolor, all hot and sour loveliness of a sort which would make a heavy cold simply throw up its hands and shout, \u201cSod it, I surrender.\u201d</p> <p>We follow it with a whole sea bass, curved round on itself in the heat of a deep-fat fryer, until the bones are crisp enough to be nibbled as a snack. It\u2019s buried under drifts of foliage and smokey chillies, the crunch of toasted rice and the intensity of more fish sauce. From the same section headed simply \u201cwok\u201d comes a perfect mess of crisp-roasted belly pork with sliced snake beans in a thick, dry red curry that shouts at you and shouts at you again until you have spooned up every last smear. The only step on to almost familiar ground is a slightly sweeter Penang curry of salted beef cheeks, cooked until spoonable, which with its dollop of coconut has edges of a massaman about it, but with more serious and savoury intent. Note: don\u2019t drop these down your shirt, or your clothes will recall your dinner for as long as you do.</p> <p>A salad of prawn, pork, peanuts and Asian pennywort, dressed with glugs of lime juice and \u2013 but of course \u2013 more fish sauce, is like a breath of cool air after hours in the sun. It is bright and fresh but still, of course, has a chilli kick. Once more the sweat runs. I mop my brow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de598f2ac7b4e42ceee4481578194f833f024801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de598f2ac7b4e42ceee4481578194f833f024801/0_336_5308_3185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duck-egg custard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Startlingly weird\u2019: duck-egg custard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from a fruit plate there are just two desserts. A salted palm sugar ice cream with toasted bananas is a revelation, full of deep caramel tones; it\u2019s what salted caramel wants to be when it grows up. A heavily set duck-egg custard served with crispy shallots is startlingly weird, verging on the unpleasant. The custard is split and, while I imagine it\u2019s a Thai combination, I could happily live without having onions on my dessert ever again.</p> <p>Prices range from \u00a36.50 to \u00a316 for the whole fish, but what struck me was that I could slip in here alone, just for the duck soup or the crispy pork dish or the beef cheek curry. And some of the fermented pork. That and a beer and I\u2019d be very happy. And yes, I\u2019d pay for it the next morning.

If the decision to eat was based solely on smell you wouldn\u2019t; think a cross between a drain and the fishmongers at day\u2019s end. But it tastes terrific.

  "<p>Two wins in a row. Say it loud and proud. After six defeats in succession \u2013 from the World Cup final, the clean sweep by England and then two comprehensive losses to the All Blacks \u2013 this was welcome relief.<br>  The Wallabies blitzed the Pumas out of the blocks early, posting 21 points in just the first 14 minutes. First Bernard Foley beat a few defenders and then the recycled ball came to Michael Hooper, who dummied and put Sami Kerevi over. Then Quade Cooper demonstrated some of that classic Cooper charm with a no-look pass for Dane Haylett-Petty to steam through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/sep/17/rugby-championship-australia-v-argentina-live\">Rugby Championship: Australia v Argentina \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tries kept coming as Will Genia forced an error and chased through to get on the scoresheet. Argentina then stemmed the bleeding with a penalty goal and started to fight their way back in the match. They added another before half-time to go in 21-6 behind. Strangely the Pumas enjoyed 70% possession and made just 21 tackles to the Wallabies 98 in the first half, but they couldn\u2019t break the Aussie line. The Wallaby defence, so meek against the English and Kiwis, was doing its job.</p> <p>In the second half Argentina started brilliantly thanks to a great finish from Santiago Cordero. At 21-13 they had a sniff and Australia\u2019s inability to hold on to the pill was becoming a problem. Enter Sean McMahon. A bullocking run from the forward with more mongrel than a rabid dog ended in a sniping second try from Genia from the next ruck. That try settled the Wallaby nerves and gave them a 13-point lead.</p> <p>Michael Cheika went to his bench but it was the bearded one Cooper who pulled out another of his party tricks. A second no-look pass and this time it was Hooper who galloped into acres of space as the Puma defence parted like the Red Sea. 33-13 and it was job done with 15 minutes left on the clock.</p> <p>There was still time for Cooper to complete a usual Cooperesque performance \u2013 with a yellow card for an unnecessary shoulder charge off the ball. Some things never change. That mean Foley\u2019s intercept try was chalked off and the Pumas hit back with a five-pointer to Facundo Isa off a rolling maul. The Wallabies closed out the game with a long distance penalty goal to Reece Hodge.</p> <p>So what does the Perth performance mean? Let\u2019s not get carried away, Australia haven\u2019t lost to Argentina on home soil since Michael Cheika was in short pants and last week they beat a struggling and out of form Springbok side in Brisbane. The Wallabies were scratchy against the Boks, giving them a large head start then saved by a bit of Foley brilliance, and they blew the Pumas away with an outstanding opening spell.</p> <p>But now they surrender home advantage and go on the road, first to Pretoria and then to London. Victories in South Africa are rarer than hen\u2019s teeth and the passionate Pumas will have plenty of support at Twickenham. Then it\u2019s back to Eden Park for the annual Auckland humiliation delivered by the All Blacks.</p> <p>Australia sit in second place on the Rugby Championship table now, however that might not be the case in a fortnight.</p> <p>Then there is the small case of a five Test, seven-match Grand Slam tour. Meetings with Wales, Scotland, France and Ireland, not to mention Eddie Jones\u2019 England again, all in quick succession. Revenge will be on the minds of the Welsh and Scots after being downed by the Wallabies at last year\u2019s World Cup, while the others will relish home ties. All this without David Pocock who is out with a broken hand.</p> <p>There are positives with nine new Wallabies blooded this year, including the emergence of Haylett-Petty and Adam Coleman. Locks Rory Arnold, Coleman and Lopeti Timani are giving the Australian pack both some much-needed bite and stability in the lineout. The scrum remains a work in progress but Tom Robertson appears an adept scrummager.</p> <p>With 10 games now away the Wallabies depth will be severely tested. Will the Cooper-Foley 10 and 12 combination keep working? Is Cooper too much of defensive liability? Is Foley big enough to play inside centre week-in-week-out? Do the green and gold forwards have what it takes to match the best of the northern hemisphere? Can they cover for the loss of Pocock?</p> <p>They\u2019re all questions we\u2019ll have definite answers to in the next three months. The vast gap between New Zealand and the rest of the world remains, with the 2015 World Cup fast becoming a distant memory. The battle to become the number two national team in the world is on, and the Wallabies are far from favourites to win that race. But last night\u2019s victory shows there is still life in Cheika\u2019s chargers.<br> </p>",
