  "<p>Employment tribunals are supposed to be a recourse to justice, yet thousands of workers who win their claims never receive a penny of compensation. The government says it is committed to tackling the problem and forcing culpable employers to pay up. But new data reveals that its attempts fall woefully short, with the vast majority of unpaid claimants receiving no help at all.</p> <p>Grahame Healiss, 27, is one of a growing number of claimants let down by the system. He was sacked from his job at a call centre in Liverpool after complaining about his girlfriend being sexually harassed by a team leader. \u201cIt was a really disturbing time, seeing the most important person in my life being subjected to such blatant abuse,\u201d Healiss recalls. \u201cI had to do something.\u201d</p> <p>The couple took their case to tribunal and were awarded damages of \u00a340,000. Yet eight months on, no money has been paid. Their employer, M&amp;R Marketing, went into liquidation before the final hearing and dodged its liability. This is a common ruse.</p> <p>According to government data, more than a third of successful claimants never receive any of their compensation, and less than half are paid in full. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s worse than if they\u2019d never taken the case in the first place,\u201d says Emma Satyamurti, a partner at law firm Leigh Day. \u201cIt compounds the sense of injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Lydia Stone, 31, has all but given up receiving any of the \u00a328,000 she was awarded three years ago for being unfairly sacked from an ice-cream parlour, Tom &amp; Erin\u2019s in Weymouth. Stone lost her job when she told her employer she was pregnant. \u201cThe next morning I had a letter from the owner saying my employment was over,\u201d she says. Stone took her case to an employment tribunal and received an unequivocal judgment: \u201cThe claimant was unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of her sex,\u201d it says. Again, though, her former employer liquidated the company and transferred its assets to a sister company called Tom &amp; Erin\u2019s Gift Shop. It matters little that the new company is registered at the same address and sells the same products. \u201cThe shop is still there: it\u2019s open for business and selling ice cream. It just seems so wrong that they can get away with it,\u201d says Stone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if it\u2019s obvious what a company has done, the costs involved in trying to challenge it outweigh the possible benefit</p> <footer> <cite>David Carter, debt collector</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for the government\u2019s Insolvency Service admits there could be hundreds of cases like this every week. The problem is that it is hard, not to mention costly, to prove that companies are deliberately going bust to avoid paying awards.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s obvious what a company has done, the costs involved in trying to challenge it outweigh the benefit,\u201d says David Carter of The Sheriff\u2019s Office, a debt collection firm. Carter says the transfer of assets between companies is something his firm encounters often, yet their hands are tied to do anything about it. \u201cThe government needs to tighten up the law.\u201d</p> <p>The problem could be addressed by denying public contracts to the offending businesses, disqualifying directors, and allowing employment tribunals to enforce payment directly. Earlier this year the government introduced fines for employers who don\u2019t pay up, but very little has changed. Figures seen by the <em>Observer </em>reveal that in the five months since the penalty system has been in place it has helped in 11 cases, bringing in \u00a355,000 in unpaid awards. According to TUC figures, that equates to just 1% of cases where successful claimants have not been paid.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for the system to bed in,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department for Business. \u201cBut early signs are encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says urgent change is needed: \u201cToo many employees who win cases don\u2019t get the money they\u2019re owed. The government must take tough action on employers who refuse to pay up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The views on Brexit expressed in the <em>Observer</em> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\" title=\"\">News, last week</a>) are welcome and may remind MPs that ours is a parliamentary democracy, and they are in no way bound by the outcome of the referendum.</p> <p>Parliament saw off the pretensions of divinely anointed monarchs long ago and should not be afraid of doing the same with an ill-informed mass vote if they wish to preserve our form of democracy, in which the views of voters are tempered by elected representatives. The effusions of the prime minister about \u201cthwarting the will of the people\u201d remind me of Europe\u2019s pre-war dictators.</p> <p>It will not be enough for parliament to vote on the withdrawal procedure or dream of another vote when that procedure has reached its inexorable end. MPs should rediscover their backbone and refuse to endorse the repeal bill. If they fail to do that they will have no further influence as events unfold.<br><strong>Barry Rydz</strong><br>Corsham, Wiltshire</p> <p>Given all Remain\u2019s advantages \u2013 choice of polling day; production of a pro-Europe leaflet paid for by taxpayers; extension of the electoral registration deadline; and the designation of Vote Leave rather than Leave.EU as leaders of the Leave campaign \u2013 I\u2019m surprised Leave could still win by four percentage points and over a million votes.<br><strong>Jeremy Hayes</strong><br>Snodland, Kent</p> <p>Leavers are pretending to take the vote perfectly literally, but the ballot question said nothing about freedom of movement. We do not know if there is a majority in the country against it and we do know that many value the input of EU immigrants to the country. Presumably, at least a few Leave voters were simply in favour of more free trade with the wider world, and some simply taken by the call to reclaim sovereignty.</p> <p>Given the margin of 52% to 48%, it would only take just over one per cent of the voters to fall into each category for there to be a narrow majority in favour of Leaving, but without a majority for refusing freedom of movement. And narrow majorities are all we are relying on. In that case, Theresa May\u2019s government is going beyond its mandate in assuming that soft Brexit must be off the agenda. And MPs would be within their rights to demand soft Brexit, failing any other referendum explicitly dealing with immigration (perish the thought!).<br><strong>Nigel Blake</strong><br>Byfleet, Surrey</p> <p>Years of Tory underspending have brought about shortages in hospital beds, affordable housing and school places \u2013 the very things for which many Brexiters blame immigrants. Mrs May\u2019s \u201cnear-invisible\u201d support for Remain (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/brexit-theresa-may-philip-hammond-business\" title=\"\">Andrew Rawnsley, Comment, last week</a>) prompted hardly a murmur compared with the clamour against Corbyn, but positioned her well to assume a Brexiter-in-chief role. In which, by championing immigration control rather than the single market, she has highlighted the humanity and economic sense in Corbyn\u2019s policy.</p> <p>The CBI may not ally itself with Corbyn, but <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/news/cbi-comments-on-jeremy-corbyn-speech/\" title=\"\">did say</a>: \u201cLabour can be reassured that they do have a significant joint agenda with businesses of all sizes, which stand ready to ensure that the opposition\u2019s ideas deliver sustainable prosperity across the UK, and avoid the threat of an era of regressive industrial strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Further, because views on Brexit and Trump resonate, in that some attracted initially are starting to reconsider, Mrs May may have nailed her colours to the mast too early. So, while reneging on a leadership bid commitment to consolidate her own position and maintain party unity may prove to Brexiters \u201cthat she is serious\u201d, it is also a blow against Britain\u2019s economic interests, which business may be slow to forget.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br>Wallington, Surrey</p>",
  "<p>It was the week when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/theresa-may-accepts-need-for-brexit-debate-in-parliament\" title=\"\">fight back against hard Tory Brexit</a> finally began. And the loud squeals of outrage and surprise from startled ministers, sneering pundits and the lie factories of Fleet Street could be heard as far away as Brussels. Having won the vote, Tory Brexiters thought they had won the wider argument. They thought they could make Brexit mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/tory-eurosceptics-push-for-hard-brexit-eu-single-market\" title=\"\">whatever they wanted it to mean</a>. They claimed an overreaching mandate they do not possess. They said, in effect, \u201ctrust us, we know best\u201d. And then, muttering \u201cno running commentaries\u201d, they tried to close down debate.</p> <p>The good news of the past few days is that they have not succeeded. And they will not get away with it. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">result of June\u2019s referendum</a> is not in dispute. A majority voted to leave the EU. Any government, Conservative or Labour, is honour-bound to carry out that instruction. What is in dispute, rightly and passionately, is the manner of that exit, the terms and conditions of Britain\u2019s departure, and the degree of democratic oversight that is necessary and proper. To suggest otherwise is borne of a mixture of churlishness, arrogance and fear.</p> <p>Theresa May and allies such as David Davis and Liam Fox say our elected parliament, the ultimate embodiment of British sovereignty, does not have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/pm-theresa-may-article-50-parliamentary-approval-house-of-lords-committee\" title=\"\">right to vote</a> on when Article 50, triggering formal exit negotiations, is invoked. This is dishonest and wrong. <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/\" title=\"\">Post-referendum polling by Lord Ashcroft</a> clearly showed that a desire to reinforce, not weaken, national sovereignty was the main motivating factor for leave voters, Conservative and Labour alike. Nearly 50% said they supported \u201cthe principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK\u201d. And what could be more important than the Article 50 decision, a fundamental expression of the sovereign will?</p> <p>Answer: the terms on which Britain ultimately leaves, when finally negotiated and agreed by, say, 2019. These will include, crucially, whether British and British-based businesses will continue to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/prices-will-shoot-up-if-uk-fails-to-get-eu-single-market-access-retailers-warn\" title=\"\">access to the single market</a>, on which the country\u2019s economic health in large part depends. Last week\u2019s controversy over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/tesco-running-low-key-unilever-brands-price-row-supplier-supermarket-falling-pound\" title=\"\">sharply rising supermarket prices</a> was an ominous harbinger of worse to come should Britain be shut out of Europe, its trade and commerce plagued by ever greater confusion and new tariffs. Parliament must have its say on any final settlement, too.</p> <p>Yet without a wider consultation with the public they serve, May and her ministers presumptuously suggest they have already decided to arbitrarily toss away these vital trading links. Hard Tory Brexiters say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">Britain can go it alone</a>. They imply a hard Brexit, like George Osborne\u2019s austerity straitjacket, may be tough medicine, but will be good for you in the end. They say the conduct of other key exit issues can safely be left to a self-appointed clique.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/hard-brexit-chaotic-leaving-eu-labour-tories-economic\" title=\"\">Hard Tory Brexit</a>, as we noted last week, has already become a vehicle upon which random reactionary ideas, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">curbs on foreign students</a>, are heaped, regardless of the democratic process and the national interest. May should remember that she is an unelected prime minister. Her retread cabinet should remember that with David Cameron gone and without a general election, they have no real mandate for anything other than following June\u2019s narrow 52-48% vote. Tory Brexit must not be used to impose half-baked, backbench rightwing prejudice on the British people. They do not want it and they did not vote for it.</p> <p>That this sort of criticism is unwelcome among the grand panjandrums of hard Tory Brexit and their mendacious editorial page cheerleaders is already crystal clear. Such arguments are \u201cunpatriotic\u201d, they say; they are remainers\u2019 sour grapes. Such criticism seeks petulantly to overturn June\u2019s supposedly \u201cemphatic verdict\u201d. It comes from members of a \u201cwell-heeled metropolitan elite\u201d who mock the views of \u201cordinary decent people\u201d. They are \u201cwhinging\u201d, \u201cdefeatist\u201d and \u201canti-democratic\u201d.</p> <p>The hard Brexiters and their outriders in the media savage any opposition from the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2013 failing to recognise that they are now the new establishment. As such, they will be subjected to the same scrutiny, interrogation and criticism that they dished out to the old pro-European \u201cestablishment\u201d. Now, while they are in the political and media vanguard, they want to close down debate and silence those who question the nature of the Brexit they are fashioning or supporting.</p> <p>It might be news to the buccaneering hard Brexiters that that is not how things are going to play out. The new establishment will need to get used to having their decisions challenged and motives questioned. That is what happens in a mature democracy. They took it apart, let\u2019s see how well they can fix it. So far? Not so good. Because they evidently went into this mission with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\" title=\"\">next to no idea</a> of how their ideological crusade would work out.</p> <p>They have even begun squabbling among themselves. Last week a parade of anti-European, free market, liberal internationalists were at pains to point out that the referendum wasn\u2019t about immigration and closing down borders. These same people were happy to align themselves with a campaign which peddled the mendacity that Turkey was close to joining the EU. All of these people, by promoting this fiction and failing to challenge other lies and half-truths, fanned the embers of anti-immigration. Seeing them now trying to douse the flames is an object lesson in abdicating responsibility.</p> <p>Yesterday came news that academics are leaving the UK and taking their research funds with them as they turn instead to an open international community on the continent. Not all of this is about the strict rules that will govern our exit from the EU \u2013 it is about the soft tissues of a society that is seen increasingly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/28/campaign-bigotry-racist-britain-leave-brexit\" title=\"\">unwelcoming, xenophobic and inward-looking</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\" title=\"\">those who stood in front of posters</a> claiming that Turkey\u2019s 76 million were about to flood into Birmingham cannot rewrite that narrative. Instead of spending column inches hitting back at remainers, maybe they can spend their time fixing this and other post-vote anxieties.</p> <p>It is not \u201cunpatriotic\u201d to want a Brexit that works for everybody. This is not about ignoring the referendum result, it is about fully respecting it. It is not \u201cdefeatist\u201d to warn about dire economic consequences. We are not in a war against the EU. But when the goodbye moment comes, all bets are off. When that happens, God save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/brexit-mps-david-davis-eu-exit-plan\" title=\"\">the pound</a>, because nobody else will.</p> <p>Regrettably, the divisions sown and exploited by the leave campaign are now carrying over into the workings of everyday government. Arriving in Downing Street, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jul/13/theresa-mays-speech-what-she-said-and-what-she-meant\" title=\"\">May promised to unite the nation</a>. But her lurch rightwards into the hard Tory Brexit camp, her own statements, and her shameful eagerness to appease a triumphal right are dismaying.</p> <p>The weakness of the hard Tory Brexit case may be measured by the intransigent vehemence with which it is defended. But amid all the bluster, cracks are showing. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour belatedly entered the fray last week. Many centre-ground Tories are resisting the hijacking of their party by Europhobe zealots. Remain supporters, while not seeking to overturn June\u2019s result, are regaining their moderating voice across the political spectrum. Theirs is a just cause. Theirs is the truly patriotic cause. Theirs is the cause of common sense, national unity, and a more secure, prosperous future for all. It is vital that they prevail.</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, when asked<em> </em>what she wished she was better at, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\" title=\"\">Lily Allen</a> offered a concise reply. \u201cPress. Shutting up. Self-censorship,\u201d she told me, nonetheless proceeding to say many entertaining things that could have got her into trouble. The singer seems constitutionally incapable of taking the easy route.</p> <p>Last Wednesday Allen posted a video about her visit to the Calais refugee camp, in which she told a 13-year-old Afghan: \u201cI apologise on behalf of my country. I\u2019m sorry for what we have put you through.\u201d The social media backlash was fierce and predictable, as was the response from rightwing tabloids. The <em>Daily Mail</em>\u2019s Jan Moir dismissed Allen\u2019s tears in the video as \u201cpatronising and self-indulgent\u201d, although some might prefer to interpret her distress as something called empathy. Allen stood her ground.</p> <p>The 31-year-old singer, who has described herself as \u201can argumentative little shit\u201d, has been both loved and hated by the press and public for a decade now, as is the fate of pop stars with opinions. Nothing she\u2019s experienced has had the effect of muting her voice. She remains bracingly fearless \u2013 an incorrigible fly in the ointment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was instantly captivating because there seemed to be no distance between her music and her personality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In July she tweeted a photograph that summed up her unusual position in British life. It was a surreptitious snap of Rupert Murdoch, Nigel Farage and Evgeny Lebedev at a garden party, with the caption: \u201cHope I\u2019m not sitting next to Voldemort or Fromage. I might be sick.\u201d The tweet revealed that Allen is enough of an insider to get invited to a party like that and enough of an outsider to not care about being invited back. After 10 years of fame, she still feels like an interloper, making fun of the celebrity circus from the inside.</p> <p>Allen knew a fair bit about showbusiness long before she recorded her first single. Her father, who left when she was four, is actor and hellraiser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/aug/21/2\" title=\"\">Keith Allen</a>, her mother is film producer Alison Owen, and for three years her stepfather was Harry Enfield. Family friends included Joe Strummer and Damien Hirst. It was a privileged childhood in some ways but a complicated one. \u201cI had quite a turbulent upbringing,\u201d she told the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/21/popandrock.lilyallen\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> in her first major interview</a>. \u201cIt was middle class and everything was quite comfortable, but everyone was mental.\u201d</p> <p>She was a lonely, introverted child and a wild teenager who attended 13 schools before dropping out altogether at the age of 15. She did everything young, from drugs to therapy, and couldn\u2019t wait to be an adult. She set her sights on fame, believing it the fastest route to independence and self-worth. (Her younger brother Alfie became an actor, best known as Theon Greyjoy in <em>Game of Thrones</em>.)</p> <p>Allen\u2019s first record deal, with London Records when she was 16, was facilitated by family connections but nothing came of it. As the offspring of celebrities far more famous than Keith Allen will tell you, a foot in the door is not enough. When she signed to EMI for a modest sum in 2005, she was a low priority and the label only really paid attention once she had built up a following herself by posting demos and mixtapes on MySpace.</p> <p>She was instantly captivating because there seemed to be no distance between her music and her personality. On her 2006 debut album <em>Alright, Still</em>, Allen sang about her ex-boyfriend (Smile), her family (Alfie) and everyday life (LDN) with charming directness and caustic wit. Admiring critics compared her with the Specials and the Streets while fans embraced her as One of Us. The album sold 2.5 million copies and BBC3 offered her a short-lived chat show, <em>Lily Allen and Friends</em>. The scale of her success took her by surprise and she often talked about her pop career as a temporary phase rather than a dream fulfilled. This nonchalance enabled her to play less safe than more conventionally ambitious singers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f08a512d9125c566c45cb5ef9252bd5249a650c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f08a512d9125c566c45cb5ef9252bd5249a650c9/0_160_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Allen at a concert in London in June to celebrate the life of murdered MP Jo Cox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lily Allen at a concert in London in June to celebrate the life of murdered MP Jo Cox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an era of media-trained pop stars, Allen was as refreshingly unvarnished as her contemporary Amy Winehouse, albeit more robust. She was funny and opinionated, speaking freely about body image, insecurity and misogyny. She was also easily riled, calling Bob Geldof \u201ca sanctimonious prat\u201d and waging a nasty feud with Cheryl Cole that she later regretted.</p> <p>To her discomfort, the tabloids couldn\u2019t get enough of her. \u201cIf you ask most people, Who\u2019s Lily Allen?, they\u2019ll say, That girl who\u2019s in the papers all the time. Not that girl who wrote songs,\u201d she said. In fact, she\u2019s an astute lyricist who accurately describes her forte as \u201cwry social observations and intimate details of relationships\u201d, and her voice, especially on ballads, has a winning clarity and vulnerability.</p> <p>Her relationship with the tabloids was tense. In 2007 she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a paparazzo. A few months later the <em>Sun</em> published news of her first pregnancy before her three-month scan; she later miscarried.</p> <p>Routinely besieged by the paparazzi, she summed up her ambivalence about celebrity in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/lily-allen-ivor-novello-awards1\" title=\"\">Ivor Novello award-winning</a> 2009 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P191zutE1D0\" title=\"\">The Fear</a>, which is still her best song: \u201cI am a weapon of massive consumption / And it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s how I\u2019m programmed to function.\u201d The song works so well because she implicates herself in the worst aspects of the fame industry. Indeed, her behaviour at the time was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and out of control. \u201cI\u2019m such a hypocrite,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I love that song so much, because it\u2019s so ironic and contradictory.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 Allen quit music \u2013 for good, she thought \u2013 in order to move to Gloucestershire and start a family with Sam Cooper, an old friend whom she married the following year. The couple, who separated recently, have two daughters. On Twitter, she renamed herself Lily Rose Cooper, as if to say that Lily Allen, pop star, was history. Allen had been talking about leaving the music industry as far back as her first album, but the quiet life left her unfulfilled, and the <em>Bridget Jones</em> musical she was co-writing fell through. In 2012 she began writing songs again with producer Greg Kurstin.</p> <p>Her 2013 comeback sent mixed messages. A delicate cover of Keane\u2019s Somewhere Only We Know for John Lewis\u2019s Christmas ad campaign was followed by the boisterous satire of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0CazRHB0so\" title=\"\">Hard Out Here</a>. The song itself was a feminist statement about the treatment of women in the music industry but the video, which parodied clips such as Robin Thicke\u2019s notorious Blurred Lines, botched the message by seeming to reinforce the stereotypes she was trying to critique. She received a shellacking online.</p> <p>Attacking her use of women of colour in the video, the critic Julianne Escobedo Shepherd accused Allen of \u201cusing racism to skewer sexism\u201d. Even without that controversy, Allen seemed conflicted about returning to the pop fray. Among the songs about marriage and womanhood on her patchy third album, <em>Sheezus,</em> (a pun on Kanye West\u2019s <em>Yeezus</em>) were angry sideswipes at celebrity culture and internet trolls. She described it as \u201ca vomit of stuff that\u2019s happened to me over the last few years\u201d. Reviews were mixed and sales disappointing.</p> <p>A fourth album, which will reunite her with producer Mark Ronson, is yet to arrive but Allen\u2019s fame rolls on regardless.</p> <p>Having previously joined campaigns relating to climate change and internet piracy, she has become increasingly politically outspoken on Twitter. She\u2019s a staunch supporter of Jeremy Corbyn (she called Tom Watson \u201ca snake\u201d last month for appearing to undermine the Labour leader), a backer of the Women\u2019s Equality party, and an opponent of Brexit.</p> <p>In April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/16/lily-allen-stalked-singer-police\" title=\"\">she spoke openly</a> about the man who had stalked her for the last seven years, in order to highlight harassment of women and the inadequate police response. The visit to Calais is further evidence of her desire to use her profile productively, regardless of the consequences.</p> <p>Unlike some celebrity activists, Allen is not sanctimonious. \u201cI\u2019m not a prophet, I\u2019m not a politician, I\u2019m not a game-changer,\u201d she told me. She has always been open about her contradictions and shortcomings, in both her interviews and songs, and this openness is her most likable quality.</p> <p>Most famous people understandably erect walls to protect themselves, absenting themselves from social media and avoiding tricky subjects in interviews. In order to make themselves less vulnerable, they make themselves less interesting.</p> <p>Allen may be happier than 10 years ago but she is scarcely less forceful, as if any serious concession to diplomacy would be an admission of defeat. She has said that women in the music industry have often been told: \u201cKeep your mouth shut or people will laugh at you,\u201d so she speaks her mind out of defiance rather than arrogance. Also, perhaps, because she just can\u2019t help herself. Allen once said her ambition, as a teenager, was to \u201cmake a lot of noise\u201d.

  "<p>Grocer John Papworth is trying to drum up custom at his fruit and veg stall in Chapel Market in Islington, north London, on a sunny Saturday morning. It is hard going. \u201cIt\u2019s the only game in the world where the price changes daily, he says. \u201cBut now, the pound being so weak is really starting to affect us. I don\u2019t like saying it\u2019s all because of Brexit [which he voted for], but the pound\u2019s fall has definitely made things much worse. Our suppliers have got to pay more, so we\u2019ve got to pay more.\u201d</p> <p>An elderly woman shopper overhears him and says: \u201cIt is all thanks to the people who voted Leave!\u201d At the other end of the market, Peter Fleming, a florist, points to his stock of potted plants which all came from the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s this week with the pound stuff that it\u2019s started to really bite. This week it\u2019s gone up 15%. If it gets any worse, we\u2019re going to have to start passing the cost on \u2013 or buying less. This is just the start \u2013 and all because we\u2019ve voted out.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few days, the downside of sterling\u2019s fall, driven at least in part by fears that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit, has begun to hit home not just across the floor of the House of Commons and in currency trading rooms but also on the high street.</p> <p>Midweek there was \u201cMarmitegate\u201d, when Tesco removed a series of products from its shelves<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/13/pound-sterling-brexit-price-row-tesco-unilever-live\"> in a dispute with its supplier, Unilever, over rising prices</a>. The consumer brands company briefly halted deliveries after the supermarket refused to stump up price rises of about 10% for a range of household products and groceries. A deal was eventually agreed and supplies resumed.</p> <p>Political messages caused currency gyrations that in turn hit consumers. Every utterance by a government minister about Brexit affected the markets. By Tuesday, sterling was down more than 18% against the dollar since 23 June. The pound sank to $1.213, down from $1.488 on the day of the referendum.</p> <p>It is not all gloom out there. The <em>Daily Mail </em>and<em> Daily Express</em> certainly don\u2019t think so. They point out that the stock market is way above its 23 June level and that the economy is in rude good health as we head out of the EU, though this view is not shared by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The <em>Mail</em> has branded those who warn of dangers ahead the \u201cBremoaners\u201d.</p> <p>But as Theresa May\u2019s government prepares for what looks like an exit from the single market, while denying MPs a say over the issue, it is not just remainers who are worried. In the Commons, in the rightwing media and among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/business-leaders-urge-theresa-may-to-avoid-hard-brexit\">business community</a>, new and in some cases surprising alliances are forming to fight for a soft landing.</p> <p>Even Conservative MPs who backed Brexit voiced their worries on Wednesday, siding with Labour, Liberal Democrat, Scottish Nationalist and Green colleagues. Anti-EU newspaper columnists in pro-Brexit papers were speaking out too, and in the high court a group of QCs warned that Brexit was being driven through in an unconstitutional, undemocratic way.</p> <p>The worries among politicians, businesspeople and opinion formers are broadly twofold: first, that MPs in parliament might be bypassed when the country decides what kind of Brexit we pursue; and, second, that May and her ministers seem so ready to ditch single-market membership in order to control immigration.</p> <p>The Labour MP Pat McFadden, a leading member of the Open Europe campaign that is battling to keep close ties with the EU, said: \u201cThis was the week when the reality of Brexit began to bite \u2013 in our economy, in our parliament and in our public debate. Issues that featured little before 23 June \u2013 like the value of the currency, the impact on prices, and what\u2019s at stake with the single market \u2013 have come to the fore.\u201d</p> <h2>What they\u2019re saying:<br>Rightwing commentators<br></h2> <p>After campaigning for Brexitand trumpeting the economy\u2019s resilience in its aftermath, some commentators on the right now sound queasy about bypassing parliament, ignoring the interests of the 48% who voted Remain, and turning our backs on the single market.</p> <p>Veteran columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/may/13/christopher-booker-misleading\">Christopher Booker</a> has been savage about the EU for decades but now appears worried that Britain is about to leave in a manner that will seriously damage the economy. On Monday he wrote that \u201cthose who have done their homework\u201d had worked out that \u201cthe only interim arrangement that could conceivably work is the soft Brexit option\u201d.

Is that what we want? The alternative is that the executive decides these matters on its own with no proper accountability. That really is a democratic deficit. Actually, let\u2019s not mince words. That\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d</p> <p>And the Eurosceptic sage Charles Moore, former <em>Spectator </em>and<em> Telegraph</em> editor, wrote: \u201cMay in her [conference] speech did not try hard enough to mingle the victorious and the defeated in the EU referendum. After all, 48% of those voting, including one Theresa May, lost. They are not a negligible rump. Nor \u2026 are they unpatriotic. They should not be outlawed from the next chapter of our island story.\u201d</p> <h2>Business leaders<br></h2> <p>Many leaders of big business were appalled by the Brexit vote but hadn\u2019t in their worst dreams imagined that it would mean leaving the single market. Ministerial talk over the past week has, however, made that seem increasingly likely, triggering sterling\u2019s fall. The period of post-referendum calm is over.</p> <p>Leading the chorus of concern last week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/hard-brexit-risks-destroying-uks-open-economy-says-cbi-chief\">Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI</a>. \u201cWhat we have heard over the past few days, if you add up the messages, are signs that the door is being closed on the open economy, which has helped fuel investment. It\u2019s very clear from conversations we are having that the world is watching. International investors are watching. Companies here are watching. And they are reading a lot into the signals of this government about how committed they are to creating a strong economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51684a3251b233f775a1b77830b7f52d6c9e3739/1517_168_1475_1844/800.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, warned of signs the door was being closed on the open economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EEF (formerly the Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation) warned of disastrous results if the UK leaves the single market and shuts the door on EU migrants: \u201cRushing into a deal at any cost would be calamitous for business \u2026 We must protect access to the single market and the ability of businesses to hire and deploy staff as they need to.\u201d</p> <p>Car manufacturer Nissan received reassurances from the government that it would not be harmed by Brexit, and would not have to pull investment plans. But doubts persist.</p> <h2>MPs of all stripes<br></h2> <p>Surprising alliances were struck in the Commons last week, with Tory MPs, including some who backed Brexit, teaming up with Labour, Scottish Nationalist and Liberal Democrat colleagues.</p> <p>The Eurosceptic hard core who caused trouble for successive Tory leaders is being replaced by an equally awkward squad of soft Brexiters. Some want parliament involved, others stress the importance of the single market, and plenty want both.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewtyrie\">Andrew Tyrie</a>, the pro-Brexit Conservative MP who chairs the treasury select committee, told the House: \u201cWe want a high degree of access to the single market, in my view. To fall back immediately on World Trade Organisation rules would risk an economic shock and certainly an economic downturn, given the high degree of trade integration at the moment between Britain and the EU.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged\">Stephen Phillips,</a> the Conservative member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who backed Brexit, emerged suddenly as a rebel. \u201cI and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government that apparently wishes to ignore the views of the house on the most important issue facing the nation.\u201d</p> <p>Labour sharpened up its act as Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, and its new Brexit spokesman, argued that his party was not trying to stop Brexit but wanted MPs to be involved in deciding the least damaging route to the exit door. Plenty of Tories agreed.</p> <h2>Traders and consumers<br></h2> <p>Theresa May has reassured Leave voters that she will take Britain out of the EU by saying \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d but if people begin to think it also means rising prices, more expensive holidays and higher inflation, she may need to find another catchphrase.</p> <p>On Tuesday, ITV ran an item on its main evening news bulletin from a London market and canvassed views on the effect of sterling\u2019s fall on traders and shoppers. A fruit seller said he\u2019d had to push up the price of tangerines by 20%. \u201cAt the weekend it was \u00a31 a pound, now we are having to go \u00a31.20.\u201d</p> <p>A florist said the price of flowers from the Netherlands had doubled in three months and she was concerned that she would lose business.</p> <p>This was before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/13/pound-sterling-brexit-price-row-tesco-unilever-live\">\u201cMarmitegate\u201d </a>, when Tesco removed products from its shelves in a dispute with its supplier, Unilever, which wanted to increase the price of its household goods and groceries by 10%.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/prices-to-continue-rising-warns-bank-of-england-governor\">Mark Carney</a>, said he would tolerate inflation going up \u201ca bit\u201d. Now market analysts expect it to rise from its current 0.6% level to above 2.5% over the next two years. With wages unlikely to follow suit, will hard Brexit still look like such a good idea?</p> <h2>Senior lawyers<br></h2> <p>Senior lawyers last week launched a case in the high court, arguing that ministers acting alone should not be able to trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\">Article 50</a>, the process that will lead to Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc449b525cad4b11aa3ae8e86eb73356b92c184/870_0_2323_2903/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Miller at the high court\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gina Miller arrives at the high court for the challenge to Theresa May\u2019s right to trigger article 50 without a parliamentary vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They argued that parliament should be involved in that process and that it should not be done through the use of the royal prerogative, as currently planned.

  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/boris-johnson-military-options-against-syrian-regime-being-considered\" title=\"\">suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are re-examining \u201cmilitary options\u201d </a>in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: post-Soviet Russia\u2019s determined drive to re-establish itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end.</p> <p>The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up anti-Russian \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s call for demonstrations outside Russia\u2019s London embassy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/russia-boris-johnson-syria-aleppo-war-crime-russophobic-hysteria\">invited similar, retaliatory action</a> against British interests in Moscow. The gaffe underlined his inexperience and lack of judgment.</p> <p>But on Syria\u2019s plight, and particularly on war crimes allegedly committed during the relentless \u201cpulverising\u201d of Aleppo, Johnson had a point. His comments served to highlight the much bigger strategic, security and diplomatic problem: what to do about Russia.</p> <p>Military options are indeed being discussed again in Washington, from where Britain usually takes its cue. The key question is no longer how best to remove the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. It is how to stop the Russian military, Assad\u2019s main backer, which is held responsible, directly or indirectly, for numerous lethal aerial attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/19/syria-ceasefire-is-over-says-countrys-military\" title=\"\">last month\u2019s destruction of a UN aid convoy</a>.</p> <p>So furious was John Kerry, the US secretary of state, at what he saw as Moscow\u2019s deliberate sabotage of the latest Syria ceasefire that he broke off bilateral talks with Moscow. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/25/russia-accused-war-crimes-syria-un-security-council-aleppo\" title=\"\">Samantha Power, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of \u201cbarbarism\u201d</a>. But repeating a pattern of behaviour familiar in Ukraine, Georgia and other crises, an unabashed Putin refused to back down. On the contrary, he rapidly upped the ante.</p> <p>Within days of Kerry\u2019s move and official leaks that the White House was considering cruise missile strikes on Syrian military airstrips, the Russian defence ministry warned that Russia had deployed advanced S-300 and S-400 ground-to-air missiles in Syria. Any US bombing raids would be deemed threatening to Russian military personnel, who would respond accordingly. Moscow also <a href=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\" title=\"http://uatoday.tv/news/russia-builds-up-forces-in-syria-reuters-782194.html\">doubled supplies to the Assad</a> regime\u2019s war effort.</p> <p>Almost simultaneously, Putin scrapped a US-Russia agreement to reprocess excess plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons and two other nuclear cooperation agreements. The deployment of short-range, nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles in Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave in eastern Europe bordering Nato members Poland and Lithuania, was confirmed. And, not coincidentally perhaps, massive civil defence exercises were held inside Russia, in apparent preparation for a nuclear war.</p> <p>Just in case Washington had not understood how serious Russia was, officials also declared Putin was considering reopening military bases in Cuba and Vietnam. It is hard to think of a more defiant, taunting message to the Obama administration than conjuring the spectre of a new Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Demonstrating that Moscow has other strategic partnerships that could be turned against Washington, Russian ships joined military exercises with China around the disputed South China Sea islands. It is also busily building up alliances with emerging powers such as South Africa and India, notably at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\" title=\"http://www.firstpost.com/business/brics-summit-in-goa-from-defence-to-food-deals-india-and-russia-push-ahead-to-reshape-trade-ties-3050782.html\">Brics summit in Goa</a>, while courting traditional American allies such as Turkey and the Philippines.</p> <p>Sergei Lavrov, Putin\u2019s veteran foreign minister, was blunt. Russia would not be told what to do. Like it or not, it was once again a global force to be reckoned with. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/2485001\" title=\"\">Washington... cannot use the language of force, sanctions and ultimatums</a> with Russia while continuing to selectively cooperate with our country only when it benefits the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week, Putin himself took to the airwaves to deliver a similar message. Responding to a formal accusation by the US government that Moscow had launched a cyber warfare-style campaign to \u201cinterfere with the US election process\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN12C27H\">Putin denied</a> he was trying to help the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cThey started this hysteria, saying this [hacking] is in Russia\u2019s interests, but this has nothing to do with Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Putin said. His government would work with whoever won the election \u201cif, of course, the new US leader wishes to work with our country\u201d.</p> <p>This latter statement was chilling. Putin was plainly saying that Russia, no longer the post-Communist economic and military basket-case it briefly became under his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia1\" title=\"\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, does not need or seek American approval or agreement to take action in its own interests in Syria or anywhere else. If Barack Obama or his successor want to do business in future, then Russia must be treated as a global equal, not as an irritant or a spoiler or mere regional actor.</p> <p>Such assertions flatly contradict Washington\u2019s preferred narrative, namely that the west \u201cwon\u201d the cold war and Russia is no longer a great power. Hence, perhaps, American slowness to come to terms with a changed situation. But the grave implications of unravelling US-Russia relations are slowly sinking in across Europe, as always the nervous pig stuck in the middle. The German magazine<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\" title=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syria-war-became-conflict-between-usa-and-russia-and-iran-a-1115681.html\"><em>Spiegel</em> recently suggested that Syria was the most prominent battlefront</a> in a new global war, more perilous even than the Cold War because the old power structures and rules are no longer in place.</p> <p>Yet any sort of western consensus over what to do about Russia remains elusive. Opinion is divided in Europe, where many countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, for example, oppose sanctions on Moscow in addition to those imposed after Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Poland and the Baltic states, threatened by the Kaliningrad deployment and border troop build-ups, demand a more muscular Nato stance. Neutral Finland and Sweden, troubled by Russian air and sea incursions, edge ever closer to the western alliance.</p> <p>The so-called Minsk group is due to make another attempt to advance a Ukraine settlement. But nobody is optimistic; the situation there is steadily deteriorating. Following the bad-tempered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/11/vladimir-putin-declines-french-offer-of-syria-only-talks-in-paris\" title=\"\">cancellation last week of Putin\u2019s visit to France</a>, EU heads of state are also due to meet on Thursday with Syria-related sanctions against Russia on the agenda. This, too, may prove a non-event.</p> <p>In Britain, meanwhile, as Johnson splutters impotently and contradicts himself over no-fly zones, the Labour party claims against all known facts that there is some kind of equivalence between Russian and US actions in Syria. If opposition fighters vacate Aleppo (handing victory to Assad), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/stop-the-war-coalition-protest-russian-embassy\">Labour suggests</a>, all will be well. Its script could have been written by the Kremlin.</p> <p>The challenge presented by Russia is one of the biggest facing the next US president. Some analysts say Putin is taking advantage of Obama\u2019s lame duck status to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in Syria. The Russian president is said to anticipate a further deterioration in bilateral relations if Hillary Clinton wins. The two have a history of personal dislike, dating back to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. \u201cShe says she sees in him a cold-blooded, self-enriching KGB agent and a bully; he remembers how she appeared to encourage street protests against him in 2011,\u201d said analyst <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/i-m-an-anti-putin-russian-and-clinton-makes-me-nervous\">Leonid Bershidsky</a>. Speaking in August, Clinton described Putin as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/25/hillary-clintons-alt-right-speech-annotated/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe grand godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism</a>\u201d \u2013 lumping him with Trump, German anti-immigrant xenophobes and hard-right populists such as France\u2019s Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>Assuming Trump loses, a Clinton administration has three possible courses of action. One is to acknowledge Putin has a fair case when he argues that the US, the EU and Nato ignored or trampled on Russia\u2019s interests in the post-Soviet era, accept that Crimea is lost and that Assad stays in power for the time being, and focus in future on pragmatic, one-off \u201ctransactional\u201d deals where interests coincide.</p> <p>A second approach is a longer-term variation on the first, containing Russia wherever possible, maintaining or toughening sanctions, and waiting for the departure of Putin and what some economists say will be Russia\u2019s inevitable economic collapse as its oil and gas runs out and international ostracism, corruption and a declining working-age population take their toll. The plan would be to re-set relations (again) with a post-Putin \u201cnew Russia\u201d.</p> <p>The third possibility, and one that seems most likely at this point given Clinton\u2019s policy positions, is that the US will move on to the front foot and purposefully confront Russia directly, not only in Syria but on a number of other areas, backed up by the possible use of military force.</p> <p>This prospect is fraught with danger, especially since Putin has shown repeatedly that he reacts badly to diktats and threats. When cornered, Putin does not back down. He escalates. He does not have a domestic electorate, critical parliament or independent media scrutiny to worry about. He disdains international opinion and international law. Despite last month\u2019s bust-up, Kerry and Lavrov met again on Saturday to try to agree another Syria ceasefire. But a lasting solution looks as far away as ever. If the past 15 years show anything, it is that Putin, like a marauding Red Army tank, has no reverse gear. Much in the Middle East, Europe and beyond now rides on what an untested Clinton, with an awful lot to prove, decides is the best way forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b73adb0e7201111a5beb721979d9c87db20b43f3/0_72_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line near Donetsk, Ukraine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Pro-Russian rebel troops withdraw from the front line about 50km from Donetsk, Ukraine, as part of the demilitarisation agreement signed in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s decision not to intervene militarily after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons left the door open for Russia. By going to the aid of his long-term ally Assad, Putin saw a chance to expand Russian influence in the Middle East at American expense and secure military bases on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. Fighting Islamic State terrorism was a secondary consideration. The US insists Assad must go, but its limited commitment so far means the non-jihadist opposition continues to struggle while civilians bear the brunt of the violence.</p> <h2>UKRAINE</h2> <p>Despite the US-orchestrated imposition of international sanctions on Russia, Putin shows no sign of reversing his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow\u2019s not-so-secret support for separatists in eastern Ukraine opposing the pro-western government in Kiev continues unabated, with renewed fighting reported last week. Peace efforts led by Germany in the so-called Minsk group have stalled. Given the US believes it is upholding an important principle of international law, a future Clinton administration is unlikely to recognise Russian-made \u201cfacts on</p> <p>the ground\u201d.</p> <h2>THE BALTIC FRONT<br><br></h2> <p>The deployment of Russian nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, the isolated enclave it controls on Poland\u2019s and Lithuania\u2019s border, is the latest move in a war of nerves along Europe\u2019s eastern flank. The Baltic sea has also become a contested area as Russian submarines and aircraft test western reactions. Nato has beefed up its defences, and Britain has pledged its support. But the uncomfortable question remains: would an American president</p> <p>go to war to defend Estonia?</p> <h2>CYBER <br>WARFARE<br></h2> <p>The US has formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to disrupt the American presidential electoral process. The suspicion is that Putin, who has been praised by Donald Trump, wants Hillary Clinton defeated and the credibility of the election result put in doubt. Trump has already claimed the poll is fixed against him. Putin denies involvement. But the affair resembles previous cyber attacks on countries that were blamed on government-backed Russian hackers.</p> <h2>THE UNITED NATIONS<br></h2> <p>The US and Putin\u2019s Russia have clashed repeatedly in the UN Security Council, most recently over Moscow\u2019s veto of a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. The standoff has raised wider concerns about the effectiveness of the UN system when permanent members appear permanently at odds and its aid convoys are blown up. Russia is accused by the US of ignoring international law and of possible war crimes, and there are moves to refer it to the International Criminal Court.</p>",
  "<p>Shark enthusiasts are concerned about the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/oct/14/great-white-smashes-through-shark-cage-during-diving-trip-video\">a viral video</a> that showed a great white shark breaking into a cage occupied by a diver in Mexico. </p> <p>The diver survived, but the harrowing video shed light on a decades-old tourism industry that allows people to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/nov/29/food.southafrica\">within an arm\u2019s length of great white sharks</a>, separated only by the sea and some metal bars. </p> <p>\u201cThe truth, of course, was that the tourist got more than he bargained for, but on balance the shark came out the worse for wear,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.biminisharklab.com/about/drgruber\">Samuel Gruber</a>, a shark conservationist and founder of the Bimini SharkLab in the Bahamas, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cClearly it was bleeding from the gills and from an area near the dorsal fin,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cIt is also clear to me that the shark was attracted to the cage for purposes of exciting footage.\u201d</p> <p>But Gruber said he did not oppose shark diving because he hoped it could \u201cturn those who hate and revile these magnificent creatures into ambassadors\u201d.</p> <p>He also emphasized that this incident was unusual, just like shark attacks.</p> <p>The diver, Chan Ming, was unharmed and said he was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ming.chan.3998263/posts/10154053740425838\">reborn</a>\u201d after the incident in a Facebook post that followed his viral fame.</p> <p>Chan had arrived home to Shanghai by the time footage of the incident was released on Thursday, racking up more than 9.5m views on YouTube.<br></p> <p>Chan <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ming.chan.3998263/posts/10154069757195838\">said on Facebook </a>that he did not blame the accident on anybody and called the diving vessel\u2019s team his \u201cheroes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo one need to take responsibility,\u201d Chan said. \u201cThe boat teams are professional.\u201d</p> <p>Seconds after the shark entered the cage, the crew opened the cage\u2019s top hatch, allowing the shark to push out of the water and dive back into the ocean. </p> <p>Being trapped in a metal cage is a particularly difficult situation for sharks, since they cannot swim backwards. Also, when great white sharks attack prey, <a href=\"http://www.sharksavers.org/en/education/biology/myth-sharks-have-poor-vision1/\">they briefly close their eyes</a>, creating a moment of unpredictability \u2013 even for the animal. </p> <p>Jorge Cervera Hauser, a managing partner of Chan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SolmarV.liveaboard/photos/br.Abr9m-NBSgVKrnqzhIwcI_n0HfuzysmuGKUtM1GhWk33hG30xQlT_sN-HcggIvBnQIyHZg93RxoR8wOaWulv9AwYdKY4qFfQb2zImBvfo8JgOkkThZeT5lBjX4ygu_ZB3M3yPQEHKqhvIgd2hD41YBhqXxaSDKAt6Llfjnut76JSl2NevoftUn6OytBf6w0H4ro/10153762223072245/?type=3&amp;theater\">diving vessel, Solmar V, also said in a statement </a>that the incident was \u201cvery rare and unusual\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe diver was completely unharmed after the incident, and the shark did not suffer any serious injuries,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cIt is also important to note that shark breaches of this magnitude are a one in a million occurrence.\u201d </p> <p>Hauser said the vessel had been an injury-free operation since opening in 2004 and that the operation had also inspected and reinforced its cages.</p> <p>When the incident occurred, the vessel was off Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, one of two hotspots for great white shark cage-diving in the world along with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/13/adventure.extremesportsholidays.watersportsholidays\"> Gansbaai, South Africa</a>. </p> <p>Depending on the location and length of time spent on the boat, trips can cost between $100 and several thousand dollars. </p> <p>Chan was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsdIrlrSi8\">not the first person</a> to get closer than he planned on one of these extreme encounters. In November 2007, Patrick Walsh was on a tour in Isla Guadalupe when a shark wedged itself through the bars of the cage. Walsh, like Chan, used an escape hatch to exit the cage while waiting for the shark to get out. </p> <p>\u201cIt just snapped this cage to pieces, it was like it was made out of balsa wood,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2obQ4kTNcc\">Walsh told Animal Planet. </a></p> <p>Yet Walsh said the incident would not deter him from his love for sharks. \u201cI was back in the water 15 minutes after the accident,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Chan had a similar reaction. When asked <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/world/americas/diver-recounts-his-encounter-with-a-cage-breaking-great-white-shark.html?_r=0\">by the New York Times</a> when he returned to the water, Chan said: \u201cThe next day.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A powerful cross-party group of MPs is to renew pressure on ministers over Brexit by forcing a parliamentary vote on whether they should reveal their plans for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU before negotiations begin.

  "<p>The far left\u2019s ideology is not \u201cleftwing\u201d in any sense that a socialist from the 19th or 20th centuries would have understood. It is simply opposition to the west whatever the west does. Occidentalism explains the appearances of Labour\u2019s leaders on Iran\u2019s propaganda <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/jeremy-corbyn-paid-iran-press-tv-tortured-journalist-2016-6\" title=\"\">channels</a> , the endorsements of <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2015/03/projecting-the-kremlin-line/\" title=\"\">Russian imperialism</a>, and the silence that greets the Syrian massacres.</p> <p>There is no secret about the nihilism and double standards. Both have been obvious to me at any rate since the bulk of the left failed to show solidarity with the victims of Saddam Hussein in the Iraq war of <a href=\"http://www.workersliberty.org/node/3569\" title=\"\">2003</a> . Nor does the far left, if we can call it a left, try to hide its prejudices. When asked why the streets of London were not heaving with demonstrators protesting against Russia turning Aleppo into the Guernica of our times, Stop the War replied that it had no wish to add to the \u201cjingoism\u201d politicians were whipping up against <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/europe/201610121046260722-stop-the-war-johnson/\" title=\"\">plucky little Russia</a>. The left\u2019s task was \u201cto oppose the west\u201d. That was all.</p> <p>I have criticised the hollowed-out leftism of the 21st century many times, and could fulminate about how no one has yet provided a satisfactory answer to the question: why is it \u201cleftwing\u201d to&#xa0;support the gangster-capitalist Russian state?</p> <p>I could note that the mainstream media has not realised that British Islam is overwhelmingly Sunni, but its supposed defenders on the \u201cleft\u201d are now allied with Putin, Assad and the Iranian and Hezbollah death squads \u2013 the Shia side in the Sunni/Shia religious war, in other words.</p> <p>But let me be generous instead. Jeremy Corbyn does not often give me the chance to defend him, and it is therefore all the more of a pleasure to redress the imbalance today. When his supporters say he is consistent, they are telling the truth. His illiberal worldview is entirely coherent. The trouble is, it is wholly despicable, and provokes the troubling question whether it is so different from the worldview of the west\u2019s \u201crespectable\u201d leaders.</p> <p>There have been repeated opportunities for Barack Obama to take a lead on Syria. The Syrian revolution was political, rather than sectarian, in its initial stages, but he looked away. He might have responded when Assad imitated Saddam and used chemical weapons against civilians, or raised the conscience of the world when Islamic state engaged in the industrial-scale rape of <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/09/yazidi-survivors.aspx\" title=\"\">Yazidi women</a>.</p> <p>As it was, the practical effect of Nato policy has been to give Russia a free pass, as Corbyn does.</p> <p>Suppose western leaders called Russia\u2019s bluff and insisted on a no-fly zone over Aleppo and a safe haven in northern Syria for refugees. I think you can imagine the reaction. I am very uncomfortable with the term \u201cfar left\u201d for many reasons, not the smallest being that Corbynism is not an alien ideology that appeared from the fringe, but a grotesque version of the worst prejudices of polite society.</p> <p>In the last decade, mainstream liberals were just as likely as post-socialist tyrannophiles to tell you that the west was the source of the world\u2019s ills. Those who disagreed were browbeaten with accusations that they were neo-cons, Zionists, warmongers, supporters of torture in Abu Ghraib and so on. Propaganda techniques allowed the mainstream to assure itself that criticism of its orthodoxies was driven by the lowest of motives; a myopic certainty that stopped it seeing sinister movements in the British left that were in front of its nose, let alone sinister movements in the rest of the world. People complaining about Stop the War failing to organise demonstrations against Russia should ask why Amnesty International and other liberal organisations don\u2019t mount them instead. Obama and European leaders must have known that, after Iraq, opposition to intervention in Syria would have come from all quarters: from the far left, from liberal opinion, and from a right wing that is increasingly nationalist and isolationist.</p> <p>The sympathy shown for Putin by Corbyn and Jill Stein, the American Greens\u2019 presidential candidate, is all the more shameful because Donald Trump is an admirer of Putin, as is Marine le Pen\u2019s National Front and the leaders of Europe\u2019s other far-right parties. The very people Corbyn and Stein condemn at home for their racism, they tacitly endorse abroad. As I said earlier, there is an \u201cL\u201d-shaped hole where the left should be. But in terms of practical politics it is clear that whatever label people slap on themselves, their similarities are more striking than their differences.</p> <p>From the president of the United States, via the liberal left and nationalist right, to you and me, are we all Jeremy Corbyn now? When we turn off the pictures from Aleppo and look in the mirror, do we see the blandly wicked features of the Labour leader gazing back at us?</p> <p>Shiraz Maher and other authorities on the Syrian revolution still believe that Putin would back away from a determined western effort to enforce a no-fly zone. I am not a military authority and cannot judge. It feels as if the time for intervention has passed, and al-Qaida is too entrenched in the Syrian opposition. Europe will now have to live with refugee flows, and the rightwing backlashes they provoke, for decades.</p> <p>I can say from experience that, however, if you do not want to see Corbyn\u2019s face in the mirror, you must resolve to never again bend the knee before fashionable opinion.</p> <p>Perhaps the best that will come from the far left\u2019s control of the Labour party is that it will change the minds of hundreds of thousands who went along with fashionable but disgraceful ideas, as much because of the social pressure to conform as any political motive.</p> <p>I could be sneery and say they should have thought for themselves before the \u201cleft\u201d dumped us with a British nationalist government without an opposition capable of fighting it.</p> <p>But you should never sneer at people finding the bravery to shake off old prejudices, and learning while they do it that it does not need a great deal of courage for comfortable westerners to change their minds.</p> <p>Indeed, when compared to the courage of civilians trying to escape Russian bombs and Iranian guns in Syria, it takes no real courage at all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you do not want to see Corbyn\u2019s face in the mirror, resolve to never again bend the knee before fashionable opinion</p> </blockquote> </aside>",

It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates too.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hello, Andrew. Firstly, thanks very much for your coverage. I think we've now hit a point where the reactions need to be divided into 'domestic' and 'UK' reactions. In Scotland, the speech on Thursday was just a clear statement of what we already knew: there was a bit more detail but no change in Scottish govt policy since the morning after the Brexit vote. But in London you haven't been following that debate, so it was big news to you. </p> <p>For Scottish people the use of the word 'home rule' today was an intriguing straw in the wind, to me at least way more interesting than Thursday's announcements. That's parking the SNP's tanks on Labour's lawn and claiming to be the heirs of devolution, while merging the notions of indy /FFA / devolution. And for us, hospitals and the care system aren't boring compared to the indy/not-indy debate: it's what governments (and nations) are <i>for</i>.

Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s end of conference speech is supposed to be her most important of the week, but south of the border her speech on Thursday threatening a second independence referendum if Scotland gets forced out of the single market is the one that people will remember from this week. It may well be that in Scotland it is the one that resonates most too.</p> <p>After more than nine years in office in Scotland it is getting harder (although by no means impossible, given the limits on the Scottish parliament\u2019s power) for the SNP to explain away poor public services, and there was evidence of that today, in Derek Mackay\u2019s Today interview (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9#block-5801f112e4b0160123895fd9\"> 10.42am)</a> and the reception John Swinney got at an education fringe (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/15/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-speech-scots-cant-trust-boris-johnson-and-liam-fox-to-represent-them-says-sturgeon-politics-live?page=with:block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c#block-58022583e4b047a4eaafcc3c\"> 1.50pm)</a>. And you could detect some evidence of this too in Sturgeon\u2019s speech, which was notably free of boasting. Instead it was pragmatic and workmanlike (and probably all the better for that).</p> <p>At the heart of the speech was a series of solid, but mainstream and detail-light policies. The best passage came when Sturgeon was talking about failings in the care service, and the need for children to be loved. (\u2018My view is simple: every young person deserves to be loved.\u201d) She tied this in well with her theme of \u201cinclusion\u201d, although a lot of her comments on children in care could have come straight from a speech by David Cameron on life chances. The announcement on NHS funding raised the question of what hospital units might have be to be cut as part of this reconfiguration. And, for someone from England, the announcement on childcare was interesting because of the tacit admission that choice at present is not a strong feature of Scottish childcare provision.

Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First of all, the taxation burden referred to in the motion is a matter for local authorities, not individual schools, with councils paying business rates on all schools under their control. Charitable status would therefore represent a significant saving for local authorities which could certainly free up more money for education spending. So far so good.</p> <p>The trouble is that business rates are paid to the Scottish Government which also provides the vast majority of councils\u2019 cash. Charitable status for around 100 private schools costs the Scottish government about \u00a310m a year, so imagine the figure for 2500 state schools.</p> <p>If the government could promise not to claw back this money by reducing education funding then that would be one thing, but the money will surely have to come from somewhere.</p> <p>Furthermore, if the government is indeed willing to finance a significant increase in education spending \u2014 such as would be achieved by non-domestic rates exemptions \u2014 then why not simply hand over the money right now?</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58022748e4b047a4eaafcc40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T13:02:28.480Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more on the debate earlier on the vote to give charitable status to state schools in Scotland.

By educating their children at private schools they benefit from about \u00a390m of tax breaks annually. </p> <p>Effectively we have a situation just now where the state subsidises educational segregation and class privilege. The system as it stands also perpetuates educational inequality and that has a knock on effect on child poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>He highlighted the case of Fettes College, where fees are around \u00a324,000 a year, which he said benefited from an 80% reduction in non-domestic rates while providing bursaries for 2% of pupils. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The system at the moment means that elitist private schools which serve the rich, the privileged and those that are already advantaged in life\u2019s race enjoy charitable status while state schools serving the wider population, which undoubtedly provide a public benefit, do not. </p> <p>It is time for state schools to be treated equally with private schools. It is time for our hard-pressed state schools to have this glaring anomaly removed, it\u2019s time for a level playing field for Scotland\u2019s children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Several delegates said it would be better just to remove charitable status from schools. One of them, <strong>Peter Henderson</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re going about this the wrong way round. Remove charitable status for private schools to level the playing field. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Sutherland revealed that his branch of Newington and Southside had twice put forward a draft resolution calling for the removal of charitable status for private schools but it had not got through the SNP\u2019s standing orders and agenda committee. </p> <p>Sutherland also said the Scottish government has rejected removing charitable status from private schools. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A couple of years ago a young lady through the petitions mechanisms through the Scottish parliament lobbied the Scottish government and the Scottish parliament to have charitable status removed. </p> <p>It was rejected because our Scottish government said there was insufficient evidence for a review of the charitable legislation relating to private schools.

But that is an almighty if. Britain\u2019s leading psephologist, <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/boundary-changes-which-mps-stand-to-lose-their-seats\">John Curtice</a>, kicked off the discussion [at a Prospect fringe at the conference] by summarising the polling on independence since the Brexit vote, which many nationalists had hoped would steel Scots\u2014who voted to stay in Europe, and now face being dragged out by English votes\u2014to make the split with the UK that they had ducked from making two years ago. Curtice, however, had dispiriting news. Few Scots, he said, cared all that much about Europe, and in fact a significant chunk of SNP voters had actually voted \u201cLeave.\u201d Yes, some people\u2014perhaps one in 10 of all \u201cNo\u201d voters in 2014\u2014were now more inclined to vote for independence next time around, but a rather similarly-sized proportion of 2014 \u201cYes\u201d voters had gone the other way. Either they preferred to be part of a Britain that was out of the EU, or they were increasingly nervous about the economics in the uncertain post-Brexit environment. Put it all together, and Scotland has barely swung at all.</p> <p>The SNP MP Kirsty Blackman was frank in admitting that here the party faces phenomenal challenges with the sequencing of the referendum, in particular. If it rushed now\u2014to exploit the full shock of the Brexit vote moment and the cross-border division that it revealed\u2014London would be able to pretend that it would deliver all sorts of things from its negotiations with the EU. It might be impossible to secure both border control and single market access at the same time, but London could\u2014for the moment\u2014continue to bluff its way through and insist that it can have the best of all possible worlds, spinning its way through Indyref2 just as the Leavers did in the Brexit campaign. But if Scotland waits until the UK truly knows where it stands before deciding its future, then the UK will actually be out. The SNP would then have to explain how it would negotiate an independent Scotland\u2019s place back in Europe, and would\u2014without special treatment\u2014have to accept both the euro and membership of the Schengen passport-free zone. All of which would greatly complicate the \u201cYes\u201d side\u2019s pitch.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/border/2016-10-14/nicola-sturgeon-marches-her-snp-troops-towards-the-top-of-the-indyref2-hill/\"><strong>Peter MacMahon, the ITV Border political editor, assesses on his blog the chances of Nicola Sturgeon pushing ahead with her second independence referendum threat.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the UK government makes an offer to the Scottish government, who will judge whether this is enough to protect Scotland\u2019s interest.</p> <p>It looks like the final arbiter of that will be the First Minister.

Here are extracts from her speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My name is Laura and I have been living with multiple sclerosis for nine years. And the fact that I am standing here conference giving a speech means that I am one of the lucky ones. </p> <p>It has become clear to me that many people living with MS have been using cannabis to help with the symptoms of that condition. In fact, it\u2019s one of the worst kept secrets at the hospital. All of these people risk a criminal record, unlike in Australia, Chile, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and some US states.</p> <p>We as a developed Western nation are fast becoming behind the times. </p> <p>In fact, a report publishd on 13 September this year by a cross-party group of MPs and peers has called on the government to introduce a system giving patients access to cannabis for medical reasons and to decriminalise the growing of small amounts at home for the same purposes.</p> <p>However the law as it stands in the UK means that cannabis is a class b drug, and the current penalty for possession is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both, and for supply and production up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p> <p>Now, I don\u2019t think someone in pain should be criminalised for trying to ease that pain. </p> </blockquote> <p>Brennan-Whitefield said that MS sufferers could now get a drug called Sativex which contains cannabinoids (cannabis ingredients). But it was not widely available and a private prescription cost \u00a34,250, she said. \u201cDoes that sound fair to you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>She said she was only proposing to decriminalise cannabis for medical use, and that it was not just MS sufferers who might benefit. Cannabis could help with arthritis, cancer, Chron\u2019s disease, epilepsy, and palliative care, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given that these people who are suffering pain - and I can assure you, those who are willing to use cannabis have in most cases exhausted every other option - is it not unreasonable to criminalise them? I am talking about some of the most vulnerable people in society who may have had the added misfortune of going through the DWP\u2019s inhumane assessment procedure for disability benefits. To be then branded criminals, for trying to have a quality of life?</p> <p>I know what it is to suffer pain. And, be in no doubt, if it came to it, I would not hesitate to ease that pain in any way I could because that is a natural instinct.</p> <p>But if my condition were to deteriorate to that stage I would be reliant on other people to help me: my friends, my family, and most of all my partner Stephen who I really don\u2019t thank enough for the care that he gives me.</p> <p>A drug conviction has very real consequences, serious consequences for your future prospects and your employment prospects. I think that now is the time to show that we are the party of compassion and common sense and it is now that we should be sending out a message to those people that we hear you and we are not shying away from this issue as Westminster is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is Brennan-Whitefield making her speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BRILLIANT work by Laura Brennan-Whitefield <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurapoppet\">@laurapoppet</a> at SNP Conference <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNP16?src=hash\">#SNP16</a> on medicinal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cannabis?src=hash\">#cannabis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndOurPain?src=hash\">#EndOurPain</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rNHKSBTqZw\">pic.twitter.com/rNHKSBTqZw</a></p>&mdash; Cannabis Law Reform (@CLEARUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CLEARUK/status/787250463355863040\">October 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58020854e4b0160123896045\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-15T10:43:48.850Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP delegates call for cannabis to be decriminalised for medical use</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Delegates have overwhelmingly backed the resolution saying cannabis should be decriminalised for medical use.</p> <p>This does not mean this will happen in Scotland because this is a matter for the UK government.

And he said Nicola Sturgeon had identified education as her number one priority.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He dismissed claims that Scotland\u2019s policy of proving students with free university tuition disproportionately advantaged the middle classes. </strong>When this was put to him, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe that free education is part of the social contract in Scotland and that has encouraged students who would not otherwise have gone to university, who might have been frightened by debt to go. I was from a poorer background. I went to university. And if there were tuition fees in place it would have been very difficult for me to go. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He dismissed claims that the SNP was not using the new tax powers it has been given.</strong> Scottish tax policy was different from the UK\u2019s, he said. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be divergence.

It will ask prominent and successful Scots to help us, boost our national export effort.</p> <p>Third, we will create permanent trade representation for Scotland with a Scottish Innovation and Investment Hub in Berlin.</p> <p>Fourth, we will double the number of Scottish Development International staff working across Europe.</p> <p>And let me be crystal clear about this \u2013 Scotland cannot trust the likes of Boris Johnson and Liam Fox to represent us.</p> <p>They are retreating to the fringes of Europe, we intend to stay at its very heart where Scotland belongs .</p> <p>To our European friends, we say: Scotland is open for business.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Debates on the Child Poverty Act, charitable status for Scotland\u2019s state schools and decriminalising cannabis for medical use.</p> <p><em>12.15pm: </em>Fraternal address from Bethan Jenkins, a Plaid Cyrmu member of the Welsh assembly.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Debates on fishing, blood transfusion and gay men and the devolution of driving tests.</p> <p><em>3.15pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon delivers her speech.</p> <p>And here is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/14/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-says-tory-conference-rhetoric-was-xenophobic-politics-live\"> my blog covering yesterday\u2019s events at the SNP conference.</a></p> <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <p>I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

  "<p>One of the most notorious Ku Klux Klan groups is stepping up attempts to ignite race war across the US with a call to arms against black people and violent support of the White Lives Matter campaign.</p> <p>An inside account from within the Loyal White Knights of the KKK also reveals that the group is linked to stabbings of anti-fascists, Holocaust denial, threats to attack gay men and extreme anti-Black Lives Matter propaganda.</p> <p>During a 15-month online infiltration of the Klan, British anti-racist group <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk\" title=\"\">Hope Not Hate</a> obtained the membership list of what is described as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/kkk-clashes-south-carolina-racism\" title=\"\">largest KKK faction</a>, a list of 270 individuals including police officers. (The group claims it has 3,000 members.) Most hailed from southern states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, although there was a considerable cohort from the Midwest, the east coast and California.</p> <p>Among them is a 28-year-old British man from Suffolk who claims to be a member of the Knights Templar, an \u201cinterdenominational association of active Christians\u201d. Another is a 44-year-old Frenchman based in Marseille who recently uploaded a series of anti-Muslim pictures to a secret Klan chatroom.</p> <p>Investigators also obtained a list of members expelled from the Loyal White Knights for so-called violations, ranging from drug use to sleeping with \u201ca Jew whore\u201d or a Mexican, watching Asian porn or having a \u201cmixed child\u201d, which made them a \u201crace traitor\u201d.</p> <p>Based in North Carolina, the Loyal White Knights was founded in 2012 by Chris Barker, a far-right supporter who last year was linked to a plot by a New York white supremacist convicted of conspiring to use a remote-controlled radiation device he called \u201cHiroshima <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/21/white-supremacist-convicted-plot-to-kill-obama-death-ray-device\" title=\"\">on a light switch</a>\u201d to harm Muslims.</p> <p>Barker is a contentious figure among Klansmen, partly because of his connections to neo-Nazis. He recently became part of the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/21/meet-aryan-nationalist-alliance-%E2%80%93%E2%80%93-racist-hodgepodge-doomed-fail\" title=\"\">Aryan Nationalist Alliance</a>, an extreme coalition of white nationalist groups, including notorious US organisations such as Matthew Heimbach\u2019s Traditionalist Worker Party.</p> <p>Heimbach , who is dubbed the \u201cface of a new generation of white nationalists\u201d by critics, and has advocated racial segregation \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/theresa-may-bans-us-segregationist-from-uk-for-neo-nazi-remarks\" title=\"\">banned from entering the UK</a> last year by Theresa May, who was then home secretary.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate\u2019s investigation found considerable evidence that Loyal White Knights retains its desire for extreme racist violence, seeking to exploit the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant climate fostered by Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cOnce inside, we came across some of the worst racism we have ever encountered and learned about their dangerous racist ideology, witnessing a culture which encouraged extreme violence,\u201d said one of the infiltrators.</p> <p>It also found that the Klan is actively involved in \u201cKnight Rides\u201d, where members drive around communities at night and throw white supremacist leaflets on to the lawns of black people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>\u201cThey organise White Lives Matter demonstrations where they get \u2018tooled up\u2019 and also Knight Rides that hark back to when members rode horses through towns at night, to terrify communities,\u201d said an investigator.</p> <p>In February this year, members of Barker\u2019s group held an anti-immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/kkk-rally-california-turns-violent-counter-protesters\" title=\"\">demonstration in Anaheim</a>, California, during which they held White Lives Matter signs. The protest erupted into violence, with three people stabbed and 13 others arrested.</p> <p>Barker then emailed the infiltrator and wrote: \u201cWe just had a fight between our members and communist [sic] our members stabbed 3 in California.\u201d Five KKK members were arrested following the brawl but later released as police said they had evidence the KKK members acted in self-defence. Barker, who calls himself the imperial wizard of the Loyal White Knights, claimed his members were holding a peaceful anti-immigration demonstration. \u201cIf we\u2019re attacked, we will attack back,\u201d said Barker, who did not attend the rally.</p> <p>Eventually, Hope Not Hate investigators were invited into the closed sections of the group\u2019s website, where they found members circulating images of themselves posing with firearms or holding a hangman\u2019s noose \u2013 a symbol linked to the lynching of black people \u2013 with one mocked-up picture showing President Obama apparently being hanged. Jokes and memes about hanging and running over black people were also posted.</p> <p>Investigators were sent magazines and leaflets, some of them deeply antisemitic. One image depicted a hooded figure in front of the confederate flag with the words: \u201cHelp save our race; everything we cherish is under assault by ZOG\u201d \u2013 an acronym for zionist occupation government, which is an antisemitic conspiracy theory that claims Jews secretly control world power.</p> <p>During the undercover operation Barker, a Holocaust denier, wrote: \u201cThey said there [sic] goal was to destroy the white race. Here they are doing just that \u2013 by brainwashing our people through the media.\u2019</p> <p>The most extreme leaflet encouraged violence against gay men, with one stating: \u201cStop Aids: support gay bashing,\u201d and \u201cHomosexual men and their sexual acts are disgusting and inhuman.\u201d The same leaflet also espouses racism, adding: \u201cBan non-white immigration. Outlaw Haitians \u2013 deport mud people.\u201d</p> <p>The extremism of the modern Klan movement may appear to be undimmed, but its membership has rapidly declined over recent decades. During the 1920s, the organisation\u2019s four million members were able to stage huge demonstrations in Washington. The <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do\" title=\"\">Southern Poverty law Centre </a> estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 Klan members active at the moment, split across dozens of groups.</p> <p>In their responses to questioning about the findings of the investigation, Barker and his wife Amanda referred to the Holocaust as a \u201cmoney-making scam\u201d. They added: \u201cOur group does not call for the killing of black people, but we do tell our members to arm and protect themselves.\u201d Barker\u2019s statement also defended the group\u2019s homophobic stance.</p>",

While the competitors in this year\u2019s women\u2019s road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/14/lizzie-deignan-urges-cycling-world-governing-body-to-clarify-rules-on-theraputic-use-exemptions\">\u201cthe last weekend of a tough year\u201d</a> defined by her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/01/rio-2016-lizzie-armitstead-court-appeal-olympics\">successful appeal</a> against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises emanating from her camp \u2013 not to mention the rider herself \u2013 suggest the combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to handle.</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s not all about Deignan.</strong> A flat course with no climbs will inevitably favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to beat. Australia\u2019s Chloe Hosking, who in July sped to a brilliant La Course victory on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, has been preparing for the sweltering conditions in the Qatar capital by <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cycling/uci-road-race-world-championships-20161009-grycps.html\">transforming her bathroom into a temporary sauna</a>; she\u2019s no slouch either. Ditto Marianne Vos, another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/27/lizzie-armitstead-marianne-vos-la-course\">former La Course winner</a>, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let\u2019s not forget her Dutch compatriot, Annemiek van Vleuten, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\">crashed out of the Olympic road race</a> in such horrific fashion but \u2013 having recovered from a cracked spine \u2013 is fit and raring to go again. What a story it would be if she could win today.</p> <p><strong>All that, and we haven\u2019t even mentioned Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen</strong>, or the Belgian speedster Jolien D\u2019Hoore.

  "<p>Theresa May has rightly read the Brexit vote as a popular revolt against metropolitan trendies like David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn and every other variant of the species. Given the chance to poke the whole pack of us in the eye, what with our \u201cprogressive\u201d values and smug, big city ways, Leavers seized it with Faragist glee. The prime minister has taken their cue. Disastrous, disordered and unlovely it may be, but her Brexit stance has, at least for now, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/09/new-times-john-gray-moving-right-new-times\">caught the mood</a> and achieved the substantial feat of making the Labour leader and his coterie look even more clueless than they did already.</p> <p>But May presumably also knows that the path she\u2019s set could lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/great-marmite-war-reality-brexit-bite\">economic calamity</a>. For now, she can afford a bit of that: prosperous Outers may be ready to be a little worse off for a while in return for their hoped-for reassertion of their idea of their country\u2019s true identity; the less prosperous who voted Leave, many of whom don\u2019t normally vote at all, have low expectations about everything anyway. Even so, May won\u2019t want to preside over too steep or too ugly a decline. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2016/oct/12/keir-starmer-on-brexit-on-what-terms-should-we-leave-the-eu-video\">Keir Starmer on the case</a>, even Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition might help make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/nicola-sturgeon-brexit-theresa-may-snp-scotland\">something useful</a> out of it. That is why May badly needs the very things the Brexit vibe she\u2019s milking most reviles.</p> <p>London, like it or not - and this is hardly ideal - is the key to UK financial health. Globalised, multicultured and full of immigrants, it powered through the last recession as the rest of proud Britannia flailed. At <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05795\">the last count</a>, London was generating \u00a3364bn of the UK\u2019s \u00a31,590bn annual economic output \u2013 a massive 23% of it, with the surrounding south east of England contributing a further 15%.</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2014, London\u2019s economy grew by 6.8% compared with 4.4% for the UK as a whole. London\u2019s workers\u2019 output is 73% above the average. When Brexit darling Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10052775/We-must-be-ready-to-leave-the-EU-if-we-dont-get-what-we-want.html\">wrote three years ago</a> that \u201cwe can no longer blame Brussels\u201d for our problems and should look instead at our own \u201csloth\u201d \u2013 especially when compared with \u201cthe Germans\u201d \u2013 he might have named the labour force of the city he (loosely-speaking) led as mayor at the time as an exception. </p> <p>Britons who fear and loathe London and all it symbolises in their eyes might note that taxes raised in the capital help fund their public transport, their affordable housing, their health services, their schools, their police officers and the upkeep of their public footpaths and parks. Almost one third of UK taxes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report\">raised in London</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/give-london-back-its-tax-boris-johnson-demands-return-on-cash-that-capital-makes-for-britain-7618555.html\">report</a> compiled for Johnson found that the equivalent of \u00a32,500 per Londoner subsides the rest of the UK every year.</p> <p>So here\u2019s an irony: even as the PM endorses the disruption of all that is integral to the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 its international business links, its receptiveness to foreign incomers, its resulting cultural variety - she is to draw more deeply from its well of wealth. A <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/business-rates-for-thousands-of-london-firms-to-rocket-next-year-in-government-raid-on-cash-cow-a3365091.html\">revaluation of business rates</a> looks set to increase London\u2019s tax bill by an average of 11% - amounting to more than \u00a3700m - while in most of the rest of England rates will go down.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s successor at City Hall, Sadiq Khan, has called this a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d for the capital. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned of the dangers of London business being <a href=\"http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?id=0&amp;did=47&amp;aid=8025&amp;st=&amp;oaid=-1\">seen as a cash cow</a>. The Institute for Fiscal Studies comments from a <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8689\">wider angle</a>: \u201cIt will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole\u201d. </p> <p>Here is the intensifying context for the continuing debates about giving London government and those of other big city regions greater autonomy. No one is demanding a bigger piece of the pie, just more control over the piece they have. Regional, rather than Whitehall, decisions about transport infrastructure, housing, schools and skills training should mean better results, with social and economic gains to follow.</p> <p>Progress in that direction had already been made in the form of new, executive \u201cmetro\u201d mayoralties for Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region and the West Midlands. Inaugural elections will take place next year. The victors will be looking for more powers to be sent their way. In London, Khan is pressing for post-Brexit arrangements that will help the capital, which voted 60-40 to Remain, to maintain its status as a city that is \u201copen for business\u201d, including the creation of a <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/248272/we-should-regionalise-immigration-decisions-starting-london\">London-only work visa</a>.</p> <p>Some of his critics, still truffling for imagined un-Britishness in the born-and-bred Tooting boy, imply that in so doing he seeks to <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/715172/Sadiq-Khan-defy-Brexit-London-open-visas-migrants-mayor-theresa-may-boris-johnson-trade\">subvert the national will</a>. Well London, didn\u2019t want what \u201cGood old Boris\u201d helped them get, and other big cities felt much the same way. They are the very parts of Britain the prime minister must help to better help themselves if Britain is to survive her Brexit strategy. She needs London. She\u2019d be wise to give the capital what it needs too.</p> <p><em>Dave Hill is the author of Zac versus Sadiq: the Fight to Become London Mayor, available from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Guardian Bookshop</a>. </em></p>",

Reuters has reported Isis executed dozens of men, including a senior commander, after discovering they <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-exclusive-idUSKBN12E0Z0\">planned to switch sides</a> and help deliver the city to Iraqi forces.</p> <p>Below are some stories of people trapped in Mosul and others who recently fled.

But in the end we reckoned it was better to stay home than risk getting caught by Isis trying to flee. My son has already had 20 lashes just for using a mobile in the street.</p> <p>I prepared a room in the house as a shelter with just some wheat to make bread and a few kilos of rice.</p> <p>Most locals don\u2019t have any cash because the government stopped paying its employees two years ago, and all our savings are wiped out. Pensioners are the lucky ones, they still get their pension via credit card, so our money comes from my cousin who is a retired teacher.</p> <p>People are worried about what comes after liberation. It is true we want to get rid of Isis but can you trust who will take power after?</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Abdul Salam, 25, university student from Mosul, now a refugee in Erbil</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a way war has become part of our life, but Mosul\u2019s locals are quite terrified about this particular battle, because the whole world is coming to fight Isis in our city.</p> <p>People are digging shelters under their homes to try and hide in during bombing, but if the war lasts a long time there will be looting, because no one has many supplies.</p> <p>My father decided to leave a month ago, to Turkey via Syria. I followed him with 10 other members of the family two weeks ago. We are all in Erbil now waiting for the liberation to go home, although our house was blown up by Isis after someone tipped them off that we had fled the city.</p> <p>My sister and many relatives are still in Mosul, they only call us after midnight for fear of being spotted using the phone by Isis militants. They are using loudspeakers in mosques and markets to urge people to join the jihad and defend their city.</p> <p>I won\u2019t go back to Mosul if Shia militias take the city, we saw what they did in other liberated cities, filling them with rancour and sectarianism.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Abu Ammar, 47, from Mosul, now a refugee</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We had run through all our savings and sold lots of our belongings for very little just to cover the daily basics for my six children. Thank God, I owned my house: it would have been a real disaster if I was renting.</p> <p>My kids hadn\u2019t left the house for weeks, because they were afraid of the US airstrikes, they were bombing residential areas, close to our home. The noise is horrible, windows get broken, the whole house shakes, and people get hysterical.</p> <p>I only went out if I needed to do some shopping, and tried my best to avoid Isis militants. Mostly we borrowed wheat from a neighbour, because we couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. I\u2019m a government employee and haven\u2019t been paid for two years. The only places that are open in Mosul are petrol stations, and shops with goods from Syria.</p> <p>I was trying to find a way out for months, a job somewhere to feed the kids, but I was scared to take the route to Erbil because it is planted with mines. I finally agreed to leave with four other families one night, but at the last minute the others dropped out.</p> <p>They said they had been tipped off that Isis had set up many checkpoints along the way and might capture us. I insisted on going anyway. We walked through the night for more than six hours, with my kids frightened and begging to go back.</p> <p>We hope the army would put an end to Isis reign of terror. People are mostly hiding at home, afraid of Isis because they don\u2019t have weapons to fight them. </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Um Ibrahim, 50, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation is catastrophic, our life is miserable. If you have money, you can live in Mosul, otherwise, you will die of hunger and worry.</p> <p>I have six kids but only one is with me, and I have not seen my sons and grandsons for a long time. They left because of Isis\u2019s strict rules about what to wear and how to shave and lack of jobs in Mosul. I can hardly even speak to them, because Isis threaten locals for using mobile phones.</p> <p>We are terrified but can\u2019t think of fleeing, because I\u2019m here with my husband who is sick and can hardly walk.</p> <p>My daughter and her five kids are also still here; she could not leave because her husband has been detained by Isis. We thought a lot about fleeing but if we do Isis will take the house.</p> <p>Its built on rocky ground, and its hard to dig a shelter, so we are going to stay in a room near the stairs. I have bought some wheat, rice, sugar, oil, tea, beans, chickpeas and tomato paste to get through the battle.</p> <p>I\u2019m scared because Isis bases are close to us, warplanes come to bomb our area from time to time. I have seen more than three wars in Iraq but this one is going to be the worst, with other wars the fighting was not near our house and the security was good.</p> <p>We are worried that the warplanes would hit the houses round here where Isis militants are hiding now. Isis dug trenches around our district and took some of the houses as bases, and fighters are gathering on a hill behind us. In a way its like an island [of Isis militants].</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Abu Bashar, farmer, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Life in Mosul is a true hell, the city is full of beggars and widows, people are fed up of the poverty and injustice and you can\u2019t say a word about the situation. Life under Isis is terribly hard.</p> <p>There was an Isis video of captives who were gathered in an iron cage and then electrocuted. Those men were my cousins, they were killed because they are related to the commander of Mosul military operations.</p> <p>We are desperately waiting for the army to liberate the city. After Fallujah and Tikrit, people in Mosul were optimistic that they will be liberated soon as well, but nothing happened and people\u2019s savings are dwindling and they have nothing to feed their kids.</p> <p>I planted vegetables in my farm but could hardly sell anything. I left a month ago because I ran out of money.</p> <p>Isis are forcing people to vow to fight with them inside the city. Still, a tribal militia of Mosul locals has formed to fight Isis, a few of my relatives have joined to liberate their areas, take revenge for their sons who were killed by Isis and to stand in face of Shia militias if they come into the city with the army.</p> <p>People are worried about Shia militias, they have already accused Mosul locals of handing the city to Isis. I would prefer the US army to Shia militia because Americans are not sectarian.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Muhammed Fawaz, 36, former security guard, from Mosul</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These wars have stolen our lives. Locals do not want Isis after the nasty experience they have with them, they are waiting for the army to come to save them.</p> <p>I was a security policeman in a Mosul oil company and declared my repentance when Isis took over the city, but after watching my colleagues taken one after the other, I left Mosul in fear of my life and went to Turkey.</p> <p>I did not have enough money to take my family, and I used to speak to my wife regularly on the mobile but I can\u2019t reach her any more. I\u2019m very worried about my family as it has become very expensive now to get out of Mosul.</p> <p>People are so scared but they can\u2019t leave, Isis don\u2019t allow them, they have set up countless checkpoints.</p> <p>A few armed groups are formed by the families whose sons were slaughtered by Isis and they are launching daily attacks against Isis from liberated villages in Mosul. There will be no escape for Isis, they have lots of people who want revenge on them.</p> </blockquote>",

There are also fears those children who are not eligible to seek asylum in Britain will be particularly vulnerable once the authorities move in and raze the camp.</p> <p>With local councils set to absorb the pressures of the influx of unaccompanied children, the chairman of the Local Government Association\u2019s asylum, refugee and migration task group, David Simmonds, said councils will \u201crequire long-term funding arrangements from government so that the commitment to support those children starting a new life in the UK is properly funded\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7e923cd57d3b7aa76a0cb4ccd4b3d45041578ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e923cd57d3b7aa76a0cb4ccd4b3d45041578ab/0_97_2899_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather inside the camp in Calais\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather inside the camp in Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Charlet/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simmonds said taking on children who had been living in the squalor of the camp could put increased pressure on stretched local authority resources. \u201cThose arriving from the Calais camp will require care and support packages directly from councils and their partners,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cFor those children relocated with existing family living in the UK, councils will still want to be assured that arrangements put in place can meet the child\u2019s needs and that they are safe and well. Many will have also experienced horrendous conditions within and since fleeing their country of origin, so councils will want to ensure they are able to settle into communities as quickly and easily as possible with ongoing support made available when they need it.\u201d</p> <p>The news of the arrival of child refugees comes as reports emerged of French police stripping people of their shoes and phones in an apparent move to keep them in the camp before their official eviction. According to a recording secured by the Independent, refugees who had ventured just outside the confines of camp, which has become known as \u201cthe Jungle\u201d, were stopped by police. The French officers demanded their shoes and forced them to walk back into the camp.</p> <p>A report published in the summer by the Bar Human Rights Committee revealed French authorities regularly took personal items, including phones, from the refugees in the camp. </p> <p>Gr\u00e1inne Mellon, co-author of the BHRC report, told the Independent: \u201cWe found evidence of what appeared to be fairly routine acts of violence in the camp, including shoes being removed and phones being confiscated, corroborated by a number of different sources. The confiscation of these items is a breach of criminal law and against all policing codes and ethics, but in addition to that and more worryingly it feeds into this sense in the camps that the residents don\u2019t have any rights.\u201d</p>",

Referring to the second presidential debate in St Louis, he said: \u201cI\u2019m standing at my podium and she walks in front of me, she walks in front of me and when she walks in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d Later, in Charlotte, he added of his opponent that \u201cshe was the most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency of the United States and her specialty has been, as you see over the years, it\u2019s character assassination\u201d.</p> <p>The Republican nominee eventually reverted to standard lines from his primary campaign after his teleprompter broke down on Friday night at a rally in Charlotte. Trump laid the devices on the stage before returning to old chestnuts, including his attack on the Obama administration\u2019s concern over climate change. \u201cObama thinks global warming is our biggest threat. I happen to think it\u2019s nuclear warming,\u201d Trump said.

  "<p>The death of Raheemullah Oryakhel, a 14-year-boy from Afghanistan, was marked last month with just a couple of paragraphs in the French press, under the headline \u201cOne migrant dead on the port ring road\u201d. There was nothing much to excite further interest; the boy was the 12th refugee to die in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\">Calais</a> this year. The news item added that Raheemullah\u2019s body had been found on the N216, on a stretch of motorway where a number of migrants had previously been run over. Police said he had probably been hit by a car. Whoever was behind the wheel had not bothered to stop.</p> <p>Nor are the details of Raheemullah\u2019s death particularly shocking to the handful of relatives and acquaintances he left behind in the Calais camp, a fetid, cramped cluster of sagging donated tents and roughly built wooden shacks, now home to an estimated 9,000 asylum seekers. The idea that vulnerable children, some as young as eight, who have mostly fled conflict zones, should spend night after night trying to leap on to moving vehicles, in a desperate (and mostly futile) attempt to reach the UK, surprises no one. It\u2019s a risky business. Sometimes people get suffocated in the trucks, or frozen in refrigerated containers; sometimes they choose a different route and drown trying to swim to England or get electrocuted on the railway. And sometimes they just get run over.</p> <p>But there is sadness and some bitterness at the driver\u2019s failure to stop, and at the apparently cursory nature of the police investigation. Abdul Wali, an older camp resident who helped raise more than \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,516) to send Raheemullah\u2019s body back to his parents, says, \u201cEven in Afghanistan, if someone is hit by a car, at least the driver will take him to a police station or hospital and say sorry. Here, people are dying and no one cares.\u201d</p> <p>Raheemullah is probably the youngest asylum seeker to die yet, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/afghan-boy-killed-in-calais-in-attempt-to-climb-on-to-lorry-to-uk\">his death</a> epitomises the risks that hundreds are taking every night on the roads outside Calais. As the French government prepares to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/france-vows-to-dismantle-jungle-refugee-camp-calais\">dismantle the camp</a> next week, aiming to disperse its residents around the country instead, the sense of urgency surrounding the mission to get to the UK has intensified. It is an intolerable situation for everyone involved: the lorry drivers, Calais residents, local police (who are exhausted by nightly patrols) and, most of all, for the camp\u2019s population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94a6656e8af9861853476b2fcccd2c2c681da04e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94a6656e8af9861853476b2fcccd2c2c681da04e/23_126_5547_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boys and young men play cricket by the fence that surrounds the Calais camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boys and young men play cricket by the fence that surrounds the Calais camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last person to see Raheemullah alive was almost certainly his friend Karim, also 14, who was trying to pull him on to the top of a moving lorry shortly before dawn on Friday 16 September. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Give me your hand\u2019 but he didn\u2019t,\u201d Karim says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t listen.\u201d It was a terrifying few minutes, in total darkness. One second his friend was there, the next he was gone.</p> <p>Until recently, Karim (an assumed name to avoid anything that might complicate his asylum claim, should he ever be in a position to make one) was showing anyone he met a photograph of his dead friend, taken in the Lille morgue, looking as bad as you might expect after a fatal road accident. Volunteers who have stepped in to help with the hundreds of children at the camp have since persuaded him to delete the image from his phone. They know Karim is devastated, but have little at their disposal to cheer him up. One volunteer took him out of the camp for an ice-cream; another took him to the donations warehouse and got him a new pair of socks.</p> <p>Because the French authorities are unwilling to recognise the camp, there is no UN presence here, and no mainstream children\u2019s charity on site; the 800 or so parentless children (a third of them from Afghanistan) are left largely to look after themselves. Volunteers with groups such as <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk\">Help Refugees</a> do their best, but are dismayed at the hopeless inadequacy of what they can offer. \u201cWe have a severely traumatised child,\u201d one says, \u201cand what can we do? We say: \u2018Your friend\u2019s dead, he\u2019s been squashed, have an ice-cream.\u2019 It\u2019s awful.\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks after the accident, Karim sits on a wooden pallet at the edge of the camp and explains how he and Raheemullah came to be on the motorway before dawn that night. The two boys had walked for an hour along the high barbed-wire fencing that separates the camp from the road, to a spot where other asylum seekers had dragged some wooden logs into the centre of the road, forcing lorries to slow down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes there are 100 people by the road, trying to get into the lorries. Someone is going to fall over and get hit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both had made frequent night-time attempts to get to England together. Karim has been in the camp since January, trying most nights to make his way across the Channel. Raheemullah, who came from the same part of Afghanistan, arrived in July, and the two became friends. Most evenings they played cricket and volleyball on the wasteland beside the motorway. \u201cHe was a good friend,\u201d Karim says. \u201cI liked him very much.\u201d</p> <p>They found a crowd of people hoping to push their way on to the stream of heavy goods vehicles as they slowed to navigate the obstacles. Karim and Raheemullah followed two older men, climbing on to the axle between the driver\u2019s cab and the container section of the lorry. Karim managed to get on to the top of the container, but Raheemullah was still on the ledge between the cab and the rest of the truck when it began to gather speed. Karim says the lorry started swerving abruptly, as if trying to shake off the uninvited passengers. He leaned over the edge, offering his friend his hand. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he take it?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>No one knows quite what happened next. One of the older men cut a small hole in the roof of the truck (a black vehicle with an enormous red logo on the side, Karim says). Karim lowered himself through it into the container, which held a consignment of swivelling office chairs, and hid there as the truck continued to the port. Some time later, he was discovered by port officials before the truck drove on to the ferry. When he returned to the camp, he discovered his friend was missing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Raheemullah lived in the camp in a windowless chipboard hut with his first cousin, Wahid, 23, and two other men. No one has moved his belongings, a few clothes stored in plastic bags. The grubby brown blanket and mattress where he slept for the last two and a half months of his life are still there.</p> <p>Wahid is better able to articulate the loss and anger he feels about his cousin\u2019s death. He speaks good English, having spent three years at secondary school in Norwich, after fleeing the Taliban when he was 14. He was taken in by a foster family, made friends, studied hard, took a part-time job in a Chinese takeaway \u2013 and then, at 17 and a half, his case was reconsidered and he was told he would be deported back to Afghanistan, which the Home Office categorises as a safe destination. He spent some time trying to appeal, but left for Europe rather than be sent back. There are many young Afghan men, with fluent English, in a similar situation in Calais.</p> <p>Wahid\u2019s friend Abdul went to school in Birmingham (also after being threatened by the Taliban), before being told at 17 that he was no longer eligible to remain in England. Both hope to return to the UK, which is the place they consider home, to appeal for leave to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bbbcb129d21cdba8feb6af431e1b1ea5548a83a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bbbcb129d21cdba8feb6af431e1b1ea5548a83a/0_123_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wahid in the hut he shared with Raheemullah; his cousin\u2019s bed and clothes have been untouched.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wahid in the hut he shared with Raheemullah; his cousin\u2019s bed and clothes have been untouched.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wahid was shocked to see his cousin, whom he had not seen since he was a child, arrive in the camp. While ambivalent about Raheemullah\u2019s determination to get to England, given his own mixed experiences, Wahid didn\u2019t try to dissuade him. \u201cIt was not my job to tell him how to decide his life.\u201d Instead, he invited him to come and share his hut. Raheemullah had travelled alone from Afghanistan, and been badly beaten by Bulgarian police; he was relieved to find someone to protect him. For a month, they went out together five nights a week, to try to jump on a lorry.</p> <p>\u201cIn the beginning he was happy,\u201d Wahid says. \u201cHe said it was good fun. Slowly he realised it was not easy, that it was risky. Sometimes I\u2019d say, let\u2019s go tonight, and he\u2019d say, \u2018No, tomorrow.\u2019 I knew he didn\u2019t want to go. He was very scared. It\u2019s a one-hour walk in the dark. You feel scared of the French people. You worry that if they see you alone, maybe they will beat you. Sometimes there are 100 people by the road, trying to get into the lorries. People are pushing. Of course someone is going to fall over and get hit.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I said, \u2018The sooner you can go from here, the better.\u2019 There is fighting. It is not a good place for a child</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wahid was also aware the camp wasn\u2019t a safe place for Raheemullah. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said, \u2018The sooner you can go from here, the better.\u2019 There is fighting between the Sudanese and the Afghans, between the Afghans and the Afghans \u2013 for no reason, just because of the tension here. It gets boring. You sleep, wake up, sleep, wake up. You can\u2019t shower for a week. People are desperate. It is not a good place for anyone, especially not a child.\u201d</p> <p>He feels anger at how slow the British response has been. Raheemullah had an older brother in Manchester, and was in theory eligible to join him in the UK; but the process for organising reunification is very slow, bureaucratic and hard to understand. It is not clear how much his brother was able to help with the application, or if the papers had even been lodged. Charities estimate there are 300 to 400 unaccompanied children in Calais with relatives in the UK; but even in straightforward cases, the legal process takes between five and 10 months, during which time the children often give up waiting and start making the nightly journey to the motorway instead.</p> <p>Security has been increased around the port, so that finding a way in has become harder and much more dangerous. Work has recently begun on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/20/work-calais-wall-refugees-lorries-uk\">a \u00a31.9m, 1km-long wall to block off the dual carriageway</a>, half-funded by the UK. Although French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/02/france-vows-to-dismantle-jungle-refugee-camp-calais\">committed to clearing the camp by the end of the year</a>, there is scepticism about how easy it will be to find homes for everyone. Officials believe that people will stay on, and the barriers will still be needed. \u201cWhy are you spending the money on building a wall?\u201d Abdul wonders, sitting with Wahid in a caravan that serves as a clothes distribution point, donated tracksuits piled up on the surfaces. \u201cYou are wasting money. If they hadn\u2019t built these fences, people wouldn\u2019t risk their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Wahid and Raheemullah managed to get on lorries together three times, but each time were pulled off at the border by officials with sniffer dogs. \u201cThe police were nice with him. And, because of him, they were nice with me as well. They take you to the front of the port and say, \u2018Go back to the jungle.\u2019\u201d Early last month, Wahid hurt his back badly after his friends put a heavy box over him to hide him inside a lorry. \u201cI was under it for eight hours. I couldn\u2019t stand [it] any more, so I left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1507b56f759b027e7d52332dd9392d05ac6720a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1507b56f759b027e7d52332dd9392d05ac6720a/31_103_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Calais camp, home to an estimated 9,000 asylum seekers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Calais camp, home to an estimated 9,000 asylum seekers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Raheemullah suggested he come with him early on the morning of 16 September, Wahid said no: his back was too painful. \u201cI told him to be careful. He knew it was very dangerous.\u201d The next morning, when it became obvious Raheemullah was missing, a youth worker from the camp visited local hospitals and police stations to look for him. Later, Wahid went to the morgue to identify the body. Raheemullah\u2019s face was so badly damaged, he was unrecognisable, except for his clothes and a distinctive mark on his arm. Wahid thinks his cousin wasn\u2019t strong enough to pull himself up on to the roof. \u201cHe was young, he had no muscles.\u201d</p> <p>Wahid spoke to his uncle, Raheemullah\u2019s father, in Afghanistan, but found himself unable to break the news. \u201cThey asked what happened, and I said, \u2018He is injured.\u2019 I told them a lie. His parents are quite old. I didn\u2019t want to hurt them.\u201d He assumes their older son called later, from Manchester, to tell them. Since the body arrived back in Afghanistan, accompanied by another relative who came from Norway to travel with the coffin, Raheemullah\u2019s parents have called again to ask how their son died. The calls are distressing: \u201cThey keep ringing me. I say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to know. He is dead.\u2019 Why make them more upset?\u201d</p> <p>It is still unclear why Raheemullah\u2019s parents sent their son 4,000 miles across Europe to try to start a new life in England. Wahid isn\u2019t forthcoming; his own experiences of hostile questioning by the Home Office have made him wary of the question and he will say only that \u201cit wasn\u2019t an economic problem. There was a danger for him.\u201d But Karim thinks the absence of work in postwar Afghanistan was a factor. \u201cHe was going to send money to his family. His father was an old man \u2013 he couldn\u2019t work. No one wants to go to England, but if they have problems at home, that\u2019s why they go.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the decision to send a child away is never taken lightly, Wahid says. \u201cOf course they will be wishing with their hearts now that they hadn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t know he was going to die.\u201d His own advice to other parents now is not to send their children to Europe, but there is often a reluctance to listen. On the whole, children do not tell their parents about the difficulties they have encountered, so an unrealistic perception prevails. \u201cLife [in Afghanistan] is very hard. There\u2019s Isis and the Taliban, and no security. They don\u2019t know anything about the situation in Calais. The parents don\u2019t know about the risks.\u201d Abdul has become equally firm. \u201cI have five brothers. They call me and ask, shall we come? I say, if you come, you will sleep in the street. Please don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteers attempt to persuade refugees to claim asylum in France, rather than wasting months and risking their lives trying to get to the UK. They point out that \u2013 particularly for young people from Afghanistan \u2013 it makes more sense to remain in France, because there is less risk of being deported when they approach 18. But it is hard to persuade children whose parents have paid large sums of money to dispatch them across Europe. People smugglers operating in the camp also have a vested interest in encouraging others to get to the UK, otherwise their business model disappears.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of camp residents <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/2016/09/07/more-calais-migrants-give-up-british-dream-seek-asylum-in-france/\">have applied for asylum in France</a>; it is now largely those with relatives in the UK who persist in their attempts to join them. But many of those children who decide to stay in France are told there is no room for them in the nearby emergency shelter, which is turning away between 15 and 35 children a day, so they remain in a dangerous limbo. No one knows where the children will be sent once the camp is shut down.</p> <p>Wahid believes any investigation into his cousin\u2019s death has already been closed. No one has come to look for witnesses in the camp. He made one visit to the police station when he was searching for Raheemullah, where he says the police officer was rude; he is reluctant to go again because of his illegal status in France. \u201cThey don\u2019t care who has died. To them, we\u2019re just illegal migrants, \u2018jungly people\u2019.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s office of Boulogne-sur-Mer did not respond to emailed requests for details of the police investigation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a minute\u2019s silence was held for Raheemullah in the camp at the end of September.

  "<p>First a thought. Now that Landon Donovan has shaken off the proverbial dust from his Galaxy uniform and returned to action, the league should probably consider removing his name from the MVP award. After saying goodbye to the game in 2014, MLS respectfully renamed it in his honor, but now after his return it seems slightly odd for a trophy to be named after a player who, despite his great success in the past, is probably not better than the candidates who might receive it.</p> <p>Namesake notwithstanding, Major League Soccer\u2019s MVP award is one of my favorite prizes in the world of soccer just because the nominees and winners continue to be so wonderfully diverse. Since the league\u2019s first ever season in 1996 when Carlos Valderrama won it with Tampa Bay Mutiny, we have had 10 different nationalities win the award. From Bolivia\u2019s Marco Etcheverry (DC United) to last year\u2019s first ever Italian winner in Sebastian Giovinco, it\u2019s refreshing to see just how many different nationalities represent the most sought after individual award in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/15/mls-latinos-hispanic-community-dna\">most diverse professional sports league in North America</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/new-york-city-fc-mls-necaxa-mexico\">New York City FC head to Mexico for 'really special' date with Necaxa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we discuss this year\u2019s finalists most likely to appear on the three-man ballot at the beginning of November, one thing is abundantly clear: this is a two-horse race. The incomparable Giovinco will never stop impressing us and 16 goals and 13 assists for the season so far are nothing short of superlative. But I just don\u2019t think the award will be given to a player who has been out of action <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/toronto-fc/story/2940247/toronto-fc-forward-sebastian-giovinco-out-for-a-month-with-double-strain\">since late August</a> and missed five matches in the process. Sacha Kljestan is an assist machine (17) and we should not disregard the value he offers to both the Red Bulls and the US national team as the 31-year-old midfielder was one of the only shining points from USA\u2019s draw with New Zealand earlier this week. </p> <p>This award, however, loves forwards (see Giovinco and Robbie Keane, the last two winners) and as the season winds down there are only two candidates who are worthy of the prize. As we wind down the regular season, these two stars know there is something much bigger at stake than an individual honor. Both teams, from the same city, are still looking to win the conference and indeed the Cup \u2013 and the fact that they represent a fresh rivalry make this debate that much more enticing. And in keeping with the trophy\u2019s diverse spirit, they are a south Londoner whose father was one of the greatest strikers in the English game and a pint-sized player from Northern Spain who is lovingly referred to as El Guaje.</p> <h2>Bradley Wright-Phillips, New York Red Bulls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bradley Wright-Phillips\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:33.3375% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKTD5LTBoV9/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@bdubyas_view surpassed Chris Wondolowski&amp;#39;s @mls record with 62 goals scored over 3 consecutive seasons. #dare2BWP #REDTogether #RBNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by newyorkredbulls (@newyorkredbulls) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-13T13:29:47+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 13, 2016 at 6:29am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Forget about the fact that the 31-year-old Englishman is a contender for the Golden Boot award (tied with 21 goals with David Villa) and set to become the first player in MLS history to score at least 20 goals in multiple seasons.

Or that two months later, he broke another record by becoming the club\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 62 goals, surpassing the great Juan Pablo Angel. All that you need to know is that shortly after he broke yet another mark by scoring the most league goals over three seasons last month with 62 goals since 2014 (and counting), Jesse Marsch decided to give the ex-England U20 international the definitive compliment. \u201cListen, this is not taking anything away from Thierry, and obviously Thierry\u2019s the biggest name to ever play here, and is one of the best players,\u2019\u2019 Marsch <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/22/once-trialist-bradley-wright-phillips-never-imagined-hed-be-great\">said in September</a>, \u201cbut I think Brad is emerging himself as the best Red Bull player, the best New York MetroStars player, or whatever you\u2019d want to call it.

Since the 7-0 atrocity in the Hudson River Derby, the Frenchman has created an atmosphere of consistency and resilience amongst the squad, a trait that is often needed with new teams entering a 20-year-old league. Players such as Jack Harrison and Steven Mendoza also have helped the cause, but make no mistake about it, this is David Villa\u2019s team and no other squad relies on single a player more. From a statistical standpoint, the numbers are impressive: 21 goals tie him with the aforementioned Wright-Phillips including four match winners. But what makes this 34-year-old World Cup winner truly one of the greatest ever strikers of his generation is his work rate. The man simply doesn\u2019t stop moving and it\u2019s this mobility and eye for goal that has enabled him to be the most dangerous striker in the league. This season Guaje hasn\u2019t gone three matches without scoring a goal: to put that into perspective, both <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2970782/mls-talking-points-who-will-be-named-mvp-in-2016\">Wright-Phillips and Giovinco have gone seven matches</a> or longer without scoring this year, albeit Giovinco\u2019s reasoning was also down to injury. But what this means is that Villa is the man you can bet your house on to score, no matter who you\u2019re playing against or who is supplying the chances. Before the season started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/12/david-villa-new-york-city-fc-interview\">I interviewed Villa</a> and during our conversation he stressed to me how his goalscoring is a priority for the team\u2019s success and not for personal achievement. \u201cI score for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for David Villa.\u201d As NYC FC make history by entering their first ever playoff run, it cannot be forgotten that it\u2019s all mainly thanks to David Villa, the man who was born to score.</p>",
  "<p>The novel that follows Piers Torday\u2019s acclaimed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/26/the-wild-beyond-piers-torday-review-teenage-dystopian-fiction\" title=\"\"> Last Wild trilogy</a> gets off to a bit of a slow start. It\u2019s a snowy Christmas Eve when we meet the Mallory family \u2013 oldest child Violet, 11-year-old Albert, whose nickname is Mouse, toddler Esme and their harassed mum Belinda. Dad has decamped to Florida with a new love, and nobody is very happy, so there\u2019s plenty of bickering. But Mum finally herds the kids into the car for the drive across the moor to the house of Granny and Gramps where they are to spend Christmas Day.</p> <p>So far it\u2019s all very realistic: a closely observed, wry portrait of a wounded family, and in particular the love-hate of Violet and Mouse. Then, 30 pages in, everything changes. The car hits a patch of black ice and crashes, spinning off the road on an isolated part of the moor. Violet blacks out for a moment, and when she comes to she finds herself trapped by her seat belt. Esme is alive, and so is Mum, although she\u2019s unconscious and bleeding. Mouse, however, has vanished.</p> <p>At this point the narrative splits in two and we discover that Mouse is somewhere else entirely. He wakes alone in a field, unable to remember how he got there or who he is. There\u2019s certainly no crashed car or any other human beings in sight, only a friendly sheep who seems to be able to pack a lot of meaning into each \u201cBaa!\u201d. Soon things take a rather stranger \u2013 and much darker \u2013 turn. Mouse realises somebody or something very scary is watching him from the nearby woods.</p> <p>Just then a large talking horse appears, an impossible transformation of Nonky, Mouse\u2019s beloved childhood toy. Nonky casually informs Mouse that he is now in a \u201cstory\u201d and that it will include peril, quests and an enemy \u2013 the thing in the woods \u2013 who&#xa0;wants to kill him. So they set off&#xa0;through a fairytale landscape, collecting several other toy-based characters. Mouse is dressed as a knight from his favourite computer game; their goal is a distant castle which may or may not exist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Violet is still trying to get out of the car and save her family. The power of story and imagination plays a&#xa0;key role in each narrative. It quickly becomes clear that Mouse is in a world created by his unconscious mind, and Violet \u2013 who loves reading \u2013 uses the wisdom she has gained from books to solve practical problems as well as to give herself courage. The two strands gradually begin to come together, as tension about the family\u2019s fate mounts.</p> <p>I won\u2019t reveal the tale\u2019s eventual destination, but there are clues. Astute readers will quickly guess the identity of the deadly monster stalking Mouse. Then there\u2019s the name Mallory: it can\u2019t be a coincidence that Mouse shares a surname with the man who disappeared into the snows of Everest. At its heart, this story is about survival, ut it\u2019s also about a family dealing with tragedy and managing to carry on.</p> <p>I do have a quibble. The narrative moves fairly slowly, and I was left with&#xa0;a sense that it doesn\u2019t have quite enough plot for its length. But that\u2019s offset by the fizz and crackle of the dialogue, the menace of the darker scenes, the depth of insight into the human condition and the sheer originality of the whole.

  "<p>Could national populism have reached its high-water mark in western politics. Perhaps globally?

Britain\u2019s current political travails are a seen as a side show in Europe at the moment.</p> <p>Elsewhere on the continent, there are yet more signs of pushback. In central Europe, often described as a hotbed of parochialism and intolerance, illiberal politicians aren\u2019t entirely having their way. This month Poland\u2019s nationalist, ultraconservative government had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/05/poland-signals-u-turn-total-abortion-ban-protests-video-report\">backtrack on plans to curtail abortion rights</a> after thousands of women protested on the streets.

It may be that national populists have overreached (Trump\u2019s racist and misogynist antics); or that memories of a dark past and the need to avert political catastrophe have come to the fore (Germans wanting to counter the far-right Alternative for Germany, French citizens worried about Le Pen). It may be that groups are rekindling the spirit of democratic mobilisation (Polish women and the anti-Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski grassroots, who are such keen demonstrators). It may be that voter apathy also sends a message about policies that stigmatise outsiders (Hungary).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/the-question-was-stupid-hungarians-on-the-refugee-referendum\">'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does this sound too optimistic? Precisely because there haven\u2019t been many reasons for optimism recently, it\u2019s important not to ignore what is potentially promising. Likewise, it\u2019s important to see how the connections between international affairs and domestic politics may not all play out in the populists\u2019 favour. Authoritarianism has thrown its weight around in recent years, but right now it\u2019s going through a bad patch.</p> <p>Take Russia. Whatever allowances some in the west might have sought to make for Putin in the past, the Syrian tragedy has made this much more difficult. To claim that Russia\u2019s air assault on Aleppo\u2019s population is no different from western interventions against Isis not only flies in the face of documented facts, it smacks of intellectual and moral disorientation.</p> <p>Geopolitics feeds into politics. Which means there is cautious hope to be drawn from the fact that Putin\u2019s Russia currently finds itself more isolated than it ever has been (only Venezuela\u2019s autocratic regime voted alongside Russia in the UN recently). Russia has been an active backer of populists in Europe and in the US. Putin sympathisers now find themselves having to keep awkwardly silent over the scandal unfolding in Syria, or having to repeat a propaganda line that many citizens may find hard to swallow.</p> <p>This is not to say that national populists or their authoritarian backers are about to be defeated or disempowered. The fuel that powers the far right has yet to be exhausted. But from Clinton\u2019s lead to the surprising strength of Europe\u2019s political centre-ground, and with the novelty of Russia being discredited on many fronts, the picture is not just doom and gloom for the democratically minded. If this is an interconnected world, then the pushback against national populism may be stronger than we think.</p>",

If he was still here, he probably wouldn\u2019t have lasted through what\u2019s about to happen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/14/chicago-clubs-goat-curse-baseball-world-series\">No acting the goat at Chicago Cubs when it comes to pub owner\u2019s curse | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first thing you\u2019ll do is tell me that I\u2019m a coward, that I got sick of losing, that I have no loyalty. What about the Sammy Sosa home run chase? The 1998 wild card tiebreaker? Mark Grace, Kerry Wood, Ryno, Andre Dawson, Harry Caray passing out on his notes, and that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TtEx2WOOg\">one game where Bill Murray did play-by-play</a>?</p> <p>I grew up a Cubs fan, probably the only Cubs fan in the entire city limits of Merced, California, because my dad (also named David, but less fond of the more informal version) was. Why would anyone root for the Cubs in California? We\u2019re generally cheerful people, sons and daughters of Disneyland and open roads. Merced isn\u2019t exactly Hollywood. It\u2019s an Air Force town populated with retired airmen, farm workers, and people who thought they were just passing through. Still, there\u2019s enough sunshine optimism that the idea of cheering for a perennial loser lacks a certain appeal.</p> <p>My dad, himself a retired Air Force master sergeant, was not a cheerful man. The Cubs were perfect for him. Most of my vivid memories of him are his grousing. He loved to complain about how the world had set out to ruin him. Bureaucrats, friends, relatives, and his own wife were somehow preventing him from being happy. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a lot happier when I\u2019m dead,\u201d he\u2019d be prone to say at totally inappropriate times. One day, he came in from washing the car just so he could throw a phone book against the wall as loud as he possibly could. I still don\u2019t know why he did it. No one would tell me. </p> <p>Nothing was ever his fault, either. If we couldn\u2019t pay the bills, it was because my mom spent too much. If the car broke down, it was because the salesman screwed us. He was overweight because there wasn\u2019t enough good food in the house. The Cubs have a literal goat to pass down all of their existential fury and self-loathing. My dad had to find the metaphorical kind. His love-hate relationship with the Cubs was formed when he was born in the Chicago suburb of Aurora, Illinois, which is most famous for being the town where the movie Wayne\u2019s World is set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80e0dd4c6176b42d18f0e8d6d70466d157e6c785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e0dd4c6176b42d18f0e8d6d70466d157e6c785/0_3_640_637/500.jpg\" alt=\"The author\u2019s mother and father\" width=\"500\" height=\"498\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author\u2019s mother and father in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Dave Schilling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My grandparents moved to Southern California when my dad was still a kid, and just about everyone took on the Dodgers as their favorite baseball team, except no one told me that for years. I equate this to finding out you\u2019re adopted or that your parents are actually Soviet spies, but worse. You realize that you\u2019ve been living someone else\u2019s lie for your entire life and have to come to grips with that.</p> <p>Instead of being given the choice, I accepted the received wisdom that Chicago was the center of the sports universe. To a child in California, Chicago was a distant, unknowable entity. Why should I care? And yet, my father persisted in rooting for the least cool baseball team possible and made me do it to. I\u2019m sure he just wanted someone else to be depressed with him.</p> <p>A case could be made that the Royals or the Padres are less appealing to a young child than the Cubs were in the early 90s, but I\u2019m not buying it. The Padres play in sunny San Diego and have a jolly, fat, bald man as their mascot. Also, do not sleep on the San Diego Chicken as a major plus for a prepubescent boy. The Royals were pretty lame too, but Kauffman Stadium was my default stadium when playing World Series Baseball for Sega Genesis. I just really liked the water fountains, I guess.</p> <p>What\u2019s the best part about being a Cubs fan? Going to Cubs games and getting well and truly wasted during the day. Not only was I not allowed to drink until I was 21, I also didn\u2019t live anywhere near Wrigley Field. WGN, the Cubs\u2019 superstation broadcast partner, wasn\u2019t even offered on our cable subscription. So, I flirted with other teams, much to my dad\u2019s chagrin. The Giants were the closest, geographically. The Mariners had Ken Griffey Jr. And there were the Dodgers, where my uncle and grandmother lived. The uncle I never saw, who my father refused to talk to. The grandmother that my father couldn\u2019t stand.</p> <p>\u201cI hate the Dodgers. They\u2019re cocky,\u201d he\u2019d say when invoking the bane of his existence from Los Angeles. \u201cThey carry themselves like they\u2019re better than everyone else. They buy titles and they have no respect for the game.\u201d As an extra bit of guilt, my mom would feed me this line about how David Sr\u2019s aunt was buried in her Cubs hat. How could I abandon such maniacal devotion so casually? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/oct/14/chicago-cubs-world-series-stats\">Is this finally the Chicago Cubs' year?

Game 6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/oct/15/chicago-cubs-steve-bartman-world-series\">Bartman</a>. I made the truly foolish decision to call my dad in the sixth inning. \u201cWe really might do it this time,\u201d I said breathlessly after running back from my college job manning a desk at the library. \u201cGive it some time,\u201d he responded with a trademark terseness. The greatest lesson I ever learned from my father is that baseball is not fun.</p> <p>When the meltdown was complete, I called my dad again. His affect had not changed much. \u201cThey will lose Game 7. No one comes back from that, especially not the Cubs.\u201d I hung up the phone, not sure whether to drink myself to sleep, cry, or both. The Red Sox stole our thunder a year later, capturing the hearts of the entire country in a way that was charming at first, but turned completely obnoxious by 2008. Which, by the way, Cubs fans should be prepared for. If they do win, the faithful are going to have to learn to swallow their pride and not throttle every soulless bandwagon rider, opportunistic celebrity, and media pundit who suddenly discovers their love for your favorite team. If you own a company that sells Cubs hats in various shades of pink or green, start planning that yacht purchase now.</p> <p>In 2006, my dad keeled over from a heart attack in the middle of the work day. My mother later revealed to me that he\u2019d simply stopped taking the medication that regulated his heart problems and had purposefully prevented her from receiving certain Air Force retirement benefits. He also left her with tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes. Her wages were garnished for years and she sunk into a massive depression that strained our relationship.</p> <p>I moved to LA a year after burying my father, but was committed to keeping up my Cubs fandom. After all, who wants to be the guy to abandon tradition? Does anyone covet the reaction of moralistic baseball fans eager to rub your disloyalty in your face? But the more I learned about my dad\u2019s estrangement from his family, the more I started to see why he hated the Dodgers in the first place, why whenever we visited Los Angeles when I was growing up, he\u2019d sink even further into depression.</p> <p>Loving the Cubs was a way to escape, to imagine another life. But LA is my life. I got married here, I bought a house here. I\u2019ve lived here longer than my dad ever lived in Illinois. I slowly gave up trying to force myself to root for the Cubs around the same time I stopped forcing myself to see my father as anything other than a flawed, sad man full of spite. When I root for the Dodgers this coming week, I\u2019m rooting for myself, for my own choices, and for the person I want to be. There will be lots of talk of ghosts during the NLCS, but the only ghost that matters to me is the ghost of my father. I\u2019ve already exorcised that one. </p>",
  "<p>About a thousand years ago, when I&#xa0;was a kid at summer camp in Maine, my fellow cabinmates announced a game in which everyone had to ignore someone whose name began with an H&#xa0;and ended with a Y. Naturally I was quite hurt by this, and a little confused. Hadn\u2019t we all been friends yesterday? Two of them had already said they wanted to be my pen pals for life! I couldn\u2019t understand it. It turned out they didn\u2019t mean me, they meant a different 11-year-old girl, one called Holly. (I&#xa0;can\u2019t remember why they didn\u2019t like Holly.) I&#xa0;was still bruised, and never really felt the same way about my cabinmates again. The following week, I switched cabins.</p> <p>Which brings me to what it\u2019s like being a&#xa0;foreigner in Brexit Britain or, to put it more accurately, if less alliteratively, Brexit England. Now, when politicians bang on about immigrants stealing British jobs, and suggest all foreign workers should be on some kind of list \u2013 maybe not a \u201cname and shame\u201d list, but at least a&#xa0;private&#xa0;list (because this is somehow better) \u2013 I know they\u2019re not thinking of me, exactly. I&#xa0;am a white Jewish American lady who speaks the language, pays her taxes, understands the cultural significance of Phillip Schofield, and manages to do all those other things foreigners allegedly don\u2019t.</p> <p>But I also know they\u2019re not <em>not</em> thinking of me, either. After all, I am a foreigner who works for a British company, so I am in the general neighbourhood. (But could a native Brit make as many jokes as I have done over the years about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/karl-lagerfeld\">Karl Lagerfeld</a> on this newspaper\u2019s fashion pages? <em>I don\u2019t think so.</em> Don\u2019t forsake us skilled immigrants, Britain!)</p> <p>At least we all now know for certain what \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d really means: it means blaming everything on immigration. I\u2019d like to talk a little about this idea of putting foreigners on lists. Of late, I\u2019ve been researching my father\u2019s family, who were all in Paris during the war. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to go full Nazi analogy on you: I don\u2019t actually think Theresa May is Hitler. (Although whether Donald Trump might be is still very much TBD, in my opinion.)</p> <p>But let me tell you a not especially heartwarming story. My grandmother lived in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Marais\">the Marais</a>, the Jewish ghetto, with her three brothers, Henri, Alex and Jacques, having fled Poland during the pogroms. A few years after they arrived, my great-uncle Alex sensed the way the political wind was going, and convinced an American tourist he\u2019d met at most twice to marry my grandmother, which might at least get her out of the country. This is how my grandmother met my grandfather.</p> <p>Soon after, in September 1940, Jews in France\u2019s occupied zone were ordered to register at their local police station. To go on a list, you see. Of the three brothers, only trusting Jacques obeyed. In May 1941, thousands of foreign male Jews, including Jacques, were arrested and shipped off to internment camps and eventually, concentration camps, where Jacques was killed.</p> <p>Alex, by contrast, never trusted lists. He didn\u2019t even keep his money in a bank. Instead, he joined the underground and spent part of the war in France and part of it in Britain, which he loved. He spoke fondly of BBC radio for the rest of his life, until he died in 1999, because he associated it with the one European country where he, a&#xa0;foreigner, had felt welcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/01/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-no-such-thing-perfect-marriage-why-pretend\">Brad and Angelina proved there's no such thing as the perfect marriage: so why do we pretend?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As politicians love to say, we can talk about immigration without being racist (unfortunately, they usually say this right before saying something pretty racist). But <a href=\"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/britain-u-turns-british-jobs-british-people-policy/\">using slogans</a> (\u201cBritish jobs for British people!\u201d) <a href=\"https://www.bnp.org.uk/news/british-jobs-must-be-british-workers\">the BNP was bandying about</a> a decade ago is just not a good look for a government. Obviously Brexit England is not Vichy France (as <em>if</em> England would take orders from Germany, those EU bastards), and the grossed-out reaction to the stupid list idea, even among some Tories, reinforces this. But that it was even pitched in the first place certainly gives a flavour of how this government pictures post-referendum England.</p> <p>So if Brexit means a Britain in which politicians vilify all the foreigners all the time, well, you can understand some of us might start looking towards other cabins, which I&#xa0;guess is their point anyway. No one wants to be somewhere they\u2019re not wanted, and I never really believed that my cabinmates meant just Holly and not me, too. Unfortunately, the threat of a&#xa0;hard Brexit has so devalued sterling that none of us foreigners can actually afford to go back to&#xa0;where we came from. How about that for irony,&#xa0;Brexiteers?</p>",

Sequestered in a secluded villa, a team from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) was assigned to help the new arrivals learn Khmer, familiarise themselves with their new surroundings and look for work.

  "<p>I think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremy-paxman\">Jeremy Paxman</a> wants to be known, but only on his own terms, and these terms are tidal and possibly a mystery to himself. He worries, for instance, that his obituary will be headlined Man Who Asked Same Question Of Michael Howard 14 Times Dies. Except it wasn\u2019t 14 times, he notes beadily in his new memoir, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/untitled-446407.html\">A Life In Questions</a>, already anticipating the posthumous lies that might be told: \u201cThe repetition of that number proves that what matters is who produced the first account.\u201d (For the record, it was 12 times.)</p> <p>Paxman worries about his public image but then starts fights: with Marks &amp; Spencer, for instance, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/21/fashion.lifeandhealth\">the support offered by their pants</a>. (The clue to his willingness to do this, I think, is also in his memoir, where he notes that Ruby Wax told Options magazine in 1994 that he has \u201chuge genitals\u201d. I do not know how she came upon this information, and I do not ask.) Paxman still keeps a copy of an old interview with Best magazine in which he said he found clothes \u201creally boring\u201d. By way of revenge, Warehouse founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/16/fashion-jeff-banks-award-retail\">Jeff Banks</a> then nominated him one of the worst-dressed men in Britain. \u201cThat man should loosen up,\u201d Banks said, \u201cand get into some soft linen.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that was true once. When we meet, in the Langham hotel opposite Broadcasting House in London, where Paxman has worked, on and off, for more than 40 years, he doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about his memoir. It is a riveting book when he writes about himself, but halfway through he seems to lose interest, or courage, and speaks about what he did, not how he felt, which is less interesting. I do not really care that late-night news producers live in a state of nervous collapse; I expect it. He loses his tone, but it comes back at the end when he returns to his father, Keith, a man \u201cincapable of expressing affection\u201d, whose ghost runs backwards through the book.</p> <p>I sometimes see Paxman working in the London Library; he is usually intense, and friendly, probably because I once implied he was a feminist in print, and said his face was ravaged by ennui. Today he is apprehensive, and early; a schoolboy at the dentist, wearing clothes that Jeff Banks would not hate. He looks around the bar with fascinated eyes. \u201cHow,\u201d he asks, \u201cwould places like this function if it were not for people who came here to better themselves and understand service?\u201d He ponders the foreign staff\u2019s potential visa arrangements, and begins to ruminate on Brexit. He voted to remain: \u201cI just wish someone had had the guts to make a decent case.\u201d What would he have asked David Cameron the night after the referendum vote, had he still been at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/newsnight\">Newsnight</a>? \u201cAren\u2019t you a man who sacrificed his country for his party?\u201d he says, swiftly. He imagines Cameron\u2019s potential answers, and I remember how much I miss him on Newsnight.</p> <p>Paxman is fierce, even more so because he is not the raging caricature of myth, although he will put it on when it amuses him. He is kindly and interested, if occasionally derisive. If I were Paxman, and I have thought about this a lot since we met, I would have asked him: \u201cDid your emotionally distant father lead you to a career where you excelled, specifically, in seeking out and humiliating figures of authority?\u201d But I am not Paxman, so I tug at the edges, often pointlessly.</p> <p>He joined the BBC in 1972, going from Radio Brighton to Tonight, to Panorama, to the Six O\u2019Clock News to Breakfast Time to Newsnight; he was, for seven years, a war reporter and, along the way, he married and had three children. (He says nothing about his family in the book; his marriage is alluded to only in a picture caption. \u201cWhat they choose to disclose of their lives is up to them,\u201d he says.) His mother once told him she remembered him watching television with her, \u201cand seeing <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/11/98/crossing_continents/125942.stm\">Julian Pettifer</a> \u2013 a very glamorous young reporter in Vietnam \u2013 jumping out of a helicopter and saying, \u2018I want his job.\u2019 I realise now, looking back, that journalism was a square peg in a square hole for me, but I don\u2019t have any recollection of this.\u201d</p> <p>Being an outsider can make you a good journalist though, I suggest. He answers with a rebuke: \u201cI once sat behind you at Labour party conference and heard you shamefully applauding some platform speaker and I thought, \u2018This isn\u2019t what we do.\u2019 You probably <em>stood up</em> and applauded, I don\u2019t know. Resolutely remain seated and do not applaud.\u201d I\u2019ve moved on, I say weakly; I wouldn\u2019t do that now.

His answer is: the ones whose cause is lost. \u201cI think that many of the people I most admire have not got right to the very top,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting to the top\u201d \u2013 there is a long silence \u2013 \u201crequires a compact with the devil.\u201d He pulls back slightly: \u201cThey are not all charlatans or shits, but we should just\u2026 [It\u2019s] like supping with the devil, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Has he ever hated a politician? \u201cNo.\u201d He sounds very cool and very far away. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt hatred. I\u2019m quite surprised you asked me. What right does anyone have to feel hatred? Of course not. I\u2019ve never hated anybody.\u201d He repeats this: \u201cI\u2019ve never hated anyone. I probably have said, \u2018I hate you\u2019, when younger. It\u2019s an utterly unproductive emotion. What\u2019s the point? Who cares what some pipsqueak journalist thinks?\u201d Except that the epigraph to his memoir is by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">Hilaire Belloc</a>:</p> <p>\u201cHere richly, with ridiculous display,</p> <p>The politician\u2019s corpse was laid away,</p> <p>While all of his acquaintance sneered and slanged</p> <p>I wept. For I had longed to see him hanged.\u201d</p> <p>Paxman is more comfortable talking about politics than about himself. (He has begun to respond to questions on any other subject with: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do better than that!\u201d) \u201cThe comment that \u2018they [politicians] are all the same\u2019 reflects this widespread malaise that there is something not working about politics,\u201d he says. He distrusts \u201cthis requirement to reduce everything to simple binary choices. It is insulting to the intelligence. We know deep down that it\u2019s incredibly complicated.\u201d The problem of funding the NHS, for instance: \u201cNo one will engage with this. I think people are sick of the idiom, sick of the promise of jam tomorrow. It\u2019s imaginary jam, imaginary bread.\u201d In a healthier democracy, he thinks, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be standing on our back legs [in parliament] saying that everything our interlocutor is saying is rubbish. It\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, he wants \u201ca parliament made up of spiky individuals. I want to be surprised. I want to feel there are people there who are making up their minds based on the issues. It\u2019s become almost totalitarian.\u201d Journalism, he believes, is withering, too. \u201cThe trade connives at its own irrelevance. This lifestyle stuff, the preponderance of comment over disclosure. If we aren\u2019t telling people things that make them go, \u2018Crikey\u2019, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always felt inadequate. Well into my 40s, I would go to a party and lurk in the corner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paxman will admit to mistakes. He is ashamed, for instance, that he opened <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIPtmby9iI0\">his 2010 general election interview with Gordon Brown</a> with the words: \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to like you.\u201d Like a boy who has done his time, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve \u2019fessed up to that in the book, haven\u2019t I? It was unkind. It was a bit unkind.\u201d</p> <p>Because, I add, some people did like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\">Brown</a>: his wife, for instance. \u201c<em>You</em> apparently did!\u201d he shouts. But this is his slightly garbled defence: \u201cWhat you are trying to establish in an interview, it\u2019s always about something. People make up their mind about politicians on the basis of what they feel personally about things. I think it was a mean, mean question, but how he dealt with it told us something.\u201d Brown dealt with it by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re such a nice guy, Jeremy.\u201d</p> <p>Paxman was always harder on politicians than on anyone else. They were immune from his sensitivity and he accepts that he may have added to the public distrust of politicians, \u201cthough it does not keep me awake at night\u201d. He asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> what a pink pussy was, as if he didn\u2019t know. He asked Silvio Berlusconi, off camera, if it was true he had called Angela Merkel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/21/jeremy-paxman-stuns-silvio-berlusconi-angela-merkel-insult-allegation\">\u201can unfuckable lard arse\u201d</a>. What Berlusconi replied, he doesn\u2019t say.</p> <p>In his memoir, Paxman writes that he once asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>, also off camera, \u201cAre those fuck-me shoes?\u201d \u201cI bet you Theresa May has no recollection,\u201d he says now. I bet she has. \u201cDo you know about shoes?\u201d he asks me. He seems genuinely curious. \u201cI now understand they are kitten heels, aren\u2019t they?\u201d He has an appetite for trivia, but then he is interested in everything. When he insisted Marks &amp; Spencer underpants had declined in quality, the then chairman Stuart Rose invited him to lunch, bringing in male models in different underpants and inviting Paxman to feel the quality. This was a private lunch. Rose\u2019s on-the-record assessment was that, \u201cas men get older, their balls hang lower\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jeremy Paxman grew up poised between classes, which makes for a good journalist, but not, I suspect, a happy child. His father was a naval officer and, later, a salesman of limited success who ended up living on the other side of the world. Keith was so emotionally distant that, on one return from sea, the infant Paxman didn\u2019t recognise his father and ran away screaming. (His sister, he writes, once found their father crying on the bathroom floor. He asked her to leave, and they never spoke about it.) Keith could not bear to be disobeyed. \u201cI was thrashed by sticks, shoes, cricket stumps, cricket bats or the flat of his hand,\u201d Paxman writes. \u201cIn the most intense row \u2013 or at least the one I recall most intensely \u2013 he sent me to my room for disobeying him, and when I stood my ground, he tried to drag me upstairs. Within a minute or so, all that was left of the shirt was the collar.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e6116346c81d92692cc6dfef5eae62f4383dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e6116346c81d92692cc6dfef5eae62f4383dab/0_172_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Paxman, on the right, with his younger brothers and his father, Keith, a man \u2018incapable of expressing affection\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paxman, on the right, with his younger brothers and his father, Keith, a man \u2018incapable of expressing affection\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Jeremy Paxman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother Joan\u2019s family eventually made money, from a canning factory; this paid for private schools for the four Paxman children. They grew up in crumbling houses in Worcestershire and Yorkshire; they were middle class, but \u201changing in there by our fingernails\u201d. They lived \u201cin full mimicry of what were presumed to be our betters\u201d.</p> <p>There is a lot about Keith in Paxman\u2019s book, but almost nothing about Joan. \u201cI loved my mother, but everyone does, don\u2019t they?\u201d he says. It is a genuine question. He relates how his parents met, and talks about Joan\u2019s hair and how it changed throughout her life. The images move through his head. \u201cI remember this rather elegant woman with jet-black hair, she wore it in a bun, then cut it short when it went grey.\u201d She was \u201cvery conventional. Her characteristic refrain was, \u2018We can\u2019t afford it.\u2019\u201d The three boys \u2013 he is the oldest \u2013 were \u201calways fighting. Joan was run ragged. A busy, active person constantly running around stamping out this fire.\u201d He searches for a photograph of her on his telephone, and shows it to me. She is handsome, and indistinct in a group of female relatives, but she looks strong. \u201cVery Yorkshire,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, he opens up: \u201cI think, growing up, I never felt that I belonged anywhere and I haven\u2019t really felt that until probably about the last 10 years, or 15 years, or something like that. People develop very simple-minded ideas about all this, and only you know what you\u2019re really feeling inside \u2013 and I always felt inadequate. I always felt, \u2018Am I going to cut the mustard here?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, he learned \u201cthe tricks of going into a room and not being frightened. But well into my 40s, I would expect to go to a party and lurk in the corner, cornered by the most boring person in the room.\u201d</p> <p>What changed? \u201cI\u2019m 66 years old,\u201d he says, and the pensive mood flies away. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing George Melly said? The best thing about growing old is losing your libido, like being unshackled from a lunatic!\u201d Does that resonate with you, I say, being unshackled from a lunatic libido?</p> <p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d he says in his poshest voice. Paxman has an arsenal of voices, a rainbow of derision and engagement. This one makes you \u2013 or \u201cone\u201d, he might say \u2013 feel like a twit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss it.\u201d He then ruins this statement by giggling. You brought it up, I say. \u201cMore fool me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of worrying about these things?\u201d he asks. He is talking about inadequacy again. \u201cThere is nothing to be gained by worrying. The implied expectation of sympathy, and I don\u2019t think any of us deserve sympathy.\u201d I think of his father on the bathroom floor, unable to ask for sympathy, even from his child. \u201cI feel very lucky that I\u2019ve had a job which enabled me to go to amazing places, meet interesting people and I don\u2019t think I deserve any sympathy, really.\u201d This is the Miss World Defence; in his memoir, he writes that he had therapy, and took anti-depressants, for several years.</p> <p>Does he ruminate on why he was depressed? \u201cDid I ruminate on <em>what</em>?\u201d he asks. It is an enormous \u201cwhat\u201d. On the reason for his depression, I remind him.</p> <p>\u201cI never ruminated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life. It\u2019s only in the last decade or so that I really thought seriously about why one has the feelings one has. I tried to think about it. What the reason is for responding to things in a particular way.\u201d He is speaking very slowly. He is starting to open up \u2013 and then he isn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4300bf20b5a7d3e649334c4526b9014101708d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4300bf20b5a7d3e649334c4526b9014101708d32/0_41_1483_890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In El Salvador in 1982, with cameraman Alan \u2018Bulletproof\u2019 Stevens.

He bangs again. \u201cThis room\u2019s going to fall down!\u201d he shouts. \u201cSomeone do something about it, quick!\u201d I suspect he will continue to bang until I change the subject. The waitress comes over to suggest we have tea.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, let\u2019s have the tea, if we may, please!\u201d He is still shouting, but he is polite. He is very kind when he wants to be; in his memoir, he recalls that the matron of his school, Malvern College, was unhappily in love with a tutor, and she wept over the teenage Paxman. He was bewildered, but let her. He also chose, at school, to help local children with special needs learn to tie their shoelaces, rather than play soldiers. I think the matron was his first real interview, though unasked. He asks the waitress for Earl Grey.</p> <p>I say weakly, \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d I am a coward, and although he is probably relieved I have stopped asking about his depression, I suspect he despises me for it, too. Instead, I ask about his feelings of not being accepted, specifically at Cambridge University, where he studied English and edited Varsity magazine, and where, he says, he used to pose by a bridge, as if tempted to jump off. He gives a deep sigh. It sounds like, \u201cNeeer.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see the life before him then; now that he can, the past feels different. \u201cI loved it!\u201d he explodes. \u201cI absolutely loved it! Three years to sit around reading wonderful books, occasionally holding forth and spending a lot of time with people of your own age, most of them much cleverer, and having to think about things\u2026 it was fantastic!</p> <p>\u201cI was unhappy,\u201d he adds, \u201cas I have been unhappy much of my life. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m looking for sympathy, but I recognise that actually it was a wonderful, wonderful time. The happiest days of my life, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>I mention the bridge. \u201cWhy are you furrowing your brows like that?\u201d he asks. He laughs again. I wanted to ask, I say, when the depression first manifested. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing else to say about it.\u201d</p> <p>In the introduction to his book, Paxman mentions that he shoots squirrels from his toilet through the bathroom window. I ask him about this; but my question is apparently misleading. \u201cThere is a key clause missing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe seat \u2013 the lid, or whatever \u2013 is down. The seat is down when this occurred.\u201d</p> <p>What else annoys him, aside from squirrels? He pauses, searches for an answer, gives up and shouts: \u201cVirtually everything!\u201d He has an anecdote to illustrate it: \u201cI was just in John Lewis, trying to buy a toaster, and I said to the woman, \u2018What\u2019s the best kind of toaster? These ones are quite good, aren\u2019t they \u2013 they are made in Britain?\u2019 And it was extortionate, \u00a3160 or something. I said, \u2018No one is going to pay \u00a3160 for a toaster unless they are off their head!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942ad512154e6a54bf6cd34ef92e334ed10937a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/942ad512154e6a54bf6cd34ef92e334ed10937a2/0_1_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Paxman on the set of Newsnight in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the set of Newsnight in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC News &amp; Current Affairs via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I listen to him rant and, as I do, wrap my nicotine gum in paper and put it in my bag; I do not want to leave it on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you will have to open your handbag [to clean it]. I bet it\u2019s full of old bits of chewing gum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVirtually everything\u201d annoys him, he repeats, \u201cbut some things make me feel very happy. On the tube as I was coming here, there was a man and a woman and a baby in a pushchair, and they were making faces at the baby and the baby was laughing.\u201d He sounds terribly sincere. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s wonderful.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m rabbiting on. God save us from people who go through life indifferent to things. We want to feel. Being irritated by things, or being made happy by things, is a sign that you are noticing. Do you want to go through life not noticing things?\u201d</p> <p>I love this image of Paxman; now that he is no longer tormenting senior politicians, he is watching babies laugh on public transport, and he is moved by it. Perhaps this is the truest Paxman.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why he left Newsnight in 2014, after 25 years, or what he thinks of it now; he isn\u2019t telling. He spends an age deciding what to tell me and eventually says, \u201cI don\u2019t see it. I like to go to bed early. Which, incidentally, means I can say I don\u2019t know what I think, because I don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p> <p>My own theory is that he got too happy for it, as standup comics do; once you have mellowed, you cannot summon the rage. (In the book, he writes: \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that I have mellowed, but I cannot deny it\u201d.) Later, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s much more important to have friends than enemies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>God save us from people who go through life being indifferent to things. Being irritated is a sign you are noticing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Or perhaps it was the weather that finished him? At the end of his tenure on Newsnight, Paxman was required to comment on the weather and he did so, at peak sarcasm. He gasps silently when I mention this, and lets out a great, \u201cThat was <em>absurd!</em>\u201d Weather reportage, he says, has turned into, \u201ca form of nannying, you know, I can\u2019t stand it\u201d. He turns to me and says softly: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be cold tomorrow, so do make sure you wrap up warm.\u201d The voice is perfect; I believe he cares that the theoretical viewer is wearing a sweater. Or (it is hot the day we meet), \u201cDo be sure to take your bottle of water with you.\u201d So why did he do it? He gives two answers: \u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why would anyone refuse? Presenters should do what they are bloody well told.\u201d But remembering again the indignity, he booms: \u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d</p> <p>He adds that he shouldn\u2019t have let this attitude show. \u201cIf you are right \u2013 and it\u2019s for others to judge \u2013 that you become immensely sarcastic and don\u2019t take things seriously, you are letting your colleagues down.\u201d He is veering still, as I suspect he always has, between classes, because that is what was expected of him when he was young: between the establishment and the revolutionaries. If he never chose a side, this is what makes him hard to read, and easy to watch.</p> <p>We are almost finished, so I ask when he felt closest to belonging. He complains, somewhat tangentially, about the deification of the media: \u201cIt didn\u2019t exist 60 or 70 years ago. But I suppose I belong there. I\u2019m not sure I want to belong, actually. But I suppose I\u2019ve got used to it and I quite enjoy it now. I don\u2019t want to belong.\u201d Now he sounds youthful in his contradictions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/oct/11/im-with-you-on-the-digital-revolution-its-the-lack-of-journalism-i-cant-face\">I'm with you on the digital revolution, it's the lack of journalism I can't face</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am allowed only one more question, so I ask about his seven years as a war reporter; he writes in the memoir, that, eventually, \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep properly, and when eventually I did manage to drop off, I awoke not even knowing what country I was in. In my dreams men with guns in Africa, Ireland, Latin America and the Middle East got all muddled in my head. I didn\u2019t exactly have a breakdown, but it felt like one.\u201d</p> <p>This question irritates him, so close to the end. \u201cThis is like the depression question,\u201d he shouts. \u201cGive us a break!\u201d But he answers: \u201cI admire those people who put up with it, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I made no bones about it. I got too frightened. You\u2019ve got to be able to control your imagination, and I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel a sense of loss when I quit, but I did feel a slight sense of inadequacy. But then I\u2019ve always felt that. It was just another thing one couldn\u2019t do particularly well.\u201d</p> <p>He gives a huge laugh. I think the laugh means he doesn\u2019t mind any more, and I hope it is true.</p> <p>\u2022 A Life In Questions by Jeremy Paxman is published by William Collins at \u00a320.

Its standout feature is the \u201ccruck barn\u201d at the back, built by the owner using traditional materials and the first in the dale for 400 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f690001a9028c05de877bc3de3d4a683cf5783be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f690001a9028c05de877bc3de3d4a683cf5783be/0_99_5241_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Craven Arms, Appletreewick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Craven Arms, Appletreewick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reaching the Craven Arms from the village of Grassington is akin to drinking a neat shot of the dales. Cross the river by the photogenic Linton Falls before climbing up to the gorgeous hamlet of Thorpe through fields threaded with dry-stone walls. Carry on through meadows where lapwings \u201cpee-wit\u201d and a stray foot may startle a hare into pulsing flight, to reach Burnsall and what has to be the most photographed bridge in the dales. Cross the river and follows signs for Appletreewick, and find the Craven Arms close to the Mock Beggar Hall, an old monastic grange that testifies to the village\u2019s connection to nearby Bolton Abbey. Below the pub is a fantastic wild swimming spot.</p> <p>The five and half miles back are most atmospheric if you time it to arrive in Grassington at dusk. Return to Burnsall and then take the historic riverside path north-west, crossing the suspension bridge at Hebden. Along the way enjoy woodsmoke from farmhouse chimneys; the quiet grandeur of autumnal trees bronzed by late light, ground mist around their roots; the gurgling rush and calm of the river; and the unforgettable, far-reaching fells, alive with the bleats of Swaledale sheep, gradually bruising into black.<br><strong>Rob Cowen, author of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/common-ground-371780.html\">Common Ground</a> (Cornerstone)</strong><strong>, voted one of the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/11/readers-top-10-best-books-of-2015\"><strong>Guardian readers\u2019 top 10 books of 2015</strong></a></p> <h2>2 Nidd Gorge, North Yorkshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872da68aa4408dce33df9efb8d36f69c61a09258/125_144_4483_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nidd at Knaresborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nidd at Knaresborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: carriagesknaresborough.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 7</strong>\u00bd<strong><sup> </sup>miles<br></strong><strong>Time: 3</strong>\u00bd<strong> hours<br>Start/finish: Sustrans 67 junction with Bilton Lane (Google <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B000'48.6%22N+1%C2%B031'23.7%22W/@54.0135,-1.5254387,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.0135!4d-1.52325\">map</a></strong><strong>/OS Explorer 297)<br>Grade: Moderate<br>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://www.carriagesknaresborough.co.uk/\"><strong>Carriages</strong></a><strong>, Knaresborough</strong></p> <p>Autumn\u2019s true glories are experienced through trees: the turning of leaves from greens to fiery yellows and reds; the wine-black clusters of berries and nuts on drooping branches; the musty smell of leaf litter as shafts of sun streak the damp earth.</p> <p>A mile from my home on the northern edge of Harrogate, a thickly wooded river gorge provides the perfect stage to witness the splendour of autumn.</p> <p>Enter the Nidd Gorge by following the <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-67\">Sustrans cycleway 67</a> from Bilton to the defunct Victorian viaduct that spans the river.

Today, a handful of fishermen catch whelks, scallops and lobsters, and the Ty Coch is the only pub. The landlord, Stuart Webley and his family are the beach\u2019s last permanent residents.</p> <p>An excellent circular (clockwise) walk to Porthdinllaen starts in the inland village of Edern (park by the Ship Inn). Take the footpath from the wooden footbridge next to the butcher\u2019s shop along the western bank of the Afon Geirch. Head north in the direction of the coast. Cross the stream in front of Porthdynllaen Farm and follow it until you meet the farm track, then hard left until you pick up the footpath again on the other side of the farmyard.</p> <p>Pass by the campsite at the farm and follow the river, now on its eastern bank, to the rocky beach at Abergeirch. Stone steps will take you to the cliff path \u2013 the Wales Coast Path. A colony of seals live off the rocks at Life Boat Bay. When mackerel are in season it\u2019s not unusual to see a pod of dolphins from the cliff. Rejoin the beach at Life Boat Bay and follow the coastal path to the Ty Coch.</p> <p>Proud to be a chip-free zone, the Ty Coch provides carbs in a superb list of bottled craft beers, two local tap beers and a revolving guest ale. The saloon is the beach, with a great view of Anglesey, though you\u2019d be surprised how many people can cram inside when it rains.</p> <p>After lunch continue along the beach to Morfa Nefyn, enjoying superb views of the Yr Eifl hills until the road meets the beach below the Cliffs pub. Walk straight over at the crossroads, then turn right at the T-junction and take the footpath along the B4417 back into Edern. An alternative that avoids the road is to cut back across the golf course and follow the coastal path back to Abergeirch.

To avoid the busy A438, leave Offa\u2019s Dyke here and head up to the steep pitch behind the roadside hamlet of Bronydd. The path eventually brings you out at Bettws Dingle, where you turn briefly west before heading back on yourself towards the river. Zigzagging along the contours of the hills will take you past Upper Bettws farm and on to Old House. Just before reaching the latter, bend right along the track and down through an old wood. Then it\u2019s all downhill to the pub.</p> <p>A splendid 14th-century coaching house, the <a href=\"http://www.rhydspence.com/\">Rhydspence Inn</a> has been welcoming footsore travellers for centuries. The exterior is a gorgeous assemblage of squiggly timber beams and off-kilter windows. If a building could be happily sozzled, this age-old public house would be. At the rear, the garden slopes down towards the Wye: a perfect spot for a pint on a sunny afternoon. Along the southern perimeter, a brook marks the England-Wales border, its narrow banks keeping St George and the Dragon at arm\u2019s length.</p> <p>Inside, the atmosphere of a traditional country pub lives on, from the heavy oak front door and creaking corridors to the cubbyhole bar and open-hearth fire. Upstairs are seven bedrooms with delightful views.</p> <p>The bar menu features all the pub favourites \u2013 steak and ale pie, lasagne, scampi, fish and chips, at around \u00a310 \u2013 alongside baguettes and ciabatta rolls at lunchtime. The restaurant menu is a little more ambitious, with starters that include Thai fish cakes and smoked duck breast salad.

Continue walking alongside the river as it makes its majestic sedate way to Hampton Court Palace. This part of the walk is approximately three miles. You can\u2019t help but be impressed with the history on show here (but be aware that entry to the palace and gardens costs a hefty \u00a319.80). Cross over the river once more on Hampton Court Bridge and Hampton Court station, with its regular trains back to Richmond or London\u2019s Waterloo, is right in front of you. <strong>DG</strong></p> <h2>9 Glen Finglas, Trossachs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"186c10177862543b1a20181384e53a81f875e557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/186c10177862543b1a20181384e53a81f875e557/0_722_5571_3343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LOOKING OVER TO THE TROSSACHS CHURCH AND LOCH ACHRAY WITH BEN VENUE VISIBLE BEYONDB7EF1F LOOKING OVER TO THE TROSSACHS CHURCH AND LOCH ACHRAY WITH BEN VENUE VISIBLE BEYOND ** for 5.

It is the illimitable horizon and vast open beach that first dazzle the visitor to Wells-next-the-Sea: this windswept space is intoxicating. At low tide it\u2019s possible to imagine you\u2019re in a desert until the tide creeps up with swift stealth.</p> <p>An easy two-hour stroll is to take the footpath westwards into the pine woods at the far end of the beach car park at Wells. This becomes a sheltered grassy track at the edge of the woods where you can bump into muntjac deer or watch skeins of pink-footed geese and wading birds drawn to the wet fields in winter. At Holkham, you can turn through the pines on to the vast beach and head back east to Wells, keeping an eye out for seals, oystercatchers and other shoreline birds.</p> <p>This is a particularly beautiful walk in autumn and winter, when there is more chance of encountering coastal wildlife. And even when it is busy, you can always find space and solitude on such an expanse of sand. My tip is to check the wind direction when you set out and do this walk whichever way round ensures that the wind is at your back on the beach.</p> <p>After a fresh-air buffeting, you may require some refreshment; follow the coast path up the channel to the port of Wells, where you\u2019ll find the <a href=\"http://albatroswells.co.uk/\">Albatros</a> moored on the Quay.

Many of its conifers have been removed and the revived native wood has become one of the best places in Britain for the purple emperor, an elusive, iridescent butterfly that flashes purple and inspires obsessive devotion when it emerges in late June. At this time of year, it is a brilliantly camouflaged caterpillar but the rides of Fermyn remain a lovely walk.</p> <p>If I\u2019m in the area, I always call in at another nature reserve, <a href=\"http://www.wildlifebcn.org/reserves/glapthorn-cow-pastures\">Glapthorn Cow Pastures</a>, which is even closer to the Chequered Skipper. This is a hidden gem, a mix of ancient woodland, meadows and blackthorn scrub, home to another rare butterfly, the black hairstreak. Like the purple emperor, this little butterfly with tiny tails on its wings has a cult following. <strong>PB</strong></p> <h2>13 The Devil\u2019s Dyke, Cambridgeshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ff99c570b6122a9daa4a5310699ba6173d12f8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ff99c570b6122a9daa4a5310699ba6173d12f8f/658_162_3457_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 9 miles <br>Time: 4 hours <br>Start/finish: Barbara Stradbroke Ave, where the race course meets the Dyke (Google </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/52%C2%B013'48.3%22N+0%C2%B021'53.0%22E/@52.2300893,0.3625213,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d52.230086!4d0.36471\"><strong>map</strong></a><strong> /OS Explorer 226) <br>Grade: Easy <br>Refuel: The </strong><a href=\"http://www.dykesend.co.uk/\"><strong>Dyke\u2019s End</strong></a><strong>, Reach </strong></p> <p>The Devil\u2019s Dyke is a chalky, manmade trench-and-ridge earthwork, most likely built as an Anglo-Saxon defence.

After Reach, the fens begin, with chalk replaced by peat, and the pathway bounces beneath your boots in a place that has not forgotten its swampy past.</p> <p>The walk heads along the dyke\u2019s watery extension, Reach Lode. Another manmade feature, this is an old waterway first dug, perhaps, in Roman times.

Now I can both exercise my right to roam on the same route, and stop off for lunch at the <a href=\"http://thebeehiveinn.co.uk/\">Beehive Inn</a>.</p> <p>The first leg of the Combs Moss circuit is a great appetite builder. It is easy to park at the top of Lightwood Road in Buxton and then follow the gravel track to the bridge over a small brook and climb the steep facing slope. Then the route heads north-east, following the boundary line and gritstone wall, known as Black Edge, that divides the heather moorland from the upland pastures.</p> <p>There is a sense of vast space, and glorious panoramas over the heart of the Peak District. Then, as you drop off the moor to the minor road above Combs Edge and make the last steep descent into Combs and the Beehive itself, you can see, way to the north, the darker contours of Kinder Scout and Blackden Moor.</p> <p>Avoid retracing your steps by undertaking a post-lunch slog up Ridge Lane and back to Buxton via the old Roman road, completing an eight-mile circuit. You are largely walking on an old gravel and even tarmac road, so the route is clear and the going good. It gets a little tougher with the years and over time I have seen the lapwings and curlews decline, yet the buzzards, peregrines and ravens are all increasing. The varied colours of autumn vegetation seen from this route are particularly rewarding.</p> <p>The fact that the Beehive pub is always busy despite being down a virtual cul-de-sac in the tiny hamlet of Combs, miles from the main road, speaks volumes for the friendliness of the staff and the reputation of its food and cask ale. It has a wood-lined interior with superb photos of local Derbyshire characters on the walls. There is an excellent range of traditional fare, but the generous Sunday roasts (\u00a310.95; the beef was particularly good last time) with heaps of fresh vegetables have long been a stock choice of my family. <strong>MC</strong></p> <h2>17 North Down Coastal Path, County Down</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206d9e519eef1c2e4f88c8b19f28c54a075356d1/0_258_5128_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crawfordsburn country park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawfordsburn country park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Length: 9 miles <br>Time: 4 hours <br>Start: Holywood station (Google </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B038'37.6%22N+5%C2%B050'21.3%22W/@54.6437771,-5.8414307,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.643774!4d-5.839242\">map</a></strong><strong>/OSNI Discover 15</strong><strong>)<br></strong><strong>Finish: Seacliff Road, Bangor (Google </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B039'56.2%22N+5%C2%B040'00.1%22W/@54.6656121,-5.6688897,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.665609!4d-5.666701\"><strong>map</strong></a><strong>) Grade: Moderate<br></strong><strong>Refuel: </strong><a href=\"http://saltydogbangor.com/\">The Salty Dog</a><strong>, Bangor</strong></p> <p>From busy marinas to quiet sandy beaches, this trip along the shore of Belfast Lough is a celebration of the coastal diversity a stone\u2019s throw from the capital.

Not since Margaret Thatcher has it given a prime minister such unstinting admiration and support. It never much cared for David Cameron \u2013 for a time even Gordon Brown ranked higher in the Mail\u2019s affections, perhaps because Brown replaced a flashy predecessor, just as May has done. Both leaders exemplify the hard work and modesty that you might expect from a childhood spent in a churchy household \u2013 a manse in Brown\u2019s case and a vicarage in May\u2019s \u2013 which are habits and virtues that the Mail likes to think its readers share. May, presumably, loves the Mail in return; who wouldn\u2019t want the support of the most politically influential paper in England? But whether May hates the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d quite as much as the Mail does is an open question.</p> <p>On the morning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\" title=\"\">her big speech to the Tory conference</a>, the Mail\u2019s front-page report predicted that she would condemn this elite, which it also called the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, \u201cfor sneering at millions of ordinary Britons over immigration\u201d. But her speech, when she delivered it, wasn\u2019t quite so straightforward. Many politicians and commentators, she told her audience, had found \u201cyour patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial, your views about crime illiberal, your attachment to your job security inconvenient\u201d. But the only mention of an elite came in an earlier passage about the many \u201cpeople in positions of power\u201d who behaved as if they had \u201cmore in common with international elites than with the people down the road, the people they employ, the people they pass in the street\u201d. And then she added: \u201cBut if you believe you\u2019re a citizen of the world, you\u2019re a citizen of nowhere.\u201d</p> <p>In one or two paragraphs, she had taken aim at various kinds of elites and allegedly elitist attitudes, some antithetical to others and the most awkward of them probably invented for the sake of political balance \u2013 for which politician or commentator has ever openly complained about the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of a worker\u2019s attachment to job security?</p> <p>Two broad categories had been conflated and confused. First came the rich and greedy international elite, who ran businesses that didn\u2019t pay proper taxes and treated their workers badly. Second came a social and cultural elite who peered down their noses at the illiberalism and flag-waving of the classes below.</p> <p>Both groups could be smeared as citizens of nowhere \u2013 \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d in the antisemitic jibe of Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union \u2013 but other than that they have little or nothing in common. Ruthless billionaires on the one hand, condescending academics on the other: together, May implied, they had alienated the larger part of an electorate that felt wronged and ignored.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing new in her diagnosis. Shortly before he died in 1994, the American historian and moralist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/obituaries/christopher-lasch-is-dead-at-61-wrote-about-america-s-malaise.html\" title=\"\">Christopher Lasch</a> wrote an eloquent charge sheet against similar targets in his posthumously published book The Revolt of the Elites. He mainly described the United States, but his analysis illuminates many other parts of the world (including the land of Brexit) as well.</p> <p>What went wrong? Lasch: \u201cThe general course of recent history no longer favours the levelling of social distinctions but runs more and more in the direction of a two-class society.\u201d What he called the \u201cdemocratisation of abundance\u201d \u2013 the expectation that each generation would be better off than its predecessor \u2013 was giving way to a society of rising inequalities.</p> <p>How did this happen? When the idea that the masses were riding the wave of history faded away. The radical movements of the 20th century have failed, and the industrial working class, once the mainstay of the socialist movement, has been weakened to the point where, in some of its former strongholds, it barely exists anymore.</p> <p>Who are the elites? \u201cThose who control the international flow of money and information, preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher learning, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus set the terms of public debate.\u201d</p> <p>A Marxist could have written those last words; the Daily Mail, in its anti-Philip (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3784214/Still-working-hard-Sir-Shifty-Philip-Green-relaxes-shore-family-luxury-yacht-docks-Monaco.html\" title=\"\">Sir Shifty</a>\u201d) Green and anti-metropolitan moments, could almost have written it.</p> <p>As a social critic rather than an ideologue, Lasch is hard to place on the left-right spectrum. Sometimes he might be depicting the present-day dilemma of a constituency Labour party in the north of England, as when he points out that the class once regarded as the most likely to support a revolution has many members with political instincts more conservative than those of their radical would-be leaders.</p> <p>Elsewhere he could be describing a way of London living that in 1994 still lay a dozen years in the future: \u201cAmbitious people understand \u2026 that a migratory way of life is the price of getting ahead \u2026 \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 suits them to perfection, conjuring up an agreeable image of a global bazaar \u2026 Theirs is essentially a tourist\u2019s view of the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading Lasch at this time of crisis in British history is also valuable as a caution. He writes that when the common folk confront well-meaning initiatives from above, their resistance provokes an outburst of \u201cthe venomous hatred that lies not far beneath the smiling face of upper-middle-class benevolence\u201d.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think of myself as upper-middle-class, but that might be a caricature of my emotions when, say, I watch Brexiteers on Question Time. The Daily Mail\u2019s portrayal of remainers as truculent and bitter has a few grains of truth. Nobody can look at something they see as a catastrophe and not despair of the people who caused it.</p> <p>Speaking of whom, let us count the public schools and the frequent mention of the same university.

The house, which had been rented and staffed by Lord Sainsbury and Lord Rothschild, offered a home to some of those for whom no foster families were available. There, the children would be schooled, taught English, fed English delicacies that took some getting used to (kippers, stews, custard) and cared for by Matron Sabakin with her helpers, Ms Turner and Ms Griffith.</p> <p>Most of the boys would never see their families again. Hans and Wolfgang would learn that, during the night of 12 February 1940, the Jews of Stettin, their home town in Germany, had been woken by the Nazis, transported to Poland and then marched 30km in deep snow to an enclosed ghetto in Lublin. Many would die en route and others soon after: by November 1941, Hans and Wolfgang\u2019s mother, father and baby brother, Raphael, had all died.</p> <p>With the coming of the blitz, the Lytton Grove children were evacuated to Reading, and Hans and Wolfgang eventually became John and Wilf.</p> <p>I later asked an elderly relative, my great-uncle Kurt, what he remembered of John in those years \u2013 surely he must have been a desolate child, parentless in a strange country, not speaking the language, bullied as an \u201cenemy\u201d German? He replied with incredulity: John had always had a cheeky sparkle in his eye and everyone always knew he would be OK. This sparkle would later serve John well, when he began a&#xa0;flirtation with Marlene, an Auschwitz survivor, also from northern Germany, on his daily commute from Belsize Park tube station. They would marry, have two children and seven grandchildren.</p> <p>To me, this photograph encapsulates the resilience and optimism of childhood. Now 86 and a little frail, John still retains that sparkle. Perhaps the photo may offer some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/may/19/kindertransport-survivors-todays-child-refugees-nicholas-winton\" title=\"\">resonance with the current refugee crisis</a> in terms of the hope and rewards offered by doing the right thing.</p> <p><em>Danny Altmann</em></p> <h2>Playlist: Singing in the supermarket at three</h2> <p><strong>There\u2019s a Kind of Hush by Herman\u2019s&#xa0;Hermits</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cSo listen very carefully / Closer now and you will see what I mean / It isn\u2019t a&#xa0;dream\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKwSGovRACk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKwSGovRACk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>My mother has a different version of this story.

  "<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, my great-great-great-grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.winchesterguns.com/news/articles/150-years-of-winchester.html\">Oliver Winchester,</a> founded the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in New Haven, Connecticut. His pride and joy was the revolutionary Winchester repeating rifle, one of the first guns to fire rounds repeatedly, taking away the cumbersome need to stop and reload. The Winchester became an icon of the American frontier \u2013 used by cowboys, Native Americans, outlaws, sheriffs and even President Theodore Roosevelt. As the settlers went steadily westwards after the civil war, the Winchester was their weapon of choice \u2013 it became known as the Gun that Won the West, celebrated in celluloid numerous times by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu0h3GRBQ-U\">gun-toting John Wayne</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D5_0cMzFVw\">youthful Jimmy Stewart</a>.</p> <p>Used by the Turks in their 19th-century battles against the Russians, and by the Mexicans in their uprising against the French-backed emperor, the Winchester became known around the world. The company\u2019s officials were always wary of having a history of their beloved rifles written \u2013 we don\u2019t want dead buffalo and Indians on every page, observed my great-great-uncle Ed Pugsley, the chief engineer.</p> <p>My introduction to the Winchester came on a hot August afternoon in 1987, more than a century after Oliver Winchester had started manufacturing his rifles. Visiting my American relatives in Connecticut, we fired tennis balls from an adapted elephant gun into the sparkling waters of the Long Island Sound, just for the fun of it. My great-aunts, legend has it, would fire the tennis-balls at intruders who ventured too close to their family compound.</p> <p>We were having a high old time at the family compound in Branford, Connecticut, which had been built by Oliver\u2019s daughter Jennie and her husband, Thomas Gray Bennett. As a distant family member from London, I had a dim idea of what the Winchester repeating rifle was, having watched a healthy dose of westerns on TV during my early 70s childhood. And as a former air cadet in east London, I learned to fire a .22 rifle and a .303 \u2013 but always on a shooting range, in a highly restricted environment. And here were my relatives merrily shooting tennis balls into the blue yonder, with guns inside their summer houses \u2013 it was an introduction to the gun culture of America, so very different from that back home in Britain.</p> <p>My grandmother Molly, who inherited a not-inconsiderable sum of money as the great-granddaughter of Oliver, married an Englishman and left her family in New England for Cambridge, England. She was ambivalent about the legacy of the Winchester, and would occasionally grunt disapprovingly about gun money, shaking her head. As a child, she took me to CND rallies in Cambridge, and we watched deeply alarming videos about Hiroshima. A strange juxtaposition, the gun heiress turned fervent supporter of nuclear disarmament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34cd9f3515177bad84afe0db1047cd4feae96ce9/768_141_2127_2741/776.jpg\" alt=\"Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Native Americans carrying Winchester rifles, 1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CS Fly/Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That visit to my American clan stayed with me as I went off to university. I began to read all I could about Oliver Winchester and his rifles. He was born a penniless farm boy, trained as a carpenter building flying buttresses in churches, successfully patented a bestselling shirt collar, and then decided to invest his considerable cash in guns just as the US civil war was looming. When my husband and I moved with our sons across the Atlantic in 2004, my interest in all matters Winchester increased. We bought the caretaker\u2019s cottage on the family\u2019s summer estate of Johnson\u2019s Point in Connecticut, and the idea of writing a book about these mysterious descendants of yesteryear evolved.</p> <p>As I was learning about my Winchester heritage, I was reporting for the BBC on the phenomenon of mass shootings in America. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/sandy-hook-classroom-massacre\">Sandy Hook elementary school massacre</a> in 2012, when a gunman killed 20 young children, six adults, his mother and himself, I arrived to witness a scene of unbearable agony. In this picture-perfect Connecticut town, not far from where Winchester built his repeating rifles, Christmas trees had been put up in memory of every dead child. I stood outside the temporary mortuary where the bodies of the murdered six- and seven-year-olds lay, and wept, imagining how I would feel if my own six-year-old was inside.</p> <p>At school, my children learned what they called \u201chuddle drills\u201d \u2013 what to do if someone is having a really bad day, as my then seven-year-old son explained brightly. I told him reassuringly that I didn\u2019t feel that he would ever have to do a huddle drill for real. In the wake of Sandy Hook, Congress failed to pass even modest gun-control legislation, such as ensuring background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows.</p> <p>As the descendant of a dynasty created by manufacturing weapons of war, writing a book has forced me to examine my own feelings on the topic. One of our relatives, Sarah Winchester, was supposedly so racked with guilt and haunted by the spirits of those killed by the Winchester that she started building a house in California because a medium advised her that endless building would appease the dead. Construction only stopped when she died. Thousands flock every year to the bizarre <a href=\"http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/\">Winchester Mystery House</a>, pulled in by the irresistible tale of guns and guilt. There is scant truth to the myth \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.</p> <p>I am fascinated by the Winchester legacy, but I don\u2019t feel responsible for or guilty about the past. I see our family as a thread in the tapestry of America\u2019s history. There is no airbrushing over the brutality of the settling of America\u2019s west, in which guns were central. The Winchester was deployed to kill Native Americans defending their historic lands \u2013 and yet they also used the rifle with devastating effect, most notably at General Custer\u2019s last stand. African Americans also embraced the Winchester as a defensive weapon in the bloody period after the civil war, in which lynching was common. \u201cA Winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home,\u201d as the civil rights crusader Ida B Wells wrote in 1892. And so the Winchester was used for many different causes during a violent period.</p> <p>As a soon-to-be dual US and British citizen, it is hard not to be struck by the starkly different approaches to gun control. When I was growing up in Britain, strict gun laws were passed in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/20/archive-1987-hungerford-massacre-michael-ryan\">Hungerford massacre in 1987</a> and then additional legislation was passed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\">Dunblane school killings</a>. In the US, where the second amendment provides a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the debate is very different. Although opinion polls suggest the public supports controls on the sale of assault weapons and background checks for everyone who buys a gun, the National Rifle Association has so far lobbied successfully against these measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad57078c08d9b254474d66f16c42f4bde14d86ec/0_0_2693_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trevelyan\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, left, with his grandson, baby Thomas Gray Bennett, and his son Winchester Bennett, c1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Laura Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hillary Clinton is running in favour of what she calls commonsense gun control, while Donald Trump is staunchly against her proposals. Why such different approaches in two countries sharing a common language and heritage? Guns were embedded in the culture of America at the time of its violent revolutionary war against England, and used to expand the territory of the new nation.</p> <p>When the question of gun control in the US came up in the 1970s, the surviving Winchester relatives were staunchly opposed. But then they had never been fans of Uncle Sam having a say in their business. In the 1890s, when men at the Winchester factory were regularly blown up as they mixed the explosive primer used in the ammunition, my great-great-grandfather, Thomas Gray Bennett, perfected a system where the men mixed the primer using mirrors to keep themselves at a safe distance. He was most pleased to have kept meddling factory inspectors at bay through his own ingenuity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/25/kids-guns-and-the-american-way\">Kids, guns and the American way</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, it was heavy-handed government-administered contracts that led to the end of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company as a family concern. When the first world war loomed into view, my great-grandfather, Winchester Bennett, was at the company helm. A highly strung man, he had suffered from nervous anxiety for much of his adult life and was nursed throughout by his devoted wife, Susan. Winchester, named after the gun, was not equipped to deal with the rigours of wartime production and had to leave the company just as the factory was gearing up to produce millions of rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of rifles for the allied wartime effort. Bennett was later treated for addiction at a Connecticut facility specialising in patients with psychiatric disorders.</p> <p>His father, Thomas Gray Bennett, though he was nearly 80, came back on to the company board at this time of personal and professional crisis. Thomas Bennett never approved of doing business with the US government, which insisted on fixed-price contracts. As the costs of labour and materials skyrocketed because of wartime demand, Winchester made less and less money. By the time the war ended, the company was millions of dollars in debt. A wild plan to diversify into selling products \u201cas good as the gun\u201d followed, and the company used the excess factory space left over from the war to manufacture ice-skates, penknives, fishing rods, washing machines, cutlery and all manner of household items. The scheme was a monumental failure and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company went into receivership in 1931.</p> <p>A special summer home is the legacy of the company for our generation. As I rake the beach for oyster shells, if I narrow my eyes I can conjure up the image of a cowboy out west galloping on his horse, his trusty Winchester at his side. The great-aunts have passed on now, but I can still hear the echo of their laughter as they fire the tennis-ball gun out into Long Island Sound.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Winchester: Legend of the West by Laura Trevelyan is published by IB Tauris, \u00a320.

  "<p>Fig trees can be found in many places in the world, their bright-green, fleur-de lis-shaped leaves providing a welcome dappled shade. In Britain, they grow abundantly, but seldom bear much fruit unless enclosed in a walled garden. The leaves, however, are exactly what I\u2019m after. In California, we wrap the large leaves around freshly caught fish to be grilled on an open fire or baked in the oven. In the sweet kitchen, we gently wash the leaves of any dusty pollen and dunk them into pots of cream or milk to infuse and turn into custards and ice-creams.</p> <p>The flavour of the fig leaf is difficult to describe \u2013 it is somewhere between a fig and a coconut. Its fragrance is heady and a little surprising. For me, it\u2019s best kept simple \u2013 a burnt-sugar shell suits it well in the creme brulee below.</p> <p>Texture, as well as flavour, is what makes a well-balanced dessert, and here, the crunch of the bruleed top accentuates the silky set cream inside. You can add another layer of texture by serving it with a cookie \u2013 or my favourite buckwheat shortbread below. Buckwheat flour is, despite its name, wheat- and gluten-free. It is a relative of rhubarb, and in many countries the whole groats are toasted and cooked like a delicious, fragrant rice. Milled, it is a tasty alternative grain flour. Buckwheat\u2019s earthy flavour makes it a good match for a custard flavoured with herbs or other botanicals.</p> <h2><strong>Fig leaf creme brulee (main picture)<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br>6 fig leaves<br>180g single cream<br>360g double cream <br>180g milk<br>150g caster sugar<br>9 egg yolks<br>A pinch of salt<br>6 tbsp caster sugar, for the topping</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/08/baked-pear-crisps-recipes-pear-eves-pudding-claire-ptak-baking-the-seasons\">Claire Ptak\u2019s recipe for baked pear crisps and pear eve\u2019s pudding | Baking the seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>1</strong> Heat the grill of your oven and lay the fig leaves out flat on a baking tray.

  "<p>A lemongrass bush isn\u2019t much to look at: an oversized tuft of grass with long waxy leaves shooting out and drooping down in every direction. But if I came across one in a field somewhere, I\u2019d be grinning my way back to the kitchen. That unruly mop of tropical green comes with white stalks and the brightest of flavours. It sits somewhere between mint and fresh air, citrus and sunlight. It\u2019s steeped in hot water for tea from Togo to Mexico; it loves coconut, chilli and ginger in all manner of curries, but is no stranger to sweet creams and bakes. It\u2019s the herb you simply don\u2019t get used to: the one that\u2019s impossible to substitute and will surprise you every time.
