Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. </p> <p>But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright.<br></p> <p>Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen....<br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-election-turnout-latino-vote\">Clinton campaign buoyed by high Latino turnout in election's final hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning with more market action.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher.

  "<h2>The Clinton Crush</h2> <p>In which Donald Trump loses every state with even a hint of Democratic flavor and drops a few big Republican ones too \u2013 the fantasy scenario for every American who yearns for his/her sense of shock and offense at Trump\u2019s candidacy to be reflected in the electoral result. </p> <p>Trump not only loses the big battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, he hemorrhages support everywhere, losing Iowa, losing Colorado, and then \u2013 in the stroke that places the election among the all-time routs \u2013 losing in states where Republicans have simply never lost in the modern era. African American voters in Georgia turn out in Obama-era numbers to defeat him; Hispanic voters do the same in Arizona. In Texas, second- and third-generation Mexican immigrants unite with educated white voters, including a lot of moderate Republicans, to deliver the first Democratic presidential victory in the Lone Star state since Watergate. </p> <p>Clinton even beats Trump in Utah, where pious Mormon voters decide at the moment of truth that no, they cannot vote for a candidate who wants to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. Republican leaders get on TV the day after the election and declare that the nomination of Trump was a historic mistake. Thousands of words are spilled haranguing Republicans for nominating a candidate whose appeal to the base may have been strong but who obviously was not a serious contender to lead so great and diverse a nation.

As the night grows late, Trump realizes that he has lost Nevada and Colorado, owing to a strong Hispanic vote against him both places. He has lost Virginia because there are too many people in the DC suburbs who have some actual experience of the federal government and who are horrified to their teeth at the idea of his taking the White House. Surprisingly strong turnout among Trump supporters in the white working-class communities of Pennsylvania has failed to push Trump over the Democratic wall of Philadelphia and its suburbs. But Trump has performed strongly all night in the battleground states that count, winning Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. </p> <p>And then, luck strikes: Trump picks up a single electoral vote in northern, rural Maine, one of two states that split their electoral votes. Finally, against all odds and the predictions of most polls, he pulls off an upset win in Wisconsin, which has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988, but which is more homogeneously white than its neighboring states, where Hillary Clinton ends up having failed to inspire African American voters in Milwaukee to turn up on election day, and where Republican governor Scott Walker\u2019s political machine has once again succeeded.

The people who were supposed to vote for her are voting for her \u2013 women, nonwhite voters, educated white voters \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason she won\u2019t win.

First, the independent voters of New Hampshire have responded to Trump\u2019s late-race momentum, and concluded that no, they\u2019d really rather not have a Clinton dynasty in American politics. They give Trump four electoral votes. Then Trump wins North Carolina, where there admittedly are plenty of white Republican voters, where Republican efforts to quash voting have succeeded and, let\u2019s be honest, if Barack Obama lost it in 2012, how was Hillary Clinton supposed to win it? </p> <p>It gets really white-knuckle, however, when the Colorado result comes in. A large share of voters in Denver\u2019s suburbs are registered independents, and maybe they\u2019ve had the same kind of feeling New Hampshirites have had: enough with the Clintons. So Clinton stalls out at 266 electoral votes. Trump gets to 243. And all eyes are on Florida. Nonwhite voters in Miami haven\u2019t turned up at the polls as they might have. Meanwhile, turnout among white voters in retirement communities has proven absolutely crushing. The Puerto Rican vote around Orlando seems to have failed to materialize. And they\u2019re still counting Tampa and St Petersburg. Then final results in Broward County, where Obama won by more than 260,000 votes in 2012, come in, and the state is clearly Clinton\u2019s. Trump cries foul but nobody can hear him through the cacophony of popping corks.

The election turns out to be close \u2013 closer than anyone would have thought. Maybe Trump wins New Hampshire and makes a sweep of the other battleground states, save Colorado, to produce a 269-269 electoral vote tie. Or maybe Florida, which even in the relatively placid year of 2012 took four days to report its election result, comes down to a razor-thin margin like the one that separated Al Gore and George Bush in 2000, resulting in recounts, fights over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-lieberman-put-democrats-in-retreat-on-military-vote.html\">absentee ballot postmarks</a>, a refusal to concede on either side and, ultimately, the mother of all legal battles. </p> <p>The 2016 election cycle has proven its ability to soar beyond the human imagination, and surely no mere mortal can comprehend how hairy things could get. The most horrible scenarios appear to lie down the path of an electoral tie. What happens then? Nobody really knows. While the constitution prescribes that Congress shall step in to resolve such a tie, and while <a href=\"http://www.leinsdorf.com/House.htm\">a couple of early 19th-century elections</a> were close enough for Congress to get involved, there really are no applicable precedents. Since presidents are technically chosen by electors who meet to cast formal votes in December, it is conceivable that a so-called \u201cfaithless elector\u201d might break a tie in favor of, say, Clinton, by going against the will of his or her state\u2019s voters. But then Congress must formally count the ballots in January, and if but one senator and one representative disagree with the result, each chamber must vote on the validity of the count. You see where this is going. This is a Congress that cannot so much as tie its shoes, much less leap constitutional hurdles. </p> <p>Would a result ever emerge on the other side? Would the supreme court get involved, again? (When they\u2019re still one justice down? What if they tied, too?) Who would ultimately prove more litigious, Trump or the Clintons? Eesh. Some bridges are better left uncrossed until necessary. Final tally: pass the Scotch. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e459878d2c40f95f315a274eda07c9ad86ac68b1/0_0_1290_1090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Electoral scenario map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"845\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>The Make America Great Again</h2> <p>Britain Brexited. The Cubs won the World Series. And guess what? These things happen in threes. It\u2019s 2016. The age you thought you were living in is yesterday. This is the age of reality television, the era of entertainment uber alles, the time of Trump. And any fool not foolishly attached to her or his notions of the false-glorious yesterday could see it coming. American voters unbothered by the worst of what Trump had to say simply voted for him. But millions of additional voters \u2013 suburban moms, second-generation immigrants who have already paid their dues, Republicans who came to their senses, and men everywhere \u2013 found that when they stepped into the polling booth, they either couldn\u2019t check the box for a relic of America\u2019s political past \u2013 a woman, no less \u2013 or they weren\u2019t as bothered by Trump\u2019s words, and by the actions of his supporters, as they thought. After all, he\u2019s not serious about wanting to deport millions of American residents, just as he wasn\u2019t serious when he said what he did about women, wasn\u2019t serious when he impugned American democracy, wasn\u2019t serious when he said Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were terrorists, wasn\u2019t serious when he called for a nuclear Saudi Arabia and wasn\u2019t serious when he said journalists should be silenced and when he said, over and over, that Hillary Clinton should be in prison. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s big night begins in New Hampshire, continues shortly thereafter in Virginia and North Carolina, rolls through Iowa and Ohio and then \u2013 earlier than anyone could have thought \u2013 through Florida, where he maintains a second home. Nobody can believe it when Trump wins Pennsylvania \u2013 it turns out that African American voters in Philadelphia stayed home, and a surprising number of centrists in the Philly suburbs decided that no candidate who loved golf so much could be so bad. Trump wins Colorado, maybe misses in Nevada and misses in the upper midwest \u2013 but by then he\u2019s over 300 electoral votes, so who cares? Hang the White House with a big gold T, and brace yourselves for whatever may be.

But I think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the judgment we get from the supreme court, full stop.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davis rejected calls from several MPs for the government to hold a vote on triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment.</strong> It was right to wait until the supreme court issued its decision, he said. But he told the Conservative <strong>Nicky Morgan</strong> that, although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a one-line article 50 bill, he was \u201cvery tempted\u201d by the idea. And when <strong>Peter Bone</strong>, a Conservative, said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article 50, Davis said that the government was not proposing that, but that the Commons itself could decide to have a vote. He also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally, not least because they cover decisions like going to war.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article 50, the supreme court ruling could say something different.</strong> He was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article 50, or whether just passing a resolution (a quicker, easier process) would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He defended the independence of the judiciary, although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of pillars of our democracy, one of them is the independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for centuries, and one of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after centuries.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said some of the online trolls who have attacked Gina Miller, the woman who brought the article 50 case, should be prosecuted.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me comment on the issue of Gina Miller.

In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire, he used much of the same language that he did in his Today interview (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/07/labour-wants-brexit-plan-but-will-not-block-artice-50-outright-starmer-says-politics-live?page=with:block-58203b7de4b029b92ca46369#block-58203b7de4b029b92ca46369\">9.26am)</a> but he also went marginally further in saying that Labour would not block the triggering of article 50. He told the programme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted the mandate. There was a clear mandate on 23 June to leave the EU. Article 50 triggers that process, and therefore we are not going to frustrate that. But we are going to argue very loudly and very strongly for the government to disclose its plan so that we can debate it and try to reach agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if there were any circumstances in which Labour would vote against triggering article 50, he replied: \u201cWe are not going to frustrate the process.\u201d Was that a no, he was asked. \u201cYes\u201d, he replied.</p> <p>But he also confirmed that Labour might try to amend the legislation allowing the government to trigger article 50.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it is legislation, then of course there might be amendments put down.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he gave some indication as to what those amendments might cover. This is what he said when asked about possible amendments.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are clear that we need the fullest possible access to the single market, that we should be in the customs union, and that there should be special arrangements for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because, in two respects, it goes further than <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-gives-theresa-ultimatum-9204393\">by Jeremy Corbyn in his Sunday Mirror interview</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">by Tom Watson in his Radio 5 Live interview yesterday.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer says Labour wants UK to stay in customs union.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says the Brexit deal should include special arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Starmer\u2019s comments about not blocking an article 50 bill imply that, if Labour\u2019s amendments on, for example, the customs union were voted down by the government, it would not vote against the bill as a whole at third reading.<br></p> <p>But his words are also an open invitation to Tory MPs who favour a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit to vote with Labour in favour, for example, of an amendment saying that staying in the customs union should be a priority.</p> <p>Starmer also said in his interview that Labour accepted that the Brexit talks would have to involve some curbs on freedom of movement. But he suggesting that protecting the economy was more important than controlling immigration.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I accept also that freedom of movement, and changes to the way freedom of movement rules operate, have to be part of the negotiation. What I want is for the government to aim high, to put the economy and jobs first, of course to negotiate on freedom of movement, and get the best possible outcome. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer suggests protecting the economy more important than curbing immigration in Brexit talks.</strong></li> </ul> <p>This is significant because over the summer Theresa May indicated that, for her, controlling immigration was the number one Brexit priority (although recent comments from the government, perhaps influenced by the economic impact assessments ministers have been reading, suggest that business interests are increasingly seen as pre-eminent.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd7e2c3f499693301a553e9de0deb1a475d7b35/59_0_707_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58205dfbe4b029b92ca463d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T10:57:17.267Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are two statements in the Commons this afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourwhips/status/795576345162027009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2 statements from 3.30pm - your guess is as good as ours on actual titles 1.

He has identified three.</p> <p>First, the UK government should have been more ambitious.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First: we under-bid. In fact, though we had plenty of media and party political tactics, we went into the talks without a sufficiently clear strategy for change in Europe. Cameron\u2019s brilliant 2013 Bloomberg speech \u2013 envisioning sweeping EU reform (but not mentioning immigration ironically) \u2013 was incrementally distilled down to a less ambitious opening bid in the renegotiation. Even some European leaders suggested more ambition. As one diplomat put it, \u201cIn Europe, we ask for 10 things in order to get 6, you ask for 4 things to get 4. Why?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Second, the politicians gave officials too much power.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The second mistake: we outsourced political decisions to UK and EU civil servants, who, naturally, are more cautious about what\u2019s achievable. Between June and mid-autumn 2015, the most substantive discussions were conducted between officials from the UK, European Commission and European Council. These \u201ctechnical talks\u201d were meant to be purely legal but were in reality at least in part political, with options effectively being taken off the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, third, the government ran out of time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The third mistake: we got timed out. European partners knew we were very unlikely to walk away from the table at the EU summit in February this year as that would kill a June vote. That self-imposed deadline hurt our leverage.</p> <p>The two year time-table contained in Article 50 is, arguably, the government\u2019s biggest challenge in achieving a successful Brexit. Control over the clock equals leverage. The government should jump at any opportunity to build in more time.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is his conclusion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there is one rule for a Conservative prime minister in EU talks it\u2019s probably that you can get more than your civil servants claim, but less than your backbenchers think.

The article was headlined \u201cJeremy Corbyn gives Theresa May ultimatum: Agree to Labour\u2019s Brexit terms or I\u2019ll force election in spring\u201d, although Corbyn\u2019s own quotes did not put it as starkly as that.</p> <p>Then yesterday <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-position-tom-watson-article-50-brexit-a7400976.html\">Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, seemed to give a different messsage when he appeared on Radio 5 Live. </a>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hold this up. The British people have spoken and article 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>This morning Starmer was on the Today programme. Broadly he was taking the Watson view, saying at least twice that Labour would \u201cnot frustrate the [article 50] process\u201d. But he also said four times that Labour would \u201cnot simply vote down article 50\u201d, implying its support for article 50 was conditional, and that it would only back triggering article 50 if the government gave certain assurances.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we must have discussions about [the terms of Brexit]. We can\u2019t have a vote in a vacuum. And we can\u2019t proceed with this approach where the prime minister says I hold all the cards for the future of the UK in Europe, and its relationship with Europe, and indeed the world, and I\u2019m not going to disclose even the basic terms to parliament. So of course we need that discussion.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when Starmer was pressed on this, he did at one point say Labour would \u201cnot vote down article 50\u201d without including the word \u201csimply\u201d. He also said Labour would not vote down article 50 \u201ccome what may\u201d (ie, under any circumstances).</p> <p>He said Labour wanted the government to set out its plans for Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to have the plan before parliament. That needs to be subject to scrutiny ... This is the future of all of us, and the future of our children. We should be proceeding on the basis of a consensus across parliament, not forced divisions. </p> </blockquote> <p>But he left it unclear what Labour might do if the government failed to proved it with the assurances it is seeking. He ruled out blocking article 50 completely, but he did not rule out using the legislation that will have to go through parliament (assuming the government loses its case in the supreme court) to attach some sort of conditions to article 50 approval.</p> <p>I will be covering any reaction to his interview that comes in.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>1.45pm:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, visits the University of Sheffield, where she will later deliver a lecture on \u201cScotland and the UK: economic policy after the EU referendum\u201d.</p> <p><em>3.30pm: </em>David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is expected to give a Commons statement about the high court ruling last week saying parliament must be consulted on triggering article 50.</p> <p><em>Around 4.30pm: </em>MPs are due to begin a debate on exiting the EU and workers\u2019 rights, the first of several debates being scheduled by the government ahead of article 50 being invoked.

  "<p>Janet Reno, who has died aged 78, was the first woman attorney general of the US. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1991, she served throughout his two terms of office, the second longest tenure in American history. It made her a figure of stability in a cabinet often in flux and frequently rocked by the steady stream of partisan attacks on both President Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Clinton, most notably the Whitewater investigation.</p> <p>Never part of Clinton\u2019s inner circle, Reno displayed great independence, and her courage to stand behind decisions she felt were right often left her vulnerable to critics from both sides of the political fence. Her controversial decisions included the assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas; the return of the six-year-old Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez to Cuba; the anti-monopoly prosecution of Microsoft and a racketeering lawsuit against the tobacco industry to recover the healthcare costs of treating smokers. Each time she would stand behind her actions publicly, often quoting Harry Truman\u2019s \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Miami, she was the daughter of two of the city\u2019s journalists. Her father, born Henry Rasmussen, came to the US as a child from Denmark; his parents reportedly chose the more American name Reno from a map. He worked as a crime reporter on the Miami Herald for 43 years. Her mother, Jane Wood, was a reporter on the Miami News, and a naturalist famed locally for wrestling alligators. When Janet was eight and she and her three siblings moved to a home on the edge of the Everglades, her mother built their new house herself.</p> <p>Janet was debate champion at Coral Gables high school and left Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in chemistry; commentators sometimes noted her almost scientific approach to both the law and to the facts of a case. She graduated from Harvard law school in 1963, one of only 16 women in her class, but when she returned to Miami she was turned down by the city\u2019s most prestigious firm, Steel Hector &amp; Davis. After opening her own firm, in 1971 she was appointed counsel to the Florida state house of representatives\u2019 judicial committee and, in 1972, she lost in a race for a state house seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54261e91884b88f036ea4a1a34c0150089e44f7c/0_26_1005_603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janet Reno with Bill Clinton as she is named the new attorney general during a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she was offered a job by R<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/us/richard-e-gerstein-dead-at-68-prosecuted-key-watergate-figure.html\">ichard Gerstein</a>, the state attorney for Dade County, which includes Miami. She informed Gerstein that her father thought he was a crook; he replied that that was why she had been offered the job. Although she left the office briefly in 1976, when offered a partnership by the same firm who had rejected her 13 years earlier, she returned, and when Gerstein retired she was appointed to his job, a difficult one given Miami\u2019s high crime rate and racial conflicts.</p> <p>She prosecuted a number of high-profile child abuse cases where doubts over convictions led to changes in the ways such cases were handled. Most tellingly, she brought charges against five white policemen for beating a black insurance salesman to death. Their acquittal in 1980 (by a judge and jury in Tampa) sparked rioting in Miami during which 18 people died. Reno resisted calls for her resignation, instead working for improved relations with the black community.</p> <p>Bill Clinton offered Reno the attorney general\u2019s post after his first two choices, Zo\u00eb Baird and Kimba Wood, both withdrew because they had hired undocumented immigrants as nannies.</p> <p>Before she had taken office in 1993, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-david-koresh-1457125.html\">David Koresh</a> and his Branch Davidian sect of the Seventh Day Adventist church began a showdown against federal agents seeking to search their Waco compound for illegal weapons. Ten people, including four agents from the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were killed when they tried to serve a warrant in Feburary. In April, Reno ordered a full-scale assault on the compound in which Koresh and 75 other people, many of them children, died. She was criticised fiercely by the right, for murdering American \u201cpatriots\u201d, and by the left for claiming she feared children were being abused by the Davidians. Reno took full responsibility; in 2004 she said that \u201cthe tragedy is we will never know what was the right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>In 1994 Reno appointed a special prosecutor, the Republican <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/us/man-in-the-news-aggressive-prosecutor-robert-bishop-fiske-jr.html\">Robert B Fiske</a>, to investigate the Clintons\u2019 real estate deal known as Whitewater, but Fiske was viewed by the right as too bipartisan, and Congress empowered an independent counsel, George HW Bush\u2019s former solicitor general <a href=\"http://\">Kenneth Starr</a>, to replace him. Starr\u2019s investigations ran for five years, resulting in the impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton for lying about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. In the middle of Whitewater, Reno refused to appoint another prosecutor to investigate the Clintons\u2019 campaign financing, saying the was no evidence to justify such calls.</p> <p>Her efforts against Big Tobacco ran head on into powerful voices in Congress funded by the industry in the states they represented. In 1998 she pursued the suit against Microsoft despite critics who claimed the issues were \u201ctoo complicated\u201d for juries to understand.</p> <p>But her political legacy was again sealed by a raid, in the case of Gonz\u00e1lez, the Cuban boy found in an inner tube off the coast of Florida after his mother was one of 10 people who drowned when the small boat in which they left Cuba sank. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s relatives in Miami refused to send him back to his father (from whom his mother was divorced) in Cuba. The boy, who later said he had wanted to return, became a political football, until the family refused to follow a court order, and Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on their house in which Eli\u00e1n was seized and returned to his father. The attorney general who believed so strongly in the facts and the law was again left with no option but the use of governmental force.</p> <p>Over six feet tall and resolutely lacking glamour, Reno was a figure of cruel abuse on rightwing talk radio, and a somewhat gentler satire on Saturday Night Live, where Will Ferrell\u2019s skits of \u201cJanet Reno\u2019s Dance Party\u201d were a running gag. After leaving office in 2001, Reno showed a more relaxed side to her character by appearing on the show alongside Ferrell.</p> <p>In 2002, Reno mounted a challenge to Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Jeb Bush, but she lost the Democratic primary to Bill McBride.</p> <p>Reno had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 1995. In later years she served on numerous boards, including that of The Innocence Project, and devoted herself to her extended family.</p> <p>She is survived by her sister Maggy. Loretta Lynch, the second woman to serve as US attorney general praised Reno, saying \u201cShe was guided by one simple test, to do what the law and the facts required... regardless of which way the political winds were blowing.\u201d</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 Janet Wood Reno, lawyer, born 21 July 1938; died 7 November 2016</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May came to India for her first bilateral meeting outside of Europe arguing that she wanted to lay the groundwork for a significant post-Brexit trade deal.</p> <p>India, with its historic and cultural ties to Britain, is exactly the sort of country that \u201chello world\u201d Brexiters claimed the UK could do business with after leaving the European Union. It\u2019s important to note, however, that the whole of the EU was unable to secure a similar agreement with this Asian giant. </p> <p>Why? There were a number of stumbling blocks when it came to access into markets, but one important factor was unquestionably linked to migration. India wanted more of its skilled professionals to be able to enter EU countries on six-month visas. </p> <p>Vince Cable, who was the Liberal Democrat business secretary in the coalition, said May was unwilling to budge on the issue while at the Home Office. But given that leave campaigners suggested Commonwealth nationals could get a better deal on migration after leaving the EU, could May have changed her mind? </p> <p>The signs in India suggest not. On the way over to the trade summit, May argued that the visa system for Indian nationals was sufficient, saying this was a more generous deal than for Americans, Chinese and Australians. The clear implication was there would be no increase in numbers. </p> <p>And her language in the statement after a bilateral meeting with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, calling for help to return Indians who had no right to remain in Britain, felt like an uncompromising stance on migration. Even May\u2019s offer to consider a more liberal visa regime was all about process (the application system, and getting through British airports) rather than in any way linked to the criteria applied to cases. </p> <p>The registered traveller scheme was similarly about experience rather than the numbers of people able to come. All of which may be an understandable political position in the face of unrest about immigration in the UK. May thinks British voters aren\u2019t ready to see a wave of new migration from non-EU countries, never mind what Brexit campaigners promised in the referendum.</p> <p>But it leaves Britain in a difficult position when it comes to the possibility of a future trade relationship with a country such as India. Already there is anger in India over a decision last week to toughen up the requirements for IT workers coming to Britain. </p> <p>A decision to bring in a higher salary threshold for those workers barely made the papers in the UK but was headline news in India. And before that there was unease over a decision to limit how long graduates can remain in Britain, in a move that caused a significant cut in the number of Indian students in the UK. </p> <p>After May\u2019s comments on returning Indians who \u201chave no right\u201d to remain in Britain, Indian journalists huddled together comparing notes, asking whether she had really used those words. They found the language startling, with one \u2013 Priyanka Tikoo, editor and bureau chief of the Press Trust of India \u2013 saying it felt as though May wanted India to hand over trade liberalisation in return for little else. She said the Delhi press pack had expected to hear something warmer, and were surprised by what felt like a somewhat hostile tone. </p> <p>Downing Street pointed out that the idea of supporting Britain on returns was an issue agreed between both governments, and said India had been happy to sign up. Delhi had also welcomed other moves to make the visa process easier. </p> <p>No 10 also argued that trade deals were far more complex than a simple trade-off between economic access and migration, with India also seeking assurances over services, technology and skills sharing. </p> <p>But the backlash from some business voices over the issue underlined the complexity of the task ahead. India would love to sign up to a trade agreement with the UK, but only if it is in its economic and social interest. Like the EU example before, the challenges facing Britain in India underline the mountain May has to climb as she attempts to reach the opportunities of a post-Brexit world. Free movement in return for trade isn\u2019t a concept that is limited to the European project that British voters rejected in June. <br></p>",

  "<p><strong></strong>All eyes are on the race to be the next US president, but the battle to control Congress may be almost as consequential.</p> <p>The next Congress could determine whether the supreme court goes back to having nine justices, whether the USA makes good on its climate promises and whether, for example, Hillary Clinton is impeached, should she be elected president.</p> <p>If the Senate and the House stay Republican and Donald Trump wins the presidency, he would not necessarily have carte blanche. As much as Trump may want to build a border wall with Mexico, he would not be able to spend the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/11/trumps-dubious-claim-that-his-border-wall-would-cost-8-billion/\">estimated $25bn</a> it would cost until Congress legislated for it.

It\u2019s unclear whether the GOP would back him on these issues. But a quick agreement on issues such as repealing the estate tax and Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law might well be in the cards.<br></p> <p>It is extremely unlikely that the Democrats will seize control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, owing to an overwhelming, 60-seat Republican majority in the lower chamber.</p> <p>Artful gerrymandering at the state level means there aren\u2019t many toss-up House races this cycle \u2013 only 18 out of 435, according to the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">Cook Political report</a>. Democrats could win every single one of the toss ups and still fall around eight seats short of a House majority. </p> <p>But the Senate is a different matter, with most analysts putting the Democrats\u2019 chances of overcoming the GOP\u2019s current eight-seat majority and taking the upper chamber at about even. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically 50-50,\u201d Harry Enten, a polling analyst with FiveThirtyEight, told CNN on Sunday. \u201cYou have in my opinion maybe six or seven seats that are going to really determine this.\u201d</p> <p>If Democrats controlled the senate, and Clinton were president, the supreme court vacancy could soon be filled \u2013 although Republicans have already hinted at a procedural fight to stop that from happening. </p> <p>As with every aspect of the 2016 election cycle, Trump\u2019s presence is palpable. Some Republican incumbents appear to have been wounded by associations with the GOP nominee. Senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire saw her numbers drop after she was asked at a debate whether Trump would be a good role model for children, and replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d.<br></p> <p>If Nevada representative Joe Heck loses his senate bid, analysts will point to the record number of Hispanic voters who lined up in the state to cast early ballots for Clinton (and against Trump). Senator Richard Burr in North Carolina may fall victim to the abandonment of Trump by moderate Republicans in his state.<br></p> <p>In other races, there is no perceivable Trump drag \u2013 and there may be Trump coattails. In Ohio, where Trump and Clinton appear to be neck-and-neck, Republican incumbent Rob Portman is polling 16 points ahead of his opponent, a former governor. And in Missouri, where Trump appears to be crushing Clinton, Republican incumbent Roy Blunt is in a seemingly tight race with the Democratic state secretary of state. In Pennsylvania, incumbent Pat Toomey appears to be running behind his opponent, but not as far behind Clinton as Trump is running in the state.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult to understand exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Enten said.<br></p> <h2>Races to watch</h2> <p><strong>New York\u2019s 19th congressional district:</strong> Big outside money is trying to block progressive star Zephyr Teachout from making it to Washington.

Some understood the danger he represented, seeing in him a would-be dictator \u2013 \u201cI alone can fix this!\u201d \u2013 whose contempt for basic democratic norms, from the importance of a free press to the need to respect the outcome of a democratic election, suggested a lurch towards fascism. That small handful will be remembered with admiration. But, whatever the outcome today, historians of the American republic will judge harshly those who did not stop Trump when they could. It will damn those who indulged, pampered and enabled him to reach this moment: where polls still show him with a path, albeit narrow, to the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33d2b1067022f23ef7329880d8efacb4e8ace0bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d2b1067022f23ef7329880d8efacb4e8ace0bd/0_116_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeb Bush was among the Republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with Bush.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeb Bush was among the Republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First in this roll-call of shame is the Republican party. Among those hanging their heads should be the 16 rival candidates who allowed themselves to be steamrollered by a reality TV host and serially bankrupted businessman. Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and the others had no idea how to deal with Trump. They collectively made a strategic error by failing to realise their primary task was to take him out. Instead, they fought each other, each hoping to emerge as the sole, anti-Trump candidate around whom Republicans would unite. That proved a delusion.</p> <p>As Trump\u2019s poll lead increased in late 2015 and early 2016, his rivals grew ever more frightened of taking a shot at him, anxious that they might alienate his supporters or, worse, that he might train his fire back on them. So while, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/07/republican-debate-new-hampshire-marco-rubio-chris-christie-donald-trump-ted-cruz\">Chris Christie mocked Rubio</a> on a TV debate stage in New Hampshire in February, Trump could literally step back and watch \u2013 only to emerge as the winner in that state\u2019s Republican primary a few days later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503ac8289b40c1720d6f08ed534c54be7015fb1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503ac8289b40c1720d6f08ed534c54be7015fb1f/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump rival and New Jersey govenor Chris Christie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump rival and New Jersey governor Chris Christie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Evans/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the Republicans cannot be blamed for the weakness of the field that fought Trump for their party\u2019s nomination. Perhaps no traditional politician \u2013 no senator or governor \u2013 could take on Trump when the Republican grassroots, so furious at the political establishment, were hungering for an outsider. (Although, of course, this anti-establishment fervour, this loathing of all things Washington, was itself stoked for years by Republicans and their allies on Fox News and in the rest of the conservative political-media-entertainment complex. In losing their party to Trump, the Republicans were burned by a fire they themselves had started.)</p> <p>But what shames them is their conduct afterwards. Even as Trump made clear what kind of man he is \u2013 calling Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d, suggesting African-Americans are too lazy to work, that Jews see everything through the lens of money, calling women \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cpigs\u201d, threatening violence against protesters, endorsing torture and the murder of the families of suspected terrorists, calling for a foreign power (Russia) to hack into emails belonging to his political rival, arguing that women who have abortions should \u201cface some sort of punishment\u201d, and being exposed as a proud perpetrator of sexual assault, a man whose approach to women is to \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d \u2013 even after all this and so much more, most senior Republicans of note stood by him.</p> <p>To be sure, they condemned him occasionally, when the extremity of their standard bearer\u2019s behaviour left them no alternative. Paul Ryan, who serves as speaker of the House of Representatives, rightly called it the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment\u201d when Trump said that <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442\">Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be impartial in handling the lawsuit against the so-called Trump University because Curiel was \u201cMexican\u201d</a>. In fact, the judge was a US citizen, born in Indiana. Ryan cold-shouldered Trump again, after the release of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted of his attacks on women. But he never repudiated him fully. Ryan never said Trump was unfit to be president of the United States and that he would not vote for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8b741b95a2e2ea85645fcecf4f26e2bde5368c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8b741b95a2e2ea85645fcecf4f26e2bde5368c4/0_40_3354_2012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator John McCain endorsed Trump and never withdrew his endorsement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator John McCain initially endorsed Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J. Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same was nearly true of Senator John McCain, tortured for five and a half years in a Hanoi cell and yet derided as \u201cnot a hero\u201d by Trump (who said he preferred those who were not captured). McCain swallowed that, along with Trump\u2019s promise to ban Muslims and to deport 11 million undocumented migrants \u2013 only withdrawing his endorsement last month, after the notorious tape.</p> <p>Until then, McCain, like most of his fellow Republicans, clung to the fiction that Trump would transform himself into a new creature: sober, presidential and, above all, capable of being tamed by the Republican establishment \u2013 even though there was not a shred of evidence, bar a very occasional willingness on the candidate\u2019s part to read prepared lines from a teleprompter, to support that fantasy.</p> <p>That puts them on a moral plane only slightly above that occupied by Trump\u2019s trio of enablers: Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. Those three horsemen of the Republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake-oil salesman was fit to be president \u2013 and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process. As Hillary Clinton pointed out, Giuliani used to prosecute tax-dodgers. In this campaign, he praised Trump\u2019s failure to pay income tax for at least two decades as evidence of his \u201cgenius\u201d.</p> <p>And that is to omit the fourth horseman: Mike Pence, the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice-married, serially adulterous, self-confessed grabber of women. When the 2005 \u201cgrab them\u201d tape emerged, Pence went into seclusion. Some thought he might emerge to announce he was quitting the Republican ticket. He did no such thing. Instead, he examined his conscience, found it pristine and continued to act as a character witness to a man who cheats his taxes, cheats on his wives and lies every time he opens his mouth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"267f3ccf1675ff3f460b49a0bf5a6be3ca6fe08d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267f3ccf1675ff3f460b49a0bf5a6be3ca6fe08d/161_222_2827_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump And Mike Pence campaign together In Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Mike Pence campaign together In Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to attack the spineless \u201cleaders\u201d of the Republican party. Easy but incomplete. It\u2019s a rule of political combat that no one ever, ever, attacks the voters \u2013 a rule Clinton unwisely broke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">when she deployed an odd metaphor to describe half of Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d</a>. But that rule only applies to candidates for office. Any truthful assessment of a campaign has at least to include those doing the voting.</p> <p>Some blame surely attaches to the Americans who let Trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway. There is no escaping the fact that north of 40% of the US electorate have been prepared to vote for Trump despite everything that he has said and done. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/297383-poll-nearly-half-of-voters-think-trump-will-detonate-a\">One poll found 22% of Trump\u2019s own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war</a>. They thought that, but were prepared to vote for him anyway. None of them will be able to say: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Notable among that group are Christian evangelical voters, people who used to say that character mattered, that the personal conduct of a candidate was crucial. Five years ago, only 30% of white evangelicals believed that a person guilty of \u201cimmoral\u201d personal behaviour could behave ethically in a public role. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/19/the-trump-effect-evangelicals-have-become-much-more-accepting-of-politicians-immoral-acts/\">Now that figure stands at 72%</a>, a remarkably rapid shift. It means people of supposedly deep moral convictions have been prepared to junk those beliefs just to accommodate Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc0c77118a9277337457f38e7d1d3f5c725f4a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc0c77118a9277337457f38e7d1d3f5c725f4a5e/660_167_2853_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Republican presidential rally in Mobile Alabama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Christian vote: a Republican presidential rally in Mobile Alabama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, they will have had their reasons \u2013 including, for many millions, an all-consuming loathing of Hillary Clinton, a hatred so deep it blocks out, or at least outweighs, Trump\u2019s copious flaws. Analysts have not been sure how to explain the other motives. Some have been compassionate and highlighted the role of economic disadvantage among Trump supporters, those left behind by globalisation. Others have suggested that Trumpism is a howl of often racist, misogynistic rage from angry white men, furious that their once-privileged place in American life has been supplanted. The latter camp has taken to sharing pictures or reports of overt racism and sexism by Trump supporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soledadobrien/status/795426520768581637\">with the sarcastic caption: \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This debate has been thoroughly aired in parts of the American press, but, overall, the media \u2013 and especially TV \u2013 shares some responsibility for the dire state of the 2016 campaign. It\u2019s true that the most respectable newspapers and reporters kept tabs on Trump\u2019s prodigious lying: <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/donald-trump-quickfacts.html\">one correspondent tweeted out a daily tally</a>, often stretching into the dozens. Others maintained diligent fact-checking services.</p> <p>But the big picture was indulgence on an epic scale. For months, Trump had unique and unprecedented access to the airwaves of cable TV. Rather than wait to be booked for a set-piece interview, he would simply call up Fox or MSNBC and put himself on the air. He knew he was ratings gold; he knew the networks would not be able to say no. He had a similarly instinctive, reptilian understanding of the media\u2019s addiction to outrage: his nocturnal tweeting habit spread offence and insult far and wide \u2013 but it ensured he remained at the centre of public attention for over a year. According to the media analyst Jack Shafer, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/2016-election-trump-media-takeover-coverage-214419\">the only subject ever to have enjoyed a comparable full-spectrum dominance is 9/11</a>.</p> <p>Yet that quantitative imbalance was not the only distortion. The media clung to its notion that balance required equivalence, so that if Trump wallowed in dishonesty, requiring constant fact-checking, then Clinton had to be treated as equally dishonest. Witness <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/matt-lauer-forum.html\">the morning TV anchor Matt Lauer</a>, widely pilloried for a programme in which he let Trump say anything, much of it false, but played inquisitor-general with Clinton, especially over her emails. (Still, the enduring face of media indulgence of Trump will be that of late-night TV host Jimmy Fallon, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BYqzdiuJc\">playfully ruffling the hair of the real estate magnate</a> \u2013 treating him as just another lovable rogue.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BYqzdiuJc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u0BYqzdiuJc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The moment when TV host Jimmy Fallon ruffled Trump\u2019s hair epitomised the media\u2019s indulgence of him.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nowhere was this mindset more misleading than in the never-ending discussion of those emails, especially in the campaign\u2019s final stretch. Which brings us to the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, in particular, its director, James Comey. His decision to announce 10 days before election day that he was, in effect, reopening the FBI probe into the email affair handed the last week of the campaign to Trump. It put Clinton on the defensive, halted her momentum and stopped the bleeding in Team Trump. Many analysts believe that, by bringing Republican voters back home to the party, it will also prevent Democrats retaking the senate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12dbba3a5078cefb023727a4cd39b752c034d8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12dbba3a5078cefb023727a4cd39b752c034d8bf/0_134_2716_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FBI director James Comey takes his place in the hall of shame.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FBI director James Comey takes his place in the hall of shame.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And all that on what turned out to be an entirely false premise. On Sunday, Comey had to admit that the cache of supposedly new emails was, in fact, nothing of the sort and that there were no grounds to alter his July view that Clinton should face no further action. But by then the damage had been done. Whether through partisan bias or sheer incompetence, we do not yet fully know.</p> <p>So Comey takes his place in the hall of shame of the 2016 campaign, shuffling into the group photo alongside Julian Assange, who might as well have handed over his WikiLeaks operation to the Trump campaign. Assange kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, many of them embarrassing, none devastating \u2013 while conspicuously leaking nothing that might damage the Republican nominee. WikiLeaks never produced Trump\u2019s tax returns or the outtakes from The Apprentice said to contain yet more evidence that Trump is a bigot and sexual predator. It targeted Clinton alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d668e00f2cd58fa4157f72fc95e9f72e2c88b3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d668e00f2cd58fa4157f72fc95e9f72e2c88b3d3/0_148_2896_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks operation kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, while leaking nothing that might damage Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks operation kept up a drip feed of leaked emails from the Clinton team, while leaking nothing that might damage Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there should be room in that photo for Vladimir Putin, whose intelligence agencies are near-universally believed to be behind the wholesale hacking of the Democratic party, and whose goal appears to have been either the installation of Trump or, failing that, the sowing of confusion and chaos in the US electoral system.

More than two-thirds are against the idea \u2013 and almost 70% believe it will put more children at risk.</p> <p>Making children\u2019s rights an optional extra might sound cruel and unusual, but sadly it seems nothing is safe with a government that boasts of plans to scrap our Human Rights Act and is proud of turning our country into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">\u201chostile environment\u201d</a> for migrants.</p> <p>This American election is a moment in history none of us should ignore.

  "<p>Every election offers hope and renewed possibility for supporters in their chosen candidate, and when that much hope arrives at events there are myriad moments, richness, and color to capture. It\u2019s a treasure trove for visual exploration, and so I try to arrive well before and stay long after candidates have departed.<br></p> <p>For me the real magic rarely occurs on stage, but lives in the periphery, with quiet moments that can be quirky, offbeat, and even comical.</p> <p>One of the most astounding aspects of covering a campaign are the interactions with the supporters, those unforgettable individuals who often travel great distance and volunteer long hours, working to elect their chosen candidate. The passion and persuasion they have voicing their beliefs enlightened me as to the pulse of the populace, which is the gift from covering politics.</p> <h2>Palmetto primary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e122e20b1a3f89aca03ff24cc3dcbe47d1a204eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e122e20b1a3f89aca03ff24cc3dcbe47d1a204eb/200_232_3270_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gathers for a group photograph with patrons while visiting Saffron\u2019s Cafe &amp;

In the quest for 270 electoral votes to secure the presidency, the coveted prize of the \u201cKeystone state\u201d saw Clinton, Trump, their running mates or high-profile surrogates, and on many weeks all of these, campaigning throughout Pennsylvania. It has not voted Republican since George HW Bush in 1992, but Trump is fervently contesting it. </p> <p>Working on a photo-essay of the rust belt, a stronghold of Trump\u2019s, I drove past a derelict home with his surname spray-painted in bold scarlet lettering on the facade. For a region decimated by the collapse of the coal industry, the Republican presidential nominee represents the prospect of renewal and returned prosperity.

  "<p>Climate taxes on meat and milk would lead to huge and vital cuts in carbon emissions as well as saving half a million lives a year via healthier diets, according to the first global analysis of the issue.</p> <p>Surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk would account for the damage their production causes people via climate change, an Oxford University team has calculated. These taxes would then deter people from consuming as much of these foods, reducing both emissions and illness, the team said.</p> <p>Food production causes a quarter of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming, largely from the raising of cattle and other livestock. These emissions are increasing as people around the world become richer and eat more meat. </p> <p>Marco Springmann, from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, who led the study, said: \u201cIt is clear that if we don\u2019t do something about the emissions from our food system, we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/03/eating-less-meat-curb-climate-change\">no chance of limiting climate change below 2C</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d have to pay 40% more for your steak, you might choose to have it once a week instead of twice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-07T11:51:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Meat and dairy tax\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2016-11-07T11:51:24/embed.html\">Meat and dairy tax</a> </figure>  <p>The research, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nclimate3155\">published in the journal Nature Climate Change</a>, evaluated the tax required for each food type to compensate for the climate damage its production causes. Beef has a heavy footprint, due to the deforestation and methane emissions associated with cattle and the grains they are fed, and needed a 40% tax on average across the world.</p> <p>The scientists then assessed how much less of each food type would be eaten as a result of the taxes. They examined different tax regimes and found the optimum arrangement in terms of both emissions and health was to combine the taxes with subsidies for healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, and payments to people to compensate for price increases. This ensured poorer people did not end up with worse diets as the result of taxation.</p> <p>This optimum tax plan would reduce climate emissions by 1 billion tonnes a year \u2013 the same as the entire global aviation industry. This huge potential cut in emissions surprised Springmann, as did the heavy impact of dairy products.</p> <p>Changes to how food is produced and consumed have largely been ignored in the battle against climate change, due to public sensitivity about their food choices, fears about increasing hunger in poorer parts of the world and the lack of straightforward measures to tackle the problem.</p> <p>\u201cIf people see any food price rise, they get angry, so you have to explain why you are doing it,\u201d said Springmann, adding that a successful food tax policy could spend all the money it raised on ensuring people could afford healthier diets. He said a t<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20280863\">ax in Denmark on unhealthy saturated fats</a>, where the government simply kept all the revenue, was aborted after a year. But in Mexico, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/mexican-soda-tax-cuts-sales-first-year\">sugar tax on soft drinks has been successful</a> after the funds were spent on free drinking water in schools.</p> <p>Most of the foods with big climate impacts also happen to be unhealthy when eaten in large quantities, such as beef and dairy. Therefore, if climate taxes cut consumption, fewer people would die from related diseases such as heart disease, strokes and cancers. In the US, for example, people eat three times the recommended level of meat. The researchers found climate taxes would save more than half a million early deaths every year, largely in Europe, the US, Australia and China.</p> <p>However, cutting the demand for meat and dairy would not be easy, said Rob Bailey, research director at UK thinktank Chatham House: \u201cThe challenge is political. As the new research demonstrates, in many countries there is a very strong public health and climate case for dietary change, but it isn\u2019t happening. Governments are reluctant to \u2018interfere\u2019 in people\u2019s lifestyle choices for fear of a public backlash and criticism for \u2018nanny statism\u2019, as well as the reaction from powerful interests in the food industry and agricultural lobby.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey said there was currently little pressure on governments to act, partly because the public understanding of the link between diet and climate change is low. But, when people are informed, they find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/meat-tax-far-less-unpalatable-than-government-thinks-research-finds\">meat taxes far less unpalatable</a> than is supposed, he said.</p> <p>Calls to cut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet\">meat-eating, by the UN</a> and high-profile figures including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">climate change experts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6442164/Lord-Stern-People-should-give-up-eating-meat-to-halt-climate-change.html\">the economist Lord Stern</a>, have so far been both rare and controversial. </p> <p>The new research found the taxes needed to compensate for climate damage were 15% on lamb, 8.5% on chicken, 7% on pork and 5% on eggs. Vegetable oil required a large tax of 25%, but this was due to the low initial price of the product, making a relatively modest surcharge look high.</p> <p>These tax levels were global averages but there was significant variation with, for example, the beef tax being higher in Latin America, where cattle-raising produces more emissions than in other regions. The optimum tax plan also had regional variations, including limiting climate taxes to beef in the lowest income countries, to ensure people there were still able to afford decent diets.</p> <p>Springmann said it was critical to find a way to cut the environmental impact of food production: \u201cEither we have climate change and more heart disease, diabetes and obesity, or we do something about the food system.\u201d</p>",

The analysis focused on comparing damage produced by the nibbling of insects to that previously seen in fossil leaves from the western interior of North America.</p> <p>The North American leaves revealed that the diversity of damage, and therefore the variety of insects munching on the leaves, decreased dramatically at the time of the asteroid impact, with insects that fed on just a small selection of plants the worst hit. The data also showed that it took around nine million years for insect damage to recover to pre-impact levels. </p> <p>Similar trends were seen in the fossil leaves from Patagonia. However, both before and after the asteroid impact the diversity of damage was higher, suggesting that Patagonia was rich in a huge variety of insects. What\u2019s more, the diversity of the leaf damage returned to pre-impact levels more quickly than in North America, taking just four million years.</p> <p>Careful analysis of details in the damage produced by insects that burrow between leaf layers - so-called leaf miners - offered further insights, revealing that even though the same type of insects existed in Patagonia before and after the impact, they were unlikely to be of the same species. \u201cIt makes it look like there is a lower extinction, but ... there\u2019s actually new insects that were making this damage,\u201d said Donovan.</p> <p>The upshot, the authors conclude, is that the catastrophic impact that bumped off the dinosaurs had a huge and devastating effect on insect biodiversity in both hemispheres, but that ecosystems recovered more quickly in Patagonia than in the western interior of North America.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile, and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet, they will soon. It is also widely anticipated that in the next few years, North Korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US west coast. Former and current US administrations have taken the strategic decision that Pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point, by force if necessary. But the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Clinton\u2019s foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming Korean crisis early in her term in office, reassuring Japan and South Korea that the US will not abandon them, and seeking to put pressure on China to enforce UN-mandated trade sanctions more effectively. That may well not succeed, leaving a Clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with Pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status, as long as it restricts missile development. If that were possible, it would alarm US allies who are already within North Korean missile range.<br></p> <p>American allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if Trump reaches the Oval Office. He has questioned the value of US alliances in the region, and he has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-japan-south-korea-might-need-nuclear-weapons/\">floated the possibility</a> that countries like Japan or South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the US strategic umbrella. If he sticks to that policy in office, there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north-east Asia and possibly beyond. Ultimately, a Trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a North Korean long-range missile. He has said he would put more pressure on China to get tough with its neighbour, and he has said he is willing to meet Kim in the US, on the grounds \u201cthere\u2019s a 10% or a 20% chance that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-north-korea-nukes-224385\">I can talk him out of those damn nukes</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>Failing that, he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the US nuclear arsenal.

The Chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the South China Sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives Beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world. US influence is under further threat by the rise of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/philippine-president-calls-for-removal-of-all-us-troops\">threatened to eject US troops</a>, casting doubt on his predecessor\u2019s agreement to allow new permanent American presence. </p> <p>Clinton\u2019s likely policy will be to continue Obama\u2019s faltering \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d, and to prioritise restoring the faith of US allies in the region that Washington will help them resist Chinese attempts to dominate the South China Sea. It is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by Duterte\u2019s ultimate intentions, and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region. </p> <p>Trump has pointed to the Chinese reef-building programme as a reflection of US weakness but has not said what he would do about it. He has focused more on the threat posed to the US by its trade relations with China. In the transactional model of foreign relations Trump favours, he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-china-idUSKCN0ZR2MN\">could agree</a> to turn a blind eye to creeping Chinese takeover in the South China Sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with Beijing on better terms. </p> <h2>Syria </h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">Why Clinton's plans for no-fly zones in Syria could provoke US-Russia conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new US president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> in Syria and neighbouring Iraq, but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers.

However, it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with Russia, with all the risks that entails. The generals at the Pentagon, who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone, would work hard to block such a scheme. A Clinton White House is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups.<br></p> <p>Trump has indicated that he would seek to work with Assad and Putin in a combined fight against Isis, and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel-held areas such as eastern Aleppo. That policy would also have heavy costs.

A Trump administration is unlikely to contest Russian enforcement of its influence in eastern Ukraine.</p> <h2>Europe and Nato</h2> <p>Clinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show US willingness to shore up EU and Nato cohesion, and will attend summits of both organisations in February.<br></p> <p>Trump has suggested, by contrast, that Nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in Europe are worth what the US is currently spending on them. He said he would check whether US allies \u201cfulfilled their obligation to us\u201d before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/donald-trump-america-automatically-nato-allies-under-attack\">coming to their defence</a>, calling into question the purpose of the defence pact.

The accord wasn\u2019t presented to Congress as a formal treaty, meaning that Trump could undo it himself.</p> <p>Extricating the US from the deal, along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change, would take some time, however. Now the agreement is in force, any signatory nation faces a three-year delay before it could opt out, with a further one-year wait as the process plays out.</p> <p>\u201cThat means,\u201d said Robert Stavins, an expert at environmental law at Harvard University, \u201cit would be impossible for a President Trump to remove the United States during what would be his first term.\u201d</p> <p>But the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the Paris deal after the US and China, the world\u2019s two greenhouse gas superpowers, jointly announced they were committed to the process last year.

That followed Britain cutting the period of time for which graduates from India could remain in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cIf you see what is happening in the UK vis-a-vis Indians, you look at the difficult travel conditions for professionals travelling to the UK, especially IT professionals, and the UK has made it more difficult for students to stay on and look for a job there,\u201d Tikoo said.<br></p> <p>The government source argued that there were a number of other possible concessions that could encourage Indians to enter a trade deal, including technology and skills transfers.<br></p> <p>The issue also triggered discussion in the UK, where the Institute of Directors welcomed the trade talks with India but warned that migration was an important factor. \u201cThe prime minister must recognise that labour mobility and visas are key to deepening trade for a services-based economy like the UK,\u201d said the head of trade policy at the IoD, Allie Renison, who suggested that students ought to be taken out of May\u2019s net migration target. <br></p> <p>Sam Bowman, executive director of the Adam Smith Institute, agreed that May ought to be more flexible on migration. \u201cIndia\u2019s position that a trade deal with Britain must include looser migration controls on Indian migrants is good news for Britain. A free trade deal with India that also made it easier for skilled Indian workers to come to Britain would be win-win for us, and be a real coup by making the UK the first major economy to strike a deal with India,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brexit supporters told voters with links to Commonwealth countries that leaving the EU would allow an immigration system that was fairer towards people from their countries. However, if May is to meet her promise of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands, she will need to reduce migration from across the world. </p> <p>Bowman argued that British people were relaxed about skilled workers and students arriving in Britain, and said the cap had become an \u201calbatross hanging around the government\u2019s neck\u201d.</p> <p>Another group, WPI Strategy, argued that India could demand the scrapping of subsidies for British farmers to enable a deal. <br></p> <p>Sean Worth, director at WPI Strategy and a former Downing Street adviser, argued that there were good reasons why trade talks between the EU and India had previously stalled.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has the chance to achieve something that the EU hasn\u2019t been able to do for nine years \u2013 a trade deal with India. The prime minister will, however, be confronted with exactly the same problems as her European counterparts. Her trade negotiators will have to fight tooth and nail not to give ground on the movement of people, but this could mean putting the future of UK farming at risk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, he said the benefits would be huge.</p> <p>The economist Jonathan Portes said it was a \u201cfantasy\u201d to expect India to suddenly give Britain everything it wanted in trade terms. \u201cThey\u2019ve never hidden the fact that as far as they\u2019re concerned they regard access to the UK labour market for skilled workers, through the work permit system, as a key priority. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s remotely any prospect of a free trade agreement with them.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>My daily commute takes me through London\u2019s Liverpool Street station. Most days I walk by a tiny touching statue, a bronze of two small children with a suitcase. A sign reads: \u201cF\u00fcr Das Kind\u201d, meaning for the children. The statue commemorates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/03/nicholas-winton-saved-me-nazis-kindertransport-jewish-children-friend\" title=\"\">Kindertransport</a> that rescued 10,000 child refugees and brought them by train to safety in Britain, escaping the persecution of Jews in Nazi Europe. Few of those children ever saw their families again. Most who could not leave were exterminated.</p> <p>Last week, just yards away from the statue, appeared a poster that fills me with horror. A looming, dark, hook-nosed figure dominates the foreground. This man is an object of suspicion, watched apprehensively by a pretty, pale-skinned young woman. This man is instantly identifiable \u2013 at least to anyone who knows world war two history \u2013 as the caricature Jew of Nazi propaganda posters.</p> <p>However inadvertently, the designers have used a horribly familiar antisemitic image. The impact goes far beyond these associations, serious as those are. A friend who was unaware of Nazi iconography revealingly said that she saw on the poster an \u201cevil-looking dark-skinned man\u201d. The image plays on people\u2019s fears of \u201cthe other\u201d, and creates anxiety about a suspicious \u201cthey\u201d who may be hiding something, in the words of the poster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5ce1eb91c926a15f321a7b92df43340fc529c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5ce1eb91c926a15f321a7b92df43340fc529c8/0_146_2310_2886/800.jpg\" alt=\"Eternal Jew, 1937.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eternal Jew, 1937. \u2018The propagandists of the Third Reich knew exactly what they were doing when they used such imagery.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who exactly are \u201cthey\u201d?

They encouraged a majority of people to focus on and fear minority groups, making them the targets of suspicion and violence. This deliberate demonisation created conditions for some human beings to take away the rights \u2013 and in the end, the lives \u2013 of others.</p> <p>It is one thing to be concerned about public safety, and it makes sense to urge passengers to be vigilant, to look out for activity that appears abnormal, like an unattended bag.

  "<p>Have we gone back to the 1930s? Could we see the return of fascism? After all, hatred and prejudice, which many people thought had been marginalised in western democracies by the defeat of fascism in 1945, decolonisation and the American civil rights movement now seem to be part of the mainstream.</p> <p>Furthermore, democratic institutions appear threatened.

If Trump becomes president and keeps his promise to deport millions, parallels with Nazi Germany will inevitably be made.</p> <p>The march of far-right parties appears irresistible. Perhaps their success in Hungary and Austria, or even France, could be seen as a reversion to type, for authoritarian regimes were present there before 1945. But now the far right is advancing in the UK and US too \u2013 once seen as protected from extremism by their \u201cdemocratic cultures\u201d. There are clear parallels between the modern far right and fascism \u2013 authoritarianism, charismatic leadership, nationalism, racism, protectionism, anti-liberalism \u2026</p> <p>Yet whatever the similarities, we should think twice before interpreting the present as a re-enactment of the past.</p> <p>For one thing, fascism is notoriously hard to define. Decades of research have not enabled academics to agree on a definition. The problem is that fascism \u2013 like socialism or any other political movement \u2013 was diverse and meant different things to different people. Even if we confine our attention to those Italians who described themselves as Fascists between 1919 and 1945, we find an enormous range of views on what fascism was. Some thought that the state should be supreme, others that the party should rule. Some advocated government intervention in the economy; others wanted capitalists to be left to get on with the job. Fascists did not agree what fascism was, so it\u2019s not surprising that scholars don\u2019t either.</p> <p>The problem is even greater if we include nazism within the category of fascism. The German regime learned from Italian fascism in many ways. Yet many Nazis were contemptuous of Italians as poor soldiers, who had betrayed Germany by joining the Allies in the first world war. The Nazis were reluctant to call themselves fascists, because doing so implied that they were imitators.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/15/ali-gharib-is-trump-a-fascist\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4f4ay\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2424216\"            data-video-name=\"Ali Gharib: is Trump a fascist? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-566f5253e4b0b03f38dbbb11\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/12/15/151215LaurenceUploadUpdate_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/dec/15/ali-gharib-is-trump-a-fascist\">Ali Gharib: is Trump a fascist?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There were important differences between the regimes. True, racism was never absent from Italian fascism, especially towards Slavs, and in its imperialist war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1935/oct/03/italy.mainsection\" title=\"\">modern-day Ethiopia</a>. Yet before 1938 there was no equivalent in Italy of the Nazis\u2019 extreme antisemitism and drive for a biologically pure race. If we impose the category of fascism on nazism, we risk obscuring the importance of this antisemitic racism.</p> <p>The contemporary far right is equally diverse. Parties have different attitudes to Europe for instance, and some are more anti-democratic than others. All we can say is that some aspects of the modern far right are like some elements of fascism.</p> <p>Some modern far-right movements were designed to rehabilitate fascism \u2013 that was true of the French Front National in the 1970s, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/26/worlddispatch.france\" title=\"\">Italian Social Movement</a> (MSI) in the 1990s, but one never knows where such efforts will lead. While the FN has in some ways become more extreme, for instance on European immigration, the MSI was eventually absorbed into the mainstream right.</p> <p>If we simply see these movements as reinventions of fascism, then we risk obscuring what is specific to our own times. Italian fascists saw socialists as their chief enemies, while for the Nazis it was \u201cJudeo-Bolshevism\u201d. These days, the labour movement is in retreat, and the subculture that sustained it has largely gone. Disillusioned working-class voters in Europe and America provide a more important fund of support for the modern far right than they ever did for fascism or nazism, notwithstanding the often underestimated support of middle-class voters for the contemporary far right.</p> <p>Another major difference is that whereas fascism and nazism came to power by combining paramilitarism on the streets with electoral victories, the modern far right relies on the latter alone. Indeed, it rarely opposes democracy in principle and actually takes advantage of the discriminatory potential of democracy itself \u2013 those who do not conform to the characteristics and wishes of the \u201cmajority\u201d \u2013 judges or Muslims \u2013 are enemies of \u201cthe people\u201d.</p> <p>Ultimately, perhaps, it matters less than we might think whether Trump or any other figure is \u201cfascist\u201d in some academic sense. The real question is moral \u2013 do we see their policies as morally acceptable? And if history teaches anything, it is that people who called themselves neither fascist or Nazi were capable of complicity in repugnant acts.</p>",

Ironically, the approval letter arrived when I was abroad. I got the news over the phone just outside St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome; the assembled pilgrims probably didn\u2019t appreciate my yelps of \u201cOh my God!\u201d.</p> <p>I was ecstatic.

And that is one way in which I still feel very German. For many young Germans, myself included, being European is something to be proud of, whereas being German is not. The German former head of the V&amp;A, Martin Roth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/05/german-v-and-a-director-martin-roth-quits-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">has said</a> that if you\u2019re born in the 1950s you\u2019re not proud to be German \u2013 and that is still true if you\u2019re a child of the 80s, like me.</p> <p>Speaking to my German friends before the referendum, one thing that kept coming up was how proud they were to be Europeans. It means transcending nationality and meeting, working and living with people from different countries and backgrounds. Germans are particularly invested in the European project because it has ensured peace in this part of Europe for over 70 years.</p> <p>It has also been a chance to be part of something more than a nation haunted by its brutal history. Reports that descendants of tens of thousands of German Jews who fled the Nazis and found refuge in Britain are now thinking about using their legal right to become German citizens is perhaps indicative of how much Germany has changed. But Germans will also be among the first to understand that some feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/03/holocaust-german-brexit-citizenship-jewish-refugee\" title=\"\">ambivalent</a> about doing so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/07/attorney-general-jeremy-wright-defends-judges-criticised-brexit-ruling\">Attorney general defends judges criticised over Brexit ruling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most Germans still don\u2019t have the happy patriotism that many of the British have, with union jacks on their cushions and mugs, no questions asked.

While far from being perfect, it always seemed to be miles ahead of Germany in its acceptance of people from all around the world.

  "<p>The nightmare truly began when Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/donald-trump-in-iowa-obama-esque-campaign-but-the-same-mouthy-mogul\">threw</a> Jorge Ramos out of a press conference in August last year. Some might argue it was when he called Mexican immigrants \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">rapists</a>\u201d the month before, but the beast hadn\u2019t yet emerged, hadn\u2019t yet been given a clear face or features.</p> \n<p>\u201cGo back to Univision!\u201d Trump shouted as Ramos was escorted out of the room. The familiar syntax was not lost on us Latinos, who have been told to \u201cgo back\u201d for as long as we\u2019ve been in the United States, whether we were born here or not.</p> \n<p>Before he was forcibly removed, Ramos was criticizing Trump for effectively saying he would deport 11 million undocumented people and build a 1,900-mile border wall. Well, Trump skirted those specifics, but that was the reality of what he was proposing. We Latinos were put in a familiar place \u2013 where we are merely numbers or parasites to the economy, seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as laborers.</p> \n<p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara, </em>goes an old Mexican proverb. \u201cTo the bad times, good face.\u201d When I first delved into the world of activism, I used to hold the saying in contempt. It seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the Mexican American in the face of oppression, the immigrant family, the Chicano who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss. It painted us, I thought, as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to us.</p> \n<p>Watching the Trump campaign, being its first scapegoats, I felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure. The slogan Make America Great Again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country. We are the unclean other, our culture dilutes the purity of America\u2019s white citizens who must be protected from us. Make America great again \u2013 by kicking us out. </p> \n<p>Violence <a href=\"http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/\">against Latinos surged</a>, at Trump rallies and across the country. Xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the demagogue\u2019s rants, his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors. \u201cSend them back\u201d was a phrase I heard more in those months than I ever had in my life. \u201cYou have to go back\u201d became a common response to everything I wrote. Something had changed.</p> \n<p>It was Trump\u2019s attack on US district court judge Gonzalo P Curiel, born in Indiana and of Mexican descent, that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality. Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee, accused Curiel, who was overseeing a class action lawsuit against Trump University, of being biased simply because of his Mexican heritage. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a66255a-cc79-416b-9f19-99ad578f5f5a\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   -\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I remember watching the debacle unfold and thinking: \u201cSo this is how he\u2019ll silence us as president.\u201d All of us. For Trump, it has never been about immigration. It\u2019s been about stoking racism against brown people, against black people, against the \u201cother\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican,\u201d Trump said of Curiel. \u201cWhich is all fine. But I say he\u2019s got bias.\u201d It harkened back to McCarthyism. This is what he meant when he said he would make America great again.</p> \n<p>Things took a dip into the absurd with the infamous Cinco de Mayo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168?lang=en\">taco bowl tweet.</a> Trump, smiling and without irony, as if he hadn\u2019t advocated for the mass deportation of our people and hadn\u2019t called us criminals and thugs, tweeted: \u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d</p> \n<p>It was beyond parody.</p> \n<p>Today, many hope that the long nightmare is about to draw to a close. But Trump could still pull off a win. And even if he doesn\u2019t, the Trump machine will roll on, with or without him. We have on our hands a significant population of angry white citizens who blame us for all their frustrations. Things are about to get worse for us, not better.</p> \n<p>It happens in cycles. America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\">last mass deportation</a> of Latinos and Mexican Americans happened during the Great Depression. Approximately 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were rounded up and ejected from the country. And leading up to Trump, xenophobia in the Republican party was already the norm. Trump merely brought the subtext to the fore, bolded it and added several exclamation points. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster.</p> \n<p><em>Al mal tiempo, buena cara. </em>I used to hate the phrase, but now I think of it daily. It helps me survive the daily inanities of the election cycle, the daily ways we are dehumanized. It\u2019s not putting on a smile and pretending the bad times aren\u2019t happening. It is a radical act of survival. It is a resolute affirmation in the face of adversity: I will make it through this. I will live to see the better days.</p>",
  "<p>Take two quarterbacks. QB1 throws for 281 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. QB2 throws for 297 yards, three scores and one pick.

But Rodgers tossed touchdowns to Davante Adams and Randall Cobb on Green Bay\u2019s final two drives \u2014 enough to bring the Packers within striking distance, but not enough for the win.

We\u2019ve got some real talent at our quarterback position. I think Tony Romo is one of the best quarterbacks that has played this game. My real regret would be to have had him here and not win a Super Bowl with him. He\u2019s that talented. And then I look at Dak and how he\u2019s playing, his future. I just don\u2019t have a problem with this situation.</em></p> <p>That was Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after the Cowboys routed the Browns, 35-10, to improve to 7-1 on the season. They\u2019re currently the top seed in the NFC. They\u2019re tied with the Patriots for the best record in the NFL. And Dak Prescott \u2014 who went 21-of-27 for 247 yards and three touchdowns in Sunday\u2019s win \u2014 has thrown 12 touchdowns and just two interceptions. But he\u2019s only playing because Tony Romo got hurt in preseason. On a normal team, Prescott would absolutely start for the rest of the season. But this is the Cowboys, and Jones really cares about Tony Romo. He\u2019s already hedging about getting Romo a Super Bowl win. It may be moot, however: Romo is <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000734143/article/tony-romo-still-not-ready-to-return-to-dallas-cowboys\">only in the beginning</a> stages of his return.</p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2> <p><strong>158 yards</strong>. A week after being benched for fumbling, Mark Ingram ran for 158 yards on 10 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown. Tim Hightower, as predicted, got the bulk of the carries for the Saints, rushing 23 times for 87 yards. The Saints ran for 248 yards \u2014 their highest total of the season by more than 100 yards. Of course, they were playing against the 49ers \u2014 a team that Football Outsiders says has the 30th-worst rush defense and has given up more than 200 yards rushing three times this year.</p> <h2>Fantasy player of the week</h2> <p><strong>Melvin Gordon, Chargers</strong>. Gordon was a high pick in fantasy drafts last year as a rookie, and ended up a huge bust. He rushed for just 641 yards and didn\u2019t score a touchdown. But fantasy players who held onto him in dynasty leagues or drafted him this season are reaping the rewards. In San Diego\u2019s 43-35 win over the Titans on Sunday, Gordon rushed for 196 yards and a touchdown. He also caught four passes for 65 yards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Chargers remain one of the most interesting teams in the league. They blew second-half leads in all four losses in their 1-4 start, and have been ravaged by injuries. Unfortunately for the Chargers, they\u2019re 4-5 while everyone else in the AFC West has a winning record.</p> <h2>Video of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dhm/status/795389569524989952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When your friend from Pittsburgh tries to make fun of Philadelphia <a href=\"https://t.co/o9ceuENug0\">pic.twitter.com/o9ceuENug0</a></p>&mdash; Dan McQuade (@dhm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhm/status/795389569524989952\">November 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Steelers could do nothing offensively for the first three quarters. But after the Ravens returned a blocked punt for a touchdown, Ben Roethlisberger led a nine-play, 75-yard drive for a touchdown that ended with a TD pass to Antonio Brown, then ran it in from four yards out to cut it to a one-score game with 48 seconds to play. The Steelers would need to recover an onside kick next to keep the game alive.</p> <p>Chris Boswell attempted to fool the Ravens by stepping past the ball and kicking with his legs crossed with his opposite leg. In soccer, that\u2019s called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabona\">rabona</a>. In the NFL today, it didn\u2019t work. He knocked the ball into his own leg, then effectively downed it after just a yard when he kicked it downfield. The Ravens won, 21-14. It was such a hilarious attempt that it was the most memorable play in a game that included a Mike Wallace 95-yard touchdown reception. Roethlisberger looked just so-so (264 yards passing, one TD, one pick) in his first game back from injury, while Le\u2019Veon Bell had just 32 yards rushing. Both teams are 4-4.</p> <h2>Elsewhere around the league</h2> <p> \u2014 It looked like the Minnesota Vikings were going to win when tight end Rhett Ellison took a jet sweep into the end zone from a yard out with 23 seconds left. But Matt Stafford drove the Lions 35 yards and Matt Prater hit a 58-yard field goal at the gun to send the game into overtime. Detroit got the ball first in overtime, and Golden Tate broke two tackles on the sideline and jumped into the end zone for a 28-yard touchdown and the stunning road victory.</p> <p>It was a defensive game, with each team getting into the end zone twice. Minnesota could\u2019ve won in regulation, but Blair Walsh missed an extra point after the Vikings\u2019 first score \u2014 allowing Detroit to drive for the game-tying field goal. After a 1-3 start, the Lions are just a half-game out of first in the NFC North at 5-4.</p> <p> \u2014 Travis Kelce was ejected from the Chiefs\u2019 19-14 win over the Jaguars after a bizarre sequence in the third quarter. Nick Foles, playing in place of injured starter Alex Smith, threw a pass to Kelce in the end zone. It fell incomplete, but Kelce thought he was a victim of pass interference. He argued with the referees, and even did John Cena\u2019s \u201cU Can\u2019t C Me\u201d taunt from WWE. He got a 15-yard flag. After seeing that he\u2019d been penalized for his argument, he threw his towel at a second official. That ref then threw his hat in the air, and another ref threw a flag. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wibwChrisLilly/status/795368183624585216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I had a decent angle of that Travis Kelce ejection.

A missed call is just that, missed. No matter how much frustration builds on the field, the refs don\u2019t deserve that kind of response.\u201d</p> <p> \u2014 The Jets went down 23-27 to the Dolphins in a game that could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 spell the end of the Ryan Fitzpatrick era in New York. He tossed another couple of interceptions in the loss, although he wasn\u2019t helped by some costly penalties from his team-mates. But with the Jets now at 3-6, their season is all but over and Fitzpatrick clearly isn\u2019t repeating the form he showed last year. Todd Bowles may as well put in Bryce Petty to see if he has the potential to be a competent starter in the league.</p> <p> \u2014 Helped by a few early Carson Wentz interceptions, Eli Manning threw for 257 yards and four touchdowns on a day where he also didn\u2019t have his best. The Eagles picked him off twice in the fourth quarter; the second pick gave them a chance to win the game. But Wentz could only get the Eagles as far as the Giants 17, and New York held on for a 28-13 victory.</p> <p>Odell Beckham Jr only caught four passes for 46 yards, but two of them went for scores. Sterling Shepard and Roger Lewis had the other scores for the Giants, who improved to 5-3 on the year and moved into second in the NFC East. The Eagles, who started 3-0, are now 4-4 and in last place in the division. Wentz threw interceptions on back-to-back passes early in the first quarter; both turnovers led to Giants touchdowns. He did end up throwing for 364 yards, but the Eagles 3-0 start seems worlds away now.</p> <p>\u2014 The Oakland Raiders\u2019 best start in ages continued with a Sunday night win over the Broncos, 30-20. Latavius Murray lead the way for Oakland with 114 yards rushing and three 1-yard touchdown runs. The team rushed for 218 yards overall and committed just (\u2018just\u2019) eight penalties a week after setting the NFL record for infractions with 24. The Broncos rushed for 33 yards, and fell to 6-3. Oakland is 7-2, first in the division and the No2 seed in the AFC.</p>",

Their response? Think <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/26/investing/markets-brexit-reaction-monday/\">Brexit</a> and multiply.</p> <p>Hundreds of US economists working in academic institutions (including several Nobel laureates) have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/11/01/prominent-economists-including-eight-nobel-laureates-do-not-vote-for-donald-trump/\">warned against electing Trump</a>, precisely because of what they referred to, in a public letter, as his propensity to misinform the electorate and promote \u201cwillful delusion over engagement with reality\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cIt would be the US version of Brexit,\u201d says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. The election of the Republican candidate for president would be, like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\">British vote to leave the European Union</a>, an event that \u201cis not expected, but that is very consequential, while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us all, now and into the future\u201d.</p> <p> Given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all else, the initial reaction to a Trump victory \u2013 as with the Brexit vote \u2013 would be a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/economics-blog/2016/jun/24/the-day-brexit-pushed-the-markets-into-freefall\">stock market selloff</a>. \u201cThis kind of wave of emotionally fuelled selling could lead to the market losing between 5% to 10% in a couple of weeks or a couple of months,\u201d says Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.</p> <p> Following that poll, we saw <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy-idUKKCN11B0TQ\">a kind of Brexit bounce</a>, when investors realized that Britain\u2019s departure from the United Kingdom wouldn\u2019t happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in Europe. </p> <p> But the United States is a different kind of animal. It\u2019s a much larger market, for one thing: about a quarter of global GDP and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are US companies, changing hands on US stock exchanges. Add to that the fact that a lot of investors have <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-wall-street-effect-markets-230164#ixzz4PATlxIQy\">already placed big bets</a> that Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, will prevail in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, and you\u2019ve got all the makings of a nasty market shock. The starting point for a selloff in the stock market could be 10%, and it could get worse from there, some suggest \u2013 and that shock would almost certainly be a global one, rippling outward from the peso and the Canadian dollar to the yen and European markets. </p> <p> Simon Johnson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has argued that the kind of \u201cbig adverse surprise\u201d that Trump\u2019s election would pose to the system, causing the stock market to crash, <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-consequences-of-trump-victory-by-simon-johnson-2016-10\">could prove cataclysmic</a>. Trump, whose promises to boost economic growth immediately to between 4% and 5% are \u201cpure fantasy\u201d \u2013 in Johnson\u2019s opinion \u2013 has advocated anti-trade policies that would lead to anything but growth, the economist argues. And a Trump victory? Well, that might just be enough to cause a worldwide recession, Johnson says. </p> <p> Nonetheless, some investors are preparing for the heightened risk of a Trump presidency, stocking up on cash, gold and such hedges against the US market as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/11/02/donald-trump-investors-safe-havens-german-bonds/\">German bonds</a> in their portfolios. They have done so as the political situation has become more fraught and Trump has succeeded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-narrows-polling-gap-rigged-message-512682\">in narrowing the polling gap</a> between Clinton and himself and making a Trump presidency more likely. </p> <p> Should Trump actually triumph, the immediate market shock isn\u2019t the only factor that these investors will have to consider, however. </p> <p> \u201cIn the near term, I think a Trump administration would affect business investment and hiring decisions,\u201d says Zandi, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain. \u201cNo one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president Trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity. That would slow economic growth.\u201d </p> <p>Longer term, Zandi adds, the outlook depends on what choices a president Trump would make. What form would his anti-immigration stance take? If Trump chooses to follow through on all his policies \u2013 deporting undocumented immigrants, building a wall along the Mexican border \u2013 it could shrink the size of the US economy or trigger a trade war. </p> <p>\u201cThis is what markets will worry about most,\u201d says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services. \u201cIf we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods, our trading partners would likely retaliate, and our exports to those countries, like China and Mexico, would suffer.\u201d There would be no winners; global growth would slow.</p> <p> Trump has promised that he would cut taxes if elected, which sounds appealing to voters. That has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief jolt, to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual taxpayers, and if those people choose to spend their windfall. </p> <p> But Hoffman notes that Trump\u2019s tax plan is set up to <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/09/26/Trump-s-Tax-Plan-Would-Benefit-Wealthy-Most-Study-Finds\">benefit wealthy Americans most</a>. Many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households. There\u2019s also the pesky question of how Trump would pay for those tax cuts. \u201cHe is not at all clear how he would do that,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cDo you just run higher deficits? That would be a longer-term negative.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/aug/21/stock-market-records-ordinary-investors\">Why a surging stock market isn't making ordinary investors happy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Still, investors who confront a Trump-induced market selloff on Wednesday morning shouldn\u2019t imagine that there are no economic upsides to his election. Trump has promised to take a light approach to regulating businesses \u2013 that could be good for corporate profits, and for stock prices, when the shock is over. \u201cMany of his ideas are pro-market policies,\u201d Ablin says. </p> <p> And if you shudder at the idea of a President Trump, remember that some of what he is able to accomplish will be governed by the makeup of Congress. He can\u2019t abrogate existing trade treaties, like the Nafta trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico, single-handedly; he could find working with Congress to pass some of the more protectionist measures that investors find so terrifying to be far harder than he expects. </p> <p> The idea of President Hillary Clinton is one that investors have had plenty of time to accustom themselves to, and the Democratic candidate\u2019s policies are clearly articulated and by now offer few surprises to anyone who has been paying attention.

  "<p>Not long after he launched his rocket of a campaign last summer, Donald Trump walked into a gathering of hardcore conservative activists in Nashville, Tennessee.

Whether he built the movement or simply rode its wave, Trump has profoundly reshaped the politics of the Grand Old Party. From his opposition to trade to his admiration for Putin, from his authoritarian tendencies to his anti-Nato stance, Trump has trampled across several red lines of Republican politics.

That moment came at a high point of President George W Bush\u2019s power, soon after his re-election in 2004.</p> <p>At the time, the establishment consensus was clear about the rise of Latino voters. Republicans could not afford to concede them to Democrats, and instead could win them over with an agenda of family values, faith and support for small business.</p> <p>So when Bush pushed for immigration reform in 2005, he fully expected his political capital to pay dividends. Instead, he found himself outflanked and outgunned by House Republicans and nativist hosts on conservative talk radio. A comprehensive approach died that year and a more limited version was killed two years later, just as the financial crisis was beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The crash of 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, transformed a political landscape that was already shifting against the pro-business, pro-immigration culture that once represented mainstream Republican opinion.</p> <p>Steve Schmidt was a senior staffer on Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign and in effect campaign manager of McCain\u2019s 2008 effort as the economy collapsed. He sees the emergence of Trump and Bernie Sanders as part of a far bigger shift in global politics that threatens the security and economic order we have known since the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cThe absolute acquiescence of the Republican establishment, who discarded a generation of conservative ideology at the knees of an authoritarian wannabe, and the fact that someone so manifestly unprepared intellectually, emotionally and morally came this close to achieving real power in this country is a historic event that is truly unprecedented,\u201d says Schmidt. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/03/trump-supporters-us-elections\">What I learned after 100,000 miles on the road talking to Trump supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe notion that there\u2019s a snap-back to normal is naive in my view.

Here, Facebook has a grip on society like nowhere else, and few Instagram accounts express Joinville as well as, ironically, the local newspaper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anoticia/\">account</a>, which shows a more intimate view of the city than most personal accounts.<br></p> <h2><strong>Biggest controversy</strong></h2> <p>In 2014, the city was (and still is, to a lesser degree) <a href=\"http://anoticia.clicrbs.com.br/sc/geral/noticia/2014/09/carros-parados-sobre-corredor-de-onibus-voltam-a-gerar-polemica-em-joinville-4599551.html\">overtaken</a> by a heated debate over bus lanes. Parents at one of Joinville\u2019s private schools were using one of the most important bus lanes in the city for parking space, so they could pick their kids up hassle-free. And this was even after city hall built a special overpass for that exact purpose in 1998.</p> <p>Students and parents refused to use the overpass and a civil movement, <em>N\u00e3o \u00e9 S\u00f3 Pelo Corredor,</em> was formed in defence of the bus lane. However, a local columnist claimed that, since the school came before the lane and donated the land for the street, it had the right to ignore legislation. And so the city, civil activists and the school went to court over whether or not the school had the right to park in the bus lane. </p> <p>At the height of the controversy, the school was adamant in refusing any solutions other than \u201cremoving the bus lane from our parking space\u201d. In a judicial tug-of-war, the school lost the case, went to a <a href=\"http://ndonline.com.br/joinville/noticias/liminar-obriga-prefeitura-de-joinville-a-reabrir-vagas-de-estacionamento-em-corredor-de-onibus\">higher court</a> and got a court order preserving the parking. The court order got repealed by another judge and in the end the surreal parking space inside a bus lane was removed. </p> <h2><strong>Worst building</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0e19d84dada4f4e7d105cf752febdb91db79efe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e19d84dada4f4e7d105cf752febdb91db79efe/81_0_2479_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crumbling reminders of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crumbling reminders of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aline Seitenfus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A very ugly representation of the worst problem in our local public space \u2013 and very nearly falling apart \u2013 is the old Migrant\u2019s Hotel in Rua XV de Novembro. It is an example of the all-too-common practice of leaving historic buildings to rot so they can be torn down to create space for new and \u201cbetter\u201d architecture. Since legislation forbids the demolition of known historical buildings, it\u2019s not unusual for owners to leave them to decompose like this.</p> <h2><strong>Moment in history</strong></h2> <p>Fritz, Joinville\u2019s unlikely city mascot \u2013 a seven-foot-long alligator \u2013 was found dead, floating in the Cachoeira River in May 2015. While a seemingly a trivial affair (a dead animal in a city river is not usually a huge historical event for most cities), but for the last 15 years the reptile was one of the incentives to reduce pollution on the river. After all, there aren\u2019t many cities who can claim to have a live alligator as their mascot. The sad news was followed by a report showing that there are far more alligators on the river than just Fritz and his two mates, Jaca and Lacoste, and sightings of other gators in the river lead to doubts over the death of the beloved mascot. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq75O6WtIZA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qq75O6WtIZA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Best local artist</strong> </h2> <p>Novelist, journalist, and comic book writer <a href=\"https://garotadistraida.wordpress.com/\">Vanessa Bencz</a> rose to prominence in 2014 with her graphic novel <em>Menina Distra\u00edda </em>(Girl Distracted), which deals with bullying and emotional pressure in schools, including from teachers.

Both are gathering spots for rising poets, writers and protesters, with gatherings and <em>Saraus </em>(an event held to promote artistic expression) most Fridays. Another option are the <em>Ocupa Cidadela</em> gatherings on the Cidadela Cultural near the Art Museum. Announced over Facebook and organised by local social movements, those events are marked by alt bands and discussion of social issues.</p> <p> While the National Immigration and Colonisation Museum is a must-see, at night the area around it is best avoided. Poor lighting make the beautiful Palm Street one of the most crime-ridden areas of the city centre after dark. </p> <h2><strong>What does your city do better than anywhere else?</strong></h2> <p>For most locals, Joinville is a city of two things: industry, and more industry. But for most outsiders and especially<em> </em>for a week and a half per year, Joinville shows its true colours and its real talent: dancing. Joinville hosts the only Bolshoi Ballet School outside Russia and the world\u2019s largest dance festival, hosted yearly in late July, the <a href=\"http://www.festivaldedanca.com.br/\">Festival de Dan\u00e7a de Joinville</a> hosts over 6,000 dancers in various styles, from the classics to modern street and urban dancing. The festival has taken place annually since 1985, and is growing in popularity each year. The Bolshoi School opened in 2000, and in 2005 the festival was honoured as the largest in the world by the Guinness Book of Records.</p> <h2><strong>How green is your city?</strong></h2> <p>We are slowly improving our city\u2019s green credentials. Once the most polluted river in the state, the Cachoeira River might be the best example of how Joinville is cleaning itself up and changing the old ways of the past. Beginning in 2001, the river has seen progressive changes, with new legislation against chemical pollution, changes in sewage treatment (which rose from less than 3% of the city in 1999 to 40% today) and public awareness, spurred on in part by our former reptilian mascot.</p> <h2>Smell of the city?</h2> <p>Given the pollution in the river, the old chemical smell near its banks has been replaced by a (still terrible) earthy odour, and the formerly toxic waterway now hosts schools of fish, cranes, alligators, capybaras and even fishing bats. But where the stench is concerned, there is still much more to be improved. The rest of Joinville has your average urban fragrance, except when it rains \u2013 then the whole city has a peculiar earthy pong that isn\u2019t quite as unpleasant as the river\u2019s smell, but your nostrils will certainly notice it.<br></p> <p><strong>Five to follow</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chuvaacida.info/\">Chuva \u00c1cida</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessiemichels/\">Jessiemichels</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlesvoos?lang=pt\">Charlesvoos</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EEEguaaa/?fref=ts&amp;__mref=message_bubble\">\u00c9\u00c9\u00c9\u00e9guaaa</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Metranca/?fref=ts\">Metranca</a></p> <h2>From me</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23045d1003660c1e61206882d50249089f29b9a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23045d1003660c1e61206882d50249089f29b9a9/0_400_2827_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joinville journalist, Pedro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joinville journalist, Pedro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scheila Silveira</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pedro Leal writes on pop culture and politics in the city of Joinville and translates independent books for a living.

But amid all this desolation Trump gains three things. He fuels doubt and fear, leaving people vulnerable; he denigrates his opposition en masse, blaming the world on them; and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage. </p> <h2>Embiggen big league</h2> <p>Like a man who once took <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/04/media/donald-trump-fingers-hands/\">a joke</a> about the size of his hands too hard, Trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible, from his never-proven $10bn worth (Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/09/28/the-definitive-look-at-donald-trumps-wealth-new/#3d4c500d7e2d\">estimates</a> $3.7bn) to crowds at his rallies and his success in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-fact-check-debate-polls-us-jobs\">meaningless</a> internet polls.</p> <p>This self-inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork.

He ignores that reporters quote him extensively, call his campaign for comment, interview his supporters, his rival\u2019s campaign and independent voters and experts. He often cites news stories about Clinton, and even praised fact-checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood.</p> <p>At every rally, Trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience, even though his campaign <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/how-donald-trump-bent-television-to-his-will\">forces cameras to stay within a small pen</a>, where they pan to show the crowd \u2013 as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see. Only one camera at each event stays fixed on Trump: the shared \u201cpool\u201d camera, whose footage networks share and which stays on Trump so as not to miss his speech.</p> <p>Last week, NBC\u2019s Katy Tur, a target for criticism from the podium, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgolden/status/794024376496553985\">noted</a> that Trump \u201chas joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a shtick that he does to rile up his base,\u201d she said, \u201cto give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor, to give them an excuse to berate someone that\u2019s not Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s scorched earth insults, like his attacks on other institutions, try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place. But while most Americans still respect <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/7177/americans-respect-military-honor-veterans.aspx\">other institutions</a> that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-suggests-fire-the-generals-227862\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/19/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-prisoner-of-war\">has</a> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-father-fallen-soldier-ive-made-lot/story?id=41015051\">demeaned</a>, the press was vulnerable.

No evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/donald-trump-fact-check-rigged-election-voter\">decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible</a> \u2013 but the claim gives Trump something to blame failure on besides himself.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/tech/science/watchdog-earth/2016/10/10/trump-looks-burn-coal-1000-years/91850954/\">he wants to burn coal indefinitely</a> because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">he denies the climate change consequences</a>. Trump also wants to <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-zero-out-federal-clean-energy-56cca794790#.rdszdpyie\">eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-tax-plan-now-favors-the-ultra-rich-even-more/\">cut taxes predominantly for the most wealthy</a>, build a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602494/bad-math-props-up-trumps-border-wall/\">costly and pointless border wall</a>, engage in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-tab-166-billion-121500\">expensive mass deportations</a>, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/trump-dodd-frank-wall-street/\">deregulate the financial industry</a>. Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/\">extensive policy plans</a> are <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/3/13318750/hillary-clinton-vision-government\">effectively the opposite</a> of Trump\u2019s.<br></p> <p>Many are puzzled that a candidate with such generally unpopular policy plans and who has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/01/the-kkks-official-newspaper-has-endorsed-donald-trump-for-president/\">endorsed by the KKK</a> could be supported by over 40% of Americans and have a chance at winning the presidency of the United States. Unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.shapingtomorrowsworld.org/lewandowskyTrumpUK.html\">we seem to have entered a post-truth era</a> in which facts simply don\u2019t matter. <br></p> <p>The two American political parties have become so different that <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13496688/swing-voters-dying-cartoon\">swing voters have virtually gone extinct</a> and most conservatives would vote for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Ed\">Mister Ed</a>, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump\u2019s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree.<br></p> <h2><strong>Trump wants to regress to the white male-dominated 1950s<br></strong></h2> <p>The Trump campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate\u2019s words and his supporters\u2019 feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s.</p> <p>In the 1950s, only about <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/feb/wk3/art03.htm\">one-third of women participated in the American work force</a>, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement\">the Civil Rights Movement</a>. The tobacco industry created the playbook followed by the fossil fuel industry today:<a href=\"http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/21/2/87.full\"> spread misinformation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/\">sow doubt</a> to keep the public consuming its deadly products.<a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html\"> Nearly half of Americans smoked cigarettes</a> in the 1950s (as compared to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/\">under 17% today</a>). The tobacco industry <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf\">already knew that smoking caused cancer</a>, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing.<br></p> <p>These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for \u2013 an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump\u2019s base are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/04/the-similarities-between-trump-support-and-climate-denial\">the predominant climate science-denying group in the country</a>. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group\u2019s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited.</p> <h2><strong>Like it or not, the status quo is changing</strong></h2> <p>White, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they\u2019re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/qf-laborforce-10.htm\">approaching even footing with men in the labor force</a>. Even social norms are changing, for example with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-legal-supreme-court\">gay marriage becoming legal</a>.</p> <p>And of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/21/global-warming-continues-2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-ever-recorded\">the Earth\u2019s climate itself is changing rapidly</a> due to human-caused global warming, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/oct/24/the-atmosphere-is-being-radicalized-by-climate-change\">causing all sorts of negative consequences</a>. Climate scientists are <a href=\"http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2016/11/dont-make-a-choice-that-your-children-will-regret/\">pleading with American voters not to make a choice our children will regret</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>You have a fateful choice to make.

Only by continuing the progress we\u2019ve made toward cutting carbon pollution can we slow global warming.

But like every country, there are also dark periods in its past; for example, in the treatment of minorities and women as second-class citizens. Donald Trump aims to return America to those deplorable periods, and to put the world on a path toward a catastrophic future by undoing the progress we\u2019ve made in tackling climate change.</p> <p>The world is counting on Americans not to make a catastrophically wrong choice in tomorrow\u2019s election.<br></p>",

She was not a diary keeper by habit. Nor was she at that time an established writer who might consider any of it fit for publication. She did it for herself, and for her family; perhaps to try and piece together a coherent picture of what she felt was an incalculable disaster to come.

We were surrounded by enemy forces at each border and in every country on the other side of the Baltic Sea. But we were told not to worry, that \u201cthe war won\u2019t come to Sweden\u201d. And I think I believed that. I had every reason to trust my mother, I always did. It seemed quite reasonable to us that we, for some reason, had escaped the great danger that threatened the world outside.</p> <p>On 5 September 1942 my mother noted: \u201cThe war is three years old and I have not celebrated its birthday. We\u2019ve all found our attitude to the war gradually changing. We used to talk about it all the time; now we see it as a necessary evil, to be thought of and talked about as little as possible.\u201d</p> <p>My memories of that period of my life are rather faded. I seem to recall an atmosphere of drab colourlessness in the streets of Stockholm. The winters were extremely cold and the pavements encumbered with huge stacks of wood, for heating. There were few people about, and almost no motor traffic.</p> <p>I was an indoor child, not adventurous and outgoing like my brother. I preferred to stay close to my family at home, reading, writing and drawing. I enjoyed skating, though, on the ice rink in the park nearby. And my mother and I went skiing in a wood not far from where we lived.</p> <p>The summers were bright and happy, despite the war; always warm and sunny in my memory. We would spend July at my father\u2019s parents\u2019 house in the Stockholm archipelago, bathing in the sea, learning to swim and cycle. In August I would stay with my cousins at the farm that my other grandfather was the tenant of, in my mother\u2019s birthplace, Sm\u00e5land. We helped with harvesting, as much as little children can, weeding beets, driving horse carts across the fields, delivering stakes to the farm workers. To me, my grandparents\u2019 and my uncle\u2019s homes were paradise, and gave me a valuable insight into the countryside of my mother\u2019s childhood \u2013 a world I came to recognise when I read her books, years later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/02/the-10-best-pippi-longstocking-quotes\">The 10 best Pippi Longstocking quotes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her books. At the time there were none published, and none intended. My mother for some years had been supplementing her income by selling children\u2019s tales to Christmas magazines, but there was no author\u2019s ambition linked to it. It is obvious from her wartime diaries that she had a talent for journalism (at 19 she had worked as an assistant reporter for a daily newspaper in her hometown). And we children knew that she had a great talent for telling stories. Bedtime was always connected with her reading aloud, or making up stories. She read us all the well-known children\u2019s books, but also the classics \u2013 RL Stevenson, Dickens and Thackeray, as well as modern humorists such as PG Wodehouse.</p> <p>But who could have known that one day her books would come to be regarded as some of the finest children\u2019s literature ever written, translated into more than 90 languages? That her story about a small red-haired girl with extraordinary physical strength would sell millions of copies was something she could never have foreseen in these days.</p> <p>I was ill in bed for a long period in 1941, my first school year. I was bored, and kept begging my mother to tell me stories. One evening she said, exhausted: \u201cBut what more can I tell you?\u201d An answer came bursting forth, in an attempt to keep her by me: \u201cTell me about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">Pippi Longstocking</a>!\u201d It was a name out of the blue, only a child\u2019s play on words.

I have always stood for honesty, integrity and the truth. The people deserve no less, especially from this chamber. It goes to the very heart of our democracy.

Day told an official of the finance department on January 25 2016 that, in the complicated financial arrangements surrounding the building, that he, Day, retained the loan from the National Australia Bank. </p> <p>He told the department that Fullarton Investments was to receive rent from the commonwealth to cover Day\u2019s occupancy in the building \u201cthen make vendor payments to me using those funds. No rent, no vendor finance payments,\u201d Day tells finance official <strong>Shane McGaughey </strong>on 25 January.<br></p> <p>Then there is correspondence between the special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, and Day in early August. </p> <p>In this correspondence Day characterises the arrangements with the building in the following terms:<strong> \u201cI have an agreement with someone else who has an agreement with the crown.\u201d</strong> This explanation is provided by Day to Ryan in the event \u201cthe department pulls the pecuniary interest card\u201d.</p> <p>In this email on 7 August, Day says he has spoken to finance about the pecuniary interest issue, and told them it isn\u2019t relevant.<br></p> <p>Ryan clearly disagrees with this and seeks further advice. Day also furnishes him with further particulars. </p> <p>In this email exchange on 29 August, Day says he has not been given clear advice by either the department, or by the special minister of state when he was elected in 2013 (which was <strong>Michael Ronaldson</strong>) on the problems associated with him having some kind of financial relationship with the building which houses his electoral office.<br></p> <p><strong>Bob Day</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Their advice basically centred on the principle that it was \u201cnot a good look\u201d for a senator to own his or her own office.

Day gave a guarantee to the bank over the mortgage so that essentially if the commonwealth doesn\u2019t pay rent to the company that owned the building, Day or his trust has to pay.<br></p> <p>Ryan said that may lead to the conclusion that Day has an indirect pecuniary interest in the lease, which would make him ineligible to be in the Senate.

Under clause 5 of the bill, <strong>the question to be asked would be \u2018Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry</strong>?\u2019. The result of the plebiscite would be determined by whether more than 50% of the votes cast are in favour or not in favour of the plebiscite proposal under clause 6 of the bill. The bill would also provide that, should this bill become an act, the writ for the plebiscite must be issued within 120 days after the act commences.</li> <li>Clause 15 of the <strong>bill would require the establishment of two committees, each comprising five members of Parliament and five citizens. These committees will be known as the Committee for the Yes Case and the Committee for the No Case</strong> and will be appointed jointly by the attorney general and the special minister of state. Each committee will have two government members (one of whom will be the chair), two opposition members and one crossbench member. Each committee would receive $7.5m in public funding to conduct official yes and no campaigns and the ability to receive up to $1,500 in tax deductible gifts from donors. </li> <li>The Electoral Commission will be responsible for overseeing the vote under clause 7 to ensure Australian voters are informed about the procedural elements of the plebiscite, <strong>the Electoral Commission will prepare and distribute to households in Australia general information about how to vote in the plebiscite</strong>. This is appropriate given the role of the Electoral Commission as an independent impartial body responsible for overseeing parliamentary elections.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:35:39.454Z\">at 11.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-581fb8d5e4b07ceadb3a30e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-06T23:13:42.406Z\">11.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The special minister of state, <strong>Scott Ryan</strong>, is now speaking to the marriage equality plebiscite bill.</p> <p>It is mostly mechanics but makes a quick political point that this is the first government to bring this (marriage equality) matter to the parliament.

As I fell in the Senate doors in a mess of earphones streaming <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> from ABC AM, I almost ran into the other Malcolm, smiling sweetly next to the security check. <strong>Malcolm Roberts</strong>\u2019 office has released an alert for a press conference for One Nation at 9am. This causes reporters to prick up their ears because One Nation senator<strong> Rod Culleton</strong> is expected to be referred to the high court this morning for a ruling on his eligibility. Former Family First senator <strong>Bob Day</strong> will also be referred. Will One Nation be talking about the future of Culleton, shearer of sheep and key collector? We shall await the hour of nine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, your prime minister has been on ABC AM. <br></p> <p>There are a couple of news points.</p> <p>Turnbull says if he accepted that the boats had stopped he would fall into the complacency that hit <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong>. It\u2019s a more challenging environment \u2013 with social media \u2013 than <strong>John Howard</strong> faced, says Turnbull.<br></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten</strong> is pandering to the left of his party on speaking out against the lifetime ban on asylum seekers who have come by boat, says the <strong>prime minister</strong>. (Shorten has yet to commit to voting against the legislation).</p> <p>Turnbull moves on to 18C. His words are a bit mashed but I will relay as much as possible so you can see the nuance. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ... has been, and <strong>I have sympathy for this argument</strong>... there is a view ... the bar that is set is too low. In other words, in particular that prescribing conduct which insults and offends is too much a restriction on free speech.

  "<p>The internet of shopping is finally here: magic -like buttons that when pressed have goods delivered to your door, without any need to log on to a website or get out your credit card. The branded Dash buttons are Amazon\u2019s latest offering to make it easier to shop, so I bought a load of them to find out whether it\u2019s the retail revolution we didn\u2019t even know we were looking for.</p> <p> There is no <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FAmazon-Dash-Button%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D10833773031&amp;id=114047X1572903\">Dash</a> button for ordering Dash buttons, so I looked though the 40 or so available and found eight for things I would normally buy . They\u2019re \u00a35 each, so I spent \u00a340 for this convenience, but with the promise \u00a35 would be taken off the first purchase made with each button making them free in the long run.</p> <p>A box of boxes turned up the next day. Each Dash button comes in a small cardboard box. Unpacking them and setting them up was straightforward if a little tedious. For each one you have to do a little song and dance with the Amazon app.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c4acafb87ab98e6b31a9d7c036b9e7d1f0ef20f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c4acafb87ab98e6b31a9d7c036b9e7d1f0ef20f/0_0_3522_2114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash buttons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My collection of eight Dash buttons ready to go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Select the option to set up a new Dash, tell it the password to your Wi-Fi network, select the product and quantity and then hit save. The delivery and payment information is pulled from your Amazon one-click order settings; there\u2019s no way to set per-item delivery locations.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take too long to set one up, but doing eight in one go got old really fast. Once activated though, that\u2019s you done. In future all you have to do is hit the button \u2013 although that proved to be too easy.</p> <p>Thankfully when you have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu3FTEmN-eg\">pushed the button</a> you get until evening that day to cancel the order. When you\u2019ve made an order a notification pops up from the Amazon app on the device you set up the Dash buttons with, but you can and probably should activate that notification on every device you own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"theguardian.com\" data-alt=\"Amazon Dash button\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/11/07/Pushing-Dash-button-gimp-small.gif&quot; title=&quot;source: theguardian.com&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;\u00a0&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Push the button and wait for the green flash to tell you it\u2019s been successfully ordered.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first time the notification saved my bacon was when I installed the Dash buttons. They come with a sticky strip on the back and a small black hanging bracket that you can attach to a hook or similar. I chose to stick them in place out the way, next to where I\u2019d normally store whatever it was. In the bathroom cabinet for toothbrush heads and Listerine, under the sink for bin bags, cleaning fluid, that kind of thing.</p> <p>By the time I\u2019d managed to stick them in place I\u2019d already ordered a set of new toothbrush heads by accident, and very nearly some toilet roll and washing tablets, none of which I needed. A couple of taps in the app and the order was cancelled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4436af170e5d465d91ec4d71292a30dad73f6108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4436af170e5d465d91ec4d71292a30dad73f6108/0_0_4818_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon dash orders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Were any of them ordered by accident?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I felt good about the installation. They were stuck out the way, inconspicuous and convenient and everything was fine. That was, until they started ordering stuff on their own. It turns out that the adhesive on the back of the Dash buttons doesn\u2019t like sticking to unpainted MDF surfaces within cupboards.</p> <p>The one I had stuck next to the stocks of shower gel, moisturiser and other bits fell off almost immediately within the cupboard, landing as it fell to the shelf surface below on an upstanding bottle of nail varnish ordering some foundation in the process. The first I knew of it was an order notification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"323269927122c7b13bf7a9fd682f82155c0dcdeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/323269927122c7b13bf7a9fd682f82155c0dcdeb/0_0_3576_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash button\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rimmel Dash button secured to unpainted MDF with the help of a Command poster strip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Presuming it was my fault I simply stuck it back in place with a bit more gusto, which lasted for about an hour before another ping and another tube of foundation to be cancelled. This was starting to get tedious.</p> <p>The Rimmel button was just the start of a trend. Over the next few days all but two of the buttons dropped off various metal, paint and wooden surfaces, some ordering products, others just making a nasty clang in the middle of the night and waking me up.</p> <p>In the end I took the nuclear option and stripped the adhesive gel off the back of the Dash buttons, which doesn\u2019t take long if you pull hard enough, and replaced them with poster mounting strips, which did the trick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a6fa122baef94589d2088ba14a1574dd8863e87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a6fa122baef94589d2088ba14a1574dd8863e87/0_0_2323_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash button\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pull hard enough and eventually the clear adhesive gel on the back will come off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once finally, safely attached to the walls it was a couple of weeks before I actually pushed any of the buttons on purpose. Then the toilet roll and mouthwash began to run out, so it was finally time to put them into action.</p> <p>Pressing the button was simple. Getting the delivery, however, was not. The trouble is that when setting up the toilet roll button the only option was for an order of 45 rolls. Normally I\u2019d buy eight at a time; our family doesn\u2019t go through toilet paper that quickly.</p> <p>In order to receive a package the size of 45 rolls I had to order it the day before I knew I would be at home to receive it. So I got up on Friday morning, hit both the Andrex and Listerine buttons and gleefully waited for them arrive on Saturday, my very first internet of things purchases.</p> <p>That\u2019s when the second round of trouble started. When I hit the button we were down to three rolls. But while the 1L of mouthwash arrived on Saturday as expected \u2013 in a big box, of course \u2013 the toilet roll did not. By Sunday morning with two toilet rolls left, the order was still \u201cpreparing for dispatch\u201d so I hit cancel, consoling myself that at least Tesco would provide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9070ee26887b4cc1d9d6abb0a10f7a72e8a274f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9070ee26887b4cc1d9d6abb0a10f7a72e8a274f0/0_0_3723_2234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"listerine in an amazon delivery box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OK, but where are the toilet rolls?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately Amazon said I couldn\u2019t cancel because it was already on its way, but on Monday it was still \u201cdispatching\u201d, so I tried cancelling again, to no avail. By Monday evening we were already a good chunk into our last toilet roll, with visions of having to resort to kitchen roll or yesterday\u2019s Guardian. To make matters worse I was off on holiday on Wednesday and was starting to have visions of 45 toilet rolls stuck outside my front door like a giant advert to burglars.</p> <p>Thankfully it arrived sometime on Tuesday. I came home to find it wedged behind a bin \u2013 luckily it didn\u2019t rain \u2013 meaning we\u2019ll be stocked until February at least. It was not the best first order experience. Subsequent orders for toothbrush heads, Dettol, dishwasher tablets were less painful, primarily because I got most of them delivered when one of the family was home for some other reason. But it certainly wasn\u2019t a case of simply hit it and forget it. </p> <p>You can get deliveries sent to an Amazon locker if there are any within striking distance, but not everything can fit in one - there\u2019s no way the toilet rolls would have. And by the time you\u2019ve gone out to a locker to pick up some Listerine you might just as well have gone to the supermarket. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0812731385fbef174a5ac0a3f948f8f90e9c332c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0812731385fbef174a5ac0a3f948f8f90e9c332c/0_0_4758_2855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash button\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two buttons remain stuck to the underside of the kitchen sink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washing tablets, like toilet roll, presented a scale problem. While the tablets arrived on time, they arrived in serious quantity: 180 tabs across six boxes, which at a rate of about one or two a week, is going to last me at least 18 months and feels like I\u2019ve turned my house into a warehouse full of them. The Rimmel button, for a product that would fit through the letter box, has still never been intentionally pressed.</p> <p>Amazon pitched the Dash buttons as a way of avoiding the need to fill up your house with large stocks of the boring things in life, but when the order quantities are vast, the next day delivery fails or you simply don\u2019t have someone there everyday to receive deliveries, they\u2019re more trouble than they\u2019re worth.</p> <p>Perhaps if you\u2019re part of the metropolitan elite and your serviced apartment comes with a concierge, or you work from home or someone is always in, the brain-free push of the Dash button is a great idea. But the convenience of pushing a button is outweighed by the hassle for me.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be keeping some of them for smaller items - they are great for toothbrush heads and bin liners \u2013 and getting them delivered to work but the Andrex button and any others for heavy goods are going: it\u2019s just easier to go to a supermarket and pick them up, or order them in a big weekly online grocery shop.</p> <p>The novelty of Amazon dash buttons wore off even faster than the adhesive backing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19f99f5d20dc2262652cb75829b21517615320b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19f99f5d20dc2262652cb75829b21517615320b/0_0_4595_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon dash buttons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out the way on the inside of the bathroom cabinet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/25/amazon-fire-hd-8-review-2016-budget-tablet-fireos\">Amazon Fire HD 8 review: cutting the right corners for a decent \u00a390 tablet</a></strong><br></li> </ul> <p><sup><em>Some Guardian articles and galleries contain links to various products and services.

Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted.

Although he admitted they were complex negotiations, he claimed that her unwillingness to budge was down to an obsession over getting the net migration numbers down as home secretary.</p> <p>May said she hoped that her three-day visit to India would pave the way for a future trade arrangement after Brexit as she sought to break down barriers. However, she suggested she did not think a more generous visa system was necessary. </p> <p>\u201cTrade is an important part of our relationship with India. India is the third-biggest investor into the UK \u2013 second-biggest creator of private sector jobs in the UK. And the UK is the biggest G20 investor into India, but there is more we can do,\u201d she said.</p> <p>May was joined by a delegation of business representatives for a trip during which she attended the India-UK tech summit in Delhi with Prime Minister Narendra Modi before a bilateral meeting.</p> <p>Modi used a speech to heavily hint that he wanted young people to be more able to travel abroad to study, after stricter rules in Britain on how long graduates can stay contributed to a halving of the number of Indian students coming to the UK to study over five years. </p> <p>\u201cEducation is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities,\u201d he said. </p> <p>May used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with India, laying out plans for India to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in British airports.</p> <p>\u201cThat means for Indian nationals who frequently come to the UK \u2013 and who fuel growth in both our countries \u2013 the entry process will become significantly easier. Fewer forms to fill out, access to EU/EEA passport control, swifter passage through our airports,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from India to the UK, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it \u201ccreates a rising tide that lifts all boats\u201d. </p> <p>She said Britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: \u201cBecause we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world; they stagnate, they get poorer, they don\u2019t protect their people, they make them worse off.\u201d</p> <p>Adding that while countries like India did not owe Britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success. </p> <p>May also said she did not need to wait to leave the EU to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries. </p> <p>However, she had earlier made clear she was aware of sentiment in the UK about immigration, and her promise to stick to an ambition of reducing the net migration figure to the tens of thousands would require cutting the numbers from all over the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/05/trade-uk-india-suffer-double-hit-theresa-may-visit-brexit-sterling\">Trade between UK and India to suffer double hit, says business chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The response could disappoint those of Indian origin in the UK and those with links to other Commonwealth countries, after Brexit campaigners suggested they would benefit from an immigration system that no longer discriminated in favour of Europeans.

It will allow passengers to come through the e-Passport gates, usually reserved for Britons and Europeans, and without a requirement to complete a landing card.</p> <p>Only nine other countries currently benefit from the scheme, including the US, but they are not places where travellers need visas. </p> <p>The government will also offer a group of high net-worth Indians access to a bespoke visa and immigration service called the Great Club. That doesn\u2019t offer any guarantees but means individuals \u2013 and their immediate family members \u2013 are provided with a personal account manager to help them secure visas more quickly and smoothly.</p> <p>However, the offer falls short of a pilot set up by the prime minister during a recent trip to China for a G20 meeting that cut the price of two-year tourist visas from \u00a3330 to \u00a387.</p> <p>Ahead of this trip, Chandrajit Banerjee, the director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, told the Financial Times that he was \u201cvery, very hopeful\u201d that the prime minister would offer a similar liberalisation to Indian visitors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/theresa-may-obsessed-with-controlling-immigration-says-vince-cable\">Theresa May 'obsessed' with immigration control, says Vince Cable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It followed a letter from senior executives including the heads of Heathrow airport and Virgin Atlantic calling on the government to cut the cost of tourist visas for India \u2013 saying that 400,000 Indians visited Britain last year spending \u00a3433m. However, they warned that France had become a more popular destination. </p> <p>May is likely to address this issue during her talks but a source played down the issue, stressing that the Chinese price cut is a pilot scheme.</p> <p>The registered travellers scheme will initially be offered to Indians travelling on a work visa, with the possibility of rolling it out to other routes in the future.

  "<p>In the city of Herat in western Afghanistan, a small but determined contingent of young women are quietly learning to code. They grow more empowered, creative and confident every day, says Fereshteh Forough, who set up after-school programme Code to Inspire \u2013 the country\u2019s first coding school for women \u2013 in November 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of coding and tech is that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you are \u2013 with one computer and the internet they can reach the world and work without even leaving the house,\u201d says the 29-year-old, an Iranian-born Afghan refugee who returned to Afghanistan with her family after the Taliban regime fell in 2001.</p> <p>Code to Inspire would have been unthinkable before then, when under Taliban rule, girls\u2019 education was illegal and the internet was banned. Code to Inspire is looking to the future. So far it has taken on 50 students between the ages of 15 and 25 in Herat and aims to expand into Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif. Students are learning the language to develop websites, creating their own mobile apps and exploring gaming technology.</p> <p>In a highly conservative country where <a href=\"http://codetoinspire.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 85%</a> of women have had no formal education, and <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 16%</a> of the workforce are women, in many ways these students are the lucky ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa09a46b4e976bab78ca555c2bd6e5dc07d68d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa09a46b4e976bab78ca555c2bd6e5dc07d68d9c/0_11_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Girls in Afghanistan working on laptops\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The beauty of coding is that they can reach the world and work without even leaving the house.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Code to Inspire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEducation for women is still a very sensitive topic, it is a very male-dominated culture,\u201d says Forough. Even in strict families, where young women might still have limitations on their independence, coding offers the chance to work from home, she points out.</p> <p>When studying computer science at Herat University, Forough encountered lots of problems as one of the only female students. \u201cI was a very vocal student; the majority of my classmates were male and a lot of the time they didn\u2019t like to see a girl being so vocal in the classroom,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Forough became one of the first female mentors to teach Java. More than 200 students were taking the class \u2013 but only 10 turned up for the first few weeks. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to learn from a girl \u2013 they didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be capable.\u201d</p> <p>With her own experiences in mind, the first priority was to find a safe and secure location to hold the coding classes \u2013 \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to create any unnecessary trouble for the women or their families\u201d. The Code to Inspire team has worked hard to foster good relations with the local community and has won the approval of the students\u2019 fathers and brothers. </p> <p>Among the students is 20-year-old Heydeh, who aspires to become a professional web developer. \u201cI have big dreams, I want to make websites to support local people with their work so they are no longer forced to turn to other countries for help,\u201d she explains. </p> <p>\u201cI was excited to come to Code to Inspire because coding is not too familiar [in Afghanistan] and women cannot normally raise their voices \u2013 but we are proving women have that power and we can talk with the world via coding.\u201d She says her family were skeptical at first, but now they want to help her realise a future beyond just \u201chousework and marriage\u201d.</p> <p>One student has already created a delivery app for a local restaurant, while others are working on how they can build platforms to promote their country to potential tourists.</p> <h2>Girls can code</h2> <p>Other organisations are recognising the potency of nurturing female coders in Afghanistan, too. In April 2016 non-profit <a href=\"https://womanity.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Womanity Foundation</a> launched Girls can Code in two of Kabul\u2019s biggest girls\u2019 schools. Forty students between the ages of 16-18 are enrolled in the classes, which take place before and after school.</p> <p>\u201cCoding empowers girls by teaching them how to use their creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills to develop solutions,\u201d says Elizabeth Rector, programme leader. \u201cThrough this process they build confidence and learn to rely on their own abilities to find solutions, and these skills are forever with them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/2015/apr/14/coding-isnt-just-for-the-next-zuckerberg-it-can-help-dentists-too\">Will learning to code help you get a job?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is global shortage of skilled tech workers expected in the coming years, Rector adds. In Afghanistan the population\u2019s access to the internet <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\">is currently only 7%</a> and businesses need to prepare for the coming growth in internet access.</p> <p>\u201cInvesting in educating girls in subjects like coding, where we expect there to be abundant, good-paying jobs is key to the future of Afghanistan. With a full range of talent to tap into, Afghanistan\u2019s economy can grow and become less reliant on foreign aid and retain ambitious young women,\u201d says Rector.</p> <p>Female app developers are already emerging in Kabul and Herat \u2013 in May, 45 young women submitted mobile app ideas at Girls Make Apps workshops, organised by Herat Technovation. Universities and other technical schools are working to increase female enrolment and organisations such as USAid are investing in matching young women to ICT employment opportunities, according to Rector.</p> <h2>Travel the world and reach for the stars</h2> <p>For Afghan women aspiring to get into tech, Forough is testament that it can be done. So is her former classmate, Roya Mahboob, who founded IT consulting firm Afghan Citadel Software Co in 2010, making her one of the country\u2019s first female tech chief executives. She also launched <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://digitalcitizenfund.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Citizen Fund</a>, a nonprofit which helps girls and women in developing countries gain access to technology.</p> <p>Mahboob says setting up her business wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cIt was very hard to establish a client base at first \u2013 many men didn\u2019t want to do business with women, even though we could bring them clients,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When pitching for business, the fact she is the chief executive of her own company is regularly met with outright disbelief, and it hasn\u2019t been uncommon for clients to refuse to pay for work carried out. Mahboob and her team have even been followed, spied on and threatened. Undeterred, she has made it her priority to hire female programmers and bloggers from the beginning. Today more than half of her staff are women \u2013 and business is thriving in Afghanistan and beyond its borders.</p> <p>\u201cWhile cultural barriers threaten the dreams and aspirations of young women and girls, the opportunities they can find through the internet and technologies show them a larger world than the one that they have always known,\u201d says the entrepreneur. \u201cThey can travel the world and reach for the stars, without even having a passport.\u201d</p> <p>The story in Afghanistan feeds into a wider struggle going on throughout the world to get more women into tech. In an increasingly digital world, it will be at the heart of unlocking greater equality, empowerment and economic stability in every country.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

Meanwhile uncertainty grows, as does interest in emigration, especially among young professionals. Imagine you have a son or daughter who, dismayed by the referendum, is thinking of moving abroad. Naturally you would prefer them to stay, but how would you convince them? Already their family will suffer the usual pressures \u2013 housing, health, education; now, for the foreseeable future, they will face new potential instabilities, whether of income or employment.</p> <p>The commonsense Britons seem to have developed a taste for the roulette wheel. Mass immigration was a gamble, and the referendum a second blind leap to escape the consequences of the first. Now it turns out the government has been dicing with the constitution. How long could it take to sort everything out? Two years, five, a decade? Nobody knows. The referendum was a game played by high rollers, but the outcome means we\u2019re all gamblers now, as people like my imaginary son or daughter find themselves forced to place bets on their futures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammond-not-lone-voice-caution-on-brexit\">Cabinet tensions grow as ministers back Hammond's warning over hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How could David Cameron have taken such a risk?

It\u2019s not just a mess Cameron has left her, it\u2019s an ammunition dump that could go up at any moment: the post-Brexit economy, Scotland, our EU negotiating team, the Tory party itself.

The only fun there would be that in 2020 he could be up against Corbyn: Laurel against Hardy, the Labour straight man against the Tory joker.

It\u2019s the intolerance that\u2019s un-British, and if I myself were thinking of going (I\u2019m not), it would be that that tipped me over.

  "<p>India\u2019s prime minister has hinted to Theresa May that Britain needs to open up its universities to more of its students.</p> <p>At a conference only hours after the British PM arrived in Delhi on a trade mission aimed at boosting economic ties, Narendra Modi appeared to tackle one of India\u2019s biggest demands of the UK.</p> <p>Addressing a UK-India tech summit he said: \u201cEducation is vital for our students and will define our engagement in a shared future. We must therefore encourage greater mobility and participation of young people in education and research opportunities.\u201d<br></p> <p>The comments were seen as underlining the importance that Indians place on the ability of their students and highly skilled professionals to move across the world. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/06/india-warns-uk-immigration-policy-wreck-post-brexit-trade-deal\">India warns UK immigration policy could wreck trade deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/06/uk-will-not-offer-more-work-visas-to-indian-nationals-says-may\">Earlier May had reduced Indian hopes for a more liberal visa system</a>, under which more of its nationals wanting to work in the UK could do so, by arguing that the current offer was generous enough. </p> <p>Speaking on the way to Delhi for her first bilateral meeting outside Europe, the prime minister argued Britain was already able to attract the \u201cbrightest and best\u201d from outside the EU.</p> <p>\u201cThe figures show that we issue more work visas to India than I think US, Australia and China put together. Nine out of 10 visa applications from India are already accepted. We have, I believe, a good system,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The comments could prove disappointing for some in the Indian government and business community who have argued for increased numbers, and the move could be key for any future trade deals. </p> <p>May used her speech to the tech summit to insist she wanted an open relationship with India, laying out plans for India to become the first visa country to be put on a registered traveller scheme which helps speed up the experience of visitors in British airports. </p> <p>\u201cThat means for Indian nationals who frequently come to the UK \u2013 and who fuel growth in both our countries \u2013 the entry process will become significantly easier. Fewer forms to fill out, access to EU/EEA passport control, swifter passage through our airports,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Despite the reluctance to increase migration numbers from India to the UK, the prime minister delivered a passionate argument for free trade between the two countries arguing that it \u201ccreates a rising tide that lifts all boats\u201d. </p> <p>She said Britain was determined not to turn its back on the world, adding: \u201cBecause we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world. They stagnate, they get poorer, they don\u2019t protect their people, they make them worse off.\u201d</p> <p>Adding that while countries like India did not owe Britain a living, she said working together meant the greatest chance of success. </p> <p>May also said she did not need to wait to leave the EU to start discussions on how trade and investment could be boosted between the countries. </p> <p>She began the speech by insisting that India and the UK had a special link, listening \u201cto each other\u2019s music\u201d and eating each other\u2019s food, as well as sharing a love of cricket. </p>",
  "<p>Dark forces have been gathering against freedom of speech in Australia. They have been gathering for a very long time, but not quite where you might think.</p> <p>As parliament enters its last few weeks of the year some politicians and news organisations <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/07/malcolm-turnbull-says-qut-case-hurt-human-rights-commissions-credibility-on-18c\">have once again taken up the attack</a> againstsection 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which prohibits offending, insulting, humiliating or intimidating someone on the grounds of race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/07/malcolm-turnbull-says-qut-case-hurt-human-rights-commissions-credibility-on-18c\">Malcolm Turnbull says QUT case hurt Human Rights Commission's credibility on 18C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The referral of complaints about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/07/second-bill-leak-cartoon-cleared-by-australian-press-council\">Bill Leak\u2019s now infamous Indigenous cartoon</a> and the summary dismissal of a case brought by a Queensland academic have led to the latest round of the fight. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/07/malcolm-turnbull-says-qut-case-hurt-human-rights-commissions-credibility-on-18c\">prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull</a>, appears to be gauging support for a parliamentary committee to examine the section as conservative forces rally to wind it back.</p> <p>Reams of column inches and television segments have been devoted to the topic. The sheer volume of content could make you think that people are being locked up left, right and centre by the Australian Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>There are plenty of legal experts who agree that the section could do with changes. But is it the threat some politicians and commentators are suggesting? These are civil, not criminal cases and complaints are rarely successfully invoked. Most cases do not get to the federal court. The Queensland federal circuit court\u2019s decision to summarily dismiss the academic\u2019s case shows that frivolous cases will not be taken up.</p> <p>So where does the real battleground lie for free speech in Australia? </p> <p><strong>1. Offensive language</strong></p> <p>Most states and territories have sweeping offences that allow police to summarily charge Australians with offensive language and behaviour. These powers are used so frequently in New South Wales alone that on average in 2015 four people were charged every day with offensive language. </p> <p>These charges can be applied capriciously. Indigenous Australians are disproportionately impacted; 567 out of the 1,600 charges brought by police were made against Indigenous Australians in 2015.</p> <p>And they can also target legitimate expressions of speech. Police frequently charge protesters with using offensive language. Last month <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-to-use-the-f-word-in-political-protest-67705\">a magistrate threw out a charge against a protester</a> who said the word \u201cfuck\u201d during a marriage equality protest against Fred Nile\u2019s supporters.</p> <p><strong>2. Defamation laws</strong></p> <p>Defamation laws remain one of the biggest threats to freedom of speech in Australia. Journalists face major impediments in their reporting owing to limited protections and defences under defamation laws, as well as the absence of any express constitutional protection for speech. The former treasurer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/30/joe-hockey-wins-200000-from-fairfax-in-treasurer-for-sale-defamation-case\">Joe Hockey\u2019s defamation case</a> against the Sydney Morning Herald would never have made it through the door in the US, but in Australia it led to a $200,000 payout by Fairfax Media. The laws are out of reach for most Australians owing to costs and so are often used by those with deep enough pockets to afford the legal fees.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just news organisations who bear the brunt. Australians who use social media are increasingly being prosecuted for defamatory posts. Without meaningful reform of the current uniform defamation laws, these cases will only increase in their frequency.</p> <p><strong>3. Gags on immigration detention staff</strong></p> <p>The Australian Border Force Act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/01/detention-centre-staff-speak-out-in-defiance-of-new-asylum-secrecy-laws\">bans staff within the detention system</a> from speaking out on matters of public interest. Under the act a former detention staff members could be prosecuted for disclosures to news organisations. Even the mere act of making a recording could see them in breach. In September the secretary of the immigration department issued a determination <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/20/doctors-freed-to-speak-about-australias-detention-regime-after-u-turn\">excluding doctors from this offence</a>. This was a positive move but many other workers remain within its scope.</p> <p><strong>4. Limited whistleblower protection</strong></p> <p>The Australian Border Force Act is dwarfed by the sweeping scale of a little-known section of the Crimes Act that criminalises \u201cunauthorised disclosures\u201d by all commonwealth officers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/04/qut-racial-discrimination-and-why-the-liberals-fight-over-18c-will-lead-to-a-sequel\">QUT, racial discrimination and why the Liberals' fight over 18C will lead to a sequel | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This offence is so broad that almost any government officer \u2013 and any disclosure they make \u2013 could be captured by it and face two years in jail. It has been used to prosecute whistleblowers. And a number of journalists\u2019 stories relating to the immigration detention regime have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/22/journalists-reporting-on-asylum-seekers-referred-to-australian-police\">referred for prosecution to the Australian federal police</a> under this section. There\u2019s no public interest defence or requirement that the disclosure has actually caused harm.</p> <p>The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended substantial changes to how it operates. These changes have been largely ignored by successive governments.</p> <p><strong>5. Restrictions on news organisations reporting on intelligence operations </strong></p> <p>There are heavy criminal penalties in place against news organisations reporting on special intelligence operations. It\u2019s an offence for anyone to disclose the details of such an operation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, irrespective of the public interest or whether the disclosure exposed wrongdoing. </p> <p><strong>6. Suppression orders and secret hearings</strong></p> <p>Australian courts have a peculiar affinity for suppression orders. It\u2019s common for judges to issue sweeping orders that lock the public out of hearings or reporting on key details of cases. Victoria is particularly renowned for the aggressive use of non-publication orders. Studies have shown a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/court-suppression-orders-still-issued-in-their-hundreds-in-victoria-20151010-gk611a.html\">staggering rate</a> of orders being made.</p>",
  "<p>Sharks are circling as the US prepares to vote, on the lookout for signs of American weakness and indecision around the world during the months-long transition period until the next president is firmly established in the White House. Call it a window of vulnerability.</p> <p>No matter whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, Barack Obama bequeaths a world fraught with danger. From Asia to the Middle East and eastern Europe, governments and forces hostile to US and the west <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/01/no-time-to-lose-why-the-next-president-must-move-quickly-to-reassert-u-s-power/\">may try to exploit America\u2019s power vacuum</a>. </p> <p>The problem is not new. Unlike in Britain, the US constitution does not allow a quick handover. Clinton or Trump will be sworn in at noon on 20 January 2017. Until then Obama remains in office, but as a \u201clame duck\u201d president his wishes are increasingly irrelevant.</p> <p>Once installed, it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments. The most important, such as national security adviser and the secretaries of defence and state, must be confirmed by Congress. This can be a contentious, lengthy process.</p> <p>The most disastrous transition was probably in 1860-61 between James Buchanan and his successor, Abraham Lincoln. During the interregnum, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths-about-why-the-south-seceded/2011/01/03/ABHr6jD_story.html\">seven states seceded from the Union</a>. When Lincoln came to office, he found the civil war already under way. </p> <p>Modern-day threats are mostly external (although some Trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he loses). North Korea is one of the most pressing. The dictatorship in Pyongyang has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons programme in recent months.</p> <p> North Korea\u2019s latest provocations include the testing of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-ballistic-missile\">submarine-launched ballistic missile</a> capable, in theory, of attacking the western US. The isolated regime has ignored stepped-up UN sanctions and is hardening its stance, determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37869993\"> Political upheavals in South Korea</a>, where the president faces pressure to resign, a tougher military posture adopted by Shinzo Abe\u2019s rightwing government in Japan, and the reluctance of China to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability. </p> <p> If Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s unpredictable leader, senses uncertainty in Washington, he may be tempted to fire a shot, literally or metaphorically, across the greenhorn president\u2019s bows \u2013 with incalculable consequences.</p> <p> China faces similar temptations. It has been sparring with the US navy in the South China Sea, where its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">expansionist maritime claims</a> and island-building have been ruled illegal by a UN court. Beijing is also squeezing Taiwan, whose new government its dislikes and whose de facto independence is underwritten by the US. </p> <p> Does Xi Jinping, China\u2019s all-powerful president, calculate he can use American distraction to his advantage? Some analysts suggest Xi would welcome a Trump presidency, because he and Trump think alike about national interest. Or maybe, scarily, he takes Trump for a fool he can bamboozle.</p> <p> Such considerations also loom large in the Middle East, where Russia seems intent on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/03/aleppo-braces-russian-assault-rebels-vow-defy-putin-ultimatum\">helping the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad win the civil war</a> before the next American president has a chance to change Obama\u2019s hands-off policy or impose peace terms. </p> <p> In lawless Libya, where UN efforts to foster a unity government are failing, more nasty surprises may be in store. If Islamic State is evicted from Raqqah and Mosul, Libya may become its new centre of operations. The Yemen conflict, involving Iran and Saudi Arabia, is another powder keg.</p> <p> Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s leader, could also use the US power vacuum to consolidate or advance Moscow\u2019s interests, as defined by the Kremlin, in Ukraine and the Baltic region, where tensions are already high. </p> <p> How would Nato respond, for example, to increased Russian military activity and cyber warfare along the border with Estonia or Latvia? The alliance would, as usual, look to Washington for a lead. But one might not be forthcoming.</p> <p> Trump regularly disparages Nato, suggesting he may cut US support, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37858513\">like other macho men such as actor Steven Seagal</a>, appears to admire Putin. For her part, Clinton would be loth to begin her new presidency with an old-style superpower confrontation. </p> <p> On top of all that, as the US transition looms, there are, as Donald Rumsfeld said, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns\">\u201cunknown unknowns\u201d</a>. If an unexpected, unforeseen international crisis suddenly arises, the American security safety net will be more full of holes than usual.</p>",
