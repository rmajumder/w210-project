He said BP had been allowed to explore for oil in the marine reserve after making almost half a billion dollars worth of commitments to do work in the area, and now it was walking away from them.</p> <p>He said he now expected BP to \u201cmake good\u201d some of those commitments in other ways. \u201cI\u2019ll be very interested in discussing with them in coming days what those plans might be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He criticised environmental groups that campaigned against the project. \u201cWhat does frustrate me is sometimes the workers in these industries, who tend to be fairly quiet, reticent types of people, aren\u2019t the ones on the radio or in the media telling their stories,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The government still believed the region could produce large amounts of oil and gas, he said. \u201cObviously there is still a lot of uncertainty about the area, but we remain confident of its long-term prospectivity and I\u2019ll be talking to some of those other companies about their plans in coming days,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Canavan was also asked about the effectiveness of the petroleum resource rent tax, after <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/only-5-of-oil-and-gas-companies-pay-resource-tax-20161010-grz470.html\">reports that just 5% of oil and gas projects</a> operating in Australia are paying the tax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/fears-australia-losing-billions-in-liquefied-natural-gas-tax-sparks-calls-for-inquiry\">Fears Australia losing billions in liquefied natural gas tax sparks calls for inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Tax Justice Network has warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/11/fears-australia-losing-billions-in-liquefied-natural-gas-tax-sparks-calls-for-inquiry\">Australia is set to blow another resources boom</a>, forgoing billions of dollars in potential tax revenue, because the PRRT is failing to collect adequate revenue from the explosion in liquefied natural gas exports.</p> <p>\u201c[The PRRT] is a profits-based tax and what happens, of course, is that resource developments take large upfront costs, particularly some of these LNG developments \u2026 that take some time before profits are realised,\u201d Canavan said.</p> <p>\u201cThis tax has delivered billions to the federal government over a number of decades, and it has underpinned the development of a massive industry in this country. </p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got to be very careful about making any changes, particularly to people that make massive investments.

  "<p>The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/11/pound-pressure-city-fears-hard-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live?page=with:block-57fcc0aee4b088a03a67d5ea#block-57fcc0aee4b088a03a67d5ea\">Sterling </a>recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/what-caused-pound-flash-crash-brexit-fallen-sterling\">flash crash last Thursday</a>, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee (MPC) in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-11T17:01:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Dollar against pound since Brexit vote\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-11T17:01:25/embed.html\">Dollar against pound since Brexit vote</a> </figure>  <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d Saunders told MPs on the treasury select committee.<br></p> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well contained, I would expect the MPC to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p>Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the leave campaign, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d</p>",

I think it\u2019s pretty much a cert but I am hoping that the Liberals do better now.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Spindlow, a local painter and decorator, is one of the few to criticise the town\u2019s former MP. \u201cI\u2019m a Farage man,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of toffs round here, I reckon they\u2019ll get in again because of that.\u201d</p> <p>Though even Clegg will admit victory is \u201ca mountain to climb\u201d, a close second, up from fourth in 2015, would help the Lib Dems test their messaging to Tory voters in preparation for seats they might be more able to win, particularly in the south-west, though the polls for the party nationally remain at a stubborn and desultory 8%.</p> <p> \u201cI think a lot of people here, who are traditional mainstream Conservative voters, don\u2019t want a hard Brexit,\u201d Clegg said. \u201cAnd so the byelection does assume a bigger importance: it\u2019s one of the ways in the strange political environment we are in now, that the public can now say that the government is embarking on a direction of travel with which we don\u2019t agree. Coming a good second, given where we were last May, would do that.\u201d</p>",

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>And that\u2019s all for tonight.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU.

Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So let\u2019s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/crash-pound-delusion-brexit-britain-flourish\">The crash in the pound punctures the delusion that Brexit Britain will flourish | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:38:44.324Z\">at 5.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fd0f1ee4b03b22b4fb2534\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:14:18.870Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. </strong></p> <p>It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling.</p> <ul> <li>Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019.<br></li> <li>A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK,<br></li> <li>A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. <br></li> <li>This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications.</li> <li>A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. </li> </ul> <p>The government says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner.</strong> Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. </p> <p>The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. </p> <p>Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fd07ace4b03b22b4fb2506\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:53:14.161Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 falls back from record highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit.</strong></p> <p>A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points.

  "<p>Even the darkest cloud has a silver lining and there is one definite upside to sterling\u2019s crash. Those Brexiters eager to reintroduce the imperial system of measurement can rename our heavily devalued pound the ounce. Because, make no mistake, the pound doesn\u2019t count for as much as it did in early summer. At the end of last week, financial information service Bloomberg ranked <a href=\"https://t.co/sCGF1LHpp1\" title=\"\">sterling among the 10 worst-performing currencies of the year</a>. The Argentinian peso, the Yemeni rial, the Haitian gourde: all have had a better 2016. Measured against a basket of the currencies of Britain\u2019s main trading partners, sterling is now weaker than after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\" title=\"\">Black Wednesday</a>, weaker than after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\">the 1992 ERM crisis</a>, weaker than after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-crisis\" title=\"\">the collapse of RBS and HBOS</a>. It&#xa0;is in fact&#xa0;about as weak as it has ever been. Whatever happens next, Liam Fox, Michael Gove and the rest have earned a place in the record books.</p> <p>The right wing of the Conservative party has thus engineered an 18% devaluation of the pound against the US dollar. The first big drop came after the EU referendum; the second followed directly from the Tory conference in Birmingham last week. This is itself a historic reversal: the Conservatives are meant to be the party of sound money. As&#xa0;Philip Stephens observes in his history <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/politics-and-the-pound-philip-stephens/1000873375\" title=\"\">Politics and the Pound</a> (which should be required reading for all A-level politics students), the Tories have often treated sterling\u2019s strength as a measure of national virility. It\u2019s Labour who are meant to be the louche Keynesians: the party of low interest rates and \u201cthe pound in your pocket\u201d. But what the <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/gnomes-of-zurich.asp\" title=\"\">Gnomes of Zurich</a> were to Harold Wilson, the fat-fingered traders and their algorithms are now to Theresa May.</p> <p>By prioritising immigration controls ahead of access to the single market, and expecting 27 other countries unanimous in their irritation with the UK to cut us a special, favourable deal, Mrs May has made hard Brexit almost a certainty. That prospect \u2013 and its grave long-run implications for Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 is what currency markets are now factoring into the value of the pound. On having this pointed out to them, some will claim this is whingeing by the \u201cRemoaners\u201d and point to the FTSE\u2019s rise. Fair enough, but they might also remember that the dollar value of the FTSE 100 index of multinationals is plunging. The FTSE 250 index of smaller, largely domestically focused firms has not done half as well. Had the Bank of England not spent almost \u00a3400bn on UK government bonds, one might expect gilt prices to have tanked also. As it is, they are merely slipping. In economic terms, the fall of the pound will do more harm than good to&#xa0;Britons.</p> <p>The UK is a country that consumes more than it manufactures, that imports more than it exports. Market movements won\u2019t put that right. The British manufacturing base has been pulverised for four decades. In terms of manufacturing as a proportion of national output, the UK has fallen from 20th in the world in 1970 to 116th. Looked at strategically, Britain has hardly any world-class large manufacturers producing complex, high-value goods in this country. What it has instead is a plethora of small and micro-businesses, often assembling components made abroad. Over the next few weeks, petrol prices (which are denominated in dollars on world markets) are likely to shoot up \u2013 by about 5p a litre, reckon motorist groups. Over&#xa0;the next few months, high street goods\u2019 prices will also rise. Inflation will be on the march. It is by no means certain that there will be strong growth, as businesses sit on their hands during the article 50 negotiations.</p> <p>For those who rely on benefits, inflation will mean immiseration. As chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-4-groups-of-people-will-be-hit-by-george-osbornes-working-age-benefit-freeze_uk_5703d6d5e4b0884065f1578e\" title=\"\">George Osborne froze the level of many working-age benefits</a>. That came into force this April, hitting 11 million families. As prices go up, they will be hit again and again. According to the Resolution Foundation, a couple with two children in which the husband works full-time and the wife works part-time \u2013 both on or just above minimum wage stand to lose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/crash-pound-delusion-brexit-britain-flourish\" title=\"\">a total of \u00a3720 a year by 2020</a>. Some \u00a3610 of that loss will be down to Brexit. The \u201cjust managing\u201d families targeted by Mrs May will become even worse off. This is what a car crash looks like \u2013 and article 50 hasn\u2019t even been triggered yet.</p> <p>There is just one more factor to consider: <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/business/will-carney-stay-to-chart-uks-post-brexit-economic-course\" title=\"\">Mark Carney now has less than 90 days to decide whether he will helm the Bank of England after 2018</a>. Given that the leavers attacked him, given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\" title=\"\">Mrs May implicitly criticised his decisions</a> last week, he might opt to step down. Then we really would see what a sell-off looks like.</p>",
  "<p>The FTSE 100 rose to a new record high on Tuesday, bolstered by a continuing slump in the value of the pound, as concerns mounted about the UK economy after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>But the market could not sustain its initial rise and after touching the new peak of 7,129.83, it fell during the course of the afternoon as Wall Street opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 closed at 7,070.88, down 26.62 points on the day, after US markets were undermined by poor third quarter figures from metals specialist Alcoa, which in turn sent mining shares lower.</p> <p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trader IG, said: \u201cA poor start to the session in the US caused the index to pull back ... from the highs of the session. The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier the index climbed about 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7,129.83 , beating the previous intraday high of 7,122 in April last year and well above its highest close of 7,103, achieved on the same day. </p> <p>The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.22.

Those profits rise when they are converted back into sterling. Exporters have also gained, as a fall in sterling makes their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and increases their profits.</p> <p>Neil Wilson, a markets analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cThe index jumped as the pound took another leg lower on mounting concerns about what a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 will look like.

Because of a loophole in EU laws, they are entitled to claim the same free tuition which is given to Scottish residents. </p> <p>With 13,450 EU students at Scottish universities last year, the policy is estimated to cost Scottish taxpayers more than \u00a375m in tuition fee subsidies. Scotland\u2019s free tuition policy also heavily caps the freedom of Scottish universities to increase income from fees.</p> <p>Some Scottish universities may already be affected by the delay in a tuition fees announcement, said Universities Scotland, the sector\u2019s umbrella group, with applications to some highly sought after courses closing this month. </p> <p>The deadline for 2017 applications to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the music and drama school in Glasgow ranked sixth in the world, ends this month, while applications for medicine, veterinary medicine and dentistry degree courses close on 15 October.</p> <p>With backing from the National Union of Students Scotland and the university and college lecturers\u2019 union UCU, Alastair Sim, the director of Universities Scotland, said the sector needed the same certainties that Johnson had given English universities. University finances were already so stretched, and the delay was adding to their anxieties, he said.</p> <p>\u201cScotland\u2019s universities and EU applicants applying here really need certainty from the Scottish government on the fee status for courses starting in 2017. Universities are already receiving thousands of applications and they need to start making offers now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very difficult to ask EU applicants to make decisions about the next four years of their life without knowing if they are entitled to fee-free higher education or not. </p> <p>\u201cUniversities, already facing funding pressures, are in the extremely difficult situation of deciding whether to make offers to students without knowing if or where the funding for their education will come from.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which currently has 97 EU students among its 1,000 undergraduates, said it was important that new applicants from the EU knew what their fee status would be. </p> <p>\u201cAs Scotland\u2019s national conservatoire we\u2019re outward-looking and passionately international in our community and ethos, and we are keen to ensure EU students continue to feel welcome to study at RCS and in Scotland,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A Scottish government spokesman said: \u201cWe are currently considering the position of students applying for the 2017-18 academic year.</p> <p>\u201cWe want all EU staff and students in Scotland to feel settled and secure, and we continue to urge the UK government to urgently provide assurances that the immigration status and rights of EU nationals living in Scotland will not change in the future.\u201d <br></p>",

Johnson famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon the the ultra-hawkish Labour MP <strong>John Woodock </strong>urged Johnson to adopt a Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/11/george-osborne-to-be-questioned-by-mps-as-leak-reveals-treasury-brexit-warning-politics-live?page=with:block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98#block-57fcee10e4b01d9dd2c8fe98\">2.56pm.)</a> As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.</p> <p>If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson\u2019s language was probably a bit more condemnatory than Hammond\u2019s would have been in a debate like this. But if you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May\u2019s views than Johnson\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2016/05/nick-timothy-the-chilcot-report-is-finally-coming-but-we-already-know-we-havent-learned-the-lessons-of-iraq.html\">(Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is on record as saying foreign policy should \u201cvalue stability, \u201crespect sovereignty\u201d and avoid ideological crusades.)</a> But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead was more Stanley Baldwin.</p> <p>Here are the key points from his speech.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated for war crimes by the international criminal court</strong>. But he played down prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every hospital in eastern Aleppo is believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been successfully prosecuted decades after their offences.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also expressed some support for <a href=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20161010084755-l2s3l/\">the French bid to get the ICC to launch an investigation into Syria and Russia,</a> saying he was \u201cpersonally very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the international criminal court\u201d. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, Downing Street sounded a bit less keen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/785863360227250176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris &#39;personally attracted&#39; to pursuing Syria war crimes through ICC.

Johnson said he had \u201cevery sympathy\u201d for what they were proposing and that he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending troops to Syria, he added:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone.

He also declined to back a call from Labour\u2019s <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> for the international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ... </p> <p>Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine ceasefire. That is the way.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of Syria\u2019s civil war over five years ago.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeb26a160f2b96cc7602dbd4fdddff8a76341724/66_0_662_397/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in the Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/BBC Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T16:29:41.200Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fcfedce4b01d9dd2c8ff08\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T15:10:09.982Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia defends its record in Syria</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Russian embassy in London has been using Twitter today to defend its record in Syria.

He will say:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Theresa May has got the Brexit negotiations off on entirely the wrong foot and needs to change direction. She is working on the assumption that the country voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true \u2013 a majority of people were against a hard Brexit.</p> <p>There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs that will damage other sectors.</p> <p>These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties. The aim of that committee should be to seek a fair Brexit that balances the needs of all parts of the country. It is essential that Greater Manchester has a place at this table.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0be40f64606a97026a3d2a32f09f90b266de5471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0be40f64606a97026a3d2a32f09f90b266de5471/0_32_2181_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcf268e4b05d915e423e0b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T14:16:18.125Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bernie Sanders backs Green candidate in Witney byelection</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been a controversy about British politicians like Nigel Farage intervening in the US presidential election, but intervention is not all one-way. <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>, the runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the contest to be the Democratic presidential candidate, has recorded a YouTube video backing the Green party candidate in the Witney byelection.

Laws was a Lib Dem minister in the coalition, and when he was writing the book he had access to Nick Clegg\u2019s private notes. As a result, the book is well-sourced.</p> <p>And the book reveals that Osborne was a) initially sceptical about devolving powers to the region and b) opposed to Heseltine\u2019s No Stone Unturned report.</p> <p>Here is the key extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of October [2012], the Heseltine report was published, urging the government to devolve more economic powers from the centre to the regions. George Osborne didn\u2019t seem very impressed. At a meeting, he described the Heseltine report as a \u2018very personal\u2019 report, and a \u2018bid to steal every department\u2019s capital budget\u2019.</p> <p>David Cameron joked that the whole thing sounded like a \u2018fourth-term priority\u2019. The ever-sharp George Osborne added: \u2018Yes, a fourth-term priority - but for a different government!\u2019</p> <p>The prime minister urged that we should be diplomatic in responding to the Heseltine report as \u2018Michael is a very big beast in the political jungle. Upsetting him over this would be as risky as interrupting a silverback while he\u2019s mating.\u2019 It was an interesting and vivid image.</p> <p>Later in the parliament, George Osborne seemed to become a belated supporter of more localism. For now, he certainly seemed rather sceptical. Even in early 2013, when the chancellor first started to advocate the devolving of money from central government to local areas, one seasoned government adviser told me: \u2018George\u2019s view is that the money will either be wasted by central government or by local government. He thinks the only advantage of devolution is that you can slice 10% off the money as you devolve it, so that the Treasury pays out less.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcb722e4b088a03a67d5ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T09:56:30.622Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Should you have gone quicker in government on airport expansion?</em></p> <p>Osborne says the country collective has dragged its feet on this.

This help, both financial and practical, perhaps through existing schemes such as Access to Work, is surely a worthwhile investment.</p> <p>Helping British disabled people who want to work to get jobs, expanding our domestic labour market, and controlling immigration, would be a great first step in delivering a successful Brexit and a country which really does work for everyone.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/711bd8a2-8ef9-11e6-8df8-d3778b55a923\">Alan Beattie in the Financial Times (subscription) says Britain\u2019s political negotiating style is not suited to achieving success in Brussels.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When decisions are taken at official level, the UK, with its cadre of high-quality civil servants, has frequently got its way. When elevated to the altitude of ministers or heads of state, the culture of British politics \u2014 sectarian, raucous, aggressive \u2014 is inimical to the kind of painstaking, often painful, deliberation in Brussels.</p> <p>The centralised British state, with a weak legislature and strong executive, lends itself to intense public debate in an excitable national press, followed by last-minute decision-making and quick implementation. In the EU, the dispersed nature of power means policies have to trudge wearily between the commission, national capitals and, increasingly, the European and national parliaments before being adopted.</p> <p>Neither is necessarily superior. The eurozone\u2019s inept handling of its sovereign debt crisis was an object lesson in what happens when iterative processes do not match the realities of 21st-century capital markets. Yet when British politicians are trying to achieve something in Brussels or with other EU governments, they need to play by continental rules \u2014 building out attacks slowly from defence rather than just punting the ball to the strikers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fcab5ce4b088a03a67d562\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T09:05:51.888Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The comments are now on BTL.

If we can achieve all that, there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the Treasury is not so optimistic. This morning the Times is splashing on the leak of a Treasury paper saying that, if the UK leaves the EU without negotiating a trade deal, and has to rely on World Trade Organisation rules for trading with Europe, the government could lose up to \u00a366bn a year in tax revenue.

  "<p>Today\u2019s Republican party makes no sense.</p> <p>It spent decades as the party of national security before nominating a man who both defends Russia and pretends to know nothing about the place.</p> <p>If it is the party of small government and constitutional liberty, it\u2019s not clear why its members feel so good about locking up political opponents like Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>To cap it all, the party is currently led by a reality TV star who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-women-comments-groping-apology\">destroyed his own campaign</a> with a TV interview.</p> <p>But all those contradictions look simple compared to the pretzel shape that now passes for the strategy of its leadership.</p> <p>House speaker Paul Ryan was a reluctant endorser of Donald Trump. Now he is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/paul-ryan-ends-support-trump-campaign-endorsement-republicans\">reluctant non-endorser</a> of the same.</p> <p>Ryan told his own Republican caucus on Monday that he would no longer defend Trump or campaign with him. He urged all the rats to leave the sinking ship, telling them \u201cto do what\u2019s best for you\u201d to save their House majority. He said his own mission was to stop Clinton controlling the House and Senate, as well as the White House.</p> <p>But there is no escape from this shipwreck, as Trump himself made clear on Twitter. \u201cPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, job and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee,\u201d said the same nominee.</p> <p>Ryan is indeed wasting his time. He and his House Republicans cannot run away from their own nominee. They have said too many nice things about a man who brags about sexual assault. Just one nice thing would be one too many for the suburban female voters who decide general elections.</p> <p>At the same time, Ryan and his crew cannot run away from their own Trump-loving base. If they do, they run the very real risk that Trump voters will mark their ballots for the presidential candidate and simply skip their down-ballot votes. Even a small protest vote would hand every battleground district to the Democrats.</p> <p>Those battlegrounds are already leaning a long way away from the GOP. According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-support-falls-in-wake-of-lewd-video-new-poll-says-1476115225\">poll</a>, Clinton enjoys an 11-point lead among likely voters. Barack Obama took control of the White House and Capitol Hill with a seven-point win in 2008. A mere defeat threatens to turn into a full-blown rout.</p> <p>To make matters worse for the Trump campaign, after squandering a year without a real organization, it has no voter turnout operations of its own. Instead it is reliant on the RNC\u2019s ground game, which is now either ambivalent about its presidential candidate or shifting decisively towards the House contests.</p> <p>That might help explain the ominous <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/kellyanne-conway-accuses-congressmen-of-lewd-behavior/?client=safari\">statements</a> issued by Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, who warned that Ryan was booed by Trump fans in his home state over the weekend. She went on to say that she knew of GOP lawmakers who forced themselves on young women and were hypocrites for shunning Trump.</p> <p>This Republican civil war is what you might call a lose-lose proposition. It might be a great reality TV show if it didn\u2019t affect the selection of the next leader of the free world.</p> <p>Of course, Paul Ryan and his fellow GOP leaders already know who the next president will be, and she\u2019s not colored orange. Their real contest is not about the House or the Senate. It\u2019s about the next Republican leader to guide the party out of the wilderness.</p> <p>That Moses vacancy is currently unfilled. Ted Cruz blew it with his perfectly timed endorsement just days before the Billy Bush video emerged. Mike Pence will forever be stained by putting his name on the Trump ticket. Jeb Bush will be 67 at the next election, trying to unseat another Clinton on behalf of his family.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Paul Ryan, a relatively youthful leader with not only impeccable conservative credentials but also an anti-poverty plan. Compared to Donald Trump, he is a Desmond Tutu of peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>That\u2019s where Ryan\u2019s current strategy buckles under its internal contradictions. If the Republican party is to return to power any time soon, it needs to clean house of the crazies who invaded it under the Tea Party banner in 2010.</p> <p>There is no hedging your way into the mainstream after so long on the fringes of birtherism, Islamophobia, nativism and sexism. There are no baby steps back from a flat tax and protectionism. There is nothing easy about erasing the cheap talk of undermining Nato and defending Russia. At this rate, the next Republican president has not yet been elected to a governorship or the US Congress.</p> <p>To one half of his own party, Ryan will forever be the man who betrayed Trump. To the other half, he will forever be the man who stood aside while Trump wrecked the place.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when Republicans lampooned a Democratic presidential candidate for taking both sides of the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>His name was John Kerry, and he suggested, at one campaign rally, that he voted both for and against funding the war in Iraq. For that act of doublespeak, the man who is now secretary of state was pursued by giant flip-flops at every campaign event.</p> <p>The GOP united in its scorn for the Democrats, the party of cheese-eating surrender monkeys, who had nominated the French-speaking, windsurfing candidate who was clearly as unmanly as he was indecisive.</p> <p>Republicans have traveled a very long way in the last decade. They are both for and against their own nominee. They oppose his character but they favor his policies. Unless they think he can win, in which case his character is something they can live with. They surrendered their moral compass and now find themselves lost in a sea of indecision.</p> <p>The flip-flops are now on the other feet.</p>",

Ignoring previews, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/09/the-girl-on-the-train-review-emily-blunt-paula-hawkins\">The Girl on the Train</a> has opened 44% bigger than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/05/gone-girl-review-two-different-readings-modern-marriage\">Gone Girl</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/553hc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758278\"            data-video-name=\"Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: 'The vomit was not my own' \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ebf399e4b01b56deffc51c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160929GirlonTrainJunketV2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/29/emily-blunt-the-girl-on-the-train-video-interview\">Emily Blunt on The Girl on the Train: \u2018The vomit was not my own\u2019 \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Local distributor eOne has reason to be particularly pleased with the outcome. In the US, The Girl on the Train kicked off with $24.5m (\u00a319.5m), which \u2013 by rule of thumb \u2013 suggests a UK debut at about the \u00a32.5m mark. The achieved result is more than double that. A factor may be the local popularity of the book, whose author moved from Zimbabwe to London in 1989. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/10/the-girl-on-the-train-relocating-movies\">The transposition of the story</a> to upstate New York does not seem to have dented the film\u2019s appeal in Hawkins\u2019 adopted home market.</p> <p>The sustained success of Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby this past month may have given eOne some concern, given the female skew on both titles. The flipside is that the distributor could hardly have hoped for a better trailering platform for its film. It\u2019s also the case that success can breed success: a big title can bring the audience back, and reignite enthusiasm for the cinema.</p> <h2><strong>The other winner: My Scientology Movie</strong></h2> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/06/my-scientology-movie-review-louis-theroux-gets-smart-with-the-cult-church\">My Scientology Movie</a>, starring and co-written by Louis Theroux, was beaten to the punch by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/alex-gibney-going-clear-scientology-and-the-prison-of-belief-interview-documentary-film\">Alex Gibney\u2019s documentary</a> Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, film-makers John Dower and Simon Chinn had reason to be despondent. Gibney\u2019s film premiered to acclaim at Sundance in January 2015 while My Scientology Movie was still in the cutting room, making it a tougher sell to A-list festivals and top distributors. Despite premiering at the London film festival last October, key international sales were not confirmed until May this year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-9qUjE40wM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s-9qUjE40wM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>UK distributor Altitude opted to release the film on the first full weekend of October, 51 weeks after its LFF debut. Any concerns about the fate of the documentary evaporated as soon as tickets went on sale, with key indie venues such as Bristol Watershed, Glasgow film theatre, Manchester Home and London ICA reporting rapid sellouts. My Scientology Movie has opened with a very encouraging \u00a393,000 from 26 cinemas, with previews taking the total up to \u00a3107,000.</p> <p>In addition, a special event screening with a Theroux Q&amp;A was beamed from London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall into 240 cinemas on Monday evening. Altitude reports more than \u00a3330,000 for this, including the host venue, taking the four-day total to \u00a3438,000. Gibney\u2019s Scientology film grossed \u00a376,000 in the UK over the course of its lifetime.</p> <h2><strong>The survivor: Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</strong></h2> <p>Adding another \u00a36.52m in the past seven days,<strong> </strong>Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby continues its phenomenal run, with a cumulative total of \u00a337.87m after 24 days. That puts it ahead of the lifetime total of 2004\u2019s Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (\u00a336.m), behind only 2001\u2019s Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary (\u00a342.1m) in the all-time league table of romantic comedies at the UK box office. Baby saw its steepest weekly decline to date \u2013 38% \u2013 at the weekend, but any drop under 40% is generally considered a decent hold, and the film faced formidable new competition with the arrival of The Girl on the Train. Including Monday\u2019s takings, Baby has now overtaken Deadpool (\u00a337.9m) to become the third biggest hit of 2016, behind only The Jungle Book (\u00a346.1m) and Finding Dory (\u00a342m)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hzfd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2478289\"            data-video-name=\"Bridget Jones's Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Universal \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56f2da09e4b03be67b95cae2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Of course, adjusted for inflation, Baby is still behind the Bridget franchise\u2019s previous entries. Average cinema ticket prices rose by 74% since 2001, and by 61% since 2004. Adjusted for inflation to current prices, the lifetime grosses of the earlier Bridget movies would be \u00a373.1m and \u00a357.8m.</p> <h2><strong>The disappointments</strong></h2> <p>Landing in seventh place, John Michael McDonagh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/12/war-on-everyone-review-john-michael-mcdonagh-skarsgard-pena-bad-cops\">War on Everyone</a> delivered \u00a3188,000 from 203 cinemas, including previews of \u00a340,000 \u2013 yielding a screen average of just \u00a3924, or \u00a3725 if previews are left out of the weekend total. McDonagh\u2019s previous film Calvary began its run in April 2014 with \u00a3571,000 from 150 venues, including previews of \u00a36,500. It\u2019s worth noting that \u00a3295,000 of that total came from Ireland, which is always included in the UK box office totals. Although McDonagh remains popular in Ireland, his new film\u2019s New Mexico setting means that it doesn\u2019t have the same particular local appeal there as his previous films.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/05/bridget-joness-baby-miss-peregrine-supersonic-free-state-of-jones-uk-box-office\">Bridget Jones's Baby continues growth spurt at UK box office</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In July 2011, McDonagh\u2019s The Guard opened first in Ireland, debuting with \u00a3474,000 from 71 cinemas, including \u00a372,000 in previews. Six weeks later, it kicked off in the UK with \u00a3164,000 from 60 venues. Lifetime total was a combined \u00a34.61m.</p> <p>With its US setting and international cast led by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, War on Everyone is notionally a more commercial film from McDonagh. The UK and Ireland grosses, at least, suggest otherwise.</p> <p>War on Everyone\u2019s result looks positively muscular next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/blood-father-review-cannes-mel-gibson\">Blood Father</a>, the latest action thriller starring Mel Gibson. That one landed in 17th place with \u00a369,000 from 117 cinemas, yielding a \u00a3588 average.</p> <h2><strong>The single-screen showcase: 13th</strong></h2> <p>Fans of watching documentaries on the big screen are in for a disappointment if they hope to see Ava DuVernay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/the-13th-review-ava-duvernay-new-york-film-festival-prisons-plantations-race-law-us\">13th</a>, when they don\u2019t live or work near London. The film, which is available on Netflix, is playing an exclusive one-week engagement at the Bertha DocHouse at London\u2019s Curzon Bloomsbury \u2013 a run that qualifies it for the Bafta film awards \u2013 following its special presentation as part of the London film festival last Thursday. Other cinemas seeking to book it report having been rebuffed. The Selma director\u2019s acclaimed investigation into US mass incarceration of African Americans grossed \u00a3455 at the weekend. The film ends its run on Thursday.</p> <h2><strong>The personal milestone: The BFG</strong></h2> <p>Now in its 12th week of release, Steven Spielberg\u2019s The BFG passed the \u00a330m barrier at the weekend \u2013 the ninth film to do so this year, following The Jungle Book, Finding Dory, Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, Deadpool, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life of Pets and Suicide Squad. The UK is the runaway winning territory for The BFG, relative to the size of its overall cinema market. US gross was a disappointing $55m.</p> <h2><strong>The future</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold-mislays-map-but-us-roadtrip-still-sweetly-intriguing\">American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks to the arrival of The Girl on the Train, takings at the weekend were overall 9% up on the previous frame, and 56% up on the equivalent session from 2015, when The Martian stayed at the top spot, fending off challenges from the newly released Sicario and The Walk.

  "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has rejected Bob Bradley\u2019s claim that the former Germany star was jockeying to succeed him as USA coach a year before Bradley left.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/bob-bradley-jurgen-klinsmann-jockeying-usa-job\">Bob Bradley says J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was 'jockeying' for USA job in 2010</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley made the claim on Friday when he was introduced as the new coach of Swansea City. He said of Klinsmann: \u201cWhen he did commentary on the 2010 World Cup, he was already jockeying for the job.\u201d</p> <p>Bradley was fired as the national team coach in 2011, shortly after a 4-2 defeat by Mexico in the Gold Cup final. He was replaced by Klinsmann, who had been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich in 2009. On Monday, however, Klinsmann insisted that he hadn\u2019t been angling for Bradley\u2019s job.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I mean it\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Klinsmann said in a press conference before his team\u2019s friendly against New Zealand on Tuesday night. \u201cI could have taken the job in 2006. I could have taken it in 2010. And then we got together in 2011 to finally figure out a way to make this happen. So I was not jockeying anything.\u201d</p> <p>Klinsmann was effusive in his praise of Bradley, who, in accepting the Swansea job, becomes the first American to coach in the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cI wish Bob the very, very best,\u201d Klinsmann said Monday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big, big moment having an American coach coaching a Premier League club. I think it\u2019s huge. And he\u2019s an awesome guy. He\u2019s a good person, and I just keep my fingers crossed for him.\u201d</p> <p>The match against New Zealand is USA\u2019s last run-out before they play Mexico in World Cup qualifying in November. The top three from the six-team qualifying \u201cHex\u201d advance to Russia by right, and the fourth-placed team faces a two-legged play-off against a team from Asia.</p> <p>Concacaf president Victor Montagliani suggested last week that the confederation\u2019s format be changed for future World Cups to allow more nations to play deeper into the four-year cycle.</p> <p>But Klinsmann opposed that idea, insisting that USA and other regional powers are hurt by fewer opportunities to face quality international opponents.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to get better, we need to play with the best teams out there from South America or from Europe,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cWhat does that mean? For us it means, it would be the opposite direction.\u201d</p> <p>The New Zealand game comes a year and a day after Klinsmann\u2019s team lost to Mexico 3-2 in extra time in the playoff for a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup.</p> <p>New Zealand lost to Mexico 2-1 on Saturday. Klinsmann said wished his team could have scheduled a friendly against stronger opposition, but Europe and South America had World Cup qualifiers scheduled and few teams were available.</p> <p>\u201cGhana wasn\u2019t allowed to come because they play one game in Europe and they\u2019re not allowed to play a second game in another continent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go the list up and down. Believe me, we\u2019re trying to get the best opponents as possible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Norwegian foreign ministry has denied local press reports that it rejected a British request to set up a formal joint taskforce aimed at preparing a post-Brexit free trade deal between the two countries.</p> <p>The business daily Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv earlier reported that Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, had asked Norway\u2019s trade and industry minster, Monica M\u00e6land, to form a bilateral trade working group at a meeting on 14 September.</p> <p>The paper said the request was passed to the Norwegian foreign ministry, which is coordinating Norway\u2019s Brexit response, where it was turned down as likely to jeopardise Norway\u2019s European Economic Area (EEA) agreement and \u201cinappropriate\u201d while Britain was still a full member of the EU.</p> <p>But a ministry spokeswoman said M\u00e6land had confirmed in a letter to Fox that Norway was willing to \u201cinitiate a dialogue\u201d in an attempt to \u201cminimise any potential future disruption to the bilateral trade relationship\u201d. The letter said Norway was \u201cflexible concerning the format of the dialogue, within the framework of our respective obligations\u201d.</p> <p>No 10 said it was not true that Fox had asked for a joint working group on trade with Norway: \u201cThat did not happen. Liam Fox has had dialogue with Norway. It was part of an ongoing dialogue between the Department for International Trade and individual states. It was a friendly conversation as opposed to any specific requests.\u201d</p> <p>The format \u2013 and formality \u2013 of preliminary bilateral trade talks is a highly sensitive issue. Fox is eager to begin work on negotiating new trade agreements with non-EU member states, but the UK is legally barred from signing any while it remains an EU member.<br></p> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/no-free-trade-deal-until-brexit-settled-australian-minister-steven-ciobo\">the Australian trade minister was forced to row back</a> on earlier enthusiastic noises about setting up a bilateral working group to \u201cscope out the parameters of a future ambitious and comprehensive Australia-UK free trade agreement\u201d.</p> <p>Steven Ciobo said any formal work on a bilateral post-Brexit deal would take second place to Australia\u2019s trade talks with the EU, and could not begin until Britain had fully exited from the bloc.</p> <p>Norway is not a member of the EU but has access to the single market though its membership of the EEA, which groups EU member states plus three of the four members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) \u2013 Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.<br></p> <p>Norway has said it could block an eventual UK bid for Efta membership. The European affairs minister, Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/norway-may-block-uk-return-to-european-free-trade-association\">said in August</a> it was \u201cnot certain it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway\u2019s interests.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cNorwegian model\u201d had been held up by some pro-Brexit campaigners as a possible way for the UK to access the EU single market via the EEA, although the government\u2019s insistence on controlling immigration and regaining parliamentary and judicial sovereignty after Brexit may rule that out: EEA membership requires the four EU freedoms, including the free movement of people.</p> <p>Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of Norway\u2019s Centre party, had accused the Norwegian government of dragging its feet in response to the Brexit vote, telling Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv that Britain was Norway\u2019s biggest export market.</p> <p>Britain <a href=\"http://www.norway.org.uk/norwayandcountry/Current-Affairs/Business-and-Trade/Norways-most-important-trading-partner/#.V_zsiyMrKhd\">accounts for about a quarter of Norway\u2019s exports</a> \u2013 principally oil and gas, which account for nearly 90% of the total, and seafood \u2013 and about 6% of its imports.</p>",
  "<p>I thought I saw my first killer clown this week, coming toward me down a side street I was crossing. In my experience it is unwise to make eye contact with clowns, killer or otherwise, so I looked straight ahead and carried on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/knife-wielding-killer-clown-pursues-durham-schoolchildren\">Knife-wielding 'killer clown' pursues Durham schoolchildren</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I had second thoughts. I figured it might be my only killer clown sighting of the whole craze. So I ducked into a corner shop, bought a paper, and doubled back.</p> <p>When we finally crossed paths, I could see that he was wearing a white mask \u2013 hollow-eyed, blank; an idealised skull, perhaps \u2013 with his hoodie pulled up over his head. He was flanked by two unmasked mates, as if he was being escorted to his destination. It\u2019s unlikely he was on his way to rob a betting shop, or tend goal in an ice hockey match \u2013 in either case, you wouldn\u2019t wear the mask on the way. The disguise was clearly meant to conceal something. But what?</p> <p>That\u2019s when I realised: it was probably his clown makeup. Wearing a mask in broad daylight may seem a trifle provocative, but who would dare go out dressed as a clown in the current climate? Imagine if you had to wear clown gear as a condition of your employment \u2013 that you were, let\u2019s say, a clown. Would you feel safe taking the bus to your next children\u2019s party?

What is my role in the encounter? Am I obliged to run? What if I don\u2019t? Do we just stand there?</p> <p>Something similar happened to me a few years ago when I found myself buying petrol from a vampire at Cullompton services on the M5. I was alone in the shop, and didn\u2019t understand why a member of the undead had been posted behind the till. I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say about his parchment-pale skin, sunken eyes, yellow fangs or the blood running from both corners of his mouth, so I decided not to mention his affliction at all. He asked me if I needed a VAT receipt, and I said no.</p> <p>The customer who walked in as I left handled the situation much better.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI had a late one last night,\u201d said the vampire.</p> <h2><strong>A little Dorrit?

It\u2019s like going to an event populated by actors pretending to be Dickens characters, who will talk only about things that happened in Little Dorrit.</p> <p>I always long to ask them where the fire assembly point is, but I know nothing will induce them to drop the act.

  "<p>David Bowie\u2019s art collection was tasteful. Disappointingly tasteful.

Where is the camp outrage, the punk iconoclasm? And where\u2019s Andy Warhol?</p> <p>You won\u2019t find much in Bowie\u2019s collection that connects in any striking or interesting way with his music, videos, performances or personae. One exception is his small but impressive collection of paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Bowie played Warhol in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115632/\">Julian Schnabel\u2019s film</a> of Basquiat\u2019s life, so there\u2019s a connection there; he owned a Schnabel, too.

Yet Warhol and other pop artists are in very, very short supply in the Sotheby\u2019s auction. Instead, it seems Bowie was obsessed with British 20th-century art by some very unglamorous artists.</p> <p>If his paintings by Ivon Hitchens, Winifred Nicholson, Peter Lanyon, Graham Sutherland and their ilk (with their vaguely modernist reinterpretations of the British landscape tradition) remind me of anything in Bowie\u2019s oeuvre, it is surely his appearance in the film of The Snowman. Like the snowy dream version of Britain in that Christmas classic, a lot of the art in Bowie\u2019s collection wallows in melancholy nostalgic idylls of Englishness, albeit with the lightest dusting of abstraction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2738fb72b3169b7a47cb510264ce52c7e604448\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2738fb72b3169b7a47cb510264ce52c7e604448/0_0_4140_3055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman at the preview of the Bowie/Collector exhibition in Sotheby\u2019s, New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman at the preview of the Bowie/Collector exhibition in Sotheby\u2019s, New York, with Peter Lanyon\u2019s painting Witness 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Visionary and apocalyptic this art is not.

  "<p>All countries are being urged to consider introducing a sugary drinks tax by the World Health Organisation as an effective way of curbing the soaring obesity rate, especially in children.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s advice comes as more and more countries are considering fiscal measures to dissuade people from buying the large quantities of colas, lemonades and other sugary soft drinks that have been identified as a major cause of the global overweight and obesity crisis. </p> <p>It will strengthen the hand of campaigners in countries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/03/obese-soda-sugar-tax-mexico\">Colombia</a>, where the drinks industry has succeeded in having an anti-sugar broadcast banned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/fiscal-policies-diet-prevention/en/\">A report from the WHO</a> says that a tax of 20% or more results in a drop in sales and consumption of sugary drinks. People consume fewer \u201cfree sugars\u201d such as fructose and glucose, take in fewer calories and reduce their risk of tooth decay. </p> <p>\u201cConsumption of free sugars, including products like sugary drinks, is a major factor in the global increase of people suffering from obesity and diabetes,\u201d said Dr Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO\u2019s department for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. </p> <p>\u201cIf governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to invest in health services.\u201d<br></p> <p>The WHO has already published nutritional advice saying nobody actually needs sugar in their diet. Its guidance says we should restrict our intake of free sugars to a maximum of 10% of our energy needs, preferably 5%. The UK government\u2019s scientific advisory committee on nutrition and health echoed that advice, which led to the decision to introduce a sugary drinks tax in the UK, although not until 2018. Other countries, including the Philippines and South Africa, are now looking at introducing similar measures.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s 10% tax on sugary drinks appears to have successfully reduced sales and consumption. The government is being urged by campaigners to double the tax. </p> <p>The WHO says a tax has most impact on the young, those on low incomes and others who consume a lot of sugary drinks and will have the greatest positive effect on the health of those groups.</p> <p>Other fiscal measures that work include subsidising fresh fruit and vegetable prices by 10-30%, it says. Taxing food and other drinks that are high in saturated fats, trans fats, free sugars and salt \u201cappears promising\u201d, it adds, because there is evidence that higher prices reduce consumption.</p> <p>Battle lines are being drawn in Colombia, where a consumer movement is pressing the case for a sugary drinks tax and the industry is fighting back. Sales of sugary drinks have been increasing faster in Colombia, where half the adult population and 17% of children are overweight or obese, than any other Latin American country.</p> <p>Last month, the Asociaci\u00f3n Educar Consumidores \u2013 the consumer organisation which, like its Mexican equivalent, has backing from Bloomberg Philanthropies in the US \u2013 produced an educational video to be broadcast on television, warning that drinking too many sugary drinks can lead to diabetes and other diseases. </p> <p>But after a complaint from Postob\u00f3n, the Colombian beverage giant, the government\u2019s regulatory agency charged with consumer protection banned any showing of the video on TV, saying it was inaccurate and could confuse the public.</p> <p>Senior health experts in the US have joined the fray, supporting a tax in Colombia. Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Walter Willett, of the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and others have written to the Colombian ministry of health about the dangers of sugar consumption and the effectiveness of taxation.</p> <p>Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and now the WHO\u2019s global ambassador for non-communicable diseases, said: \u201cObesity is a major contributor to diabetes, heart disease and other preventable health problems that kill millions of people every year \u2013 and the problem is getting worse, particularly among children and in developing countries. Smart policies can help turn the tides on this deadly epidemic, especially those aimed at reducing consumption of sugary drinks, which are fuelling obesity rates.</p> <p>\u201cA growing number of cities and countries \u2013 including Mexico \u2013 are showing that taxes on sugary drinks are effective at driving down consumption. The World Health Organisation report released today can help these effective policies spread to more places around the world, and that will help save many lives.\u201d</p>",

The Obama government has also had to consider the conflicting interests of Turkey, the Kurds, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Israel.</p> <p>Turkey, a Nato ally, views the Kurds as a greater threat than the Assad government in Syria. The failed coup in Turkey has only exacerbated President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown on Kurds in Turkey. The US has agreed with Turkey to give military support to Syrian Kurds as long as they stayed east of the Euphrates.</p> <p>The US is also giving air and ground support to the Iraqi Peshmerga, Iraqi troops and Shia militias, in the buildup to retake Mosul from Sunni Islamic State. At the same time, this presents a threat to the unstable Mosul dam, which, if breached, could kill millions downstream.</p> <p>The successful US nuclear negotiations with Iran have led the US to reluctantly support the Saudi government in its war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Shia Iran is waging a proxy war against a range of Sunni opponents, including Isis and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front), using the Alawite Assad regime and the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah, which Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard have armed.</p> <p>In view of these shifting alliances, it has been prudent of President Obama to consult carefully with his military and diplomatic staff before committing to further Middle East adventures. It is easy to forget that he was elected in 2008 by voters weary of protracted foreign wars.<br><strong>Linda Agerbak</strong><br>Arlington, Massachusetts, US</p> <p>\u2022 Almost every week Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de makes me nostalgic for the good old days of the cold war.

So the fragmentation of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines advanced democracy and was good; the same process in Ukraine is a Russian conspiracy and is bad.</p> <p>Her latest war-horse is Syria \u2013 a tragedy, for which all sides share responsibility. Nougayr\u00e8de\u2019s proposed solution? A \u201ctougher approach to Russia\u2019s intervention\u201d. How? As an example, she quotes approvingly the \u201ctargeted strikes on Serbian forces\u201d that in her opinion helped solve the Yugoslavian crisis. But there are no Russian ground forces in Syria, and if I remember correctly Nato bombed Belgrade as well. So is she saying that the west should bomb Moscow?

But there\u2019s a huge problem here. Electric vehicles will be major indirect polluters and contributors to climate change until the energy they use comes from renewable resources.</p> <p>Most electricity and nearly all hydrogen still come from fossil fuels. A battery-electric vehicle doesn\u2019t avoid the pollution from electricity production \u2013 it is released at the power station rather than on the motorway. Even worse, more battery-electric cars will increase the demand for electricity from a grid that already can\u2019t cope. Likewise, a fuel-cell-electric vehicle running on hydrogen only produces water, but the associated pollution is released at the hydrogen production plant.</p> <p>Solutions that ignore the connected nature of the problem never work.

By focusing on contemporary consumerism in which we all are involved to one degree or another, his words remind of how civilisations are dredging everything and everywhere: lands, forests, lakes and rivers, the sky. Even our human species is affected by the degradation of what he calls \u201cuncontrolled consumerism\u201d.</p> <p>With respect to all animals, fishes, birds, plants and the smaller living things of the Earth: so much has sickened. Disappeared. Died. While so many do work on behalf of other species, we humans do not seem to have the nerve for doing what is required to show mercy toward them.</p> <p>We do not grieve enough.

Monbiot also forgot to mention bees: some farmers are guilty, even if they don\u2019t kill bees directly; they spray their crops with chemicals that do the job nicely. Don\u2019t our poor bees have enough on their plate, being gobbled up by Asian hornets, without those who manage to get through being exterminated by lethal chemicals? No bees, no pollination.

In the case of genuine self-defence, physical retaliation may be the correct response. A civil, verbal assertion of our disagreement may be a proper response to an abusive attack.

Dance is the ultimate art of subtle non-verbal communication. And the non-verbal counts for more than we tend to allow. Professional dancers know this.

I\u2019m sure that if he wanted to he could find his way back into parliament. His own rehabilitation is well under way and he is even in danger of becoming a national treasure. However, rehabilitating the New Labour brand in the process may be a task beyond even our Ed.</p> <p>Balls is also bound to learn from his time on Strictly, however long it lasts.

Not least because he is the husband of a still-serving politician.</p> <p>The most obvious impact is on him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/21/ed-balls-bruiser-confront-tory-lies\">Long described as a bruiser</a>, and depicted in his early days as either a backroom boffin or heavyweight enforcer, dancing the samba in a lurid yellow suit, wearing a bucket-full of green facepaint, has given Balls a chance to reintroduce himself to the British public.

He\u2019s showing, in Denis Healey\u2019s classic formulation, that he has a hinterland.

She\u2019s getting to be seen by a mass audience that would never tune into politics. And seen in a wholly positive light. Not as a politician locked in an argument, but as a partner unsure whether to wince or cheer.</p> <p>It helps Labour too, by giving the audience a glimpse of the party doing something other than fighting itself. But that help probably benefits most the wing of the party associated with Balls and Cooper. When Labour\u2019s public face these days is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell , Balls\u2019s Strictly run is a weekly reminder that Labour used to look very different.</p> <p>Usually New Labour jogs itself back into the memory with an intervention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-says-his-return-to-british-politics-is-an-open-question\">Tony Blair</a>, whose associations are \u2013 shall we say \u2013 not entirely positive in the public mind. But there is nothing contentious about the resurfacing of Ed Balls. He\u2019s a reminder that, in its heyday, New Labour was very good at presenting its leading figures as normal people, in touch with popular culture and the national mood. Indeed, the fact that Balls is still on the show \u2013 despite regularly scoring the lowest marks from the judges \u2013 is a weekly reminder of New Labour\u2019s greatest selling point: its uncanny knack of winning votes.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lyndseywinship\">Lyndsey Winship</a>: He is the Brexit of the Strictly world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26ed64c5febe0fb7d349227a15094dfd67a372a/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Lyndsey Winship\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dance is a powerful art form.

But political redemption? That might be too big an ask.</p> <p>Yet with Balls\u2019s continuing success, you have to wonder. He went all out on a Mask-themed samba routine this week, green facepaint and banana-hued suit only adding to the rather camp and slightly terrifying effect. And despite only scraping 24 points to sit at the bottom of the leaderboard, he sailed through to the next round on the public vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2016/aug/31/ed-balls-strictly-come-dancing-in-pictures\">Strictly hopeful Ed Balls puts on his dancing shoes \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Balls is the Brexit of the Strictly world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/25/like-ed-balls-jeremy-corbyn-is-struggling-to-impress-the-judges\">The panel of expert judges</a> may say: \u201cDown with Balls!\u201d But who needs experts, right? The great British public know what they want. Which is what, exactly?

Despite what the unfathomable success of Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage might suggest, I still don\u2019t think we want cartoon characters for leaders. But you could argue the voting public seems to be warming to people who remind them of their own imperfect selves.</p> <p>And there is something strangely compelling about watching Balls dance. This is not someone who has given up the fight. He really goes for it, with maximum gusto. And for all the graceless execution, he\u2019s mostly on top of the steps. He\u2019s actually not as bad a dancer as he looks. Perhaps where the real gains are is in showing that he can laugh at himself. For someone with a reputation as a political bruiser and bully, that could be a clever move. A little bit of humility could go a long way.

The more money for the city of Tallinn, the less there is for the places they leave behind, explains Cats, \u201cso it\u2019s not hard to see why the government and the mayor\u2019s office might see things differently\u201d.</p> <p>Allan Alakula, the official spokesperson for the project, admits boosting the popularity of the mayor\u2019s office<strong> </strong>was one of the key motivations for rolling out the project \u2013 but insists that it was primarily about easing the burden on people\u2019s wallets, and the city\u2019s roads. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a488aebdfa58bf1ccff0bf7e48fc0a55b140a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a488aebdfa58bf1ccff0bf7e48fc0a55b140a41/0_260_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tallinn, Estonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The historic centre of Tallinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The project took a year from inception to reality in which time Alakula and his team struggled to find cities to learn from. The<a href=\"http://www.eltis.org/discover/news/hasselt-cancels-free-public-transport-after-16-years-belgium-0\"> city of Hasselt in Belgium</a> had free transport for 16 years but they had to reintroduce fares when it became financially unsustainable. It is also free in the town of <a href=\"http://www.metropolitiques.eu/Free-public-transport-from-social.html\">Aubagne</a> near Marseille in France, but neither were on the scale of Tallinn\u2019s ambitions.</p> <p>Three years later the project has been inundated with requests \u2013 from the Chinese city of Chengdu, <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/01/largest-free-transit-experiment-world/8231/\">home to 14 million</a> and desperate to ease traffic congestion, to Romania\u2019s capital Bucharest. \u201cWe would be happy to hand over the title of the free public transport capital of the world,\u201d Alakula laughs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/estonia-e-residency-european-union-brexit-eu-referendum\">A Brexit bolthole?

It is nearing rush hour but everyone who needs a seat gets one. The trams and trains are clean and Tallinners have been enthusiastic about using them for free, with<a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/01/largest-free-transit-experiment-world/8231/%E2%80%8B%20%E2%80%8B\"> early polls</a> delivering a 90% approval rating for the scheme.</p> <p>Dr Cats, who is based at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, found that the number of people in Tallinn using public transport instead of cars was up by 8%, but at the same time the average length of a car journey had gone up by 31%, which he said meant there were more, not fewer, cars on the road in the time they tested.</p> <p>He puts the increase down to a change in \u201cshopping and leisure habits\u201d rather than limitations of the scheme itself, and suggests that making driving more expensive, through parking fees and other taxes, could be more effective at cutting back on traffic. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e287511d56e64a7385404efa2468e250b8a7800e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e287511d56e64a7385404efa2468e250b8a7800e/0_172_3126_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A passenger holds his ticket card to a scanner aboard a public transport bus in Tallinn,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early polls showed a 90% approval rating for the scheme among Tallinners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So could cycling, which Alakula admits the city hasn\u2019t done enough to promote: \u201cless than 1% of people make their journey by bike, which basically means that cycle commuting doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Cats also found \u201cmixed evidence\u201d whether the scheme has \u201cimproved mobility and accessibility of low-income and unemployed residents \u2026 [and] no indication that employment opportunities improved as a result of this policy\u201d. <br></p> <p>According to Cats, free public transport is not the no-brainer everyone might initially think it to be. \u201cThe idea still faces political opposition and visitors who use public transport are less satisfied with having to pay more for it than locals.\u201d But in the case of Tallinn it is almost exclusively used by residents, not tourists \u2013 who rely on private buses, taxis and most recently Uber.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/09/car-free-city-oslo-helsinki-copenhagen\">Will we ever get a truly car-free city?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a risk, says Cats, that free public transport could lead to less investment in the service. \u201cIn the event of an economic depression, investment in public transport will be more exposed to potential budget cuts if they are not earmarked,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Tallinn also can\u2019t rely on increasing tax revenues by attracting new residents forever. Before the scheme started, 6,000 new residents registered annually.

It delivered a point that Australia would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before kick-off. </p> <p>Japan were excellent in the first half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan\u2019s concession of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia\u2019s belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest opportunities fell Japan\u2019s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make. </p> <p>Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou\u2019s selections, in particular starting with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace and width hurt Australia\u2019s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared. </p> <p>Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering the best of the home side\u2019s attacking thrust.</p> <p>Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia. Tonight pitted them against a credentialed opponent that came with a defensive agenda and showed Australia a massive amount of respect. Russia 2018 is still very much on the agenda. </p> <p>Thanks for joining me, it\u2019s been a hoot, as always.

The Asian Confederation has been whittled to 12 teams split evenly into two groups with Australia topping Pool B with seven points from their opening three matches. It\u2019s been a strong opening to this leg of the campaign by Ange Postecoglou and his crew, with a routine home victory over Iraq followed by a hard-earned away win in the UAE and a draw last Thursday in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The top four teams in the group (Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Japan) are separated by only one point, with Iraq and Thailand cast adrift and pointless. With only two automatic qualifiers and a third-place playoff on offer, every match carries plenty of meaning over the coming months.</p> <p>On paper at least Japan represent the toughest opposition to the Socceroos in the group, but their form so far has been patchy. They suffered a surprise defeat to the UAE in their opening group game and required a 96th minute winner to down Iraq a few nights ago. Coach Vahid Halilhodzic is under immense scrutiny and another disappointing performance tonight could spell the end of his tenure in charge of the Blue Samurai. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s rivalry with Japan has been one of the highlights of the move into the AFC. The Tim Cahill inspired 2006 World Cup comeback remains the highlight, but whenever these countries meet there\u2019s a sense continental supremacy is at stake. This is especially so at present with the Socceroos the reigning Asian Cup champions but without a win over Japan since 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554ddf2143e59151f23c017345212a7584882e79/0_419_1961_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"534\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Tim Cahill repeat his heroics of Kaiserslautern 2006 when Australia host Japan in a World Cup qualifier in Melbourne?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fc7251e4b0eaaafbc950e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:34:13.512Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jonathan will be here shortly to guide you through proceedings at Etihad, where Australia face their traditional Asian rivals hoping to consolidate top spot in Group B.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/08/socceroos-big-atmosphere-world-cup-clash-japan\">Socceroos keen for massive crowd in key Japan World Cup clash</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-11T05:36:21.359Z\">at 6.36am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>In public spaces across central Florida \u2013 from schools to churches, restaurants to supermarkets, fairgrounds to DMV car licensing offices \u2013 a massive scramble is drawing to a close to register Puerto Ricans to vote in what could prove to be a tipping point in next month\u2019s presidential election.<br></p> <p>The cut-off for voter registrations in Florida is this week and as the deadline has approached, efforts to cajole hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans to sign up for a ballot have reached fever pitch. (On Monday, a federal judge extended the 11 October deadline by one day to allow for the disruption of the hurricane.) Volunteers mobilized by a new coalition of Hispanic groups called Que Vote Mi Gente \u2013 my people vote \u2013 have been stationed for weeks now outside favored gathering spots accosting newcomers from the island about their civic duty.</p> <p>\u201cAre you registered to vote? Are you ready to vote?\u201d is the battle cry, and even the most superficial of glances at the statistics tells why. Florida is famously the swing state to end all swing states, ever since George Bush squeaked past Al Gore in the 2000 race for the White House with a disputed 500 votes.</p> <p>Within Florida, the rapidly expanding Puerto Rican community along the I-4 corridor that runs from Orlando to Tampa has become the ultimate swing vote within the ultimate swing state in the 2016 campaign. \u201cThis is the new mecca for Puerto Ricans and it\u2019s changing the electoral map,\u201d said Betsy Franceschini, Florida director of the Hispanic Federation, which is participating in the voter drive.</p> <p>Every day, about 100 Puerto Ricans relocate from the island to central Florida, pushed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/01/puerto-rico-debt-repayment-default-financial-crisis\">financial crisis back home</a> and pulled by the lure of jobs in Disney World and the other theme parks that pepper the area. There are now 1.1 million \u201cboricuas\u201d, as the newcomers are known in Florida, a demographic that is on the verge of toppling Cubans from their perch as the state\u2019s dominant Hispanic bloc.</p> <p>With at least 200,000 boricuas having arrived in Florida since the last presidential election in 2012 \u2013 all of whom are eligible to vote at the age of 18 as US citizens \u2013 they have the potential to be a major, and possibly even decisive, political force in a state that gave Barack Obama the nod four years ago by only 74,000 votes. Which is in large part why both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are pummeling central Florida with TV ads \u2013 the Tampa region with an ad spend of $21m and the Tampa area with $17m occupying both the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/first-read-s-morning-clips-it-s-nev-addd-ah-n660776\">top two slots</a> in the league table of presidential ad markets in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/state-factboxes/?id=FL\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>Which is all very well, but first you have to get the new arrivals to register to vote \u2026 </p> <p>\u201cAre you registered to vote?\u201d comes the cry outside the DMV licensing office in Kissimmee. That\u2019s the ground zero of Puerto Rican voter registration this year: Kissimmee has a <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/1236950\">majority Latino population</a> and is one of the fastest-growing towns in the state as a result of the boricua exodus. </p> <p>And within Kissimmee the one place that new arrivals can surely be found is the DMV. Try living in Florida without a car.</p> <p>The staff of the Hispanic Federation have spent weeks patiently waiting outside the DMV offices to pounce on boricuas such as Narciso Rey, 55, a retired shop supervisor who arrived in the town from Puerto Rico barely two weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019m ready to vote,\u201d he said compliantly as he was being collared by the volunteers and encouraged to fill out a voter registration form. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the family, and for me, to take part in deciding who will be the next president.\u201d</p> <p>On paper, the growing number of registered Puerto Ricans in Florida looks like an electoral gift for Clinton. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.americanprogressaction.org/press/release/2016/10/05/162807/release-new-poll-shows-florida-puerto-rican-voters-will-have-major-impact-on-2016-elections/\">latest poll</a> of Puerto Ricans in Central Florida conducted by Latino Decisions for the Center for American Progress Action Fund found that 61% of those surveyed, all of whom are already registered, said they were certain to back Clinton while only 12% definitely support Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/09/puerto-ricans-florida-election-immigration\">Puerto Ricans in Florida: the 'outsiders' with a powerful swing vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not quite up to the stellar ratings of Obama in 2012, who according to exit polls gained 87% of the Puerto Rican vote in the state compared with 13% for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, but it\u2019s getting there. So much so that Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, a Democratic Congress member for Chicago who is of Puerto Rican descent, dared to interpret the poll results as a solid indicator that \u201cDonald Trump is going to lose Florida and lose the electoral college, and Puerto Ricans in particular will be a huge part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory.\u201d</p> <p>But there is no room for complacency on the Democratic side, judging from the comments of the boricuas the Guardian talked to in Kissimmee. Narciso Rey, completing his registration form outside the DMV, said he was totally unclear about whether to back Trump or Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m still studying, watching, trying to work out which way to go. I\u2019m going to have to eat, drink and relax before I decide,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At Melao Bakery, a classic Puerto Rican restaurant that serves quesitos, cream-filled doughnuts and a popular dish of fried green plantain called mofongo, several of the customers were also still wavering between the candidates.

Despite the herculean efforts of the coalition, there remains an engagement gap with only 60% of Puerto Ricans registered compared with 80% of all Floridians.</p> <p>Newly arrived boricuas are often too preoccupied settling in, finding a home and a school for their children, to care about an election in a country that is still unfamiliar to them. Skepticism toward politicians runs deep in Puerto Rico and has been carried by many migrants like Quiles with them to their new homes. </p> <p>There also remains a disconnect between the rapidly growing community of boricuas and the candidates who are so eager for their votes yet understand little about their culture or priorities. The millions of dollars of TV ads that are being flung at central Florida merely disguise what Franceschini of the Hispanic Federation calls the \u201ccultural incompetence\u201d of their campaigning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like politicians, I don\u2019t like them in Puerto Rico and I don\u2019t like them here</p> <footer> <cite>Yolanda Quiles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Puerto Rico, electioneering is a matter of song and color and noise, with motorcades, or <em>caravanas</em>, trailing after candidates and crowds filling the streets waving flags and dancing to <em>la plena</em> folk music. In Florida, about the most exciting sight is a bank of lawn signs and a flyer or two pushed through the door often printed in English.</p> <p>\u201cIt applies to both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Franceschini said. \u201cUnless they figure out how to address Puerto Ricans, to campaign in a way that is culturally competent, then they are both missing an enormous opportunity as this vote could decide everything.\u201d</p> <p>The Latino Decision poll underlined the gap between potential and reality. Some 84% of the 500 Puerto Ricans who participated in the survey said they definitely intended to cast a ballot next month, yet only 37% said that they had been contacted by anyone from a presidential campaign, political party or community organization to discuss their intentions.</p> <p>\u201cPuerto Ricans have not heard enough from the campaigns,\u201d said Congressman Guti\u00e9rrez. \u201cYou would expect them to be among the most highly sought after voters in the country \u2013 it is not enough for Democrats to assume their support just because their candidate is not Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of meaningful political engagement, the Hispanic Federation is seeking to fill some of the gap with its own non-partisan messaging. It will be running its own TV ad campaign from now until November exhorting Puerto Ricans to vote, using an animated little brown tree frog, the coqui, which is a symbol of the island\u2019s national pride.</p> <p>Rumor-mongering is another, less civic, way the void has been filled. One story doing the rounds, which was repeated to the Guardian by several people in Kissimmee, is that Trump intends to remove US citizenship from Puerto Ricans should he become president. A basic Google search reveals that the story began as a <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/donald-trump-puerto-ricans/\">fake news report</a> in a satirical magazine and rapidly took on a life of its own via social media.</p> <p>Outside the Unidos supermarket in Kissimmee, a sense of political weariness hangs in the air along with the enduring heat of early autumn. Luis Arze, 58, sat under a row of fans keeping cool. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for anyone, they\u2019ve got so many problems,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kiara Balasquide is one of the enthusiasts. Born and raised in Kissimmee, she is a volunteer in the Hispanic Federation\u2019s voter registration drive and is fired up about the election: at 19 it will be her first chance to choose her president.</p> <p>In her personal capacity, how will she use that new and potentially critical power? According to the statistics, she should be gung-ho for Clinton, but no, she\u2019s stuck on the fence.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has no filter, he might be good or he might get us into a lot of trouble, it\u2019s hard to tell. Clinton is a liar, we don\u2019t know anything about her real character.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s how it\u2019s looking to a Latina in the idealistic flush of youth barely a month away from exercising the power of her vote for the first time. There\u2019s clearly still a lot at play among the boricuas of central Florida.</p>",

In the mid-90s I had a thriving, even glamorous, job in Bangalore, working for the Indian outpost of one of world\u2019s largest advertising agencies. I also had a father who at 57 had become ill to the point of being bedridden and had to give up his beloved career in journalism. </p> <p> One morning my boss introduced me to a new colleague from America. He was a tall, skinny guy with unruly hair. He was going to be on my creative team. I remember asking my boss: \u201cWhat\u2019s with the accent?\u201d I got over my irritation with the new guy\u2019s blurred R\u2019s, and over the next few months we became friends. I mostly slept through the German experimental films he liked to watch and he\u2019d groan at the Bollywood extravaganzas I preferred. We took up rock-climbing. We joined dancing classes where I bit my lip not to laugh at the sight of my slim friend being flung around the floor by our enormous, <em>mumu</em>-clad teacher to the strains of Eddie Rabbit\u2019s I Love a Rainy Night.</p> <p>For more than a year after we met, we were just close friends. Then, before I knew it, we were in love.</p> <p>I knew he would go back to his country at some point, that much was certain. So for us there was only the here and now. Even when we started dating we didn\u2019t talk about the future \u2013 there wasn\u2019t one for us, so what was the point?</p> <p>But then, during one of our many confessionals, I told him my secret. I had always wanted to be a writer. One summer he went back to America and came back with application materials to graduate programs. \u201cYou should take the GRE, I can coach you on the math,\u201d he said. Now the man I loved was doing everything he could to help me leave India and him. I applied for a full teaching fellowship to Temple University and got in. </p> <p>At JFK the visa officer noticed that my visa was from Temple in Philadelphia. \u201cWelcome to the murder capital of the east,\u201d he welcomed me. Nowadays students coming from India have readymade networks, contacts who are ready to help set up roommates and relatives eager to supply food and advice. That night in 1997 however, as the lights of the van that dropped me off on campus disappeared into the dark, I remember thinking: \u201cI don\u2019t know a single soul in this country.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/iraqi-refugee-living-in-america-some-wish-me-dead\">I'm an Iraqi refugee living in America.

Those first months I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was so lonely that one day I called up my ex-boyfriend\u2019s father in Houston, someone I had never met or spoken to, just to hear a familiar language, an Indian accent. <br></p> <p>Still, I had professors who were generous and cared about my work, and I loved walking into a classroom and arguing about American values with students from Korea or Armenia \u2013 countries that until then were just meaningless points on a map. America let me be in startup mode, create an invented-from-scratch life for myself. In those first years I loved the country with all the blind loyalty and fierce gratitude of a new immigrant.

There was no talk of love, no plans to discuss. Then in 1998, three semesters after I had moved to the US, my friend returned from India and abruptly moved to New York City, a two-hour bus ride away. When my father died that December, he was the first person I called and he showed up at my dorm a few hours later.</p> <p> We were married in 2000. He became a journalist, and in 2006 I became a citizen. We followed our lawyer\u2019s advice and took our five-year-old daughter and my first book to the final hearing.

Christie has been an aggressive critic of Clinton and even used his Republican national convention speech to play prosecutor and put her \u201con trial\u201d for endangering national security.</p> <p>He might therefore appoint a special prosecutor with some relish. \u201cThe FBI decision does not preclude reopening the investigation into Clinton,\u201d said a former government lawyer, who did not wish to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s not like double jeopardy. James Comey of the FBI has already looked at it and decided it is not a criminal matter \u2013 but of course, under a different administration, there might be new pressure from on high.\u201d</p> <p>If the special prosecutor found sufficient evidence to bring an indictment, Clinton could in theory go on trial before a jury and, if convicted, the judge would determine her sentence.

The conflation of the Newsweek quotes and Blumenthal appears to have been extracted by Trump from an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/785686449865707520\">inaccurate account of the WikiLeaks documents</a> reported by the Russian online news outlet Sputnik.</p> <p>The botched attack on Clinton and Blumenthal could backfire for Trump given that he has already been accused by his Democratic rival of being overly complimentary about the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Last Friday the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-administration-accuses-russian-government-of-election-year-hacking-229296\">Obama administration claimed</a> that the WikiLeaks documents had been hacked from Democrats\u2019 email accounts by the Russian government in an attempt to sway the US presidential election. </p> <p>Though Trump avoided talking about the groping tape in Wilkes-Barre, at an earlier rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, he did renew his line of defence that his 2005 bragging about being able to kiss and grab the genitals of women was only \u201clocker room talk\u201d. One of his leading surrogates, the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, went further by turning the issue into a joke.</p> <p>During a warm-up speech at the Wilkes-Barre rally, Giuliani made a quip about it during an attack on Clinton. He said: \u201cBoy, she is as phony as \u2026 I better not say, as I have to be nice. I might say it back in the locker room.\u201d</p> <p>In his Wilkes-Barre speech, Trump pressed all the familiar buttons that have by now become a mainstay of his insurrectionary campaign. He promised to build a wall along the southern border and have the Mexicans pay for it, to bring jobs back to America from overseas, and to cut taxes and government regulation.</p> <p>The candidate\u2019s braggadocio was clearly tailored to suit the tastes of his hardcore supporters, most of whom dismissed concern about the NBC tape as so much political correctness. The Republican candidate also appeared to believe that his openly hostile stance towards Clinton in the presidential debate \u2013 in which he threatened her with jail, interrupted her and jabbed his fingers at her multiple times, and stood ominously behind her when she was talking \u2013 had put the calamity of the groping scandal behind him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56pxc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793567\"            data-video-name=\"Trump 'prowls' behind Clinton during presidential debate \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pool\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb8cc1e4b03b4fd4fa5f18\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010TrumpLeer_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-behind-hillary-clinton-debate-video\">Trump \u2018prowls\u2019 behind Clinton during presidential debate</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So ebullient did he appear on stage on Monday night that he even took a toddler from his parents\u2019 arms and carried him on to the stage.

  "<p>Each time a new faction of British politicians find their way to power, they make the same mistakes. They start with grand promises that cheer party activists. But these promises often end up in a morass of mistakes. It is time the public demanded an end to the stupidity that is structured into politics before we are forced to suffer another round of costly cock-ups.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we have seen new faces take to the stage at party conferences to make new promises. Theresa May bought an end the era of Notting Hill neoliberalism and unveiled <a href=\"http://www.perc.org.uk/project_posts/the-protective-state/\" title=\"\">Erdington Conservativism</a>. Out went austerity, level playing fields and globalisation. In came infrastructure development, industrial policy and nationalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/09/amber-rudd-hate-foreigners-foreign-workers-companies-racist\">Does Amber Rudd hate foreigners, or does she hate us? | David Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Big ideas make excellent headlines but they rarely make good policy. This is because radical new ideas are often created by small groups of like-minded individuals. These bands of radicals can drive political innovation, but they also fall prey to groupthink. Psychologists have repeatedly found that many great screw-ups are driven by small groups of like-minded individuals who come together and end up <a href=\"http://liquidbriefing.com/twiki/pub/Dev/RefEsser1998/alive_and_well_after_25_years.pdf\" title=\"\">making stupid decisions</a>. These groups are often more concerned with agreeing with each other than making the right decision. In a tight-knit group, challenging dominant ideas is seen as a sign of disloyalty. This is particularly potent in politics, where loyalty is a vital currency. One act of dissent can be enough to end your career.</p> <p>People with big ideas rarely have much real-life experience of the policy area they are so set on shaking up. They often have a grand vision but little idea about how their fine ideas should be implemented. This is what happened when ministers in Tony Blair\u2019s government, with no real understanding of IT or health, pursued their grand vision of patient choice in health-care by commissioning the world\u2019s biggest civilian IT project. Unsurprisingly, the National Programme for IT proved to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/18/nhs-records-system-10bn\" title=\"\">\u00a310bn onmishambles</a>.

Today, civil servants rapidly move around departments. They are encouraged to have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude, so they rarely say no to politicians. What\u2019s more, today\u2019s civil servant often has as little expertise in their policy area as their clueless minister. I know of a case where a postgraduate student was asked to develop a new policy area during a three-month internship. When she asked \u201cWhat is important?\u201d, she was told by her twentysomething boss, \u201cOne or two good PowerPoint slides\u201d. At the end of her time she delivered her PowerPoint slides, and now this is a major area of government policy.</p> <p>When politicians with grand ideas end up making grand mistakes, they often move onwards and upwards within a year or two. Far from mistakes being punished, in politics they seem to be rewarded. This is what happened when Jeremy Hunt presided over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/12/rebekah-brooks-jeremy-hunt-email\" title=\"\">phone-hacking affair</a> as minister of culture, media and sport.

After overseeing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/29/liam-fox-ministry-of-defence\" title=\"\">increasingly dire situation</a> in the defence forces as minister of defence, he has just been rewarded with the vital position of trade minister. One wonders whether Dr Fox\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in defence bodes well for the UK\u2019s mission to do trade deals around the world.</p> <p>In my search for solutions, I found some inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/04/blunders-government-king-crewe-review\" title=\"\">Ivor Crewe and Anthony King\u2019s depressingly insightful</a> study of blunders in British politics. Policies should be created by groups hailing from a range of backgrounds and ideologies. All studies of group decision making shows that increasing diversity means decisions taken tend to be better quality, even though they take longer. This might mean cross-party groups should work through the details of new policy before it is released on the world.</p> <p>Politicians who want to make one of their big ideas into law should have at least some experience with the policy area. If they hope to shake up the energy sector, maybe they should spend some time in a power plant, a electricity distribution centre, or a customer service centre. They also might want to gain an understanding of the intricacies of implementing their favoured ideas. Maybe ministers should be banned from implementing any new idea until they can demonstrate a level of competence in their policy area.</p> <p>Finally, we should hold ministers to account by insisting they deliver their own stupid ideas, and clear up the mess which they will inevitably leave behind them. If a minister starts out on a new initiative, then they should stick around to see if though. Perhaps we might also insist on the kind of reward by results system they have implemented on everyone else in the public sector \u2013 if your policy screws up, then you don\u2019t get rewarded with another portfolio.</p> <p>Making these relatively minor changes to the way ministers work is one way we might try to save ourselves from the stupidity of a smart politician with a big idea.</p>",

The definition of marriage would change: The definition of marriage in s5 of the Marriage Act would be changed to replace \u201ca man and a woman\u201d with \u201ctwo people\u201d.</p> <p>2. The conditions for a valid marriage would stay the same: It will continue to be the case that a marriage would be void if, for example, the parties are in a \u2018prohibited relationship\u2019, consent was not real, or one or both parties are not of marriageable age.</p> <p>3. Foreign same-sex marriages would be recognised in Australia: All valid marriage solemnised under the law of a foreign country, including same-sex marriages, would be recognised in Australia if they are consistent with Australian law. A foreign marriage would not be valid in Australia if the marriage would be unlawful in Australia, for example, if the parties are siblings, in a parent-child relationship, or are polygamous.</p> <p>4. Existing protections for ministers of religion would be retained and strengthened: ministers of religion would be able to refuse to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man and a woman, if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister\u2019s religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of the religion, or if (irrespective of the teachings of his or her church) the minister has a conscientious objection to same-sex marriage.</p> <p>5. Marriage celebrants (including those who are not ministers of religion) would be able to refuse to marry a same-sex couple: In addition to the existing law whereby marriage celebrants are under no obligation to solemnise marriage, the Marriage Act would be amended to allow marriage celebrants who are not ministers of religion to refuse, on the basis of conscientious or religious beliefs, to solemnise a marriage on the grounds that the marriage is not the union of a man or a woman. Religious bodies and religious organisations would also be able to refuse to provide facilities, goods or services for the purpose of solemnisation of a same-sex marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental thereto, if the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion, or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion.<br></p> <p>In the event that the parliament passes the plebiscite bill, the government proposes the establishment of a joint select committee to review and report on the exposure draft.

Protections would be offered for religious organisations and celebrants involved in the marriage ceremony but not small businesses.</li> <li>Labor will meet this morning to decide their final position on the plebiscite bill that needs to pass for the plebiscite to be conducted. </li> </ol> <p>Apart from those points, these are the political points:</p> <ol> <li>Conservatives are unhappy that the amendments do not go far enough because small businesses are not offered protection on the grounds of freedom of speech \u2013 the so-called wedding cake clause.</li> <li>The LGBTI community say the amendments do not go far enough to force religious organisations to comply with the law. </li> <li>LGBTI community representatives are pushing the Labor party to oppose the plebiscite due to the fear of hate speech and the argument that no other human rights issues need to go to a plebiscite.</li> <li><strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> said this morning that Brandis released the draft marriage amendments at 11pm last night and expected Labor to decide overnight.</li> <li>Plibersek also said \u201cmeh\u201d to the changes, given the draft bill still doesn\u2019t answer the mental health concerns of a divisive debate, nor the $200m cost of the plebiscite.</li> <li>Brandis said while Labor may complain, in his meeting with his shadow minister <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong> and <strong>Terri Butler</strong>, Labor refused nine times to suggest what changes they would like to the plebiscite bill. They are not serious, says Brandis.</li> </ol> <p>He argued on Sky that the amendments set out the general rules of the act \u2013 the rest is up to the courts. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People will always be able to dream up borderline cases, I mean that is what courts are for to interpret acts of parliament. All we can do in acts of parliament is to explain a general rule. And the general rule we have created is an absolute exemption for ministers of religion. An absolute exemption on conscientious grounds for civil celebrants and an absolute exemption for churches and religious bodies in relation to the provision of facilities or the sale of goods or services reasonably incidental to a same-sex marriage ceremony.</p> </blockquote> <p>OK there is a whole lot more in Brandis\u2019s remarks, which I will bring you in the minute.

  "<p></p> <p>The next five years will see considerable work for Home Office staff managing our border, immigration and passport systems.</p> <p>Knowing that change is impending for EU nationals, the UK will see additional applications for visas, citizenship and passports from people already living here or hoping to live here. For example, the complex rules on marriage between EU and non-EU partners will be on the minds of many couples, who may now marry sooner rather than later. This will need additional staff and ongoing policy changes for any unintended consequences as a post-Brexit settlement beds down.</p> <p>But it\u2019s doubtful the Home Office, even with more staff, will easily cope with the new workload unless a line is drawn on much of the historic caseload, often going back for many years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/take-back-control-border-force-lax-security\">Take back control?

Some academic studies estimate there may be as many as 500,000 people while Migration Watch thinks it could be more than 1 million people. I think the latter is more likely and that the number will continue to grow as the total of people overstaying visas, being concealed through ports, entering on forged documents or absconding from contact will exceed the number leaving voluntarily or deported.</p> <p>Tackling this caseload is massive. Scant resources are rightly focused on higher risk individuals, such as foreign-national offenders who are deported on expiry of their sentence. Over the past six years, the government has made real progress on reducing abuse, including closing the loophole of bogus colleges that saw thousands admitted without really studying. But better control now cannot reverse the fact that the system has been abused and some people are still here after many years. The vast majority of cases of illegal migration are not active and staff resources could not cope if they were.</p> <p>An appropriate amnesty would make our post-Brexit system manageable, optimise resources to focus on new cases and also strengthen border control around our lengthy coastline. Replacing antiquated systems is also best achieved by closing legacy cases.</p> <p>As we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/20/obama-plan-shield-five-million-undocumented-migrants-deportation-speech\">have seen in the US</a>, this type of amnesty is controversial. Arguments against include that it may send the wrong signal to future would-be illegal entrants, and regularising through visas many people here may lead to their dependents overseas then applying too, if the rules allow, thus increasing net migration. And where is a line drawn to allow many to remain and the remainder to still face potential deportation?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/19/michael-gove-george-osborne-condemn-nigel-farage-anti-immigration-poster-eu\">Boris Johnson tries to calm immigration row with call for amnesty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the prize of taking a bold step will be considerable.

Starmer, touted as a future Labour leader, said his first priority would be to push for more parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has to be democratic grip of the process. At the moment, the PM is trying to manoeuvre without any scrutiny. That is why the terms on which we are going to negotiate absolutely have to be put to a vote in the house.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also put some clear water between his own views on immigration and those of the Labour leadership, which has refused to put a cap on numbers:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It should be reduced by making sure we have the skills in this country that are needed for the jobs that need to be done.

Why? Because of jobs. Millions of jobs have been created because European companies have been able to buy and sell freely to the richest consumers in the world, in the largest market in the world. Creating the single market was a painful process \u2026 A lot of politicians had to return home to their voters and admit that things would have to change. Allowing one country today to dictate its own conditions while being part of this market would probably lead to the unravelling of the whole package of hard-won compromises.

The UK will now acquire the control that Thatcher craved. But Brussels\u2019 social frontiers will be reimposed domestically. Free marketeers can lament their failure.

  "<h2><strong>Ambulance </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>This week on the medical documentary series, paramedic Rich is called to Brixton, where a man who has taken an overdose has become violent. It\u2019s just one of the incidents taking place when the pubs and bars start to either fill up or kick out on a Saturday night. But the service is stretched thin, with five babies being delivered by cool-headed call handlers across the city. When a call to attend a miscarriage comes in, it takes an emotional toll on all involved. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>National Treasure </strong><br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Along with the superb performances from Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and Andrea Riseborough, the key to the success of Jack Thorne\u2019s drama has been the carefully sustained ambiguity of Paul Finchley\u2019s position. Even if Finchley is found innocent in the eyes of the law, what does his behaviour say about the entitlement and impunity of celebrity culture? In tonight\u2019s final episode, will we be offered some answers as Finchley takes to the witness stand? <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Damned </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Jo Brand co-writes and stars in this downbeat but lovely social workers comedy. The third episode sees Al (Alan Davies) being sent to help a gay couple who are being hassled by locals, and Nitin (Himesh Patel) managing to get stuck in an air vent while trying to handle a hostage situation. The subject matter allows the scattering of some very real-world grit in among the frequent laughs, with Isy Suttie\u2019s jarring temp a particular highlight. <em>Grace Rahman</em></p> <h2><strong>Divorce </strong><br>10.10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Frances, a woman on the verge of divorce, in this new series written by Sharon Horgan. Frances lives in a world where the women are wicked and the men are 50 shades of boring. As an eventful birthday party provides a catalyst for change, her husband Robert (Thomas Haden Church) emerges as the real star. The couples\u2019 small moments of hatred are so sharply observed it hurts, and the whole thing is uncomfortably funny. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Great Continental Railway Journeys</strong> <br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Another outing with Michael Portillo, who has pretty much completed his transformation from rightwing bruiser to Joanna Lumley\u2019s understudy. Tonight he travels from Genoa to the Austrian Alps, learning how football was introduced to the port city by a Brit. After that, he takes a clifftop train ride along the Riviera Di Levante and winds up in Brenner Pass, where one of the world\u2019s longest railway tunnels is being constructed. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>Eamonn &amp; Ruth: How The Other Half Lives</strong> <br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The breakfast telly favourites continue their exploration of the richest people on the planet, seeming overly awestruck by supercars, properties and even pricey ice-cream. That said, this is not a programme exploring the world\u2019s disquieting wealth gap, but rather a look at what those kajillions can get you. This week, they\u2019re in the company of poker pro Liv Boeree and Michael Acton Smith, creator of kids\u2019 franchise Moshi Monsters. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Feed the Beast</strong> <br>9pm, AMC</h2> <p>Even the appearance of The Wire\u2019s John Doman as a racist businessman can\u2019t enliven this David Schwimmer vehicle about two friends looking to open a Greek restaurant in the Bronx. They were hoping to spin this premise out for several seasons, but it was cancelled after one. In this opener, Schwimmer\u2019s Tommy struggles to raise his traumatised son, while cocky buddy Dion (Jim Sturgess) is released from jail but now has to dodge the Polish mafia. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Body of Lies</strong> (Ridley Scott, 2008), 10.05pm, ITV4</p> <p>Not one of Ridley Scott\u2019s best, but an absorbing excursion into Jason Bourne territory. Leonardo DiCaprio is a CIA operative sent to the Middle East by his handler Russell Crowe to track down a terrorist leader (read: Bin Laden), but getting involved in turf wars with suave Jordanian intelligence chief Mark Strong.

But with the existing border control system under extreme stress, checks or visas for 100 million EU arrivals each year will mean a vast increase in workload for a Border Force that is already overstretched. Here\u2019s just one practical reality that makes Brexit look more shocking by the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/brexit-plan-divide-britain-ireland-uk-border\">This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once more | Diarmaid Ferriter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/23/theresa-may-home-secretary-government-migration-target-fail-likely\">missed all her targets</a> when she was in charge of immigration as home secretary, so she knows better than anyone the impossibility of cutting net migration down to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-drops-migration-target-deadline-after-mocking-corbyn-in-pmqs\">tens of thousands</a>\u201d.

The new home secretary, Amber Rudd, went to Heathrow in July to see how her Border Force performs. She might have expected our biggest port to be the best run, and on her visit she saw all the desks fully manned, with minimal queues at passport control and plenty of smiles.</p> <p>What she probably wasn\u2019t told was how many of those desks were staffed by people pulled in from everywhere else, including HMRC tax officers from Newcastle, who were put up in hotels. (Can HMRC spare them, when they are only <a href=\"%EB%BC%8A\">checking 4%</a> of self-assessment tax forms?)</p> <p>Had she asked staff about their workloads, they probably wouldn\u2019t have told the truth, governed as they are by a regime of terror and targets. I spoke to some Border Force staff, on condition of strictest anonymity, meeting them miles away from Heathrow for fear of disciplinary action if they were caught talking to a journalist. With no culture of transparency, this service punishes whistleblowers.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what they told me: after the public row over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/09/heathrow-passport-queues-london-olympics\">gigantic queues</a> before the 2012 Olympics, strict targets were set: non-EU passengers must queue for no more than 45 minutes, EU for 25 minutes, and fast-track first class just 15 minutes. These targets must be met 95% of the time.</p> <p>At present, they are met 70% of the time, and staff shortages mean that civil servants brought in from elsewhere get just a few days\u2019 training. \u201cAll they can do is a basic passport scan,\u201d say these whistleblowers. \u201cTraining and experience matter. We can feel whether something is wrong about who they say they are, where they\u2019ve been, for how long and how often. We notice their demeanour, their nerves.\u201d It takes experience to spot children being trafficked.

Now we are told it was simply a referendum on immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If members of the public complain about long queues with too few passport desks open, staff issue a reply from a printed sheet they\u2019re given: \u201cAll available Border Force officers are currently deployed and working to protect the public; border security remains our number one priority.\u201d An honest reply would go something like this: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough staff, we\u2019ve had cuts, we\u2019re on our knees working all hours and still missing our targets. Many more passengers are coming through and we don\u2019t have time to scrutinise them. Sorry. Did you vote for these cuts?\u201d</p> <p>With everyone manning the desks, paperwork piles up behind the scenes: asylum claims are rising again and people stopped can wait hours to be checked. Staff are taken off customs: \u201cGuns and drugs don\u2019t matter as much as queues,\u201d one officer says. They sometimes fail to claim the \u00a32,000 fines from airlines that bring people in with inadequate documentation because they miss a five-day deadline for claims.</p> <p>Staff hired now are on new contracts, with flexible annualised hours so they can be made to work overtime, extra days or to cancel holidays at short notice, \u201ca nightmare for parents with childcare\u201d, I was told. As a result, there is high turnover. \u201cWe\u2019re at least 300 short,\u201d these officers reckon. Managers deny it \u2013 but fixed official quotas of staff have been abolished.</p> <p>Visa checks on people from non-EU countries are weaker, they claim, now visa offices abroad have been closed. \u201cThere are no standard interviews for student or visitor visas now. But you can\u2019t rely on written references and qualifications,\u201d says one officer who has worked overseas. \u201cYou need to see applicants to detect people who are not what they say they are.\u201d During the present \u201csurge\u201d, there is only one forgery specialist each shift, instead of two or three: \u201cThey\u2019re run off their feet.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just staff grumbling: the rightwing, anti-public sector Adam Smith Institute <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/news/britains-beleaguered-border-force-stretched-to-breaking-point\">reported last month</a> that the Border Force is \u201cstarved of funds and neglected\u201d. Responsible for screening 225 million passengers a year arriving in the UK, it claims about 4,000 \u201chigh-risk\u201d flights are landing without proper security checks.</p> <p>Passenger numbers have risen by 20% since 2010 and are set to continue rising by 2% a year, while Border Force funding is cut: spending per passenger is down 25%. Some technology is 14 years out of date, while \u00a31bn was wasted on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/03/flaws-in-home-office-security-forcing-staff-to-rely-on-incomplete-intelligence\">failed e-borders system</a>.

The system cannot check them all \u201cin sufficient time to prevent high-risk travellers from starting their journey to or from the UK,\u201d the report said. That leaves 16.5 million people a year unchecked before arrival.</p> <p>Brexit will bring far worse problems. Half of all arrivals are from the EU, currently waved through on a scan to check their identity. But plans afoot at the Home Office suggest EU migrants will need to prove they have a skilled job lined up and can speak English. \u201cWe would need to check all these jobs were genuine \u2013 very difficult and very time-consuming,\u201d says one officer. It might require doubling the Border Force.</p> <p>\u201cTake back control\u201d was a brilliant play on people\u2019s fears. What the people swayed by it and everyone else should know is that controlling our post-Brexit borders will be phenomenally expensive and difficult.

The person said Walden said he expects even more erosion in Trump\u2019s numbers now.</p> <p>The people on the call spoke on condition of anonymity because the call was private.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fbc79de4b05d11acf9eb27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/steven-w-thrasher\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T16:59:58.395Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Snubbed at the debate: Black Lives Matter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On Sunday night, I wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> and Donald Trump to delve into real talk about race in America.

  "<p>Gil Faizon and George St Geegland \u2013 those legends of public access television, icons of the Upper West Side, and superstars of ill-fitting sweater vests \u2013 have finally made it to the main stem with <a href=\"http://ohhellobroadway.com/\">Oh, Hello on Broadway</a>, which George describes as a love letter to theater. \u201cOr,\u201d as Gil counters, \u201cmore of a stalker\u2019s note scrawled in lipstick on a mirror.\u201d This show, directed by Alex Timbers, is messy, puerile, crass, and wildly indulgent. It uses an unconscionable amount of mayonnaise. It is also uproariously, stomach-achingly funny. <br></p> <p> These septuagenarian grotesques are the alter egos of the comics <a href=\"http://www.nickkroll.com/\">Nick Kroll</a> (Gil) and <a href=\"http://www.johnmulaney.com/\">John Mulaney</a> (George), first developed on alternative comedy stages and more recently seen on The Kroll Show in the segment <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfdMsxSjY3o\">Too Much Tuna</a>. (Yes, enough tuna is used in this show to raise the mercury levels of everyone attending to dangerous heights. And this is even before the addition of a giant puppet depicting a tuna sandwich as incubus, which is practically guaranteed to give audience members nightmares. Also indigestion.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6263eea80ec08815c94fb3a292fbd3d091137c5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6263eea80ec08815c94fb3a292fbd3d091137c5c/0_0_6808_6195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This show is messy, puerile, crass, wildly indulgent ... and stomach-achingly funny.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"910\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This show is messy, puerile, crass, wildly indulgent \u2026and stomach-achingly funny.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Yang/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In a loose introductory segment, Gil, an actor, and George, a playwright and suspect in multiple homicide investigations, introduce themselves as \u201cthe orange pekoe teabag staining the countertop of American culture\u201d. They then skewer various theatrical conventions \u2013 the one-sided phone call, the shouted revelation \u2013 and finally segue into a play that George has written for himself and Gil to perform. In the midst of the play, there is a Too Much Tuna segment, and on a critic\u2019s night <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LateNightSeth\">Seth Meyers</a> was the sporting and only vaguely mortified interviewee. A typical softball question: \u201cWhy do you hate Jews so much?\u201d There is also a dream ballet, a series of gyrations that an audience will never be able to unsee.</p> <p> The show probably shouldn\u2019t work as well as it does. Kroll and Mulaney don\u2019t always play the characters consistently (when it seems like too much effort, they just play themselves) and they crack themselves up habitually. But the pleasure they take in the exercise is obvious and infectious. Yes, they\u2019re probably enjoying themselves more than anyone else in the audience, but they are enjoying themselves to such an outrageous, overwhelming, ecstatic degree that this is not faint praise. </p> <p> And the writing, though variable, has more than its share of semi-precious gems. To try to scribble them all down would leave any critic with carpal tunnel. But they manage to wring jokes from such unpromising subjects as Werther\u2019s Originals, Steely Dan, eczema cream and the Toyota Camry. Even ones that shouldn\u2019t kill do, like a description of \u201cone of those large, New York City diners where even the ice cream is bad\u201d, because Mulaney and Kroll have a way of delivering each line with a proprietary mix of disgust and amusement that leaves the audience howling and makes the somewhat staid environs of the Lyceum seem like the place to be, a rarity on Broadway. (Unless one has landed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/how-did-hamilton-become-broadway-breakout-hit\">Hamilton</a> ticket.) </p> <p>So raise a tuna sandwich to these repulsive oldsters. The pickle, too.</p>"
