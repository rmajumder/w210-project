  "<p>The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend.</p> <p>The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world\u2019s largest cities. </p> <p>The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards.</p> <p>Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on <a href=\"http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/greenland_ice_sheet.html\">earlier figures</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"798cb000d80a380bb773b5c008fb95a769a44a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/798cb000d80a380bb773b5c008fb95a769a44a29/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The southern tip of Greenland seen from space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The southern tip of Greenland seen from space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ISS/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland\u2019s volcanoes.</p> <p>The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today. </p> <p>This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland\u2019s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/9/e1600931\">Science Advances</a>.</p> <p>Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: \u201cOne thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,\u201d said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe new research happening now really speaks to the question: \u2018How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?\u2019 As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it\u2019s past time our policy reflected that urgency.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: \u201cThis study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/1000.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/1000.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Melt water on surface of Greenland ice sheet June 10, 2014 and June 15, 2016.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/17eb9ccb01a6c1fb7be0fe1ff9d880ba0e860f43/0_0_2064_1376/1000.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5857632d3199ae2f53ad52af8abb1b60bec11eaf/0_0_3093_2062/1000.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Melt water on surface of Greenland ice sheet June 10, 2014 and June 15, 2016.</a> <figcaption>Melt water on the surface of Greenland ice sheet 10 June, 2014 and 15 June, 2016.

  "<p>The UK has failed to meet many human rights recommendations made by the United Nations and should do more to prevent prison overcrowding, tackle hate crimes and restrict stop and search powers, a coalition of 175 civil society organisations claims.</p> <p>Their report, coordinated by the British Institute of Human Rights (<a href=\"https://www.bihr.org.uk/\">BIHR</a>) and submitted to the UN in Geneva on Thursday, also accuses the government of damaging international standards by threatening to scrap the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Repeal of the act would be a \u201cdenigration of international human rights law\u201d, the submission asserts. \u201cThe UK\u2019s retrogressive debates are already negatively influencing other countries. There is increasing concern that the UK\u2019s political rhetoric will, if not checked, threaten the coherence and credibility of the post-second world war human rights settlement.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx\">universal periodic review process</a> before the UN\u2019s human rights council, all 193 member countries are subjected regularly to an assessment of their human rights records and asked to improve where violations are identified. <br></p> <p>The UK is due to appear before the council in Geneva early next year. As part of the preliminary procedure, NGOs in each examined country can submit critiques of domestic problems. <br></p> <p>The report sent to Geneva by the 175 UK organisations \u2013 including Age UK, the TUC, Unicef UK, Rights Watch and Stonewall \u2013 acknowledges that the UK has a \u201cgenerally good level of rights protection\u201d but cautions that a high proportion of the 132 recommendations from the last UN hearings in 2012 have not been implemented.</p> <p>Among the failures, the report highlights the fact that race is the most commonly recorded motivation (82%) for hate crimes in England and Wales and that the Brexit vote coincided with a surge in such offences. It links reports on the government\u2019s policy of creating a \u201chostile environment\u201d for irregular migrants with discrimination against those from minority communities.</p> <p>The report expresses concerns that the prison system is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d due to over-crowding, assaults and the high number of suicides and deaths of inmates. </p> <p>On stop and search powers, the report says that although they are being used less, members of minority communities are still disproportionately affected. The powers granted to anti-terrorism officers to stop and question travellers under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 \u201cremain too broad\u201d.<br></p> <p>Stephen Bowen, the chief executive of BIHR, said: \u201cThe UK government needs to listen, not just to the United Nations but to the voices of the huge range of organisations closer to home that have shared their serious concern. They are troubled the government is taking the UK towards further isolationism and disregarding the United Nations, worsening the situation with welfare and legal aid cuts, and wanting to scrap the Human Rights Act, weakening its accountability for our rights at home as well as internationally.\u201d</p> <p>The report is being launched by David Isaac, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and Harriet Harman QC MP, chair of the parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights.</p> <p>Isaac is due to say: \u201cAny proposed changes to human rights law must not weaken the protections we all enjoy, jeopardise our remarkable record of upholding human rights nor move the country backwards.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are to stand up to human rights abuses abroad, our own record inevitably comes under scrutiny. Our credibility and influence as a global player depends on the UK having an exemplary human rights record - both in terms of the legal framework and our adherence to the highest standards of human rights in practice.\u201d</p> <p>He will call on the government to bring in a five-point plan:</p> <p>\u2022 To establish independent guardians for all unaccompanied children entering the UK.</p> <p>\u2022 To introduce a statutory duty to report trafficked and refugee children who go missing from care.</p> <p>\u2022 To stop immigration detention of children.</p> <p>\u2022 To provide protection for children seeking refugee status.</p> <p>\u2022 To ensure that those whose age is unknown are treated as children until their age can be determined.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally \u2013 true to the universal values shared by the United Nations.</p> <p>\u201cAs a nation we continue to fully comply to our international human rights obligations and we continue to take action to tackle any abuse of these rights. This includes working together with the UN to adapt a global response to mass migration and reducing the threat from international terrorism, stamping out modern slavery, championing the rights of women and girls and abhorring sexual violence in conflict.\u201d</p>",

The experience triggered Barris and his writers into making one of the funniest episodes since the show launched two years ago, but more importantly it confirmed something we already knew: the show is a series of modern-day parables on race relations disguised as a comedy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/24/black-ish-abc-show-race-issues-review\">Black-ish: a revolutionary new comedy tackling issues of race head on \u2013\u00a0review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here are a group of writers and actors, black and white, teaching America that it\u2019s OK to laugh, it\u2019s OK to cry, it\u2019s even OK to be angry about race \u2013 just make sure you engage with it. Barris began with a show about black identity and it has now developed into something much bigger. \u201cWe should be aware and constantly having conversations about the world because that\u2019s how you change it from the bigger standpoint rather than acutely trying to change things,\u201d he told Vulture. \u201cWe have to get into a place where we are able to have conversations, and it starts with the family. It starts within the home. If you don\u2019t put yourself in the place in your home where you talk about things going on in the world \u2013 you only talk about what\u2019s hip and hot \u2013 then nothing ever gets solved.\u201d<br></p> <p>Black-ish resonates with the African American community and helps white America understand another point of view. The show is a bridge-builder of race, and as the viewer you\u2019re paying attention to the point of the show.</p> <p>So if networks have finally woken up and realized that diversity is not only ethically important but also financially viable in order to create a popular, smart, funny show, then it\u2019s time to focus on a demographic that keeps getting ignored: the Latino audience.</p> <p>When it comes to understanding who the Latino community is \u2013 and I am not talking about immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">taco bowls</a> \u2013 the general American still struggles. Despite the fact that 18% of the US population is Latino or Hispanic, we are still mainly ignored by Hollywood. Earlier this year, a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latinos-hollywood-few-roles-frequent-stereotypes-new-study-finds-n523511\">study released by Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative</a> called the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, pointed out that out of more than 11,000 speaking characters surveyed in film and TV, 5.8% were Hispanic or Latino. This past Sunday at the Emmys, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/18/when-it-comes-to-the-emmys-few-latino-nominees\">not one single Hispanic or Latino performer nominated in the top acting categories.</a></p> <p>Aside from giving more opportunities for a number of Latino writers and actors, our own Black-ish would open the doors to a conversation about so many issues that remain unresolved \u2013 and just like Barris said, we will be able to change them because we are talking about it ourselves. </p> <p>Picture this hypothetical scene for a moment: the main character, Luis (Lucho) Calder\u00f3n comes back from work (he\u2019s an architect) and sits with his family as they watch Trump\u2019s speech on immigration. The entire episode would focus on Lucho and his wife, Gabriela, having to explain to their children why there is so much hate and ignorance in the only country they know. The impact it would have on an audience could be a powerful statement, similar to Hope \u2013 Black-ish\u2019s remarkable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/25/black-ish-police-brutality-episode-abc-rodney-king\">episode on police brutality from last season</a>. New York Times\u2019 James Poniewozik <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/arts/television/blackish-police-brutality.html\">summed it up</a> nicely: \u201cIt was funny but heartbreaking, nuanced but not mealy-mouthed, blunt but not despairing. It firmly established Black-ish, if there was any doubt, as a sitcom that\u2019s not just timely but up to the challenge of its times.\u201d<br><br>Another imaginary episode would deal with Luis\u2019s office as his colleagues celebrate Cinco de Mayo by wearing oversized sombreros and fake mustaches \u2013 in case you\u2019re unsure, this is a big red flag. The storylines are endless. I am a huge admirer of Jane the Virgin and Gina Rodriguez, but the show\u2019s message is less about the family dynamic and more about the value of womanhood \u2013 in this case Latina womanhood.</p> <p>What we need is a family who can stand together alongside the Johnsons and the Carmichaels, the O\u2019Neills, the Huangs and the Goldbergs, to confidently stand up and explain to network executives and America that we need a voice.</p>",

He said: \u201cWe&#xa0;now know why terrorists want her so badly to be president.\u201d</p> <p>In the potential leader of a great democracy, this is alarmist drivel. We&#xa0;should also be careful, since the&#xa0;exploitation of existential fear has long been a feature of America\u2019s isolated&#xa0;political culture. In 1950, a little-known American senator, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Kefauver\" title=\"\">Estes Kefauver</a>, achieved national fame by holding televised hearings into America\u2019s \u201corganised crime\u201d, drawing on blood-curdling fantasies of a Sicilian-American \u201cmafia\u201d. This mafia was, Kefauver claimed, holding American cities to ransom. Communities lived in&#xa0;fear of it. The national economy was&#xa0;menaced by it.</p> <p>The televised hearings were at times ludicrous. One hoodlum after another was dragged to Washington to protest that all he was running was a few protection rackets on the Lower East Side. Try as Kefauver might to find a Mr&#xa0;Big to justify his extravagant hearings, he found only a disorganised trail of small-time hoods. He still demanded a&#xa0;new Washington bureaucracy to \u201ccrack&#xa0;down on organised crime\u201d \u2013 and&#xa0;ran unsuccessfully for president. The search for \u201ca mafia\u201d was subcontracted to Hollywood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d9da9202eb1883265c97948a818c1ec4e447912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d9da9202eb1883265c97948a818c1ec4e447912/111_0_3279_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmad Khan Rahami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from WABC TV showing a man believed to be the New York bombing suspect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WABC-TV/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years later another senator, Joe&#xa0;McCarthy, decided to exploit a different \u201cexistential\u201d scare. His committee investigated what he claimed&#xa0;was the \u201cmassive\u201d penetration of the government and military by communists and homosexuals. Fear of a spurious threat to the state was turned into a witch-hunt by McCarthy and his aide, a certain Richard Nixon. There was a red under every bed \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;blackmailer in it. McCarthy, until his mental collapse, became a national celebrity. Americans have seemed to get a frisson from being told they are threatened, perhaps because they never&#xa0;have been.</p> <p>Likewise with Trump. The New York bomber was no more attacking America than, in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/lee-rigby\" title=\"\">Lee Rigby\u2019s killers</a> were \u201cattacking Britain\u201d. Why lend them such glory? These are pathetic groups, sometimes just individuals, committing nasty crimes. For better or worse, it happens every day. That the criminals occasionally yell, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d should be neither here nor there. That they may have travelled to the Middle East or&#xa0;downloaded jihadi tracts is a legitimate concern to the police. It is not a threat to the stability, let alone the existence, of the state.

It was to counsel responsibility, \u201csmart law-enforcement and good intelligence in concert with our values\u201d. It reminded us of the response of mayor Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, when he told New Yorkers not to panic but to go to the park, see a show, buy a pizza and \u201ccontinue with your normal lives\u201d. This was the opposite of Blair\u2019s response, which was to declare that 9/11 \u201cchanged the world\u201d and \u201crewrote the rules of the game\u201d.

Civil terror is a classic tool of the weak against the strong.</p> <p>In the case of modern jihadism, brutal mayhem has yet to deliver it a stable caliphate.

But given the absolute security of modern America and Britain, it is a dangerous self-indulgence.

At a stretch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/21/judge-urges-madonna-guy-ritchie-resolve-dispute-son\">Madonna and Guy Ritchie</a> filled that brief in their time. But Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were the biggest and glitziest of all, with their supersized family and affected normality (photos of them eating fast food with his inlaws in Missouri! Her lack of a publicist!) contrasted with their actually unimaginable inner lives. They were the rare celebrity couple who seemed genuinely into each other; after all, such was their initial attraction that it led to a divorce that has now been discussed longer than the marriages that both preceded and followed it. There was an air of old Hollywood glamour coupled with high-minded cerebralism about them that is hard to imagine any other celebrity couple pulling off now. Kim Kardashian, for example, tweets photos of her breasts for giggles; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/opinion/angelina-jolie-pitt-diary-of-a-surgery.html?_r=0\">Jolie wrote a New York Times article</a> about her preventative double mastectomy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50cceb212f83e4ba1aadd58c5db56d69a6e95c6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50cceb212f83e4ba1aadd58c5db56d69a6e95c6f/0_77_1998_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pitt and Jolie arrive at the Oscars, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitt and Jolie arrive at the Oscars, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The truth is, Jolie\u2019s personal life has long been a lot more memorable than her acting (her last truly seminal film was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/culture.reviews1\">Girl, Interrupted</a>, and that was made so long ago she was second billing to Winona Ryder, for heaven\u2019s sake).

Their relationship helped to define the 21st-century fame machine. In this sense, it felt absolutely right that the announcement of its end should come, not via a conventional press release, but through a leak on <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/09/20/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-kids-danger/?adid=hero1\">tmz.com</a>, precisely the kind of sensationalist tabloid blog that didn\u2019t exist when Pitt and Jolie first got together but has thrived in the sunshine of their ongoing soap opera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/sep/20/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-marriage-hollywood-screen-by-the-sea\">Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: a marriage that started \u2013\u00a0and ended \u2013 on screen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all their affected privacy, theirs was a relationship played out entirely in the shifting media landscape. When they were first photographed on a beach in 2005 playing with Jolie\u2019s adopted son Maddox (\u201c12 pages of new pics that prove the romance is real!\u201d screamed the cover of a US tabloid), celebrity gossip blogs were in the ascendence while tabloid magazines, especially Hello! and OK! in the UK, and Us Weekly and People in the US, were expensively battling one another and the web to get the most sensationalist photos first. Few were more sought after than anything to do with the Jennifer Aniston\u2013Brad Pitt\u2013Angelina Jolie love triangle, such as pictures of Aniston doing yoga on the beach on her own (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/20/jennifer-anniston-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-feud-rivalry-sexist\">\u201cPoor Jen!\u201d</a>) and Pitt and Jolie on (presumably) a different beach looking in one another\u2019s eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7d2f1f299b071a6aaaecd1cc436a80b04ec0727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d2f1f299b071a6aaaecd1cc436a80b04ec0727/0_67_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serious about the world \u2026 Jolie and Pitt at the World Economic Forum, 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serious about the planet \u2026 Jolie and Pitt at the World Economic Forum, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between 2004 and 2005 the number of paparazzi in the US almost doubled because the nature of celebrity gossip was changing. Instead of knowing-but-cosy articles written by columnists \u2013 from Walter Winchell, Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper in the 1930s to Nigel Dempster in the 70s and 80s \u2013 gossip shifted from being about words to being entirely about photos, and no one encouraged this shift more than the Brangelina behemoth. They rarely spoke about their family life except in the blandest of terms: tell-all expos\u00e9s would have been seen as far too tacky and self-exploitative for them. They were also too risky for Jolie, whose iron-clad image control became public knowledge when her stipulations about what journalists could and couldn\u2019t ask her <a href=\"http://www.bloggernews.net/17900\">were leaked online</a> (\u201cInterviewer will not ask Ms Jolie any questions regarding her personal life ... This interview will not be used in a manner that is disparaging to Ms Jolie ...\u201d).</p> <p>Instead, from the beginning, she and Pitt preferred to make their points through carefully controlled photo shoots and notably flattering paparazzi shots. Just three months after Aniston filed for divorce from Pitt in March 2005, he and Jolie ostensibly confirmed the increasingly hysterical rumours about their relationship when they posed for <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie/all\">a 60-page fashion shoot</a> depicting them in domestic bliss while flanked by five little boys who bore a striking resemblance to Pitt. The shoot was nominally pegged to the release of their film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/10/1\">Mr and Mrs Smith</a>, but, as Pitt and Jolie knew perfectly well, it was the frisson of the are-they-yes-they-totally-are rumours that made a glossy magazine hand them 60 pages. They happily exploited the public interest while still maintaining a semblance of the moral high ground by not actually saying anything. After all, next to <a href=\"http://www.posh24.com/photo/1636012/tom_cruise_couch_jump_oprah\">Tom Cruise\u2019s sofa-jumping</a>, which happened that same summer, a 60-page (did I mention it was 60 pages?) fashion shoot looked downright self-restrained.</p> <p>In classic Brangelina style, they didn\u2019t confirm they were in a relationship until the following year when Jolie was pregnant, and this made them seem loftily above the overexposed antics of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and the rest of the celebrity landscape back then. (Not everyone was wowed by the Jolie-Pitts\u2019 decision to communicate by glamorous photo semiotics as opposed to boring press conferences: Aniston later said that the fashion shoot proved to her that her ex-husband lacked \u201ca sensitivity chip\u201d.)</p> <p>The truth is, of course, few exploited the world of modern fame more thoroughly than the Jolie-Pitts. When Jolie decided to give birth to their daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/29/filmnews.film\">Shiloh, in Namibia in 2006</a>, the Namibian government, in a move straight out of Team America, enforced a no-fly zone over the coast where the family was staying. Pitt and Jolie invariably arrived last at red carpet events, such as the Oscars, thus ensuring maximum photo op, and, of course, there was the fascination with their multicultural children, which, again, the Jolie-Pitts did little to quell, with their strictly managed magazine shoots that sold for record-breaking millions. (If you think the Jolie-Pitts didn\u2019t use their family in their publicity, that they were merely compromising with the public\u2019s curiosity, ask yourself how many of their six children you can name. Three at least, probably. Now, how many of, say, Matt Damon\u2019s four children can you name? Even I had to Google that, and I write about this stuff for a living. This does not happen by accident.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436c07d1f7165280498c514cfaa6be74a8cdc21f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436c07d1f7165280498c514cfaa6be74a8cdc21f/0_0_3000_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pitt and Jolie with two of their adopted children, Maddox and Pax.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pitt and Jolie with two of their adopted children, Maddox and Pax.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave M. Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This double game \u2013 affecting to maintain privacy while actually being entirely in the public eye but only under their own terms \u2013 is what made them the perfect celebrity couple. They conjured up a form of \u201cintimacy at a distance\u201d, a term coined by Donald Horton and R Richard Wohl in their famous 1956 paper, <a href=\"http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/horton_and_wohl_1956.html\">Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction</a>. Most of all, they pulled it off by understanding the world of modern media better than the media understood itself. When the two of them needed to get the public back on side after Pitt\u2019s divorce from Aniston, and \u201cTeam Aniston\u201d sweatshirts were outselling \u201cTeam Jolie\u201d ones from LA boutiques by three to one, they didn\u2019t do it via the traditional means of fawning press interviews. As usual, they opted for photos. The two of them were pictured touring various developing world countries, with Pitt hugging children in orphanages and Jolie meeting victims of the 2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. Suddenly, they weren\u2019t the sex temptress and helpless hunk who broke the heart of America\u2019s sweetheart: they were the high-minded celebrity couple who were using their fame for good and, gosh, who has time for yoga and me-time on the beach when you\u2019re busy saving the world?</p> <p>Jolie, in particular, carved her own narrative for female celebrities in the 21st century: as opposed to being the lonely singleton followed by dated frump, which is the trajectory still accorded to every other famous woman, she was the sexual adventuress followed by idealised but still sexy mother figure and world saviour. Not even Madonna could pull off that combination successfully. It was genuinely interesting to watch her determinedly overturn the cliches, and while Pitt may have had the more successful career, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/angelina-jolie-pit-i-am-on-fire-on-the-inside\">Jolie was always the more interesting one</a>, the brightly coloured bird of prey to his blond mouseburger.

The BBC was not sending out alerts about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/04/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale-file-for-divorce\">Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani\u2019s divorce</a> last year. This is because, like the perfect celebrity couple, the perfect celebrity divorce has to represent something bigger to the public, either through a media-constructed narrative or through the scale of celebrities\u2019 cultural significance. There was Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds\u2019 divorce back in 1959, when the housewives\u2019 favourite left America\u2019s darling for Elizabeth Taylor, the temptress of her era. (As Carrie Fisher, Reynolds and Fisher\u2019s daughter, has rightly pointed out since, her parents were the original Aniston and Pitt, with Taylor as Jolie\u2019s antecedent.) Taylor then left Fisher for Burton, which led to the next big celebrity divorce times two, as they married and divorced twice, while a fascinated public watched two highly public figures drive each other mad through their mutual sexual attraction and self-destruction. The next one was Cruise and Kidman, followed by Cruise and Holmes, both of which were only interesting, really, because of Cruise\u2019s weirdness, which became more apparent with each divorce. Some might include Paltrow and Martin in this list, with their all too memorable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/mar/26/conscious-uncoupling-gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-separation\">\u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d</a>. But, really, next to the brightness of Taylor and Burton and even Jolie and Pitt (well, Jolie, mainly), they are too basic and beige in my eyes to make the cut.</p> <p>The narrative on Jolie-Pitt\u2019s split has yet to be decided, although Jolie is already showing her characteristically firm hand on that. Just as adopting a child on her own helped to change her image from \u2013 and I\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2013 kinky vampiric crazy lady to benevolent world saviour, so she is at least partly relying on her children to control the story. When news of the divorce broke this week, her attorney, presumably under Jolie\u2019s instruction, said that she had filed for divorce for \u201cthe health of the family\u201d. Her manager later reiterated the point, telling the media: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37427605\">\u201cAngelina will always do what\u2019s in the best interest of taking care of her family.\u201d</a> The inference being, of course, that Pitt\u2019s presence was somehow detrimental to their children. If being a perfect celebrity couple requires superhuman self-control, coming through a perfect celebrity divorce demands an unimaginable amount of personal drive.</p> <p>Rumours about the reasons for their divorce will run for decades, continuing to fuel the celebrity machine that they helped to shape and endure. Of course, the public will never know the full story, but that is always besides the point when it comes to celebrity gossip, where story matters more than truth and a person\u2019s symbolism is more significant than the actual person. Jolie and Pitt represented to the public, first, a passionate, forbidden love story, followed by a heightened version of an intimate, idealised family. In other words, theirs were stories more generally played behind closed doors, which is why so many people felt so personally invested in them. The end of their relationship clearly doesn\u2019t represent the death of love, as many of their fans have claimed online. But it does suggest the end of a kind of celebrity that managed to be conducted wholly on its own terms, with its own sort of dignity, which is already being destroyed in the divorce. The end of Brangelina is news in the way that the end of Burton and Taylor was news, not because of what they meant to themselves, but what they meant to the public. They knew how to play us better, it turned out, than they knew how to play themselves. That, perhaps, is the real definition of the perfect celebrity couple, and it\u2019s also why so many of them end up as the perfect celebrity divorce.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Kessel reminded the hockey world how much they\u2019ve been missing him as of late. The Pittsburgh Penguins sniper was left off Team USA\u2019s roster at the World Cup of Hockey, a questionable decision at best considering he led the team in scoring at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. <br></p> <p>Kessel absolutely roasted the American team, perhaps more specifically the brain trust, towards the end of the 4-2 loss to Team Canada in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PKessel81/status/778426548651163648\">near-perfect tweet.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PKessel81/status/778426548651163648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just sitting around the house tonight w my dog. Felt like I should be doing something important, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on it.</p>&mdash; Phil Kessel (@PKessel81) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PKessel81/status/778426548651163648\">September 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It was hilarious, but also hilariously telling: Kessel was not on the ice for the Americans and they suffered, only able to muster two goals through two games at the World Cup on Hockey. With Tuesday night\u2019s loss to Team Canada the Americans were eliminated from the tournament.</p> <p>And that\u2019s a good thing. The team\u2019s lack of scoring has been evident, and not adding players like Kessel and Tampa Bay Lightning forward Tyler Johnson to their line-up only highlighted how stuck in the past USA hockey at the best-on-best level is. </p> <p>Skill and speed, not size and grit, has become the core of successful teams at the NHL level. How then could the American brain trust overlook the fact that this is only amplified in shorter tournament play? Now they cannot, and the internal hand-wringing will begin. </p> <p>But sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you can pick yourself back up. Let this woeful showing at the World Cup of Hockey be the inspiration the team needs to tear apart their methodology and become more in-tune with the style of game being played by the world\u2019s best.</p> <p>Sure, the team can state that they were built to beat Canada. But meanwhile, their scheming resulted in rolling out the lumbering Justin Abdelkader with Patrick Kane, one of the Americans\u2019 few high-end threats. Abdelkader is a player whose even-strength points production on average through 60 minutes in the NHL last season put him with the likes of Brian Gionta, Troy Brouwer and super-pest Ryan Kesler.</p> <p>And while we\u2019re on the subject: let Canada\u2019s calm, cool dismantling of the Americans last night serve as notice to those who believe that agitators should take the place of skilled players in a tournament. Kesler did his best to physically intimidate Canada Captain Sidney Crosby, to absolutely no avail. Even when Abdelkader took a run at Canadian goalie Carey Price, Price calmed the Canadian players that rushed to his defense. Why retaliate when the Americans were going to be given a penalty anyway? Agitation may work with those who can fall victim to it on weaker NHL rosters, but the best players in the world are often the best at keeping their cool as well.</p> <p>But all hope is not lost here: Jack Eichel, Johnny Gaudreau, Auston Matthews and Dylan Larkin all represent the kind of high-end skill that Team USA desperately needed throughout their first two games. They\u2019re currently playing for the Under-23 North American team and depending on when and what format the next tournament takes, could be available for Team USA selection. Matthews, yet to even play his first NHL game, is the kind of crown jewel that is needed on a line with a Kane: in Monday\u2019s 4-3 barnburner of a loss to Team Russia, Matthews logged 20:57 of ice time, second only in forwards to wonderkid Connor McDavid.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what\u2019s needed for Team USA moving forward: taking more chances on players with skill instead of proven veterans who\u2019ve been able to maintain the grind of an 82-game NHL regular season. In tournament play, that kind of mojo and experience only goes so far. Often, one quick loss can throw a team off course very quickly, as could be argued was the case with this team. The loss to Team Europe was surprising and despite the early goal against Canada, breaking Carey Price\u2019s incredible 229-minute international shutout streak, Team USA could not maintain momentum. By the end of the second period, once Canada\u2019s depth became evident and they started toying with the Americans, the looks on the bench were of morbid defeat. </p> <p>Joe Pavelski is a fine NHL captain and one of the most consistent scorers in the league but matching him on a line with James Van Riemsdyk, himself a fine but not high-end scoring threat, isn\u2019t going to produce the goals needed to win tournament games. Team USA Coach John Tortorella said some were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SWhyno/status/777927652388790277\">\u201coverthinking\u201d</a> his constant changing of his lines before the Canada game, but perhaps extended thought before the tournament on his tactics might have helped. Why he continued to split up Pavelski, Kane and Max Pacioretty, three of the team\u2019s few legitimate scorers, and surround them with middle-of-the-road talent was perplexing. </p> <p>Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a team identity and adhering to it, as Tortorella did by moving Abdelkader up the lineup. Tortorella said that Abdelkader played the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SWhyno/status/777927652388790277\">\u201cstyle of game\u201d</a> that the US wanted, but therein lies the problem: sticking to your team identity will only drive you deeper into the ground if your identity is a dated one.</p>",
  "<p>At the entrance to a disused Milanese train depot repurposed for the afternoon as a fairytale boudoir (plush seating cubes in buttoned pink velvet, strip-bar glitter curtains, a throaty undertone of dry ice), each guest arriving for the Gucci catwalk show was handed a pink piece of paper. On it was printed a quote by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/vladimirnabokov\">Vladimir Nabokov</a>: \u201cLiterature was not born the day a boy crying \u2018wolf, wolf\u2019 came running out of the Neanderthal valley with a big grey wolf at his heels; literature was born on the day when a boy came crying \u2018wolf, wolf\u2019 and there was no wolf behind him.\u201d </p> <p>Alessandro Michele, Gucci\u2019s creative director, likes to layer several characters into an outfit \u2013 he himself was dressed for the show in a distinctive Renaissance-biker style that the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/guccis-renaissance-man\">New Yorker said in a recent profile</a> suggested \u201ca dandy who had run off to join the Hell\u2019s Angels\u201d.

(\u201cAll of my fashion is an illusion,\u201d he said after the show.) </p> <p>Second, that Gucci is as much about fairytale as it is about reality. (Many of Michele\u2019s dresses, with their pineapple-top fronds of organza and elaborate embroidery, look as if they might have been conjured into life by Cinderella\u2019s fairy godmother, or stitched by the bluebirds in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.) </p> <p>Third, that stars can be born from unlikely places: the boy who cried wolf, the villain of the tale, becomes a hero from Nabokov\u2019s point of view. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c6f2ea51b6065f64e4aa4525d73cd09577388b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c6f2ea51b6065f64e4aa4525d73cd09577388b3/0_0_2981_4504/662.jpg\" alt=\"Gucci spring-summer show at Milan fashion week.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Models walked to a soundtrack of William Blake\u2019s poetry recited over a choral backdrop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giannoni/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is Michele\u2019s fourth season as the golden boy of Milan fashion week, having been plucked from the relative obscurity of the design room. The success he has brought to Gucci \u2013 sales of womenswear have risen 66% this year \u2013 is particularly notable, being in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/25/prada-thinks-differently-at-milan-fashion-week-with-commentary-on-glamour\">ailing fortunes of Prada</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/01/giorgio-armani-revenues-hit-china-slowdown\">Armani</a>. </p> <p>Fashion tires of its new discoveries fast. But Michele remains compelling partly because although his manner is warm and engaging \u2013 the virtual free-for-all backstage is unusual in strictly controlled Milan \u2013 he remains an intriguingly unknowable figure. He segues from dense cultural theorising (he mentioned French intellectual Roger Caillois in discussions about this show, as well as German author Elias Canetti) into raptures about his latest best friend, Elton John (\u201cI love Elton! He is amazing! Like a \u2026 firework!\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c2dc6788e6c61a5294cad0a261240096854e52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c2dc6788e6c61a5294cad0a261240096854e52/0_0_2981_4504/662.jpg\" alt=\"Gucci spring-summer show at Milan fashion week.\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Accessories were just as eccentric as the clothes on show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giannoni/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stage set for this show had the scent and colour of a seedy nightclub, but a soundtrack of William Blake\u2019s poetry recited over a choral backdrop. Channels of white light beaming down as if from high windows gave it an alternate identity as a sacred space. Michele, who in June staged the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/02/westminster-abbey-divine-inspiration-gucci-show\">first ever show to take place in Westminster Abbey</a>, has said he is not religious, but is drawn to places of worship because \u201cyou can feel the power of the people who were inside to express themselves, or to ask for something\u201d. <br></p> <p>What makes Michele\u2019s commercial revival of Gucci all the more extraordinary is that, in contrast to the straightforwardly glamorous clothes of the Tom Ford era, the aesthetic is a long way from the mainstream. An endless lineup of clashing sugary pastels, crammed together like the ice-cream trays in a Milanese gelateria, were whipped into a frenzy on the catwalk with the help of disco lurex, cricket-jumper trims, embroidered animals and cryptic legends in gothic fonts. Accessories \u2013 the cash cows of any luxury brand \u2013 were no less eccentric, with pearl-studded platform sandals and regal handbags hoisted into backpacks by wide satin ribbons.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Kinnock oversimplifies the immigration issue (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/cure-divided-britain-managed-immigration-work-permits\" title=\"\">The need now is to manage immigration,</a> 19 September). Yes, it was an issue, but in difficult times underprivileged groups find a scapegoat. Some places with large immigrant communities, notably London, voted to remain, as did the whole of Scotland. The relentless anti-immigrant propaganda in the popular press played a major part in swaying leave voters. In the last year alone Germany took in around 1 million refugees, an astonishing figure. Yes, there have been problems, but the sky has not fallen in and Germany is not about to leave the EU.&#xa0;</p> <p>Poorer people living in deprived areas with few amenities feel the growing income gap. They read about absurd salaries and bonuses, and note the ostentatious flaunting of wealth. Meanwhile they are subjected to cruel cuts in benefits (which should be called entitlements) plus bedroom tax and the rest. It is a severe indictment of our society that thousands need to resort to food banks. Those in work are in many cases subjected to harsh working conditions, low pay and little or no security.</p> <p>Some were taken in by the blatant lies such as the untold extra millions promised for the NHS. Jonathan Lynn (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/19/brexit-means-brexit-foreign-secretary-polish-ambassador\" title=\"\">Brexit means Brexit, G2, 19 September</a>) expresses well why we should have nothing but contempt for our foreign secretary. He kept us waiting for his decision because it was so close that he found it difficult to make up his mind, and then in a Damascene conversion became a Brexit fanatic overnight.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yes, we need a just and compassionate policy on who enters the country, but this needs to be separated from racist xenophobia and should certainly not be a response to it.<br><strong>Joseph Cocker</strong><br><em>Leominster, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In calling for limits on EU immigration, Stephen Kinnock falls into the same mistake that has made the political left in the UK a tired, toothless imitation of the right. It caves in to the Conservative narrative instead of developing one of its own, much like Ed Miliband\u2019s disastrous campaign. Restricting immigration not only addresses the wrong issue but it simultaneously legitimises it.</p> <p>Labour should be addressing the anger of many leave voters by attacking decades of spending cuts to public services, catastrophic housing policies, and the decline of unions. Brexit negotiations could serve as a nationwide platform for demanding increased minimum wages, extended public investment, and stronger welfare \u2013 all of which would address the exploitation of both underpaid British and low-skilled EU workers. Failing to provide an alternative vision and falling back on blaming immigration would not only do injustice to the fraction of the British electorate that currently feels disenfranchised, it would also doom the future of the new left.<br><strong>Thu Thuy Phan and Grant McDonald</strong><br><em>University of Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Kinnock thinks we need to manage migration but he has misunderstood the problem. We do not have a migrant problem, but we do have a massive problem with companies, business bosses and shareholders addicted to a never-ending supply of cheap labour. The UK is a low-wage economy, as is shown by the \u00a330bn a year spent on in-work benefits, which are nothing more than a taxpayers\u2019 subsidy to employers paying low wages.</p> <p>It is not some bureaucratic, expensive work permit system that is needed but a genuine living wage that is properly enforced.<br><strong>Michael Gold</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am a Guardian member; I knocked on doors for remain; I have campaigned for Labour or the Liberal Democrats at every election since 1997; I am horrified beyond words by the rise of Ukip and the increase in racial violence in this, my country (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/embassies-alleged-hate-crimes-since-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">Embassies log growth in attacks after EU vote</a>, 19 September). Furthermore I recoil from Stephen Kinnock\u2019s proposal that potential immigrants should be sifted on the basis of how \u201cuseful\u201d they are \u2013 a horribly utilitarian and certainly unchristian way of assessing our fellow human beings.</p> <p>However, my emotions are offended and my head identifies stupidity when I walk through parts of London and see whole rows of shops whose signs are exclusively in Arabic, or, as I did recently, enter a shop in sleepy Hereford where there was not a word of English to be seen among the Polish labelling and signage.</p> <p>Such practices are discourteous and alienating to the native population, encourage insularity among the newcomers, and provide political ammunition for those determined to stir up prejudice and hatred. If good sense does not preclude them, surely the law should do so: the exclusive use of non-English signs and labels should be banned. (Civil servants can work out the details, including where Welsh and Gaelic fit into all this.)</p> <p>Some hardline racists will never accept immigration as a normal part of national life; but I would suggest, based not least on personal contacts, that there are huge numbers of decent people who could be weaned back from flirtations with Ukip and the politics of hate by simple measures such as this.<br><strong>Peter Geall</strong><br><em>Coventry</em></p>",

I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get bottled off stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8&#xa0;million had fled Syria.

By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking plaster rather than a cure.</p> <p>Even more concerning is the UK\u2019s involvement in the so-called Khartoum process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan\u2019s refugees from reaching Libya and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan\u2019s record of ethnically cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek sanctuary \u2013 and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan\u2019s government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, they would be more likely to stay there. By too often appeasing Sudan\u2019s leaders, we have guaranteed that thousands of Sudanese will continue to seek refuge with their former colonial rulers.<br><strong>Olivia Warham</strong><br><em>Director, Waging Peace</em></p>",

  "<p>An Eritrean refugee accused of being the most influential people-smuggler in north Africa will face a second trial in Italy despite the failure of prosecutors to provide a single witness to testify against him during his initial prosecution.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that Medhanie Berhe, a 29-year-old former milk-hand, is in fact Medhanie Mered, a notorious 35-year-old people-smuggler who has sent thousands of Eritrean refugees from Sudan to Libya, and then onwards to Italy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/10/eritrean-accused-of-being-people-smuggling-kingpin-says-he-is-innocent\">Eritrean accused of being people smuggling kingpin says he is innocent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berhe was extradited to Italy in June, amid initial fanfare from the Italian <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/869-prolific-people-smuggler-captured-in-sudan\">and British police</a>, who were involved in the operation, and who claimed to have caught a kingpin of north African smuggling.</p> <p>Berhe\u2019s family hoped he would be swiftly released, after several of Mered\u2019s former passengers said in court and in interviews with the Guardian that Italy had arrested the wrong man. His relatives also produced documents proving Berhe\u2019s actual identity.</p> <p>But on Wednesday their hopes were dashed when a Sicilian judge sent Berhe\u2019s case to a higher court for a longer trial. The decision came despite a sound engineer summoned by the court testifying that he was unable to tell whether the accused\u2019s voice was the same as the one heard in an undercover recording of the smuggler during police investigations. \u201cThe result of our comparison is inconclusive, ineffectual,\u201d the engineer told the court. \u201cWe can\u2019t state if the man arrested is the same as the smuggler wiretapped in 2014.\u201d</p> <p>No prosecution witness was able to identify Berhe as Mered. Additionally, photographs taken from Berhe\u2019s phone \u2013 which prosecutors said were of the smuggler\u2019s dead victims \u2013 were shown to have been taken from an Asian website. After Berhe handed over access to his social media accounts, prosecutors did not find further evidence to present to court.</p> <p>Prosecutors say Berhe might have had two identities, and they have been able to prove that Berhe twice called smugglers in Libya earlier this year. But his lawyer, Michele Calantropo, highlighted how members of the Eritrean diaspora are often forced to contact smugglers to facilitate payment for friends and relatives trapped or kidnapped in Libya.</p> <p>Calantropo also said that Berhe had been in a refugee camp in Ethiopia at the time prosecutors said he was wiretapped while working as a smuggler in Libya.</p> <p>Following Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Calantropo said: \u2018\u2019We\u2019ll wait for this new trial to prove that my client is innocent. We hope to produce new evidences within this month.\u201d</p> <p>Maurizio Scala, the prosecutor who led the investigation, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are pleased with the decision of going on a higher degree of judgment.

  "<p>The Paris climate agreement is on the brink of coming into force after 31 nations officially joined the landmark accord, with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, predicting it will be fully ratified by the end of the year.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/09/list-of-states-expected-to-deposit-paris-agreement-ratification-instruments/\">31 countries</a> formally signed up to the Paris deal at the UN general assembly in New York. They include Brazil, the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10.pdf#page=30\">seventh largest emitter</a> of greenhouse gases, Mexico, Argentina and Sri Lanka. Oil-rich United Arab Emirates also ratified the deal, as did nations considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, such as Kiribati and Bangladesh.</p> <p>The pledges mean that a total of <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php\">60 countries, representing 47.7% of global emissions</a>, have now formally joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris agreement</a>. The deal aims to limit the global temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of keeping it to 1.5C. </p> <p>A total of 55 nations representing at least 55% of global emissions need to sign up for the deal to come into force. The first of these thresholds has now been reached, with Ban and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, both predicting that the agreement will be fully implemented within months.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ever more confident that the Paris agreement will enter into force this year,\u201d Ban said. \u201cI appeal to all leaders to accelerate domestic arrangements to join this year. </p> <p>\u201cWhat once seemed impossible now seems inevitable. When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride knowing that we seized the opportunity to protect our common home.\u201d</p> <p>Video messages from Germany, France, the EU, Canada, Australia and South Korea among others all promised to ratify the Paris accord in the coming months. Should these promises be fulfilled, the agreement will pass the second threshold and come into force.</p> <p>Australia, one of the largest per capita emitters, will make its \u201cbest endeavours to ratify\u201d in 2016, said the country\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, said her country planned to ratify the deal \u201cwell ahead\u201d of the next UN climate meeting in <a href=\"http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-22\">Marrakesh in November</a>. The UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/theresa-may-uk-ratify-paris-climate-change-agreement-this-year\">made a similar commitment</a>.</p> <p>Kerry said it was an \u201cexciting moment\u201d but warned that the threat posed by climate change grows every day.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem we continue to confront is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cEach day the planet is on this course, it becomes more dangerous. </p> <p>\u201cIf anyone doubted the science, all they have to do is watch, sense, feel what is happening in the world today. High temperatures are already having consequences, people are dying in the heat, people lack water, we already have climate refugees.\u201d</p> <p>Kerry added that international climate negotiations have been a \u201clong and frustrating path\u201d since 1992 but that the Paris deal means that they are \u201cfinally becoming a story that we are proud to tell our grandchildren and future generations\u201d.</p> <p>The UN climate change chief, Patricia Espinosa, said: \u201cThis is an extraordinary momentum by nations and a clear signal of their determination to implement Paris now and raise ambition over the decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 195 nations put their name to the Paris deal and submitted promises to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Several analyses have cast doubt over whether the pledged emissions cuts will be sufficient to prevent a 2C temperature increase, with concerns exacerbated by record-breaking heat experienced over the course of 2016 </p> <p>The warmest August on record was recorded last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201608\">confirmed on Tuesday</a>. The US government agency said last month was the 16th month in a row where temperature records were broken, with July being the single warmest month since modern record keeping began in 1880. </p> <p>The soaring heat, which has retained much of its intensity despite the end of the El Ni\u00f1o climatic event, is unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/nasa-climate-change-warning-earth-temperature-warming\">in at least 1,000 years and probably much longer</a>, scientists have said.</p> <p>But climate campaigners have said that the speed of the Paris deal ratification raises hopes that the world is finally swinging behind efforts to reduce emissions and prevent the worst ravages of a warming planet. </p> <p>\u201cThe global community is rallying behind swift and ambitious action to combat climate change,\u201d said Paula Caballero, global director of the World Resources Institute\u2019s climate program. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the Paris agreement will likely enter into force this year took everyone by surprise. This rapid pace reflects a spirit of cooperation rarely seen on a global scale. </p> <p> \u201cToday we pause and celebrate the important progress towards bringing the Paris agreement into force. Then we again pick up our shovels and continue the hard work of creating a safer and more prosperous planet.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Our mother, Rona Gordon, who has died aged 83, divided her life between her two motherlands \u2013 Britain and Denmark.</p> <p>She was born in Odense, Denmark, and her later life was powerfully influenced by her childhood there. Her adventurous parents, Bertha (nee Armstrong), who had moved to Denmark from her native Scotland in the 1920s, and Viggo Carlsen, both teachers, were sources of stability and inspiration.</p> <p>But this was overshadowed by the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany from 1940 to 1945. Rona described life on the brink of being sucked into the vortex, experiencing the dangers of war close at hand thanks to her parents\u2019 hazardous involvement with the resistance, and an assassination attempt on her best friend\u2019s father, a communist sympathiser who was shot in his own home by three Danish collaborators.</p> <p>After the war Rona embraced the adventure of travel on exchange trips, independent cycling holidays and at international Girl Guide events. She qualified as a librarian in Copenhagen, and then in 1957 went to Glasgow University to study history, compelled to understand how individuals and families shape, and are shaped by, historical events. While a student, she assisted the historian J\u00f8rgen H\u00e6strup (her former schoolteacher) with research on a book about the German occupation of Denmark.</p> <p>She met Alex Gordon, a Glaswegian, as a fellow student at university. They were part of a golden generation of the university Labour club, with such future luminaries as John Smith and Donald Dewar as their contemporaries. Alex became a maths lecturer at a college of further education and a longstanding Labour councillor who also stood for parliament.</p> <p>On marrying in 1963, Rona and Alex lived briefly in London and then settled in Kettering, where she concentrated on the roles of wife and mother. She went on to teach English as a foreign language, among other subjects, and made friends with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/the-refugee-crisis-and-when-britain-led-the-world-in-compassion\" title=\"\">east African Asian refugees </a>who arrived in Northamptonshire. An unwavering egalitarian and internationalist, she was a campaigner for understanding and cooperation in Europe as an instrument of peace, and proportional representation as a means of obtaining more representative government.</p> <p>She brought these passions into her commitment to the Labour party and the Co-operative movement. Although cancer and a serious heart condition curtailed her public roles, she believed that political engagement is the duty of a citizen of a democracy. At home, her practicality and passion brought some Danish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/11/hygge-the-danish-art-of-living-cosily-on-its-way-to-uk-bookshops\" title=\"\"><em>hygge</em></a> into our childhood and gave us both the stability and inspiration that her parents gave her.</p> <p>Alex died in 2009. Rona is survived by us, by her sisters, Kayleen and Shiela, and by three grandchildren.</p>",

  "<p>Dozens of people have died and officials fear hundreds more have been lost at sea after a boat carrying 600 migrants capsized off the north Egyptian coast, as world leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-refugee-crisis-response-obama-coalition\">gathered at a summit in New York</a> to discuss the refugee crisis.<br></p> <p>Rescuers have brought more than 150 people ashore and recovered 43 bodies, including several women and a child, and hundreds more are missing, according to local officials and news agencies said. </p> <p>\u201cWe are deeply concerned at reports that hundreds of people may be missing at sea,\u201d said Matthew Saltmarsh, spokesman for the United Nation\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR.</p> <p>\u201cEvents like this highlight the importance of rescue operations as part of the response to the movement of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean and the need for real, safer alternatives for people needing international protection.\u201d </p> <p>Like most boats used for human trafficking, the ship that sank not far off the Egyptian coast appeared to have been dangerously overloaded, security officials said.</p> <p>Smugglers operating from Egypt often use old fishing boats for the long journey to Italy. Manypassengers are crammed below deck, with little chance of surviving if the boat sinks.</p> <p>\u201cInitial information indicates that the boat sank because it was carrying more people than its limit. The boat tilted and the migrants fell into the water,\u201d a senior security official in northern Beheira province told Reuters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0112082f3cc8f4bf8c3fca4629cb76a5a3f9b21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0112082f3cc8f4bf8c3fca4629cb76a5a3f9b21/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather along the Mediterranean during the search for victims in Al-Beheira, Egypt on Wednesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather along the Mediterranean during the search for victims in Al-Beheira, Egypt on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the dead were mostly Egyptian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali nationals.

They still haven\u2019t pulled his body out of the water.\u201d</p> <p>The tragedy is part of a growing human trafficking problem out of the country. Neighbouring Libya is still the starting point for most efforts to reach Italy by boat from north Africa but, after years of lawless chaos in the region, a rising number of people are setting out from Egypt instead.</p> <p>In the first seven months of this year, Italian data showed that the number of migrants who reached the country by boat from Egypt was <a href=\"http://file///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/Sea_Arrivals_to_Italy_Jan_to_July_2016%20(1).pdf\">nearly 70%</a> higher than the same period of last year. Arrivals from Libya fell slightly.</p> <p>A safer embarkation point has not made the journey itself any less perilous. Thousands of people have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean, with nearly 3,000 dead or missing in the first eight months of this year, according to <a href=\"http://file///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/DeadandMissing20160901%20(1).pdf\">UN data</a>.</p> <p>The deadliest month was May, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/700-migrants-feared-dead-mediterranean-says-un-refugees\">hundreds of people died in three separate incidents</a> that overwhelmed rescuers.

So if the Tories are going to lose seats, they will lose them to the Lib Dems, he told his conference.</p> <p>Conveniently for the Lib Dems, <strong>Chris Mullin</strong>, the former Labour minister, is making exactly the same argument. He has just published <a href=\"https://profilebooks.com/hinterland-hb.html\">Hinterland, a memoir,</a> and in it he says Labour needs a Lib Dem revival because \u201cthey can win seats in places we can never hope to hold.\u201d</p> <p>More significantly, Mullin, a leftwinger and former minister, calls for an electoral pact with the Lib Dems and the Greens. Here is an extract from his book.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the Tories have by historical standards only a small overall majority, the political realities are stark. Labour is between a rock and a hard place. Too left-wing for the southern middle classes, not left-wing enough for Scotland. Given that Scotland is not likely to return to the Labour fold any time soon, I see only one way forward - an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens designed to ensure that in, say, a hundred of the most marginal seats the Tories face a united opposition. Tribalists on all sides will throw their hands up in horror at the prospect, but the truth is that Labour badly needs a Liberal Democrat revival because they can win seats in places we can never hope to hold. One should never say never in politics, but the alternative is an indefinite period of Tory rule. Think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Farron did not go quite this far. But there is increasing interest in the idea of some kind of progressive alliance on the left. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/18/labours-lisa-nandy-urges-party-to-ditch-tribalism\">The Labour MP Lisa Nandy has co-edited a new book that explores the idea. </a>Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, is supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement\">a separate initiative promoting cross-party progressive cooperation. </a>And the Green party, under their new co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley, are actively pushing the progressive alliance theme.

And the way it was done was even more disgraceful. At the end of an NEC, when people had left, a paper laid round and a decision taken on a vote of 14/14. And it was carried on the basis of a recommendation. So it was 14 people basically preventing 140,000 [sic] people having a vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although people who joined after January were able to vote if they paid \u00a325 to become a registered supporter, McDonnell said many people could not afford that. He said many of those excluded were Corbyn supporters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we lost, I think, a large group of people who were Jeremy Corbyn supporters. I think never again should we allow that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the proposal from Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, that was debated at the NEC yesterday to change the leadership election rules and reintroduce an electoral college.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing about our party now is it\u2019s based on one person one vote. I don\u2019t want to go back to some of the proposals that have come forward today [for] electoral colleges. Because what that would mean, as it was before ... the parliamentary Labour party gets a third of the votes. It will mean for every individual MP, their vote will mean 3,000 or 4,00 of ours. That is unacceptable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He criticised the way Labour has applied rules banning some members from taking part in the election</strong>. People were being suspended \u201cfor the bizarrest of reasons\u201d, he said. He said he know one woman who was suspended for tweeting that she supported the Greens; but she was talking about a team from her child\u2019s primary school, not the Green party.

But McDonnell insisted that, even if Corbyn got a lower share of the vote than the 59.5% he got last time, that would not weaken his mandate. McDonnell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to be really tough to get the 59.5% that we got last time around because of the numbers that have been prevented from voting.

You don\u2019t need to have one eye on a green seat to be political at university; you just need to care about the welfare of others around you.</p> <p>As Kallum Taylor, former student union president for the University of York, puts it: \u201cStudents are increasingly important stakeholders within their universities.

  "<p></p> <p>Navarinou Park \u2013 part playground, part open-air cinema, part vegetable garden and verdant oasis \u2013 was never meant to be. On that, all of its participants agree. Stavros Stavrides, a professor of architecture at Athens\u2019 National Technical University, is the first to say it; so, too, do the local residents who, spade in hand, also worked to transform an unprepossessing parking lot on the rim of Athens\u2019 edgy Exarcheia district into a vibrant community garden.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019d have thought?\u201d asks Effie Saroglou, a dancer, walking her dark-haired mutt around the park. \u201cWho\u2019d have imagined us ever sitting here?\u201d says Yannis Mandris, a musician, watching a grainy rendition of Blade Runner in a makeshift arena on the other side of the lot. Something is stirring in the Greek capital \u2013 and in more ways than one Navarinou Park has come to represent it. </p> <p>Stavrides calls it a movement, a new form of commons in which public-spirited individuals reclaim public space; others an informal urbanism born of a spirit of solidarity that has taken hold since Europe\u2019s economic crisis erupted in Greece in 2009. For in Navarinou \u2013 a place run by neighbourhood committee \u2013 citizens have sought new ways of overcoming the trauma of economic collapse. And they have done so by creating a place where, self-contained and seemingly beyond the reach of authority, they can meet, converse, play and produce food.</p> <p>Bereft of civic protection and the great umbrella of the welfare state, grassroots groups across Athens have followed suit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc67becbf6bfefa089cb41415f6140491784732/0_149_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Navarinou Park hosts a \u2018community kitchen event\u2019 in 2011, organised to help out those hit hardest by the financial crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we are witnessing is an explosion of social networks born of bottom-up initiatives,\u201d says Stavrides, who was among the activists whose spontaneous efforts stopped the lot being turned into a parking space in late 2009. \u201cNavarinou heralded this new culture, this new spirit of people taking their lives into their own hands. They know that they can no longer expect the state to support them and through this process, they are discovering how important it is to share.\u201d</p> <p>It is a movement that has confounded expectation.

  "<h2><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66wxY8H4Mu0\">Love -&gt; Building on Fire</a></strong><br></h2> <p>In the beginning, there was just a freaky outsider called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/david-byrne\">David Byrne</a>. Born in Dumbarton in Scotland and raised near Baltimore, Byrne was a wiry misfit with an interest in rock\u2019n\u2019roll and experimental performance art that extended to once shaving off his beard (bloodily) using beer for foam while a friend played Pennies from Heaven on the accordion. He met future Talking Heads husband-wife rhythm section <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-chris-frantz-tina-weymouth-8533427.html\">Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth</a> in 1973 while hanging out on the peripheries of the art and music scene at <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/\">Rhode Island School of Design</a>. They began jamming together, originally as the Artistics (later the Autistics, a sporting appropriation of a campus joke). Drilled into a tight live band after moving to New York, with rehearsals in Weymouth and Frantz\u2019s Lower Manhattan loft apartment and frequent gigging at nearby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\">CBGB</a>, they signed to Sire Records in November 1976, then grew to a quartet after wooing Harvard architecture graduate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/20/popandrock5\">former Modern Lovers member Jerry Harrison</a> to join on keyboards and guitar. Love -&gt; Building on Fire (the squiggle in the middle means (\u201cgoes to\u201d) became Talking Heads\u2019 first officially released piece of music in February 1977. Recorded before Harrison joined, it\u2019s an illuminating insight into how the band \u2013 then still very inexperienced in the studio, and thus inclined to accept some of producer Tony Bongiovi\u2019s more traditionalist rock band impulses (the Stax horns work well, but as time would prove, were distinctly un-Talking Heads) \u2013 might have been remembered as little more than a new wave obscurity had they not gone on to rail so firmly against songwriting and recording doctrines of the age. There\u2019s a hint of the wacky novelty about the refrain, presaged by the canned birdy noises in the intro: \u201cI\u2019ve got two loves / And they go tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet / like little birds\u201d But elsewhere more familiar and lasting Talking Heads tropes take root between harpsichord-like phased guitars and foot-stomping drums. Byrne elliptically comparing love to his face, which is a building, which is on fire, prefigures a natural discomfort towards dealing with affairs of the heart as a lyrical subject in anything other than the abstract. A live version documented on the 1982 compilation album The Name of This Band is Talking Heads shows why Love -&gt; Building on Fire quickly became one of Harrison\u2019s favourite songs to play after he joined the band, with its intricate Televisionesque guitar weaves. </p> <h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX6FsTIq6ls\">Psycho Killer</a></strong><br></h2> <p>In those early, pre-New York days, the group attracted attention with this twisted, jerky, initially acoustic number (\u201cAlice Cooper doing a Randy Newman-type ballad\u201d as Byrne described it), which quickly became one of their signature playthings. Psycho Killer was eventually toughened up and committed to tape for Talking Heads\u2019 1977 debut album 77, with Bongiovi\u2019s efforts to slather the song with psychedelic strings wisely resisted. Starting with one of the most instantly identifiable bass riffs in all of rock, supplemented by suitably stabbing guitars and topped with a brilliant half-gibberish gibberish chorus lyric, Psycho Killer scarcely wastes a note. Its spasmic middle eight, sung in French and intended to illustrate the narrator\u2019s split personality, were Weymouth\u2019s contribution. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxu5dKqEmZM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kxu5dKqEmZM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZVEMzvZIY\">Found a Job</a></strong></h2> <p>\u201cDamn that television, what a bad picture!\u201d Years before the video for Once in a Lifetime made them early MTV stars, Talking Heads wrote this strange and fascinating number about a couple who freshen up their dull lives and save their flagging relationship by making their own ratings-winning TV show. One of the standouts of the Heads\u2019 second album 1978\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/20/popandrock.shopping7\">More Songs About Buildings and Food</a> \u2013 their first to be produced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brianeno\">Brian Eno</a>, whom they had met and hit it off with on tour in the UK the year before \u2013 Found a Job captures a band on the brink of multifaceted greatness. Under Eno\u2019s tutelage, punk upstarts became funky sophisticates capable of flavouring meta-aware lyrical narratives with danceable beats and esoteric influences. Taking its cues from minimalist composers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/dec/03/contemporary-music-guide-philip-glass\">Philip Glass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/jan/28/terry-riley-contemporary-music-guide\">Terry Riley</a>, then hip touchstones on the New York art scene, the instrumental outro of Found a Job is ingenious in its esoteric simplicity: a skipping cyclical pizzicato melody repeated for two full minutes without variation, to hypnotic effect, over scratchy chords and an awkward chord progression, eventually fading out as if it would continue ad infinitum even after the needle has left the groove.<br></p> <h2><strong>4.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB9W8St1pDc\"> Cities</a></strong></h2> <p>In their determination not to become just another new wave singles band, by 1979 Talking Heads \u2013 egged on by Eno \u2013 had begun to entirely rip up the rulebook. Instead of hunkering down in a studio to record the follow-up to More Songs About Buildings and Food, they instead retreated to Weymouth and Frantz\u2019s loft to work up some more tightly wound jams. Running cables out of the window to a van from the Record Plant studio parked outside, over two days that spring the four members laid down all the basic backing tracks for what would become Fear of Music, with Eno weighing in heavily with conceptual codification and electronic treatments. On the surface of it, Cities is a fairly straightforward song about searching for somewhere to live, weighing up various places\u2019 good points and bad points (of Birmingham \u2013 England or Alabama, it\u2019s not clear which \u2013 Byrne oddly comments: \u201cLook over there, dry ice factory / good place to get some thinking done\u201d) and, it would seem, slowly losing one\u2019s mind in the process (\u201cI\u2019m a little freaked out\u201d). Always one for treating lyrics as servant to a song\u2019s melody and structure, Byrne clearly enjoys himself inserting some goofily witty wordplay (\u201cDid I forget to mention, forget to mention Memphis, home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks?\u201d). Some of Cities\u2019 most atmospheric tics are in the production \u2013 the way the track fades in and fades out for instance, as if we\u2019re privy to just a small part of our flaky narrator\u2019s trip. Frantz\u2019s quicksilver drumbeat and Weymouth\u2019s slinky-melodic bassline are pure cocaine disco, but with a starched stiffness befitting the song\u2019s fussy subject matter. <br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AJUj-qxHI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/98AJUj-qxHI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98AJUj-qxHI\">Once in a Lifetime</a> </strong></h2> <p>To fully appreciate the radical and revolutionary transformation to their music making process which Talking Heads \u2013 guided by Eno \u2013 instituted with Remain in Light, it\u2019s worth referring to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0tLcvP9Sx8\">Right Start</a>, an early sketch of what would become Once in a Lifetime. A potent but scrappy instrumental, it bares only passing resemblance to probably Talking Heads\u2019 most iconic song. Like all of the backing tracks hastily recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, in a seemingly random discontinuous process in the summer of 1980, these base elements were laid down effectively blind by the band to Eno\u2019s direction. Eno and Byrne subsequently rearranged the constituent parts into glorious new shapes through a process of fading in and out contrasting but complimentary rhythmic and melodic phrases over one another in different combinations, in what was effectively a crude exercise in sampling and looping. Between Weymouth\u2019s spacious yet forceful bassline, Eno\u2019s gurgling synth drones and Harrison\u2019s climactic organ flourish, all pieced together puzzle-like in unusual and disorientating rhythmic intervals, Once in a Lifetime is a thing of dizzying power, beauty and mystery. Over it all lies Byrne\u2019s head-scratching half-spoken half-sung vocal about living in a beautiful house with a beautiful wife, days going by and water flowing underground, written ad-hoc to Eno\u2019s placeholder mumblings and inspired by the call-and-response style rantings of American radio evangelists. You can read Once in a Lifetime as an art-pop rumination on the existential ticking time bomb of unchecked consumerism and advancing age. Or simply as a fierce groove with a clutch of nonsense lyrics dashed on the top. Either way, it sounds like nothing else in the history of pop. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Talking Heads\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A5ociLmsVqh4RRNOfNrUEQt\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zrkf65GmwE\">Crosseyed and Painless</a></strong></h2> <p>Another soaring triumph of Remain in Light\u2019s composite cosmopolitan groove-based formula, Crosseyed and Painless might be Talking Heads\u2019 most deliriously danceable song, not to mention the blueprint for a clutch of future New York bands from the Rapture to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/11/lcd-soundsystem-10-of-the-best-james-murphy\">LCD Soundsystem</a>. Weymouth\u2019s popping bassline, Byrne\u2019s stuttering, disjointed riffs, added \u201cstunt guitar\u201d solos from Adrian Belew and assorted staccato guitar rhythms and keyboard chirps all circle one another over a congas-and-cowbells beat. Like Once in a Lifetime, the song features not a single chord change in all of its four and a bit minutes, but instead simply shifts vocal melody to denote a chorus. Byrne sings a fidgety, paranoid lyric about being driven to the verge of a nervous breakdown in a search of some inscrutable inner truth (\u201cLost my shape / Trying to act casual / Can\u2019t stop / I might end up in the hospital\u201d). The half-rapped \u201cfacts\u201d middle section was a downtown homage to the nascent rap music emanating from the Bronx, specifically <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZDUEilS5M4\">Kurtis Blow\u2019s The Breaks</a> (beating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g\">Blondie\u2019s Rapture</a>, that other much more famed punk-band appropriation of rap to release by several months). <br></p> <h2><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obAtn6I5rbY\">Life During Wartime (live)</a></strong></h2> <p>How do you pick 10 of the best Talking Heads songs without it substantially resembling the setlist to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP28o7BLj_8\">Stop Making Sense</a> \u2013 the greatest concert movie ever made, capturing the New York post-punk band at their peak in the winter of 1983? You can\u2019t. By the time the film was made, long-simmering inter-band tensions had already begun to boil over towards an ultimately litigious endgame. Stop Making Sense, shot by Jonathan Demme across three nights at Hollywood\u2019s Pantages Theater on what would prove to be Talking Heads\u2019 final major tour is the definitive document of one of America\u2019s greatest bands. Some of the tracks featured in what are arguably their definitive versions, a practically aerobic performance of apocalyptic dance band jam Life During Wartime for one. Originally <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DblvhECdws0\">featured on the 1979 album Fear of Music in more sterile form</a>, its driving disco beat, chewy keyboard riff and sharp angles were perfect fodder for the expanded live Heads line-up, which added a crack squad of American funk musicians in Parliament-Funkadelic founding member and synthesiser guru Bernie Worrell, percussionist Steve Scales, guitarist Alex Weir and backing vocalists Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt. Byrne\u2019s twitchy lyric, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/patty-hearst-capture-san-francisco-1975\">Patty Hearst</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/28/germany.terrorism\">Baader-Meinhof gang</a>, imagines a kind of hipster revolutionary surveying a postapocalyptic landscape, with lines like \u201cthis ain\u2019t the Mudd Club / or CBGB / I ain\u2019t got time for that now\u201d wiring it into the downtown New York alternative scene in which the band had been forged. <strong><br></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obAtn6I5rbY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/obAtn6I5rbY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9aN93S8nl8\">This Must Be The Place (Na\u00efve Melody) (live)</a></strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have written a love song, in this film I sing it to a lamp,\u201d Byrne said of the closest thing you\u2019ll find to a Talking Heads ballad, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dE-mxVxFXLg\">he interviewed himself</a> in a video promo for Stop Making Sense. Meeting his new girlfriend and future wife Adelle Lutz in 1982 presumably encouraged him to give writing love songs a go, with the knock-you-sideways pretty and since widely covered and sampled This Must Be The Place \u2013 albeit in his own off-kilter kind of way, by piecing together a bunch of affectionate sounding non sequiturs each romantic in their own ambiguous fashion (\u201cThe less we say about it the better / We\u2019ll make it up as we go along\u201d, \u201clove me \u2019til my heart stops / Love me \u2019til I\u2019m dead\u201d) but wholly unrelated as a narrative. The music, aptly characterised by the band themselves in the parenthetical<strong> </strong>subtitle Na\u00efve Melody, is almost laughably spare and simple: a guitar and a bass synth repeating a single four-bar figure in steady unison, an unshowy 4/4 drumbeat, a playfully pitch modulation wheel fiddling lead keyboard melody. Little else. Magical as the studio original may be, it\u2019s trumped by the Stop Making Sense version, thanks to added luscious harmonies by Mabry and Holt and Weir\u2019s slippery guitar ornamentation. Paying homage to Fred Astaire, Byrne does sing and indeed dance This Must Be The Place to a tacky-looking chain-store floor lamp, which apparently had to be frequently replaced on the tour after falling victim to some of Byrne\u2019s more adventurous moves. <br></p> <h2><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzM0hW2aQ0\">And She Was</a></strong></h2> <p>Mastery of the four-minute verse-chorus pop song was always well within Talking Heads\u2019 powers, and they proved it with 1985\u2019s Little Creatures, their most successful album, which sold more than 2m copies in the US alone. Or more specifically Byrne did \u2013 he\u2019s listed as the sole author of Little Creatures\u2019 nine songs, with the band credited only with arrangements. The album closes with one of Talking Heads most successful singles, the drive-time radio ubiquitous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWtCittJyr0\">Road to Nowhere</a>. It opens with this deceptively clean-cut major-key jangler which, in the grand tradition of smuggling references to illegal drugs into chart hits, tells the story of \u201ca blissed-out hippie-chick in Baltimore\u201d whoused to drop acid in a field by the Yoo-hoo chocolate soda factory and fly high out of her mind above the city. There\u2019s something sweetly innocent and transcendent about her trip, \u201ca pleasant elevation\u201d that becomes an out-of-body experience a she watches herself below \u201clike a movie\u201d. Just because Talking Heads made writing songs like this sound easy doesn\u2019t mean it was.<br></p> <h2><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=068AFYvd58E\">(Nothing But) Flowers</a></strong></h2> <p>\u201cAnd as things fell apart, nobody paid much attention.\u201d When this line was quoted at the start of the film of American Psycho in 1991, Talking Heads practically came full circle. The lyric could have applied to the ultimate fate of the band itself: by the release of Naked, their final album, in 1988, relationships between Byrne and the other three had long since wilted, with major touring firmly a thing of the past, though it would take until 1991 before Talking Heads\u2019 split was officially announced. But they did at least leave a last few fragrant moments to savour, (Nothing But) Flowers \u2013 a standout from the largely underwhelming Naked \u2013 for one. Something of a collectors\u2019 item for featuring Johnny Marr on trademark chiming guitar and Kirsty MacColl on backing vocals, it\u2019s a shimmering, upbeat Afropop dance song bearing one of Byrne\u2019s most laugh-out-loud, funny-acerbic lyrics. As if a direct inversion of Joni Mitchell\u2019s Big Yellow Taxi, Byrne sings from the standpoint of a man embittered by society\u2019s regression from first world technological luxuries, commercialism, consumerism and globalisation into a landscape reclaimed by greenery, as he pines for the Pizza Huts, 7-Elevens and electric labour-savers of the past (\u201cIf this is paradise / I wish I had a lawnmower\u201d). Imagined in the context of 1988, it reads like he could be throwing sarcastic shade on some of the more sanctimonious save-the-world rock stars of the era.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018Aid agencies have taken an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach to housing refugees\u2019<br></h2> <p>I travelled to Greece in February to distribute supplies in Lesbos and Athens. I commend the writer for this article. However, one thing the article failed to mention is that the crisis environment we have today is a result of poor policy decisions made by the local authority and NGOs in the early days of the crisis \u2013 and it is these same aid organisations that are now getting paid to fix the situation. <br></p> <p>Instead of taking advantage of all the existing Greek residential infrastructure, the government and NGOs consciously chose to locate refugees in old abandoned industrial buildings and remote rural areas, which directly limited their access to potable water, sanitation, electricity and food. Rather than trying to integrate refugees into life in Greece, it seems that they have taken an out of sight, out of mind approach. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a lot of strain on an already broken system and accountability is absent at every level</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I see the strategy as a missed opportunity to revitalise the Greek economy too. If refugees had been given cash vouchers to buy food from local markets and farmers, it would have helped residents financially and would also have helped change perceptions about refugees. There is a lot of empty real estate in the country that could have been used at the start but wasn\u2019t. Now these places, like the City Plaza hotel in Athens, are being turned into refugee squats. <em>Anna Segur, volunteer </em></p> <h2>\u2018The biggest hurdle is lack of support from the local government\u2019<br></h2> <p>Great article on Greek systemic failures to support refugees. UNHCR rarely answer emails these days, MSF [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] are invisible, and it is virtually impossible for smaller NGOs to access the vast resources that should be supporting these desperate people.</p> <p>The biggest hurdle is lack of support at local government level \u2013 who undoubtedly face other immense challenges day to day. There is little appetite to support refugees \u2013 there are not enough resources to support Greek people in need, let alone refugees. In the Greek islands nearest to Turkey, the impact of the refugee crisis has also been harsh on tourism \u2013 coupled with the events in Turkey this year many businesses are down 40% to 50% on revenue. Greek people are the most hospitable people I know but there\u2019s a lot of strain on an already broken system and accountability is absent at every level.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have had fires, riots, a hepatitis breakout, and attempted suicides.

Hot spots are full. Asylum processing is hugely under resourced, with it taking months to get an interview appointment. Informal detention camps, like the one in Rhodes are not recognised or resourced.<br></p> <p>The refugee crisis is a global problem \u2013 not just a Greek problem \u2013 but it seems as if the global community has hidden the issue. <em>Anonymous</em><br></p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019ve had riots in the camp where the police did nothing, and have had Human Rights Watch in twice to report on the situation\u2019<br></h2> <p>As a long term volunteer based on the ground on the Greek island of Samos for the last year, last week\u2019s secret aid worker really rang true for me in highlighting what I see on a daily basis. Some NGOs have been great at coordinating with small grassroots groups (MSF in particular) but I am also disturbed by the total lack of compassion and humanity demonstrated by many of the EU appointed partners tasked with running the camp I\u2019m based in. We\u2019ve already had two riots, one of which resulted in a big fire that destroyed many people\u2019s possessions. The police failed to intervene to break it up or help innocent people caught up in it.

Corporate titans known as robber barons amassed fortunes on the backs of workers who toiled for meagre pay in difficult conditions.

After a stint as a miner he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (<a href=\"http://www.iww.org/content/about-iww\">IWW</a>), a radical labour union known as the Wobblies. The nickname\u2019s origin is unclear but the organisation\u2019s goal gleamed bright: a revolution to let workers \u2013 in fields, farms and mines \u2013 keep what they produced.</p> <p>The IWW\u2019s leaders and intellectuals \u2013 socialists, anarchists and Marxists \u2013 were based in Chicago but Little criss-crossed hamlets, towns and cities in western states, agitating, recruiting and evangelising with little more than the clothes on his back, oratorical power and a fearlessness bordering on suicidal.</p> <p>He preached to fruit pickers, lumberjacks, oil drillers and miners, urging them to strike for better pay and conditions and if necessary to impede \u2013 to sabotage \u2013 production. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de51f4a6815480f5088187a0d06c549010432de2/0_48_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reverse view of Frank Little\u2019s grave in Butte, Montana</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He drew crowds by standing on street corners reading the Declaration of Independence. He appealed not just to white working men but women, blacks, latinos and hobos, insisting they had common cause.</p> <p>Business owners hated and feared Little. Newspapers denounced him and police jailed him. When that didn\u2019t work, hired thugs beat him up \u2013 but that didn\u2019t work either. Little was the \u201chobo agitator\u201d, fighting for freedom of speech and catching trains to flashpoints in Washington, California, New Mexico, anywhere where he could stir things up. </p> <p>The US\u2019s entry into the first world war in April 1917 raised the stakes. Patriotic hysteria swept the country. The Espionage Act virtually criminalised any opposition as treachery. IWW leaders opposed the war but hesitated to say so publicly. Little, in contrast, by then a board member, branded it a capitalist slaughter-fest for which no worker should die. When soldiers rounded up hundreds of striking Arizona mine workers in June 1917, an enraged Little denounced the troops as scabs.</p> <p>Weeks later he headed north to America\u2019s industrial crucible: Butte. The Montana town sat atop \u201cthe richest hill on Earth\u201d, a font of copper which drew tens of thousands of miners. It had been known as the Gibraltar of Unionism, with powerful unions and a socialist mayor. But by 1917 the aptly named Anaconda company, a global player, was crushing organised labour. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It controlled employment, newspapers, police, politicians and for good measure had a militia, said Gutfeld, the professor. \u201cIn many respects Montana at that time was a colony of the Anaconda company. If you wanted to commit suicide you went out against the company.\u201d</p> <p>A horrific accident in June 1917 killed 168 miners, infuriating survivors and giving the IWW, Little hoped, a chance to recruit. He arrived on 18 July. He was 38 and a physical wreck \u2013 thin, ill, a broken leg in a cast. Even so, he gave a barnstorming address to miners. He spoke with \u201cmaniacal fury\u201d and \u201cpractically threatened the United States government with revolution\u201d, the pro-company Butte Miner newspaper reported. For two weeks Little kept at it, urging miners to strike and \u201cfight the capitalists but not the Germans\u201d.</p> <p>Newspapers demanded authorities crack down \u201cwithout gloves\u201d on such \u201csedition\u201d and \u201ctreasonable tirades\u201d. In retrospect it was a death foretold, but Little ignored warnings. Maybe he thought he would escape with just a beating. Maybe he knew what was coming. \u201cIt would be better to go down slugging,\u201d he had told colleagues. </p> <p>There were no witnesses to the abduction besides Byrne, the boarding house owner. And there were no known witnesses to the lynching. A man called Robert Brown on his way to work found the body swinging from the trestle some time after dawn. Pinned to the underwear was a placard: \u201cOthers take notice, first and last warning, 3-7-77.\u201d</p> <p>Rumours swirl to this day: that Little was castrated, stabbed 27 times and lost his kneecaps; that the numbers referred to his draft number, or Montana\u2019s grave specifications, three feet wide, seven feet deep, 77 inches long; that he was killed by union rivals, or a patriotic mob.</p> <p>The grisly details, said Jane Little Botkin, are exaggerations. He was savagely beaten and tortured but didn\u2019t lose body parts and was likely unconscious when hanged. \u201cI believe they put him on top of the car and drove the car out from underneath him. He didn\u2019t struggle.

The company had armed thugs, private detectives and police officers on its payroll. Which would explain why the official murder investigation went nowhere. </p> <p>There is a literary sub-plot. In his youth<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/29/100-best-novels-the-maltese-falcon-dashiell-hammett-sam-spade-raymond-chandler\"> Dashiell Hammett</a>, who created the fictional detective Sam Spade, worked for the Pinkerton detective agency, which specialised in strike breaking. Hammett\u2019s first novel, Red Harvest, concerns a labour dispute set in a thinly veiled version of Butte. </p> <p>In her memoirs Lillian Hellman, Hammett\u2019s companion, said he told her he was offered $5,000 to murder Little. \u201cThrough the years he was to repeat that bribe offer so many times that I came to believe \u2026 that it was a kind of key to his life. He had given a man the right to think he would commit murder.\u201d</p> <p>Some have speculated the novelist actually did it. <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/n/william-f-nolan/\">William Nolan</a>, one of Hammett\u2019s biographers, thinks not. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it but the fact that someone even asked him, thinking that he would be that kind of person, and that he was that deep into the thing made him feel guilty. He never got over and it always haunted him.\u201d Hammett subsequently became a communist and ended up on a McCarthyite blacklist.<br></p> <p>Little\u2019s murder initially provoked flurries of defiance. Thousands attended the funeral and sang La Marseillaise. Protests flickered across the west. </p> <p>But instead of galvanising the movement, the lynching presaged a government crackdown: federal troops in Butte, martial law in Spokane, the Federal Sedition act of 1918 and the arrest of 165 alleged IWW members, resulting in jail terms of five to 20 years. \u201cThe wounded IWW ... seemed to lose all of its old dash, all of its genius for improvising guerrilla tactics,\u201d noted the historian Robert Tyler.</p> <p>Members of Little\u2019s family were arrested, terrifying the family into decades of silence, said Little Botkin. \u201cIf you had Frank\u2019s photo on you that could be sedition. We had no photos of him, not one. The family just stopped talking about him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.</p> <footer> <cite>Arnold Stead</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A movement which had mobilised the homeless and taught workers to take direct action never recovered, said Stead, the biographer. \u201cHis death signalled the end of the only truly radical and in some ways truly effective union of the time.\u201d </p> <p>Stead sees a continuum through the evolution \u2013 and weakening \u2013 of US unions. Instead of a wide movement infusing white, black and Latino workers with a shared class identity, unions narrowed and moderated their goals, seeking gains only for dues-paying members. </p> <p>Arguably this was a sensible, successful tack which benefited members. But globalisation and anti-union laws gradually drained their power. Only one in 10 American workers now belong to a union despite stagnant wages and widening inequality. </p> <p>Which brings us to Trump.</p> <p>In the absence of powerful unions, or a shared identity with the working poor of other races, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/opinion/sunday/the-decline-of-unions-and-the-rise-of-trump.html?_r=0\">blue collar white men are Trump\u2019s strongest supporters</a>. \u201cThey feel angry and left out so it\u2019s no surprise now that you have people willing to support someone who doesn\u2019t give a damn about them,\u201d said Stead.</p> <p>For CW Copeland, a Montana member of the IWW, which still limps on, the fault lies not just with unions but also the Democratic party and progressive academics. They neglected labour issues, he said. \u201cA lot of those going crazy for Donald Trump identify more with their whiteness than with their class. If more people knew about Frank Little \u2026 I think you\u2019d have fewer voting for Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps. But Little\u2019s grave sits amid yellowing grass and weeds in a lonely corner of the Mountain View cemetery, drawing few pilgrims</p> <p>\u201cSlain by capitalist interests for organizing and inspiring his fellow men,\u201d says the headstone. Cemetery signposts direct visitors to another grave, one adorned with flags and offerings. There rests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/evel-knievel\">Evel Knievel</a>, the type of hero America remembers.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2016 to attribute information about Little\u2019s heredity to his biographer, Arnold Stead.

  "<p>Several days into a late-summer road trip across the US, a man in his early 30s stops at dusk to observe a fair taking place in a small Texas town. A band is playing.

Already he has introduced the reader to his troubled relationship with a Dutch-Irish father unable to escape a succession of blue-collar jobs \u2013 bus driver, prison guard, factory worker \u2013 in a nondescript part of New Jersey. It is in this harsh, cold, ungiving man that Springsteen locates the origin of his own flaws and fears.</p> <p>\u201cAs a boy, I figured it was just the way men were, distant, uncommunicative, busy with the currents of the grown-up world.\u201d And angry. At the wheel of a car, \u201cI would use speed and recklessness to communicate my own rage \u2026 with the sole purpose of terrorising my rider. It was gross, bullying, violent and humiliating behaviour that filled me with shame afterward \u2026 Part of me was rebelliously proud of my emotionally violent behaviour, always aimed at the women in my life. It was all straight out of the old man\u2019s playbook.\u201d Late in life the father is forced to confront full-blown paranoid schizophrenia, but not before he has seen his son march into his house and place an Oscar statuette (awarded for the theme song to Jonathan Demme\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/51216/philadelphia\"><em>Philadelphia</em></a>) on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell anybody what to do ever again,\u201d the father declares, and the wounds begin to heal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0dadc8a9bcf789e00215fd64ba53c5f35392a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0dadc8a9bcf789e00215fd64ba53c5f35392a34/0_0_3239_4744/683.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen, pictured on Sunset Strip in 1975 while promoting his album Born To Run.\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen, pictured on Sunset Strip in 1975 while promoting his album Born To Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry O'Neill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother, whose parents were immigrants from Naples and Sorrento, taught him other lessons: \u201cTruthfulness, consistency, professionalism, kindness, compassion, manners, thoughtfulness, pride in yourself, honour, love, faith in and fidelity to your family, commitment, joy in your work and a never-say-die thirst for life.\u201d Some of these qualities would be recognised by fans attending the arena concerts in which a man deep into his seventh decade can still spend close to four hours carrying his listeners on an emotional rollercoaster ride with a generosity, an energy, an intimacy and a gift for drama that none of his contemporaries can begin to match.</p> <p>In a book that bears the hallmarks of having been written by his own hand, Springsteen is particularly good at capturing the exhilaration of his rise to success with the E Street Band, formed as a \u201cbenevolent dictatorship\u201d in 1972 after he had grown weary of playing in co-operative groups. \u201cDemocracy in rock bands, with very few exceptions, is often a ticking time-bomb,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf I was going to assume the workload and responsibility, I might as well assume the power. I\u2019ve always believed the E Street Band\u2019s continued existence is partially due to the fact that there was little to no role confusion among its members. My bandmates were not always happy with the decisions I made and may have been angered by some of them, but nobody debated my right to make them.\u201d</p> <p>The book is as rich in anecdote and detail as in anguish and doubt. He opens by describing his 10-year-old self accompanying his grandfather to scavenge in rubbish tips for broken radio sets that can be repaired and sold to black workers in summer migrant camps. He talks about his experience as an altar boy with a Catholicism that surely encouraged his underlying sense of guilt and obligation (\u201cI don\u2019t often participate in my religion but I know somewhere, deep inside, I\u2019m still on the team\u201d).

There\u2019s another who broke his heart in the days before success struck: \u201cA drug-taking, hell-raising wild child who played by nobody\u2019s rules. She was a perfect antidote to the control freak in me. She was so alive, funny and broken, I couldn\u2019t resist her. She\u2019d been around, knew a few grade-B-level rock stars, brought them down to \u2018discover\u2019 my band, then slept with them.\u201d Investigating the possibilities offered by a rock\u2019n\u2019roller\u2019s moral compass, he retaliated by sleeping with her friend.</p> <p>It takes him until page 501 to admit \u2013 honourably, if a little deflatingly \u2013 that \u201cI haven\u2019t told you \u2018all\u2019 about myself. Discretion and the feelings of others don\u2019t allow it.\u201d The exceptions to the code of romantic anonymity are his two wives: the actor and model Julianne Phillips, whom he married in 1985; and the singer Patti Scialfa, with whom he took up when the first marriage was faltering and with whom he now has three grown-up children. The break-up with Phillips brings a bleak verdict on his own behaviour: \u201cI dealt with it abysmally.\u201d Scialfa is portrayed as a figure of saintly forbearance and sensitivity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a6bc525af7fbbef57f1d19b7b67aeacd4efc69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a6bc525af7fbbef57f1d19b7b67aeacd4efc69/0_46_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Springsteen and Patti Scialfa during an acoustic performance in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Springsteen and Patti Scialfa during an acoustic performance in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overwriting and repetition sometimes make it feel as though he has chosen to issue the literary equivalent of the four-CD deluxe version, complete with demos and out-takes, instead of the finished album itself. The sentimental stuff about his kids could have been tightened up and the occasional splurges of capital letters and exclamation marks require understanding as an attempt to reproduce on the page the comic melodrama of his on-stage storytelling. His editor might have given him better advice on that, as well as correcting a few mistakes.

  "<p>Yesterday, 375 of the world\u2019s top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, published <a href=\"http://responsiblescientists.org/\">an open letter regarding climate change</a>. In the letter, the scientists report that the evidence is clear: humans are causing climate change. We are now observing climate change and its affect across the globe. The seas are rising, the oceans are warming, the lower atmosphere is warming, the land is warming, ice is melting, rainfall patterns are changing and the ocean is becoming more acidic.</p> <p>These facts are incontrovertible. No reputable scientist disputes them. It is the truth.</p> <p>Despite these facts, the letter reports that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/may/26/donald-trump-wants-to-build-a-wall-to-save-his-golf-course-from-global-warming\">the US presidential campaign has seen claims</a> that the earth isn\u2019t warming, or it is only a natural warming, or that climate change is a hoax. These claims are false. The claims are made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/14/trump-and-the-republican-party-are-doing-big-oils-bidding\">politicians or real estate developers</a> with no scientific experience. These people who deny the reality of climate change are not scientists. <br></p> <p>These claims aren\u2019t new. We see them every election cycle. In fact, f<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jun/13/the-grand-oil-party-house-republicans-denounce-a-carbon-tax\">or the Republican Party</a>, they are a virtual litmus test for electability. It is terribly sad that the party of Lincoln (the president who initiated the National Academy of Sciences) has been rebuked by the National Academy today. It is sad that the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who created the National Park System, is acting in a way antithetical to his legacy. It is also sad that the party of Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency, now is trying to eliminate that very organization.</p> <p>What is perhaps most sad is that the party of \u201cfiscal conservatism\u201d is leading us on a path that will result in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution\">higher economic and social costs</a> for all of us.</p> <p>What we don\u2019t know is what the future will bring. Will the warming be gradual or sudden? Will ocean rise increase at a faster rate or not? Will we continue to see major ice shelf collapse? Increased droughts and heat waves? Will we be able to adapt?</p> <p>A rational decision maker would take action to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/23/climate-change-greatest-risk-management-failure\">manage the risks from climate change</a>. This threat is to our health, our communities, and our economies. A changing climate with warming seas and an acidifying ocean will cause real economic losses for our generation and for the future.</p> <p>In the letter, the scientists venture deeper into politics than scientists are generally willing to tread. They describe the <a href=\"https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5b1%5d-ben_1468872234.pdf\">inane Republican platform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/unleashing-americamericas-prosperity-to-create-jobs-and-increase-wages\">the foolish position of the Republican nominee Donald Trump</a>. Basically, Trump wishes to scrap our environmental agreements, which have resulted in reductions to our own emissions as well as very strong agreements to reduce global warming through international agreements. <br></p> <p>Despite the excellent work over the past 7 years, we have not seen the increase in energy prices that the denialists claimed would occur.

  "<p>Even in more placid recent times, the Ryder Cup has always been the fiercest culture war in all sport. America versus Europe. The individuals versus the team. Lone wolves versus the pack. Unabombers versus cells. Sex addiction versus sex. It is quite remarkable, in an event where the sport itself is frequently so electrifying, that it should rarely attain much more than the level of a plot device in the wider story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.thejoyofsix\">The Joy Of Six: great Ryder Cup moments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year, it is fair to say, there are more angles than ever. In fact, there are so many angles that even the Gabriel Byrne character in Miller\u2019s Crossing couldn\u2019t see them all. Brexit. Trump. Watching the US vice-captain Tiger Woods watch golf. The implications of the growth in rightwing radical populism for those crucial par fives. And, of course, all the Ryder Cup basics: religion, secularism, conservatism, progressivism, the role of US militarism in a rapidly changing world, which continent has the most exquisite manners. Those babies simply come as standard.</p> <p>As no one needs reminding, the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\" title=\"\">this summer voted</a> to disengage from the continent of Seve Ballesteros and cleave to itself as the land of Nick Faldo. Or, as seems rather more likely to transpire, the land of Colin Montgomerie. Consequently, some have jokingly suggested that the Ryder Cup itself be restored to its pre-1973 format, which is to say Great Britain versus the United States of America. Yet, given ongoing developments in both those jurisdictions, there will be many around the world who\u2019d look at that tie and struggle to get past a powerful desire for there to be two losers. And if I may put it into context for those who wouldn\u2019t: it would be the West Germany-Argentina final that none of us wants to see.</p> <p>Instead, both the USA and Europe sides descend on Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota next week. The Americans have embroidered the motto \u201c12 strong\u201d into their kit; I assume that even now the European gear is being machined with the words \u201cBeyond Brexit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee1b5dfe6b0756f8fedfa98414cb2ba20bc6fbdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee1b5dfe6b0756f8fedfa98414cb2ba20bc6fbdf/0_123_4104_2462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Poulter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Poulter celebrates after Europe pull of their \u2018Miracle of Medinah\u2019 in 2012 \u2013 the last Ryder Cup hosted by the United States.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately, the US PGA tour has spared itself the ultimate shitstorm, which would have been the event having been long-scheduled to take place at a course owned by apocalypse-beckoning US presidential hopeful Donald Trump. For a long time, this looked like an accident rather than moral design. After all, they went ahead with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/doral-donald-trump-blue-monster-wgc-cadillac\" title=\"\">March\u2019s WGC-Cadillac Championship at Trump Doral</a> in Miami despite the litany of -isms committed by their host in any given 24-hour period. By June, a few thousand -isms later, even the US PGA was finally minded to declare that sponsorship problems meant next year, the same tournament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/donald-trump-doral-golf-course-lose-wgc-event-mexico-city\" title=\"\">would be played in Mexico</a>, of all pointed relocations.</p> <p>Not that a US win at Hazeltine will not be seized upon by Trump as some electoral omen for America\u2019s impending being-made-great-again. Under President Trump, needless to say, all Ryder Cups will be won by the US.</p> <p>As far as Trump support within the US Ryder Cup side goes, one can only speculate as to quite how many players might find his interests and worldview align with theirs. We do know that Jack Nicklaus has come out for Trump, declaring him \u201ca good man\u201d. \u201cI like what Donald has done,\u201d Nicklaus went on a few months ago. \u201cI like that he\u2019s turning America upside down. He\u2019s awakening the country.\u201d Whether that is the majority PGA definition of \u201cwoke\u201d is unclear \u2013 though we do have some useful Sports Illustrated data. Every year, the publication polls tour pro golfers on the condition of anonymity, which allows them to speak more freely than the constraints of wealth and hardwired self-interest traditionally allow. Stop me if your own non-scientific guesses already confirmed this to you, but this year it found \u2013 inter alia \u2013 that 56% of PGA respondents wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary if she halved their taxes, while Trump was most supported in the Republican primary race.</p> <p>As for the European side of things, that promises to bring the angst. The very day after the referendum vote, the European Tour announced that the Ryder Cup team would still be flying the EU flag, though it did offer a hint on where it stood on the result with a slightly sniffy statement: \u201cLike all global companies whose headquarters are in the UK,\u201d this ran, \u201cwe are now in the process of assessing the implications for our business.\u201d</p> <p>If the Europeans win, you can be sure they\u2019ll be seen as a symbol of something or other. As the British gold medals rained in during the Rio Olympics, the Leave.EU campaign lost no time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/17/olympic-cyclist-callum-skinner-leave-eu-twitter-brexit\" title=\"\">putting out an advert</a> featuring all the winners, suggesting that their sporting success somehow proved the UK had no need of the EU to succeed. A category mistake, and one that caused the cyclist Callum Skinner to ask them to stop using his image. We shall have to see whether any UK golfers are moved to do the same should they be similarly co-opted in the event of a European Ryder Cup victory. In the event of a European loss, of course, there will be remainers quick to ascribe it to a doomy sign that the fellowship is so terminally scattered that we can\u2019t even beat the Yanks in the Ryder Cup any more.</p> <p>There is more, of course \u2013 so much more \u2013 and for some, golf is not an appropriate place for such multi-faceted conflicts to play out. For me, there is no better. Certainly no safer. Let us gird our loins, and have absolutely no time for those who wrongly imagine the Ryder Cup to be a good war spoiled.</p>",

They described the 28 year old as friendly, generous with free food to regulars, and at least for a time obsessed with cars souped up for racing. Some have said the family was quiet, and that Rahami\u2019s father wore religious clothing but his sons did not.</p> <p>The family immigrated from Afghanistan some time before 2002, when Rahami was 14 and they opened First American Fried Chicken. Rahami became a naturalized citizen at some point; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elisefoley/status/777961805939412993\">MSNBC has reported</a> that the family arrived in 1995 and were granted asylum in 2011, though the Guardian could not immediately confirm the dates. <br></p> <p>The family also had a decade-long clash with the city over the restaurant, whose 24-hour operations drew complaints from neighbors about rowdy crowds. City records show repeated complaints by both authorities and the family about their interactions, and one of Rahami\u2019s brothers pled guilty at one point to preventing police from enforcing a city ordinance. His lawsuit against the city, claiming anti-Muslim discrimination, is technically still pending although Mayor Chris Bollwage noted that courts have ruled in the city\u2019s favor.</p> <p>Bankruptcy court documents also showed that the family struggled with money; in 2005 Rahami\u2019s father filed for bankruptcy, saying in hte documents that he had only $100 in the bank and more than $35,000 in debt.</p> <p>Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/here-is-what-we-know-about-the-suspected-new-york-and-new-je?utm_term=.nfBKbB7lB#.nbEE5Mb2M\">unearthed Rahami\u2019s freshman yearbook</a>, and spoke with one of his ninth-grade classmates, who said: \u201cVery funny, class clown.

In the 90s, Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie represented two poles of \u201cwomanness\u201d. Aniston was in every living room in the country \u2013 America\u2019s sweetheart, the girl next door, everyone\u2019s Friend. Meanwhile, Angelina Jolie was known for being a Bad Girl. Or, as the Mirror <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/angelina-jolie-40-how-blood-smeared-5818828\">delightfully put it</a>: \u201ca blood-smeared druggie\u201d. She famously married Jonny Lee Miller wearing a white T-Shirt with his name smeared on it in blood. A few years later Jolie dated a woman \u2013 having the nerve to do so unapologetically before bisexuality became trendy. </p> <p>While Angelina Jolie moved more into the mainstream in the early 2000s, she was still very much known for her \u201cedgy\u201d past. So when Brad Pitt ended his five-year marriage with Jennifer Aniston in 2005, the media were quick to turn the story into a familiar narrative of Wronged Woman v Evil Seductress. The story became less about Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie and more about different stereotypes of women. You were either a good girl or a bad girl. A Jen or a Jolie. Who you supported said something about who you were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sara_bee/status/778248916630396929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s happening <a href=\"https://t.co/s71aYUK6lk\">pic.twitter.com/s71aYUK6lk</a></p>&mdash; \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af (@sara_bee) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_bee/status/778248916630396929\">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Which is why the Team Jolie/Team Aniston T-shirts created by LA boutique Kitson in 2005 flew off the shelf. They weren\u2019t so much a fashion statement as a statement about their wearer. And most people, it seemed, wanted to tell the world they were a Jen. The Team Aniston shirts sold 25 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/14/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/jennifer-aniston-angelina-jolie/\">times faster</a> than Team Jolie to begin with. The popularity of the Team T-shirts helped fuel the rivalry. Taking it out of the gossip mags and into people\u2019s closets. Making it part of popular culture.</p> <p>Over the years the \u201crivalry\u201d remained a media mainstay because it was a convenient way to talk about what a woman should and shouldn\u2019t be. Jennifer was a barren spinster, poor Jen! Jolie, again, was the polar opposite. A fertile earth mother. We\u2019re starting to like Angelina Jolie now! She\u2019s changed! </p> <p>But everything must end. The clock has finally run out on this story. After all, it\u2019s not the 90s any more: it\u2019s a female Clinton running for president and the Pok\u00e9mon are in augmented reality. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s no longer so easy or acceptable to talk about Jolie and Aniston in terms of tropes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/brangelina-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-love\">Farewell, Brangelina \u2013 and the dream that love can last | Mary Valle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jolie has spent years working with the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/angelina-jolie-pitt-refugees-un-donald-trump-immigration\">becoming an important advocate for refugees</a>.

In short, they\u2019re both incredibly talented women who are a lot more than their wombs and their men. Of course, they always were, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s no longer so easy for the media to pigeonhole them.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, I\u2019d like to think it no longer makes much sense for the media to pit women against each other in this tired, sexist way any more. The popularity of TV shows like Broad City<em> </em>and the Beyonc\u00e9fication of feminism<em> </em>has been a wake-up call to the media that women aren\u2019t just interested in whether the girl is going to get the guy \u2013 they want to see female friendships and solidarity. So I suggest we take this opportunity to end the Jolie/Jen rivalry once and for all.</p> <p> Indeed, I\u2019m all up for a modern plot twist. What do you reckon?

  "<p>Lord Justice Jackson, the senior judge who shaped key legal reforms, has questioned the government\u2019s policy of imposing steep rises in fees while withdrawing public funding from the court system. </p> <p>In a detailed legal work, entitled <a href=\"http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/Catalogue/ProductDetails.aspx?productid=705504&amp;recordid=6829\">The Reform of Civil Litigation</a>, the appeal court judge added his voice to the chorus of criticism from human rights groups and lawyers\u2019 representative bodies who argue that the rises put access to justice beyond the reach of many citizens.</p> <p>Last week the Ministry of Justice confirmed it would go ahead with increases of up to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/uk-immigration-and-asylum-tribunal-fees-to-rise-by-500\"> 500% in court fees for immigration and asylum cases</a>, despite a consultation in which all but five of 147 respondents opposed the move.</p> <p>Jackson has been an influential figure in reforming the way civil courts operate. His recommendations on reducing litigation costs were adopted by the judiciary and the ministry in 2013.</p> <p>But in his new book he signals his growing concern about developments since then and the government\u2019s determination to move towards a system where the courts service becomes self-funding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"110e6264911f3dd6f1ab5d905a20b89d6da28420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/110e6264911f3dd6f1ab5d905a20b89d6da28420/193_708_1054_632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Dyson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Dyson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MoJ acknowledges that it is already charging \u201cenhanced fees\u201d, which cost court users far more than the actual costs of any service provided, in order to subside the rest of the courts system. The outgoing master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, has highlighted the problem, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jan/26/top-uk-judges-denounce-dangerous-increase-in-court-fees\">wrong in principle</a> \u2026 but it\u2019s a policy matter as to whether parliament should go down that route.\u201d</p> <p>In his book, published by Thomson Reuters,<strong> </strong>Jackson states: \u201cWhilst it is not appropriate for a judge to \u2018campaign\u2019 about court fees (or any other form of indirect taxation), there is a serious point of principle here.\u201d He questions whether court fees should continue to rise at a rate far in excess of inflation.</p> <p>Jackson points out that the civil courts play a vital role in maintaining social order and in the effective functioning of the economy. It would be wrong for \u201cthe entire cost or most of the cost of the civil justice system\u201d to be shifted from taxpayers to litigants, he writes.</p> <p>\u201cAs a serving judge,\u201d he writes, \u201cI have written the book in order to promote a proper understanding of the reforms and better litigation practice. I also hope the book can help encourage the proper implementation of those recommendations for reform which are as yet unimplemented or only partly implemented.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cThe cost to the taxpayer of our courts and tribunal system is unsustainably high, so it is right that those who use the system should pay more to relieve this burden.</p> <p>\u201cWe are protecting the most vulnerable by putting waivers in place for those who cannot afford to pay fees, and will continue to assess the impact of these increases.\u201d</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",
  "<p>No one wants to be told off by their mother and Gabriel Jesus is no different. The Brazilian wonderkid, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/03/manchester-city-sign-gabriel-jesus-palmeiras\">signed for Manchester City in the summer</a> for \u00a327m and will join the Premier League leaders in January, has the potential to become one of the best forwards in the world but what makes him stand out even more is his desire to also help out defensively.</p> <p>It is not a trait he shares with too many forwards but then they may not get a rollocking from their mother if they do not help out at the back. Gabriel Jesus does. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true that my mother has a go at me when I don\u2019t track back,\u201d he says in his first interview with non-Brazilian media since signing for City. \u201cWe are very, very close and she demands a lot from me, which is great. She only praises me if I have done something worthy of praise. I am really happy to have a mum like that, who really cares. She always tells me the truth and her sincerity helps me a lot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/pep-guardiola-yaya-toure-not-play-manchester-city-agent-apologises\">Guardiola says Tour\u00e9 will not play for Manchester City until agent apologises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mrs Vera L\u00facia is a constant and hugely positive presence in Gabriel Jesus\u2019s life and that is no surprise considering his upbringing. The player\u2019s father died when Gabriel Jesus was young and his mother raised him and his three brothers on her own. She was a cleaner back then and there was not a lot of money around. \u201cA football player grows up faster than other people,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up very quickly because of the difficulties and responsibilities that I have always had.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel Jesus is a very mature 19-year-old. We meet at Academia de futebol, Palmeiras\u2019s training centre and he is polite and humble. He does not wear sunglasses or headphones and does not play with his mobile during the interview. He starts by apologising for being late. \u201cI had to do the ice bath,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>It has been a tumultuous 18 months for the man from Jardim Peri, a humble neighbourhood on the outskirts of S\u00e3o Paulo (it is a <em>comunidade</em>, a kind of <em>favela,</em> only a little bit more peaceful). In March 2015 he made his debut for Palmeiras after scoring 37 goals in 22 games in the Paulista Under-17 competition and at the end of the season he was named the best newcomer of the <em>Brasileir\u00e3o</em>.</p> <p>And that was just the beginning. This summer he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/brazil-germany-rio-2016-mens-football-olympic-final-match-report\">won Olympic gold with Brazil </a>and then made his debut for the senior team, scoring two goals in a 3-0 away win against Ecuador. And he is still a teenager. The former Brazil and Real Madrid striker Ronaldo, for one, is a fan: \u201cWhen I see Gabriel I think about my own past. He has a fantastic journey ahead,\u201d Ronaldo told TV Globo recently.</p> <p>It is not that long ago Gabriel Jesus was playing for the amateur team Pequeninos do Meio Ambiente on the pitches of the military prison camp Rom\u00e3o Gomes. He moved on to Anhanguera but, unlike many prodigious talents these days, he did not join a top side \u2013 Palmeiras \u2013 until the age of 15 so his career was very much shaped by street football.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqemskft0ag\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gqemskft0ag?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Gabriel Jesus: skills, tricks and goals.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>His childhood neighbourhood is always on his mind \u2013 and on his skin. On his forearm there is a tattoo showing a boy with a ball in his hand looking at a favela in front of him, dreaming of a better future in football. The tattoo is almost identical to the one that his friend Neymar has.</p> <p>\u201cI have always enjoyed working hard and that\u2019s why I try to give my best tactically as well as going forward. From an early age, in my <em>v\u00e1rzea</em> days [a special type of Brazilian street football], I tried to take in all the instructions of all the coaches I had. I am the same today. After all, it is very important to enter the pitch knowing what I have to do to help the team.\u201d</p> <p>He no longer lives in Jardim Peri but goes back to visit friends. When doing so in December he was stopped by the police while driving his expensive car. \u201cA dark-skinned boy cannot drive a nice car in the neighbourhood where he grew up without being stopped by the police. Everyone knows how hard it is to be black in our communities,\u201d he wrote on Instagram.</p> <p>He stayed in Jardim Peri until last year. He could have left for S\u00e3o Paulo as early as 2010 but the club did not offer him accommodation, meaning that he would have had to travel for four hours to get to and from training, and that would have had a negative impact on his school work.</p> <p>Not that Gabriel Jesus paid too much attention to anything apart from football. \u201cMy whole life has always been football and that only,\u201d he says. \u201cSince I was six years old I\u2019ve only really thought about football. I used to watch it on TV, play video games and so on. I just love football. Some people joke that I am too into it but football just sums up my life.\u201d</p> <p>His discipline is surprising for such a young age, and this is probably one of the things that has impressed Pep Guardiola, the manager who was desperate to bring him to City. Gabriel Jesus was a hot prospect even before the Olympics and City were able to beat off competition from Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 partly because of a phone call from their new manager.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a complicated decision, but in the end my desire to learn won,\u201d Gabriel Jesus says. \u201cThe presence of Guardiola as a manager at City and the fact that it is a great club were very important factors in my final decision. Guardiola\u2019s phone call was a huge part of me deciding to go there. It made me realise that I\u2019d love to work with him.

  "<p>Lisa Baxter*, a mother of three from Oldham, was trapped with a violent partner, difficulties controlling her children, threats of homelessness and frightening debt.

Her mental and physical health are transformed and her GP attendances are a fraction of what they once were.</p> <p>Baxter says: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done without Ruth. Without her, I think I would have had my children taken off me. I would not have been able to cope with social services. Before I started seeing her, I was just being seen by the doctor, given tablets and sent away, but it wasn\u2019t any help, so I would be back again.\u201d</p> <p>Chorley is a focused care practitioner \u2013 one of four employed by Hope Citadel Healthcare, a not-for-profit community interest company, to lead a pioneering approach to delivering healthcare to the most needy families in its four Greater Manchester NHS GP practices, by filling in the gaps between health and social care.</p> <p>A visit to Hill Top surgery overlooking the former mill town of Oldham, perfectly illustrates how this transformation in Baxter\u2019s life has come about. Chorley emerges with Baxter, having been on the phone for more than an hour on her behalf. She has arranged food vouchers and funds to pay for three school uniforms, and has prevented the cancellation of Baxter\u2019s child tax credit. She has also helped Baxter write a letter of appeal against the cancellation of her housing benefit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24ddd6c9b6307349453e4072ed941395667dd330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24ddd6c9b6307349453e4072ed941395667dd330/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Chorley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chorley: \u2018How can you expect patients to look after their health, when they don\u2019t know where they will be living next week?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Passionate about her work, Chorley says: \u201cHow can you expect patients to look after their health, when they don\u2019t know where they will be living next week? You can not separate people\u2019s physical health from their psychological, social and spiritual health.\u201d</p> <p>The reality of doctoring in Oldham is stark. Oldham is the most deprived town in England, according the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/townsandcitiesanalysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Office for National Statistics</a>, with 65.2% of its local areas in the most deprived 20%. Men and women in these areas can expect to die more than 10 years sooner than inhabitants of Trafford \u2013 Greater Manchester\u2019s most affluent suburb.</p> <p> Clinical director of Hope Citadel Healthcare and GP at Hill Top surgery, Dr John Patterson kick-started the Focused Care scheme from a belief that social conditions determine heath and that those in greatest need are the least likely to receive it. Patterson says: \u201cIn areas of deprivation you need more multifactorial medicine and psychosocial support.\u201d</p> <p> He asked Chorley \u2013 because of her reputation as an energetic champion of families in poverty \u2013 to design a scheme in 2010 operating from the Fitton Hill practice, to support frequent attendees at the surgery with complex problems.</p> <p>Recent figures show something of the scale of human need she and her colleagues face. Of the 120 families on Focused Care in 2014-15, 92% presented with mental health issues, 58% of households had housing problems and 17 women disclosed domestic violence.</p> <p> The scheme took off and Patterson was astonished by the two-year figures. Of the initial 50 to 60 households dealt with by Chorley, 24 had stopped using A&amp;E inappropriately, 25 no longer had parenting problems, 10 had stopped abusing alcohol and 12 homes no longer had a domestic violence problem.</p> <p> Seven years on, Focused Care has expanded into eight practices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f72a5a4260af85f9b48af0676f066f1b4f81410e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f72a5a4260af85f9b48af0676f066f1b4f81410e/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Chorley visits patient at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chorley has supported a man through insolvency and encouraged him to stop smoking and drinking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Audits of the 160 families receiving Focused Care over the four Hope Citadel surgeries show that they visit A&amp;E 57% less in the year following intervention.

In each case a patient is seen, problems identified and a care plan drawn up, tackling anything from immigration to parenting and benefit problems. The practitioner then contacts or visits the family on a regular basis and supports them in whatever way is most appropriate for their wellbeing.</p> <p>It\u2019s usually a painstaking task unpicking the problems. Chorley has supported Baxter through the trial and jailing of a former abusive partner. In another case, she helped a man through insolvency and encouraged him to stop smoking and drinking, enabling him to become a mover and shaker in his local housing association.</p> <p>Just occasionally Chorley\u2019s job can be short and simple \u2013 accessing \u00a320 from a Hill Top practice fund to pay the taxi fare to enable a woman refugee to leave her violent husband with her children.</p> <p> Hope Citadel is now working with <a href=\"http://sharedhealthfoundation.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shared Health Foundation</a> \u2013 a charity centred on identifying good practice and using the Greater Manchester health devolution agenda to roll it out into the most deprived parts of the conurbation.</p> <p> Patterson says: \u201cWe call Focused Care the \u2018Macmillan Service for deprivation\u2019.

  "<p>One episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\">Game of Thrones</a> tells you all you need to know about how important city walls used to be for defence. But they were also about identity and belonging, as Wendy Pullan, director of Cambridge University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.urbanconflicts.arct.cam.ac.uk/research-projects/conflict-in-cities\">Centre for Urban Conflicts Research</a>, explains: \u201cIf you lived within the walls then you were a citizen; if you didn\u2019t then you weren\u2019t. The status used to matter a lot.\u201d<br></p> <p>In recent times, since the collapse of the iron curtain, one might have imagined separation walls would be less in vogue. But walls within cities, slicing one community from another \u2013 whether on ethnic, religious or political lines \u2013 are still prevalent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2013/nov/walls#intro\">from Jerusalem to Belfast</a>, not to mention in war-torn cities such as Homs in Syria.</p> <p>\u201cAll over the Middle East, you\u2019re seeing walls between Sunni and Shia residents,\u201d says Raghda El-Halawany, who works for global peace movement <a href=\"http://www.masterpeace.org/\">MasterPeace</a>. Homs is now peppered with walls \u2013 the most famous one encloses Baba Amr, a rebel stronghold, surrounded by Sunni and Christian quarters.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story in Iraq\u2019s capital, Baghdad. While many of its walls have been built for security around schools and hospitals, or for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/iraq-builds-wall-and-trench-around-baghdad-to-stop-militant-attacks\">protection against militant attacks</a>, they\u2019re also to keep sectarian communities apart: a three-mile wall was built by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/20/iraq.usa\">US soldiers in 2007</a>, for instance, which gated off a minority Sunni community.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93eed9891bd1deec9b7e984840e6f917d2e0d3b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93eed9891bd1deec9b7e984840e6f917d2e0d3b9/0_234_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wall Baghdad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A painter decorates a security wall sealing off the southern section of the Shia enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karim Kadim/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, walls separate rich from poor communities. The most well-known is the gated communities of Alphaville, in which 60,000-odd residents are surrounded by around 40 miles of wall. The high-rise buildings inside the compound, with their bright blue <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f4/15/10/f415103cf5b1fc89631e472084372a6b.jpg\">swimming pools on apartment balconies</a>, jar against the dusty red roofs of the surrounding, low-lying favelas.</p> <p>Referring to separating walls as a \u201chot topic\u201d, El-Halawany also cites the recent UK proposal for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/uk-immigration-minister-confirms-work-will-begin-on-big-new-wall-in-calais\">big, new wall</a>\u201d in the French port city of Calais \u2013 four-metres-high and 1km-long \u2013 to stop refugees boarding lorries to reach England illegally.<br></p> <p>Pullan says it\u2019s unclear whether there has been the same kind of growth in city walls as along the borders between countries \u2013 a phenomenon that will surely increase should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">Donald Trump become the next US president</a>. Certainly, though, \u201cvarious municipal authorities are using walls and it seems to be more prevalent,\u201d she suggests.</p> <p>It\u2019s with the aim of subverting the trend, and turning walls of separation into walls of connection, that MasterPeace has invited artists to spend 21 September, the UN\u2019s annual <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/\">International Day of Peace</a>, painting walls in 30 cities around the world for one of the biggest mural projects in history. Walls will be painted in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slums, one of the worst spots of post-election violence in recent years; in the Bangladeshi city of Sylhet, prescient in a country that\u2019s home to the world\u2019s longest border wall; and in Mexico City, where the Trump wall is on everyone\u2019s minds.</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77aac25d3b21c46bc3c75b991d9c53aa6bad2271/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banksy\u2019s work on the West Bank wall in Ramallah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In most cases, separation walls are imposed, usually by some sort of authority, and usually against the wishes of some, if not all, affected inhabitants. The separation wall in Jerusalem, for instance, built by Israel from 2002 onwards to cut East Jerusalem off from the rest of the West Bank, has been built against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Palestinians.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you build a wall, you need to guard it \u2026 walls create hatred automatically</p> <footer> <cite>Raghda El-Halawany</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Northern Ireland, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/29/belfast-berlin-wall-moment-permanent-peace-walls\">Belfast\u2019s walls</a> are unusual as the majority of those living beside them \u2013 built from 1969 to divide Protestant and Catholic communities \u2013 seem to favour them.<br></p> <p>In desperate times, such walls can be a pragmatic answer to a city\u2019s volatile rifts. As Pullan concedes: \u201cYou can understand that when there is fighting going on, and people are killing each other, the municipal authorities will react usually quickly in wanting to pull the warring communities apart.\u201d</p> <p>Although many walls start life as temporary, they very quickly take on a permanence, and divisions become harder to heal. For El-Halawany, they are antithetical to the very nature of cities: \u201cCities are built on integration, mobility and connections. The feeling of separation creates more of this feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t belong\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m hated\u2019, so it\u2019s more okay to be violent.\u201d</p> <p>She feels their ill effects in her native Cairo: \u201cWhenever there is a new compound, there is increased security \u2013 when you build a wall, you need to guard it \u2026 walls create hatred automatically.\u201d<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7JHbwVD2wU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q7JHbwVD2wU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What makes these walls so damaging, says Pullan, who who is speaking from Jerusalem where she lived for over a decade, is that they\u2019re \u201coften in a place where no one would have expected a wall, they divide the urban fabric \u2013 they cause spacial discontinuities. If you get that, you usually get social discontinuities as well \u2013 it cuts the normal flow of movement in a city, it means that people never encounter each other, or very rarely.\u201d</p> <p>She takes the example of the wall and UN buffer zone built between the Turkish and Greek communities of the Cypriot capital, Nicosia: \u201c[It] goes right through what was their major commercial street ... and that\u2019s what\u2019s so damaging \u2013 you end up with two rump cities. Once you do that, it\u2019s very hard to put the city back together again.\u201d You only need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/apr/12/cyprus-buffer-zone-photographs-agencies\">look at pictures of the area now</a> \u2013 eerie, like a ghost town \u2013 to understand what she\u2019s talking about.</p> <p>In Jerusalem today, some of the same issues apply as in Nicosia\u2019s old commercial heart. In such a badly divided city, Pullan says, \u201cit\u2019s very important that occasionally people see a face that doesn\u2019t look like theirs \u2026 The Palestinians hear quite a lot of Hebrew, because that\u2019s the dominant language at this point, but the Israelis need to hear Arabic \u2026 These are little things but they\u2019re really important if societies are ever to come together.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/23/struggle-cairo-egypt-revolutionary-graffiti\">'Erase and I will draw again': the struggle behind Cairo's revolutionary graffiti wall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So separation walls feed into a much bigger narrative of estrangement in divided cities: without contact with \u201cthe other side\u201d, communities will tend, Pullan says, to vilify \u201cthe other\u201d. </p> <p>The roots of division often run very deep and it\u2019s difficult to bring walls down even when they\u2019ve been physically removed. So is there an answer? Public space, according to Pullan, is essential. \u201cThere\u2019s the tendency \u2013 even in cities that have a very low level of conflict \u2013 to privatise, put in barriers.\u201d Turning the areas around walls into useable public space is one of the things El-Halawany hopes MasterPeace\u2019s project will achieve. They painted a wall in Cairo a few years ago<strong></strong>, not far from Tahrir Square. Ever since, she says, the space around it has been used for pop-up concerts and events. The local community have invested in it.</p> <p>\u201cThere probably is something fairly inherent in the way we live that we tend to want to live with our own people,\u201d Pullan says. \u201c\u2026 And I suppose there\u2019s nothing so terrible about that. However, there have to be places in cities where we meet other people, and that\u2019s key.

  "<p>If there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign has taught us it\u2019s to view every depraved moral nadir as a challenge, not a destination. You think this is bad? Wait for the tangy mouth garbage he\u2019s got stewing for tomorrow. Then forget about it instantly \u2013 everyone else will! I heard state department employees sometimes email each other!!!</p> <p>Just this week we\u2019ve seen Trump metabolise the Chelsea bombing into an incoherent anti-Clinton smear before the shrapnel had even settled. I\u2019ve listened to my Muslim friends express their fear of leaving the house after <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/new-yorkers-just-received-a-terrible-emergency-alert.html\">Monday\u2019s unconscionably irresponsible emergency alert</a>, the kind of histrionic racial profiling Trump vows to amplify. We\u2019ve read up on <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/donald-trumps-new-anti-abortion-letter-should-terrify-you.html\">Trump\u2019s alignment with an anti-abortion extremist group</a>, and his avowal to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trumps-law-and-order-approach-wont-make-us-safer/\">\u201cget very tough\u201d</a> on \u201cthing[s]\u201d apparently including <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/348568/donald-trump-free-speech-ny-bomb/\">freedom of expression</a>. We\u2019ve clocked Trump\u2019s pin-drop silence on the shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher and Tyre King, though \u2013 don\u2019t worry \u2013 over the summer he promised to make the streets safer \u2026 for police. Trump \u201cjoked\u201d (again!) <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/9/16/12949204/trump-jokes-clinton-assassination\">about the assassination of Hillary Clinton</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted\">His son compared refugees, who are human beings who need our asylum to live, to Skittles</a>, which are sweets.</p> <p>It was a panoply of potentially career-ending gaffes extruded, clumped, scooped and forgotten in a single week \u2013 AKA business as usual in proto-Trump America. Baffled disgust turned to abject terror (in my circles, at least) when new poll numbers saw Trump climb to 42%.</p> <p>So, yesterday (like most days in these, surely, the end times), I wrote some snotty doom and gloom about Trump on Facebook and, to my surprise, was gently scolded by a friend. \u201cHating Trump isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, \u201cjust like hating W wasn\u2019t enough in 2004. We have to talk about Hillary.\u201d I was defensive for a second \u2013 I do talk about Hillary! \u2013 but couldn\u2019t quibble with her point. It\u2019s easy and fun (and compulsory for responsible human beings) to despise Trump, but treating Clinton like a barely-better-than-a-literal-white-supremacist cipher does her \u2013 and our future as a non-blown-up planet \u2013 no favours. Yes, Trump is an objectively, dangerously horrendous candidate. But we have to start acknowledging that even if we scrubbed Trump from this universe altogether (buy my fan fiction!), Clinton would still be an excellent one.</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton, but not just because I want to see Donald Trump fail and cry.</p> <p>Clinton is pro-choice. This means she does not want to force anyone to give birth to their rapist\u2019s child, or carry a dead foetus inside of their body for 20 weeks, or derail their future because sex is great and everyone has it and accidents happen, or otherwise be a nonconsensual incubator of any kind. Clinton wants to make it harder, not easier, to buy guns. She believes in eliminating loopholes and expanding background checks on gun sales. She does not think domestic abusers should own guns, which is good, because abused women are five times more likely to be murdered if their abusive partner owns a gun. She would prefer your children not to get shot in schools or shopping malls or nightclubs. I agree.</p> <p>Clinton believes in guaranteed paid family leave, because fathers are parents too, and mothers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between career stagnation and going back to work while their episiotomy stitches are still oozing.</p> <p>Clinton wants to tax rich people more than poor people, which is a sentence that no one should have to type ever again.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s platform addresses mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline, climate change, violence against trans women of colour, the systemic neglect of veterans, mental health stigma, voting rights, student loan debt, public education and affordable health care. Clinton is the candidate whose views best represent my own.</p> <p>Whether or not you feel comfortable with every decision and position in Clinton\u2019s past (I do not), she is qualified for this job. She is a shrewd, savvy, tough politician.</p> <p>Clinton has weathered intrusive, insulting, gendered smear campaigns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/490478924/cooked-up-after-a-hillary-clinton-gaffe-the-first-spouse-cookie-battle-is-back\">cookies</a>, Benghazi, emails and pneumonia \u2013 with a grace rivalled only by Obama\u2019s unflappable handling of birthers. She swam through tar every single day of her career and still surpassed male opponents who swam through water. She has been scrutinised in bad faith and beyond all reason for her entire campaign (and decades prior), and Republicans have still had to manufacture baroque, toothless scandals out of dust motes. Yet, somehow, 42% of my country apparently believes that Donald Trump is more qualified to address foreign policy and \u201csafety\u201d than an actual seasoned diplomat. Do you guys think \u201csecretary of state\u201d is the kind of secretary who gets the president coffee? Is that the confusion?</p> <p>We cannot excise sexism from this election (and here I am talking predominantly to white dudes \u2013 the group most disproportionately supporting Trump \u2013 who just have a vague \u201cfeeling\u201d that they don\u2019t like Clinton). You might not overtly hate women. You might be a fantastic boyfriend, husband, brother or son. You might not beat women or harass them or even objectify them or belittle them. But do you trust them? Do you hire them? Do you hire them for management positions? You\u2019re building a house. Do you prefer a male contractor or a female contractor? You\u2019re having open heart surgery tomorrow. Do you want a male surgeon or a female surgeon? If your gut says \u201cman\u201d, you have some introspection to do.</p> <p>So let\u2019s try again: you\u2019re voting for a president soon. Do you want a graduate of Yale law school who served eight years as a US senator and four as secretary of state? Or a racist landlord who moonlights as a tie salesman?</p> <p>I cannot wait to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>",

Ask questions, build a rapport with the right people, and you will find you\u2019ve already got promising leads into a different direction from your contacts.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Opportunities aplenty for those with a legal background</strong></h2> <p>Those working in the legal industry but hoping to take their career out of the City and into the field, are welcomed by international aid organisations. \u201cA legal background should stand you in good stead for a variety of opportunities in the sector,\u201d says Fairman. \u201cMy best recommendation would be to try to get some work placements or volunteering under your belt first to get a feel for the kinds of roles that are out there, and a better idea of the direction you want to take. You\u2019ll find that way you begin to carve a route in and make some strong contacts while you learn.\u201d<br></p> <p>Humanitarian organisations need a surprising amount of legal advice, adds Macdonald. \u201cThey get some of that met pro bono by external firms, but will also retain their own legal staff both in their headquarters and local representation in other countries. A lot of this is relatively mundane Visa or work permit issues, but issues of international law and compliance with anti-terrorism laws are also common in some places.<br></p> <p>Legal professionals should make contact with Advocates for International Development. \u201cThey match law firms and practising lawyers with development organisations who need legal assistance,\u201d says Tubb. \u201cYou can generally volunteer remotely to get a view of what the opportunities and issues are.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>Jailed nine years ago for stealing lorries, Sergio is adamant he won\u2019t join the long line of ex-offenders heading back into Mexico\u2019s notoriously violent, overcrowded prison system. Reoffending rates in the country stand at 44%.</p> <p>Sergio\u2019s chances might be better than most. After leaving jail three months ago, he joined <a href=\"http://www.prisonart.com.mx/\">Prison Art</a>, a social enterprise operating in six prisons in the states of Guadalajara and Queretaro to make high-end textile goods. </p> <p>\u201cLeaving prison, my only option apart from this was a minimum-wage job some place. With Prison Art, I can work from home and the pay allows me to look after my mother and daughter,\u201d Sergio says. </p> <p>Prison Art sells bags, wallets, belts and other accessories in 11 shops around Mexico, as well as internationally <a href=\"http://www.prisonart.com.mx/shop/\">online</a>. The designs are inspired by tattooing, an art form that the social enterprise\u2019s founder Jorge Cueto-Felgueroso became familiar with during the 11 months he spent in a Guadalajara prison awaiting trial for fraud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7a82c8db0d01c8e20635fc525c4e2512ffac1ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7a82c8db0d01c8e20635fc525c4e2512ffac1ef/0_0_4992_4352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Cueto-Felgueroso founder of Prison Art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Cueto-Felgueroso founder of Prison Art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prison Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The actuary-turned-businessman was found innocent, but the experience inspired him to help prisoners reintegrate into society. His solution was Prison Art, which he set up in late 2013 and which now provides paid work and training to over 200 prisoners. All the profits from sales are ploughed back into providing skills training and setting up new retail outlets. </p> <p>The use of prison labour by companies is commonplace in Mexico, which has a prison population of<a href=\"http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/mexico\"> just under 250,000</a>, as it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/09/prison-work-program-ohsa-whole-foods-inmate-labor-incarceration\">around the world</a>. Yet the work is typically low-skilled, repetitive and poorly paid. And it\u2019s not without controversy. Whole Foods announced in April it would stop stocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/09/prison-work-program-ohsa-whole-foods-inmate-labor-incarceration\">products made by prison labour</a> after customers accused the supermarket chain of participating in the exploitation of low paid prisoners.</p> <p> Cueto-Felgueroso says Prison Art is about raising prisoners\u2019 self-esteem and providing them with a tradeable skill, it\u2019s not just about work or wages. \u201cThe bags we make are just a sub-product of the whole process,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the help we offer with rehabilitation and the reintegration into society afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, inmates on Prison Art\u2019s programme can earn between $350-$1,000 (\u00a3270-\u00a3770) per month, according to Cueto-Felgueroso \u2013 not bad given that the monthly salary of a prison guard is around $450 (\u00a3350). In order to help maintain family relationships and meet domestic expenses, the social enterprise directs half of all prisoners\u2019 pay to their immediate families. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/taller-nu\">Taller Nu</a> is another social enterprise working in Mexico\u2019s prisons. Set up by 29 year-old fashion designer Pilar Obeso and her business partner Olga Olivares, the company produces high-end shoes that sell in designer stores in Miami and New York, as well as across Mexico. The company, which currently counts 25 female inmates on its work training programme, also offers courses in self-empowerment via a non-profit partner. Participants are paid on a per-product basis.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoZHF2rGkDI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CoZHF2rGkDI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Taller Nu video.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In addition, Taller Nu has an arrangement with the correctional facility in Texcoco, 25km north-east of Mexico City, that sees prisoners\u2019 jail times reduced by five days for every ten days they work. The prison authority is helping the organisation co-fund a permanent workshop within the jail.</p> <p>Because of the emphasis on vocational training, life skills and long-term rehabilitation, Obeso says that her initiative is free of the shadow of exploitation that hangs over prison labour. She sees a benefit in actively promoting its work with prisoners. \u201cPeople are willing to pay a bit more once they know what and who is behind this beautiful product,\u201d says Obeso.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a65493d4e2aa1c400c6b028e9b3cec683aaca08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a65493d4e2aa1c400c6b028e9b3cec683aaca08/0_0_1400_933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olga Olivares and Pilar Obeso, founders of Taller Nu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olga Olivares and Pilar Obeso, founders of Taller Nu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taller Nu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar initiatives are being tried in the UK, where companies offering paid work to inmates is becoming \u201cmore common\u201d, according to a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmjust/309/309.pdf\">recent government review</a> (pdf).

The organisation trains over 400 prisoners in embroidery skills annually in around 29 UK jails. Their work has been exhibited at the V&amp;A and sold to designers such as Stella McCartney and hotelier Kit Kemp. </p> <p>Fine Cell Work is part grant-funded and part financed through product sales, which net around \u00a3250,000 per year. The pay is peanuts by conventional standards, with participants collecting around \u00a3200-\u00a31,100 per year, according to founding director Katy Emck. But the emphasis, she says, is primarily on self-esteem and future career prospects. \u201cWages are not real world wages,\u201d Emck concedes, \u201cbut people don\u2019t do it if they don\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d </p> <p>Social enterprises should be the norm in prisons, she says: \u201cRather than just doing something functional, if the people involved have purpose and their skills are nurtured and they are encouraged, then we would have much, much lower recidivism.\u201d </p> <p>Whole work opportunities for prisoners \u201cmay play a positive role in their rehabilitation\u201d, says Peter Frankental of Amnesty International, he warns of exploitation. \u201cUnder no circumstances should commercial interests take precedence over their rights. The abuse of prisoners in many countries makes it particularly important for governments to conform to internationally established ground rules when they allow businesses to use prison labour and to ensure that safeguards relating to working conditions and health and safety are in place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At the opening night of the Archibald prize in July, one painting commanded more double takes than the rest: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/15/archibald-prize-2016-review-typically-debatable-portrait-beats-some-very-worthy-work\">Nick Stathopoulos\u2019 portrait of Sudanese refugee and lawyer, Deng Adut</a> \u2013 so real to life it could have been a photo. </p> <p>On Wednesday Stathopoulos was awarded the public-voted people\u2019s choice award for the hyperreal piece, which took him four months to complete \u2013 more time than he has ever taken on a single painting. </p> <p>The portrait, titled Deng, is Stathopoulos\u2019 first public choice winner and his fifth entry to be selected as an Archibald finalist.

Considering the recent political news involving debates over the acceptance of refugees from the Syrian civil war, it\u2019s relevant reading:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I came to the United States as a refugee when I was 11 years old. My father was a diplomat and a strong supporter of democracy in Czechoslovakia, so when the Communists took over, we were forced into exile as refugees. In November 1948, we were welcomed to the United States of America.</p> <p>Becoming a US citizen is the most important thing that ever happened to me. My father said that when we were in Europe during WWII people would say, \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you be leaving to go back home?\u2019</p> <p>But in America, people said: \u2018We are sorry for your troubles and hope that you have everything you need; by the way, when will you become a citizen?\u2019</p> <p>America resettles more refugees than any other nation because it reflects one of our noblest traditions as a nation: providing support to those who are most vulnerable.</p> <p>With the world facing the largest mass displacement on record since World War II, it has never been more important for world leaders to follow America\u2019s example and work together to do more to support refugees....</p> <p>When countries with insufficient resources take in refugees, it creates more instability, not just at the frontlines of this crisis, but around the world. If we were to slam the door in the faces of refugees with certain religious backgrounds, we would defy our history and our principles of pluralism and diversity. As we talk to other nations about what more needs to be done to tackle this crisis, it\u2019s important that President Obama is setting this example.</p> <p>When I came here as a child, I will never forget sailing into New York Harbor for the first time and beholding the Statute of Liberty. I did not have to face refugee camps or the kind of danger that many refugees endure. But like all refugees, I shared a hope to live a safe life with dignity and a chance to give back to my new country.</p> <p>Together, we can help refugees rebuild their lives and live with dignity once again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a621e4b0603ea33c4669\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:18:18.009Z\">10.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fox News talking head Sean Hannity\u2019s outspoken and material support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached another milestone today, with the release of an eight-minute promotional video for the nominee in which Hannity makes an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0J_EKmvYZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k0J_EKmvYZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hannity, whose eponymous program has long been a favorite slot for Trump to answer softball questions and for the duo to <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/OeF3QBlnwlV\">soak up each others\u2019 awesomeness</a>, arrives about six minutes into #HEARTLAND4TRUMP, a promotional video studded with testimonials about the Republican nominee:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons I\u2019m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he\u2019s going to put originalists on the supreme court - people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>He\u2019s a guy that will vet refugees to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>And, of course, he\u2019s gonna build that wall.

Should you engage with those who may be intolerant of cultural diversity or racial difference? Is it worth accepting that significant section of the Australian community may be holding such views? Should racial ugliness be killed with kindness, empathy and understanding?</p> <p>First, it is essential that Australia remain a society committed to non-discrimination and tolerance. There should be no excuses for the advocacy of discrimination and the expression of intolerance. Acknowledging people\u2019s concerns doesn\u2019t mean endorsing them. This doesn\u2019t in any way mean stifling freedom of expression. Those sympathetic to populist political rhetoric about race, immigration and Islam are, of course, entitled to their view. But they are not entitled to engage in vilification or discrimination. They are not entitled to be coddled or be protected from criticism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/14/comprehending-pauline-is-not-the-challenge-engaging-constructively-with-hansonism-is\">Comprehending Pauline is not the challenge. Engaging constructively with Hansonism is | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Everyone has a right to free speech and to call out prejudice, racism and bigotry. If people don\u2019t want to be called racist or bigoted, they can begin by not doing things that involve racism or bigotry.</p> <p>And as part of listening to community concerns about issues, it\u2019s also worth listening to those who experience racism or bigotry.</p> <p>Australians have a natural sympathy with battlers. But on matters of race and free speech, the battlers aren\u2019t political representatives or media commentators who enjoy regular, prominent public platforms to express their views. The real battlers are those whose voices are only rarely heard, or whose voices get silenced by racism.</p> <p>When politicians target particular groups with their rhetoric, it can affect what children experience in the schoolyard, and what their parents experience in their workplace.</p> <p> There\u2019s a need, though, to retain perspective. The vast majority of Australians are comfortable with multiculturalism. We shouldn\u2019t overstate the small minority who are hostile towards it. Five per cent of people across the country voted for One Nation, but 95% of Australians did not.</p> <p>Moreover, we must avoid the complacency of believing that there may be nothing more Australian than intolerance \u2013 to believe that copping racism is just part of some initiation rite for any immigrant group. Some say that just as the Irish, Italians, Greeks and Asians copped ugliness, so too must Muslims. According to this view, immigrants must show forbearance, become part of the mainstream, and then be free to have a go at the next lot who arrive.</p> <p>While racism and bigotry may never be eradicated, it isn\u2019t good enough to say its targets must grin and bear it, or that there\u2019s nothing that can be done. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/17/meeting-pauline-hansons-voters-silent-screamers-find-their-voice\">Meeting Pauline Hanson's voters: silent screamers find their voice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of those who have experienced racism don\u2019t endure it thinking they will one day get their own back by dishing it out themselves. That\u2019s not how racism works. It\u2019s no accident that it is our multicultural communities \u2013 the Jewish, the Chinese, the Arabs, the Greeks, among many others \u2013 who are most prominent in fighting racism. It is perverse to suggest that the greatest aspiration for immigrants should be the power of having a go at the next lot.</p> <p>Finally, let\u2019s tackle the question of whether we should kill ugliness with kindness. It\u2019s one thing to discuss matters, including race and religion, in a civil and respectful manner. But it\u2019s another thing to ask those who are vulnerable to discrimination to suck it up and be nice to those who are dishing it. Such kindness and generosity is rarely if ever reciprocated. Too often, people forget that the burden of racial tolerance is borne unequally by those who are its targets.</p> <p>All this goes to perhaps one aspect of racism that not everyone may appreciate.

Refugees are people.\u201d Trump Jr followed up on Tuesday morning when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jr-skittles-tweet-hunting\">he shared an article</a> from a far right wing website that claimed, without evidence, that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of British women have been tortured and raped by gangs \u201ccomprised almost exclusively of Muslims\u201d.</p> <p>The firestorm caused by the younger Trump\u2019s tweet even forced a response from running mate Mike Pence who told NBC News\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell in an interview: \u201cIt is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr, when Hillary Clinton\u2019s calling for a 550% increase in the Syrian refugee program.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday came against the backdrop of another fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man, this time in Oklahoma. Video footage released on Monday showed law enforcement in Tulsa fatally shoot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#terence-crutcher-2016782\">Terence Crutcher</a>, 40, as he approached his SUV with his arms raised in the air. The local police chief later acknowledged that no weapon was found either on Crutcher or inside his vehicle.<br></p> <p>Pence downplayed the Tulsa shooting on Tuesday, saying that while he supported \u201ca thorough investigation of what took place\u201d there was no institutional bias within law enforcement. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I find offensive is when Hillary Clinton and others refer to implicit bias or institutional bias within the ranks of our law enforcement community broadly,\u201d Pence told news anchor Brian Williams on MSNBC.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of our law enforcement community, we stand strongly with them,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cObviously when mistakes are made and tragedy occurs, they should be fully investigated. But enough already of this reference to law enforcement and institutional or implicit bias.\u201d</p> <p>The bulk of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-shootings-studies-racial-bias_us_5796f2d8e4b02d5d5ed2b4aa\">public research</a> on the subject provides evidence that black people are more likely to be stopped by police. Young black men were also nine times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other people, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">data compiled by the Guardian</a> on police killings.</p> <p>The Republican nominee suffered another potential blow when it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/george-h-w-bush-voting-for-hillary-claims-member-of-kennedy-family\">former President George HW Bush would vote for</a> Hillary Clinton in November. Bush apparently told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the daughter of Robert F Kennedy and former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland, that he would be casting his ballot for Clinton. She shared the news in a Facebook post, which the Guardian obtained.</p> <p> Jim McGrath, a Bush family spokesman, told the Guardian: \u201cThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s busy day came as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton stayed off the trail in advance of Monday\u2019s presidential debate, the first between the two candidate. Although the former secretary of state did a radio appearance and held a conference call with national security advisors, she held no public events. As a result, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/778238281196662784\">jibed on Twitter</a>: \u201cHillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary \u2013 see you at the debate!\u201d</p>"
