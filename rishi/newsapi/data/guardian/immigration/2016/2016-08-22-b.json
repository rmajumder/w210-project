He also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-media-ban-guardian-denied-entry-campaign-event\">banned the Guardian from attending an event in Scotland</a> after Trump took offence when reporter Ewen MacAskill questioned the Republican nominee about his allegedly \u201ctoxic\u201d politics. </p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Charles Harder, an attorney at the firm of Harder, Miller and Abrams which is representing Trump, said: \u201cThis law firm is litigation counsel for Melania Trump. Mrs Trump has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an \u2018escort\u2019 in the 1990s. All such statements are 100% false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful. She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.\u201d</p> <p>Harder\u2019s not-quite-four-year-old Beverly Hills firm, Harder Mirell &amp; Abrams LLP, is perhaps best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/10/gawker-media-bankruptcy-auction-hulk-hogan-lawsuit\">bankrupted Gawker Media</a>, which was sold at auction to media company Univision earlier in August. The suit was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who spoke on behalf of Trump at the Republican national convention in Cleveland. Harder has also represented a number of other plaintiffs against Gawker as well; most recently, Harder has threatened a lawsuit against the now-defunct website because of <a href=\"http://gawker.com/now-peter-thiels-lawyer-wants-to-silence-reporting-on-t-1781918385\">an investigative report</a> about Donald Trump\u2019s hair.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Daily Mail did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Harder has since confirmed to the Guardian that Melania Trump is also considering filing lawsuits against other publications including Politico and the Week. Harder said that those publications are all \u201con notice\u201d and no suit has been filed yet. The Guardian has since learned that Politico has received a letter from Harder putting the publication on notice of a potential legal action. The lawyer\u2019s complaints <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648\">related to a 4 August story </a>about Melania Trump\u2019s immigration status when she first came to the United States. For other publications, Harder did not specify which articles Melania Trump considered defamatory.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Thielman</em></p>",

Band wanted to arrange for the crown prince of Bahrain, a US ally, to meet the secretary of state during a visit to Washington. \u201cGood friend of ours,\u201d Band wrote to Abedin.</p> <p>After initial doubts over scheduling, Abedin confirmed that Clinton would meet Crown Prince Salman, who in 2005 had made a $32m commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. Copies of Clinton\u2019s calendar obtained by the Associated Press confirm that the meeting took place in her state department office on 26 June 2009.</p> <p>Another exchange shows Band requesting that Clinton help a member of British football club <a href=\"http://www.wolves.co.uk/\">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> \u2013 presumably a player, though no name is given \u2013 who was struggling to get a US visa to visit Las Vegas for a \u201ccelebration break\u201d because of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. This was at the behest of Hollywood and sports executive Casey Wasserman, who had donated between $5m and $10m to the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>But Clinton\u2019s office did not comply and no visa was obtained. Abedin said it \u201cmakes me nervous to get involved but I\u2019ll ask\u201d. Band replied: \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The emails also show that Clinton met SlimFast founder <a href=\"http://www.centerpeace.org/about/staff/s-daniel-abraham/\">Daniel Abraham</a>, founder of the Center for Middle East Peace and another Clinton Foundation donor, at a day\u2019s notice in May 2009. According to the Associated Press, the calendars show the meeting was one of eight between Abraham and Clinton while she was secretary, the most of any foundation donor.</p> <p>On Monday the state department rejected any allegations of undue influence. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: \u201cI would just once again emphasise that there wasn\u2019t a single channel for access to the secretary of state than secretary of state Clinton. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAnd for senior aides working at the department at the time to have connections with the Clinton Foundation \u2013 which by the way was working on, for example, Haiti relief, post-earthquake, pretty significant roles in that, in fact \u2013 only speaks to the fact that these were important people who had reason to convey information to the secretary. There was nothing that we have seen that implied any kind of untoward relationship.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign rejected the criticism and took a swipe at Judicial Watch. Spokesman Josh Schwerin said: \u201cOnce again this rightwing organisation that has been going after the Clintons since the 1990s is distorting facts to make utterly false attacks. No matter how this group tries to mischaracterise these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s running mate <a href=\"http://www.kaine.senate.gov/\">Tim Kaine</a>, speaking at the ironworkers\u2019 annual convention in Las Vegas, said: \u201cAll the donors to the foundation have been disclosed. And the foundation has said, \u2018We\u2019ll go further. We\u2019ll restructure itself completely if Hillary Clinton is elected president.\u2019 That\u2019s a pledge.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump, on the other hand, has told us nothing about how he\u2019ll deal with the conflicts posed by his business dealings, like the money his company owes to the Bank of China. And I have this to say to Donald Trump, because these ties affect your net worth: before you go about attacking a charity, why don\u2019t you come clean about your own business dealings and tell the American people who you are in debt to?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s pivot is a tale of two hirings, and which one he gives more weight to will have a dramatic impact on the outcome of his campaign.</p> <p>Most analysis thus far has revolved around Breitbart News chairman Stephen K Brannon, who last week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">named</a> the campaign\u2019s chief executive. It was a move widely seen as a rebuke to the more traditional presidential campaign that the recently ousted Paul Manafort sought to implement.</p> <p>But the hiring of Manafort\u2019s actual replacement, seasoned GOP operative Kellyanne Conway, tells a very different story. Namely, that Trump is going to remain true to himself, only this time in a winning way.</p> <p>Conway, who started with the Trump campaign in July as an adviser to Manafort, has promised to do what Manafort could not: to \u201csharpen the message\u201d put forward by Trump, rather than try to rebuild his personality from scratch with a teleprompter \u2013 something she\u2019s previously described as being less about changing Trump than giving him choices. (In a July interview with the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/20/meet-the-woman-trying-to-fix-donald-trumps-image-with-women/\">Washington Post</a>, Conway compared her approach to the time she persuaded her daughter to swap out a turquoise Memorial Day outfit for a more flattering blue alternative.)</p> <p>That means Conway listening to Trump as much as he listens to her. And unlike a lot of women, conservative and otherwise, she\u2019s been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/conway-all-issues-are-women-s-issues-746954819988\">recently telling MSNBC</a> \u201cI think you should judge people by their actions, not just their words on a political campaign trail\u201d. Whether Trump will be able to listen to and learn from Conway\u2019s guidance, however, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Listening to women has never exactly been Trump\u2019s strong suit, but now his entire campaign may hang in the balance of his ability \u2013 or more likely, lack of ability \u2013 to do just that.</p> <p>He started out strong in Charlotte last Thursday with a speech owning up to the \u201cpersonal pain\u201d caused by his past words. In <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-remarks-in-charlotte-nc\">that speech</a>, he cast himself as the truthteller for forgotten Americans and a champion of those who feel the best is behind them. \u201cI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the powerful protecting the powerful. The insiders fighting for the insiders,\u201d he said. \u201cI am fighting for you.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the pivot is about more than just rhetoric. In the weeks ahead, Trump has promised to follow the messaging up with a series of ads targeting the central themes of his campaign, like immigration, along with regularly scheduled policy addresses ahead of the upcoming debates.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s campaign has always been longer on talk than substance, and this is a strategically wise picture for Trump to be painting: that he may be brash and uncouth from time to time, but he\u2019s fundamentally a guy who calls it as he sees it. In contrast, so the picture goes, to Clinton\u2019s politically correct doublespeak.</p> <p>In interviews following Trump\u2019s big speech, Conway drove home that messaging.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/donald-trump-maybe-finally-pivots-it-probably-wont-work/\">Speaking on CNBC Monday</a>, Conway sought to cast Clinton\u2019s reserved style as a measure of her supposed \u201cuntrustworthiness,\u201d contrasting it with Trump\u2019s energetic approach to rallies. Conway called Trump a man who \u201cenjoys himself on the trail,\u201d adding: \u201cHe gets oxygen from at being at these rallies [and] from giving these speeches\u201d. Meanwhile Clinton, she said, \u201clooks like she\u2019s not happy to be out there\u201d campaigning.</p> <p>Conway has a long list of success stories when it comes to this kind of retooling, from helping GOP lawmakers change the way they talk about rape to helping Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence polish his personality in ways that \u201ckept him comfortable in his own skin\u201d ahead of a gubernatorial reelection campaign, as Pence\u2019s communications director <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/can-kellyanne-conway-save-trump-from-himself\">recently told TPM</a>. </p> <p>In both cases, her coaching seems to have paid off, at least for a time: those GOP lawmakers walked into decidedly fewer self-sabotaging boobytraps in the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/gop-rape-controversy-114524\">election cycle</a> following <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/338042/ten-takeaways-gop-retreat-robert-costa-andrew-stiles\">the 2013 retreat</a> at which she spoke, and Pence\u2019s strong performance at the RNC last month was a bright spot in an otherwise blighted convention.</p> <p>But, in the words of Trump\u2019s old campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, to just \u201cLet Trump be Trump!\u201d is a somewhat fraught proposition.</p> <p>We\u2019re talking about a man who\u2019s called Rosie O\u2019Donnell a \u201cfat pig,\u201d Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d and dismissed a difficult line of questioning from a female moderator as being linked to \u201cblood coming out of her \u2026 wherever\u201d.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of lines Conway is hoping to help Trump steer clear of, much as she coached Congressional Republicans to stop uttering such politically suicidal lines as Todd Akin\u2019s comment about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d.</p> <p>With Trump, such lofty goals may be hopeless. No sooner had Conway begun to insist in interviews that \u201c<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/priebus-trump-tied-clinton.html\">the pivot that he\u2019s made is on substance</a>\u201d, than he proceeded to make a mockery of her claims.</p> <p>After she declared on ABC News\u2019 This Week With George Stephanopoulos, that Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-kellyanne-conway-insults-227239#ixzz4I4y\">\u201cdoesn\u2019t hurl personal insults</a>,\u201d for instance, he went out the next morning and cattily attacked the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, doubling down on the sexist rhetoric that\u2019s come to characterize his campaign. \u201cTried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767685048703279104\">tweeted</a>. \u201c@morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\u201d In a follow-up tweet he referred to Brzezinski as her cohost\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767683204039974912\">very insecure longtime girlfriend</a>\u201d.</p> <p>With only two months left before the election and with Trump trailing Clinton significantly in the polls, one thing is certain: this is his last best chance to have any shot whatsoever at winning.</p>",

She also discovered that each Potter book that her respondents had read lowered their feelings about Trump by two to three points on the 100-point scale.</p> <p>\u201cThis may seem small,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for someone who has read all seven books, the total impact could lower their estimation of Trump by 18 points out of 100.\u201d</p> <p>Mutz said that even when she controlled for issues including gender, education and age, all of which predict Americans\u2019 attitudes to Trump, the \u201cHarry Potter effect\u201d remained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/08/jk-rowling-on-donald-trump-voldemort-was-nowhere-as-bad\">JK Rowling on Donald Trump: 'Voldemort was nowhere as bad'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mutz writes in the study that similarities between Trump and Potter\u2019s nemesis Voldemort \u201chave not gone without notice during the 2016 campaign\u201d, with the term Trumpdemort gaining traction, and \u201ceven Trump supporters \u2026 buying into the analogy, purchasing Trump posters featuring their candidate in front of an American flag as backdrop, with a quote from the Dark Lord himself: \u2018There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She points out similarities between the fictional wizard and the Republican candidate for president, including how Voldemort \u201csupports the eradication of mixed blood wizards\u201d, and how \u201cin comparison, Donald Trump has called for a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigration\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt may simply be too difficult for Harry Potter readers to ignore the similarities between Trump and the power-hungry Voldemort,\u201d she writes in the study.</p> <p>Mutz found that the Potter films, by contrast, did not lead to Trump opposition \u2013 possibly, she believes, because \u201creading inherently requires much higher levels of attention and allows for greater nuance in characters, many of whom are neither wholly good nor wholly bad\u201d, and \u201cdue to length, movies must leave out material from the full books, and they are more likely to emphasise action over the characters\u2019 internal dilemmas and introspection\u201d. </p> <p>Mutz ends her study by speculating that \u201cthese findings raise the hope that Harry Potter can stop the Deathly Donald and make America great again in the eyes of the world, just as Harry did by ridding the wizard world of Voldemort\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the series, love and kindness consistently triumph over aggression and prejudice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful, positive theme, and thus not surprising that readers understand the underlying message of this storyline, and are moved by it. These pro-unity views come through loud and clear in the storyline and have also been publicly voiced by the author of the series, JK Rowling, who has \u2026 espoused anti-Brexit and anti-Trump political views. Harry Potter\u2019s popularity worldwide stands to make a difference not just in the US election, but in elections across Europe that involve aggressive and domineering candidates worldwide.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ja6v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2507193\"            data-video-name=\"JK Rowling defends 'objectionable' Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PEN American Center\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573b09b4e4b05be498d5fba5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/17/160517JKRowling_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-donald-trump-freedom-pen-america-gala-video\">JK Rowling defends \u2018objectionable\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s freedom to speak</a></figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>If you walk along Britain\u2019s poorest streets, the phrase \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 in vogue again after many such places voted to leave the EU \u2013 takes on a complex meaning. It\u2019s not just that they are lagging behind the richer, better-connected places. It can seem, as you survey the pound stores and shuttered pubs, that these towns have been discarded: left behind, as in \u201cunwanted on the journey\u201d. Wealth has flowed out of them to somewhere else.</p> <p>The logical question should be: who did this? Sometimes it\u2019s obvious: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/view-wales-town-showered-eu-cash-votes-leave-ebbw-vale\">Ebbw Vale</a>, for example, the answer is the Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus, which closed the plant in 2002. In many places it\u2019s not obvious. Jobs seep away; council services are privatised; bus timetables dwindle; the local school gets taken over by a \u201csuperhead\u201d from somewhere else, outsourcing the dinner ladies on day one. You can get angry about it, but there is nobody specific to be angry at.</p> <p>Faced with the same problem, union and community organisers in the US have, in the past 12 months, adopted a novel way of fighting back. Through a campaign group called <a href=\"http://hedgeclippers.org/hedgepapers-no-19-hedge-funds-attack-baltimore/\">Hedge Clippers,</a> they have begun tracing the lineages of financial power behind the decisions that affect specific places, and targeting those financiers \u2013 pension funds \u2013 with a new kind of pressure.</p> <p>Steve Lerner, one of the instigators of the 1980s <a href=\"https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/16/justice-for-janitors/\">Justice for Janitors</a> campaign, which, for the first time, organised migrant cleaning workers in the US, explains how the tactic evolved. \u201cWe were organising janitors working for contract cleaning companies: but they\u2019re just middlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we targeted the building owners. It turned out they, too, were dependent on banks and pension companies, so we got a trillion dollars worth of pension money to say it won\u2019t invest unless there is decent pay. Then we asked ourselves: OK, what else do they own?\u201d</p> <p>It turns out, quite a lot. In Baltimore, the city\u2019s privatised water industry hiked its bills. Then, when people started to fall behind in payments, the city agreed to bundle up their unpaid bills into a financial vehicle called a \u201ctax lien\u201d and sell it to investors. The investors can, after two years, evict people from their homes for non-payment.</p> <p>When campaigners looked at who was buying up the debt, they included an anonymous company linked to one of the biggest hedge funds in <a href=\"http://www.fortress.com/OurBusinesses/AlternativeAssetManagement/PrivateEquity/Default.aspx\">America: Fortress Investments</a>, with $23bn worth of assets invested in \u201cthe largest pension funds, university endowments and foundations\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/wales-referendum-remain-leave-vote-uk-eu-membership\">Why did Wales shoot itself in the foot in this referendum? | Richard Wyn Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the 2008 crisis, with returns on government bonds negative, and stock market dividends depressed, pension funds have been pouring money into the hedge fund sector. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of assisted suicide,\u201d Lerner argues: \u201cWorkers are investing their pension money into firms whose mission is to destroy us.\u201d</p> <p>He set up Hedge Clippers, which aims to force pension funds to divest from companies whose investment strategies fuel the cycle of impoverishment.</p> <p>If you apply the same approach to Britain, you\u2019re dealing with a different ecosystem. No city has yet securitised the unpaid debts of the poor, as Baltimore did. While there is no shortage of predatory lenders to the poor, there are \u2013 after a campaign led by Labour MP Stella Creasy \u2013 at least elementary controls on them.</p> <p>However, pension funds are now the biggest source of money for UK hedge funds, according to a Financial Conduct Authority survey last year, with 43% of their money coming from institutional investors. The most obvious act of financial predation is the private finance initiative (PFI), where schools and hospitals were built with vastly lucrative private loans. As a result, the taxpayer is committed to <a href=\"https://scmdirect.com/sites/default/files/Hedge%20Fund%20Research%20Report%20-%20SCM%20Direct,%2017%20May%202016.pdf\">paying back \u00a3232bn on assets worth \u00a357bn</a>.</p> <p>Many pension funds, either directly or indirectly, are investing in the so-called \u201cinfrastructure funds\u201d who buy up PFI debt. The investment analyst <a href=\"https://www.preqin.com/docs/reports/Preqin-Infrastructure-PPP-PFI-July-2016.pdf\">Preqin</a> found 588 institutional investors worldwide with \u201ca preference for funds targeting PFI\u201d, 40% of which were based in Europe.</p> <p>Tracing the more complex ways institutional finance is funding the cycle of impoverishment is not easy. What you would want to know, in places such as Stoke-on-Trent or Newport, is not just who took the decisions to close high-value workplaces but, more importantly, who makes the decisions that lead to chronic under-investment now. Governments, including the devolved ones of the UK, spend a lot of time and money effectively bribing global companies to create jobs and keep them in Britain\u2019s depressed areas. Communities themselves have little or no input into the process, which is in any case all carrot and no stick.</p> <p>Lerner\u2019s initiative in the US grew out of trade union activism, because the unions there learned to follow the money instead of wasting time trying to negotiate with the powerless underlings of global finance. They worked out that, in an age where the workplace and the community can seem like two different spheres of activism, it is the finance system that links the two.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/left-behind-eu-referendum-vote-ukip-revolt-brexit\">Older \u2018left-behind\u2019 voters turned against a political class with values opposed to theirs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Union organising of the unorganised, and community activism in Britain have both traditionally been weak because top-down Labourism has been strong. Faced with PFI, predatory loans, rip-off landlords and privatisation, the British way is to demand legislation, not chain yourself to the door of a Mayfair hedge fund.</p> <p>With or without Jeremy Corbyn, the near-impossibility of Labour gaining a Commons majority in 2020 \u2013 whether because of Scotland, boundary changes, a hostile media or self-destruction \u2013 has to refocus the left on to what is possible to achieve from below. We have to start, as the Americans did, by mapping the invisible forces that strip jobs, value and hope out of communities; make them visible; trace their dependencies and then use direct action to kick them in the corporate goolies until they desist.</p>",
  "<p>As the summer holiday season comes to a close, men and women across America are engaging in a little known national ritual: they are calling their lawyers and filing for divorce.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160821093102.htm\">study</a> by the American Sociological Association has found that March and August are the most popular months to file for divorce. Explanations for the summer spike include a combination of coming back from disappointing summer holidays that failed to meet expectations, and the sense of urgency to get affairs in order before the back-to-school period begins.</p> <p>Here, divorced men and women describe one of the most symbolic parts of the undoing of a marriage: what they did with their wedding rings. </p> <h2>\u2018A tortuously dramatic ritual\u2019</h2> <p>Michele Oberholtzer, a 31-year-old housing advocate and writer based in Hamtramck, Michigan, remembers exactly what happened to her wedding ring: she gave it to her husband the night she moved out, and he gave his to her. </p> <p>The last night they spent in the house together, they drank the champagne they were given on their wedding day, and even danced to their wedding song before exchanging their bands.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so fucking sad,\u201d Oberholtzer says. \u201cIt was like we had to come up with these tortuously dramatic rituals to commemorate what we had. We joked we were so good at breaking up we should stay together.\u201d</p> <p>For a while, she wore her ex-husband\u2019s ring on a necklace. \u201cI liked his because it was anonymous. It was clearly a man\u2019s. I got to wear it for a while without being told I wasn\u2019t moving on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/how-to-not-screw-up-your-divorce\">How to not screw up your divorce</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018I took my ring off, and threw it at him\u2019<br></h2> <p>Karla, an executive assistant based in Mexico City, last saw her wedding ring in a strip club. \u201cI found out my husband had gone to the strip club and I was furious. I went there immediately. I paid to get in and everything,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI found my husband in a private room with a stripper giving him a dance. I went completely mad. I grabbed his neck. The security men couldn\u2019t get me off him.<br></p> <p>\u201cOnce they did, I took my ring off, and threw it at him. And I said: \u2018I want a divorce, as soon as possible.\u2019\u201d She left and never saw the ring again.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ll just leave it alone\u2019</h2> <p>Moussa Sall, a 37-year-old retail worker based in Washington DC, still has his ring. He knows he still has it, he just can\u2019t pinpoint exactly where \u2013 and doesn\u2019t know if he wants to find it.</p> <p>Sall says his two-year marriage wasn\u2019t always easy. As an immigrant to the United States and a single father, making ends meet was a struggle, and a constant weight on his shoulders.</p> <p>His own wedding ring wasn\u2019t worth much, he says. It can\u2019t have cost him more than $100. \u201cI wanted to save all the money I could to buy her a nice ring,\u201d Sall says. \u201cI wanted to spend money on her, not on me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sall says he has processed the end of his marriage, but he associates it with a tough time. To him, there appears to be no good reason to do anything with the ring. \u201cI feel funny about it. It feels very confusing. So I will just leave it there.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m going to melt it down\u2019</h2> <p>Argentina Racco, a 37-year-old high school teacher based in Toronto, keeps her wedding and engagement rings in her nightstand drawer.</p> <p>For the first year after her divorce, she says she didn\u2019t know what to do with them. Every now and then, she would take a ring out and try putting it on a less meaningful finger. But it never felt right.</p> <p>Now she has a plan for them. </p> <p>\u201cI have decided I am going to melt the gold and have something cute made for myself, like a charm or a necklace,\u201d Racco says.</p> <p>The diamond on her engagement ring, however, she plans to sell. \u201cWhen I look at it, it reminds me of him, my ex-husband, and I don\u2019t want that.

  "<p>An Olympic silver medallist from Ethiopia is seeking asylum overseas after making a gesture of protest as he crossed the finishing line in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/eliud-kipchoge-callum-hawkins-feyisa-lilesa-olympic-marathon\">men\u2019s marathon in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people watched Feyisa Lilesa hold his arms over his head, wrists crossed, in support of members of his Oromo tribe in the east African nation.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a very dangerous situation for the Oromo people in Ethiopia. In nine months more than 1,000 people died in protests,\u201d Lilesa told reporters after the race.</p> <p>The runner <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFRt1Aaml_w\">said he now feared detention or death</a> if he returned home. </p> <p>\u201cThey will kill me.

Authorities have been repeatedly accused of human rights abuses and of discrimination against the Oromo, the country\u2019s largest ethnic group, comprising about 25% of the country\u2019s 100m population.</p> <p>Plans to allocate land surrounding the capital, Addis Ababa, for development prompted fierce demonstrations from members of the tribe in November. Many of those who would have been displaced by the new scheme were Oromo.</p> <p>Authorities scrapped the scheme in January, but protests spread and continued for months, in the country\u2019s worst unrest in more than a decade.</p> <p>Several rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have reported that up to 400 have been killed in clashes between security forces and protesters.</p> <p>In the wake of the violence, the United Nations urged Ethiopia to allow international observers in to the worst hit parts of the country.</p> <p>\u201cOromo is my tribe ... Oromo people now protest what is right, for peace, for a place,\u201d Lilesa told reporters after winning his silver medal, adding that he feared his wife and two children might already have been arrested.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I move to another country ... you get the freedom if you support only the government.

  "<p>On Tuesday 9 August, Saddam Hussein Abdu al-Burai said goodbye to his wife, pregnant with their first child, and left home to make the 10km journey to a Yemen snack-food factory inside an industrial complex in the Alnahda district of the capital, Sana\u2019a. It was his first day at work but at 9.30am, barely two hours after he had begun manually counting the potato bags inside the steel girder compound, a Saudi-led airstrike began.</p> <p>Burai was killed on the spot along with six other men and three women. The attack on the potato crisp factory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/saudi-led-airstrikes-yemen-food-factory-kill-people\">came during the first airstrike</a> by the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels since the collapse of UN-brokered peace talks earlier this month. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0e3087c2fed2ea35f558a96c4faec39f160627\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0e3087c2fed2ea35f558a96c4faec39f160627/0_93_4707_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers clean up after a hospital operated by MSF in Abs was hit by a Saudi-led airstrike.

Houthi fighters, belonging to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, are allied with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and control Sana\u2019a and vast swaths of territory in western Yemen. </p> <p>The Saudi coalition has been criticised by the UN and human rights groups for airstrikes that hit civilian targets. In the case of the blast that killed Burai, a Houthi-controlled military maintenance camp was located approximately 20 metres south of the crisp factory, separated by two large walls. The airstrikes, instead of hitting the military camp, struck the middle of the factory, where about 60 people were working the morning shift.</p> <p>Abdulrahman Saleh Abdu Salah, a 26-year-old electrician, was charging his mobile phone in the manager\u2019s office when a huge blast rocked the building. He was one of the lucky ones. \u201cSuddenly we heard a massive explosion and everything started to fall on us, even the wall fell on us,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI stood up and went back to the factory, I saw everyone was scattered on the floor and some people were killed on the spot because of shrapnel and the place started to burn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw one of my colleagues near the machine I was fixing and he was jumping and shouting out in pain \u2013 he was the only one I could help and I took him outside. Minutes later the whole place was on fire and people were killed and their bodies were burned.\u201d</p> <p>Salah said he thanked God that he survived the attack, which left many of his friends dead. His best friend, Mostafa Aqeel, was among 13 workers injured and is still in hospital. Five are in intensive care and one is in a coma. Salah said he did not understand why the Saudi-led coalition targeted civilians. </p> <p>\u201cWhy did they target us?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a snack-food factory. No weapons, no bombs, no fighters are inside. Only men and women workers.\u201d The factory, which was established in 1985, has now closed down. <br></p> <p>Both sides in the conflict have since escalated their attacks, with a recent airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">hitting a hospital supported by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> in the Abs district of Hajjah governorate, in north-west Yemen. That attack, the fourth against an MSF facility in less than a year, killed at least 11 including an MSF staff member. It prompted MSF to announce earlier this week that it would withdraw from six hospitals in northern Yemen. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c01e21c2bacb7bb5b338a55d2d26c11276372ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c01e21c2bacb7bb5b338a55d2d26c11276372ca1/0_154_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People inspect the damage in a room at an hospital operated by the the Paris-based aid agency, Doctors Without Borders in Abs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People inspect the damage in a room at an hospital operated by the the Paris-based aid agency, Doctors Without Borders in Abs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Houthis have retaliated by firing missiles across the border, which has also resulted in civilian deaths. </p> <p>Juan Prieto, MSF Yemen\u2019s head of mission, said it has become difficult to operate in Yemen. He condemned the attacks on the hospitals and said he did not understand why they kept happening. The coalition has accused Houthis of hiding military equipment and personnel in public places such as schools and hospitals. A recent school attack in the Haydan district in northern Saada governorate killed 10 students who were all under 15. </p> <p>\u201cIn the facilities that we have been running our services, we can guarantee that there has not been any military activity,\u201d he told the Guardian by phone from Sana\u2019a. \u201cWe have been following all the rules that [the Saudis] have set up and the attacks continue happening, we are wondering why. There is a lack of respect.\u201d</p> <p>Prieto said the situation in Yemen was deteriorating, especially people\u2019s access to food and water. \u201cThe system cannot cope with the need at all,\u201d he said. More than 6,000 people have been killed since the conflict began \u2013 half of them civilians and more than 1,100 of them children, according to the UN.</p> <p>The UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, called on both sides three times last week to end the violence. \u201cCivilians, including children, are paying the heaviest price in the ongoing conflict, as civilian infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, continue to be hit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Maha Nagi, a 30-year-old based in Sana\u2019a who works in the humanitarian field, said most people had lost their jobs and had difficulty coping with the basic cost of living, while others had been displaced and struggled to find a place to sleep. She said that since the collapse of the peace talks there have been five to 10 airstrikes in Sana\u2019a and its vicinity every day. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ddf291cb7084990340dec3eee90bd377ce17c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ddf291cb7084990340dec3eee90bd377ce17c2a/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child who was wounded during a reported Saudi-led coalition air strike on a Koranic school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child who was wounded during a reported Saudi-led coalition air strike on a Koranic school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat is new this time is that they are not only targeting military places but they also hit family houses,\u201d she said. \u201cI blame all parties because they only care about victory and defeating others to win more power and I blame Saudi Arabia for intervening and making it worse. They target every place in Yemen and are killing innocent people. They don\u2019t make exceptions, they target even schools and hospitals.\u201d Twitter users have been using #NotATarget to highlight attacks on civilian places.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really catastrophic situation in Yemen. We want to be safe and not be killed by Saudi jets,\u201d Nagi said. She said healthcare was bad and there was no public electricity in Sana\u2019a. \u201cYou can either use a generator or solar power.\u201d</p> <p>Sana\u2019a-based political analyst Hisham Al-Omeisy said airstrikes in recent weeks had become more indiscriminate. He said that while the Houthis were \u201cguilty of hijacking and mismanaging the state\u201d, it was the Saudi-led coalition that had \u201cheld the whole nation hostage to the current conflict and [had] been collectively and indiscriminately punishing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Saudi-led coalition imposing a commercial blockade was not only devastating, it was catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no winning this war militarily. The Operation Decisive Storm, which was presumed would take weeks, is now a 16-month-old protracted conflict. Yemen is on a fast lane to disintegrating as a state, and when Aqap [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula] and Islamic State are actively expanding footholds in the growing ungoverned areas, soon we\u2019ll see a Syria scenario on steroids.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed Abdullah Hashem Jahaf, 27-year-old graphic designer, took his wife and son out of the country in the first months of the conflict, but has returned many times. \u201cI stayed alone trying to understand what\u2019s going on in my country. I lost many people in my family and friends in this war. Even I can\u2019t count how many exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days the situation has returned to the early days of the war, fighting and constant shelling in several areas, no airports, no ports and no electricity \u2026 The future in Yemen is unknown but I am afraid it will be a scary and dangerous future, not only for Yemen, but the whole of the area.\u201d</p> <p>Ibrahim Abdulkareem lost his 11-month-old daughter, Zainab, when an airstrike hit his house in Western Al-Jeraf in Al-Thawra district more than a year ago. His wife and son sustained injuries but survived.</p> <p>A year on, their life has changed beyond all recognition. \u201cLife has become very difficult \u2013 no home, no money, no furniture. I\u2019m homeless \u2013 I go from one home to another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for someone to accept this situation; rather, my sorrow and longing for her increases. Zainab was my smile, my life, and my blessing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is two months since British voters surprised themselves by deciding to end the UK\u2019s 43-year relationship with the European Union \u2013 \u201cindependence day\u201d to some and \u201cthe worst political decision since 1945\u201d to others. </p> <p>As stunned political leaderships on both sides of the Channel continue dithering about what to do next, it is worth looking back at the origins of a crisis the EU elite had not expected.</p> <p>1) It may have started with Harold Macmillan\u2019s father taking the future prime minister to watch Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee parade in 1897. Aged just three, Macmillan was very impressed by its splendour, but years later he would tell audiences that the pomp and power had been \u201call an illusion\u201d. Two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in both) and the Great Depression put paid to it. The answer was a Europe that replaced old enmities with cooperation, he decided. But in 1955 Anthony Eden was PM and clung to old illusions. His government sent no minister \u2013 only a middling trade official named Russell Bretherton \u2013 to the summit in Messina, Italy, that led to the 1957 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome\">Treaty of Rome</a>. Britain missed the boat. The French president, Charles de Gaulle, regarded Britain as an American Trojan horse and vetoed Macmillan\u2019s first bid to join in 1963 and Harold Wilson\u2019s in 1967.</p> <p>2) After De Gaulle\u2019s retirement, Ted Heath achieved entry for Britain on 1 January 1973, splitting both the Labour and Tory parties in the process. Key policies such as fishing and farming had not been designed to meet UK needs, and some people were worried about pooling aspects of sovereignty with the \u201cCommon Market\u201d six. They were now nine, as Ireland and Denmark joined too, but Norwegians voted against membership. Heath was a hopeless salesman. When he lost power in 1974, Labour\u2019s Wilson embraced Tony Benn\u2019s idea of a referendum to legitimise British membership. With most of Fleet Street and the new Tory leader, Margaret Thatcher, on his side, Wilson won heavily by a margin of two to one against a coalition of rightwing Tories, Bennites and much of the Labour movement. Union leaders saw the economically booming Europe as a capitalist plot.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> 3) The Common Market evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union#Enlargement\">membership expanded</a>, taking in former dictatorships Spain, Greece and Portugal in the 1980s, neutrals and ex-Soviet bloc countries after the end of the cold war. It would be 28 in all when Croatia joined in 2013. To keep growing, Europe needed to reduce tariff barriers and in 1986 signed the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act\">Single European Act</a> (SEA), which committed members to free movement of goods, capital, services and people in a \u201csingle market\u201d by 1992. Acknowledging emerging fears of a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d, the SEA also gave the elected European parliament greater powers. But it also replaced national vetoes with qualified majority voting on many decisions in the EEC\u2019s council of ministers. Denmark\u2019s parliament rejected the SEA, but it was endorsed by a referendum, as it was in Ireland. An opponent of referendums, Thatcher did not hold a British referendum and only later regretted that she had been deceived by the \u201cfederalist conveyor belt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcadfb6850f40cd0ceb32b49413293fa31fdbfb/387_132_1624_974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher made her Bruges speech in 1988 opposing economic and political union</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>4) The next signpost on the road to what EU integrationists hoped would be \u201cever closer union\u201d was to set up a single currency. By now Thatcher was vocally against such a move and in 1988 made her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Bruges speech</a> opposing economic and political union, but backing cooperation between nation states. (It was not meant as a Brexit speech, aides would stress in 2016). Meanwhile Labour\u2019s modernisers, led by Neil Kinnock, had reversed the party\u2019s opposition to EU membership. They had been wooed by the vision of a high-wage workers\u2019 Europe promoted by Jacques Delors, the visionary French socialist who was president of the powerful Brussels bureaucracy, the European commission. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened up the prospect of German reunification, the French insisted on a currency union to tie an ever more dominant Germany to the EU project. Britain wanted the project to be \u201cbroader, not deeper\u201d by expanding eastwards. Both policies were implemented; both would later have fateful consequences.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>5) As Thatcher\u2019s power weakened she quarrelled with key allies such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson over Europe. But her new chancellor, John Major, persuaded her to link sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at what some feared was too high a rate for British industry. When Thatcher fell, Major took over and negotiated British opt-outs from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty\">Maastricht treaty</a> (1992), which reorganised the EU and set timetables and rules for a single currency zone and for the no-passport Schengen zone. As part of Major\u2019s \u201cvariable geometry\u201d strategy for a two-speed Europe, Britain was also allowed not to join the \u201csocial chapter\u201d covering workers\u2019 rights. Denmark needed two referendums before signing; France\u2019s was only narrowly carried. Major won the 1992 election, but opposition to Europe crystallised at this time into demands for an in/out referendum on UK membership. The sterling crisis of September 1992 forced Britain out of the ERM. The economy recovered, but not Major\u2019s reputation. What became Ukip was founded and Major\u2019s government was hobbled by backbench \u201cEurosceptic\u201d rebellions, billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum_Party\">Referendum party</a> and Thatcher\u2019s criticisms. BSE (\u201cmad cow disease\u201d) turned into an ugly beef war with Europe.</p> <p>6) Major\u2019s EU problems helped Tony Blair pile up a 179-seat majority in 1997 as the most pro-European PM since Heath. Labour talked a positive game on Europe, but Fleet Street had moved against it in line with rightwing public opinion, and Blair never dared expend much political capital making the positive case for Europe. Instead his turf war with Gordon Brown ensured that the chancellor imposed a near-impossible \u201cfive tests\u201d of the British national interest before he would consent to sterling joining the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\">euro</a>, whose coins and notes were launched in 2002. Labour joined the \u201csocial chapter\u201d that Major had blocked, but fell out with most of its EU partners over UK support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. The French were denounced as \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d.</p> <p>7) Serious strategic mistakes were then made on both sides of the Channel. Labour decided not to impose transitional restrictions on the free movement of workers when mostly former Soviet bloc states known as the A10 joined the EU on 1 May 2004, unaware that France and Germany would do so. Instead of the estimated 13,000 annual arrivals expected, mostly from Poland, more than a million came in the years that followed. It allowed Ukip to capitalise on fears of wage competition, pressure on social services and cultural resentment in many areas, pushing the Tories to the right. Labour failed to respond to fears shared by many of its supporters. Tony Blair promised a referendum on the EU \u201cconstitution\u201d but ducked it when French and Dutch voters said no. Resentment grew when a version of the constitution became the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon\">Lisbon treaty</a> (2009).<br></p> <p>8) When the global banking crisis began in mid-2007, initially in France and Britain, it was blamed by many in Brussels on irresponsible \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d speculative banking. But US and British central bankers proved much more nimble in restructuring and bailing out troubled banks than the EU did at both national and eurozone level. At Germany\u2019s insistence, a tough line was taken against eurozone states, notably Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal \u2013 \u201cperipheral\u201d economies that had borrowed heavily on the new currency\u2019s credibility to launch unsustainable booms. The subsequent austerity regime crippled Greece and killed growth elsewhere. Free to devalue and with flexible labour laws, Britain was able to navigate the crisis more adroitly. Badly hit by the rising economic power of Asia, the eurozone looked less like an engine of growth than one of stagnation, and some of its banks a submerged problem that leaders tried to ignore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d038a7941534fef2018f6dfffc70b1a4fd9f915/0_228_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron hoped he could sell the economic case for continued EU membership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>9) David Cameron had won the Tory leadership in 2005 by outflanking his main rival, David Davis, over Europe, promising to quit the main conservative group of MEPs. After becoming prime minister in 2010 he talked tough, but Eurosceptic colleagues never trusted him and used his appeasement tactics to demand more. Despite investing less effort and manpower at the Brussels negotiating table, Britain was winning key battles, its language had now replaced French, its approach to law and free trade gained ground and it was outside the floundering eurozone and Schengen\u2019s border free-for-all. It was already half out. But that was not enough for critics. Ahead of the 2015 election Cameron promised an in/out referendum after a \u201crenegotiation\u201d (the tactic Wilson had used in 1975), probably expecting Nick Clegg to veto it again in a renewed coalition. Instead he won an outright majority and decided to resolve the issue early, in 2016 rather than 2017.<br></p> <p>10) Cameron\u2019s elevation of party management tactics over strategy was rapidly compounded by a perfect storm for what became known as the Brexit campaign. Tory promises to reduce net immigration from about 300,000 to below 100,000 repeatedly failed, weaponising the \u201cTake Back Control\u201d slogan. Middle East wars (in which British action and inaction made things worse) compounded the economic and asylum migration flow. The spread of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism into Europe added fresh fears to the mix. The eurozone was easily portrayed as a basket case in which failed EU policies were stirring up the very extremism the union had been devised to prevent. Yet the cross-party remain camp\u2019s lacklustre campaign clung to the economic case for membership, revealing an arrogant metropolitan disdain for voters\u2019 fears on immigration in less prosperous regions. </p> <p>Cameron thought he could keep the wavering Boris Johnson onside. Instead the London mayor became leave\u2019s biggest campaign draw, willing to deploy some of its most unscrupulous claims about migration (\u201cTurkey is joining the EU\u201d) and budget savings (\u201c\u00a3350m a week for the NHS\u201d). Cameron had also banked on strong Labour backing. But the official opposition had elected Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-European, as its leader. He declared for Europe, but millions barely noticed his feeble contribution. Nor did they believe remain\u2019s warnings of the dangers of a leave vote, some too crude to impress anyone, some from foreign VIPs like Barack Obama.

  "<p>After a century of shooing away hunters, tending to trails and helping visitors enjoy the wonder of the natural world, the guardians of America\u2019s most treasured places have been handed an almost unimaginable new job \u2013 slowing the all-out assault climate change is waging against national parks across the nation.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">National Parks Service</a> (NPS) has charted the loss of glaciers, sea level rise and increase in wildfires spurred by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threat to US heritage across the 412 national parks and monuments has become starkly apparent.</p> <p>As the National Parks Service turns 100 this week, their efforts to chart and stem the threat to the country\u2019s history faces a daunting task. America\u2019s grand symbols and painstakingly preserved archaeological sites are at risk of being winnowed away by the crashing waves, wildfires and erosion triggered by warming temperatures. </p> <p>The Statue of Liberty is at \u201c<a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/883/\">high exposure</a>\u201d risk from increasingly punishing storms. A national monument dedicated to abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who will be enshrined on a new $20 note, <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/National-Landmarks-at-Risk-Full-Report.pdf\">could be eaten away by rising tides</a> in Maryland. The land once walked by Pocahontas and Captain John Smith in Jamestown, the first English settlement in the US, is surrounded by waters rising at twice the global average and <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/National-Landmarks-at-Risk-Full-Report.pdf\">may be beyond rescue</a>. </p> <p>These threats are the latest in a pile of identified calamities to befall national parks and monuments due to climate change. Receding ice, extreme heat and acidifying oceans are morphing America\u2019s landscapes and coasts at a faster pace than at any time in human history.<br> </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/governors-island-remodelled-climate-change-new-york\">New York's remodelled Governors Island has built-in climate change defense</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYosemite\u2019s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone,\u201d fretted Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/yosemite-obama-national-parks-climate-change\">during a visit to the vast park in June</a>. </p> <p>\u201cRising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park. </p> <p>\u201cRising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That\u2019s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>Change, however, is inevitable no matter how quickly greenhouse gas emissions are cut. An NPS <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101302\">study from 2014</a> found four in five of America\u2019s national parks are now at the \u201cextreme end\u201d of temperature variables charted since 1901. </p> <p>\u201cWe are starting to see things spiral away now,\u201d said Gregor Schuurman, an ecologist at the NPS climate change response program. \u201cWe are going to look back at this time and actually think it was a calm period. And then people will start asking questions about what we were doing about the situation.\u201d</p> <h2>Alaska: the front line</h2> <p>There is now a broad new push to work out exactly what heritage is at risk and how to best to react.</p> <p>If there is a front line, it\u2019s probably found in Alaska. The state has 24 national parks, including Denali, the largest protected park in the US at 6m acres. It is also part of the Arctic, the fastest warming region on Earth. </p> <p>Permafrost, which currently sits underneath 80% of Alaska, is beginning to melt, causing sinkholes and landslides. The north-west coast is being chewed away by almost 150ft a year in places due to sea level rise aided by wind erosion from more intense storms. Wildfires are increasing, with a lack of snow cover allowing the flames to lick areas that haven\u2019t burned in almost 5,000 years.</p> <p>These trends imperil treasures such as those found in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cakr/index.htm\">Cape Krusenstern national monument</a> on the north-west coast. It has extensive evidence of human habitation stretching back 9,000 years. The NPS is scrambling to survey the area as inundations are wiping away this heritage, often before archaeologists can document it.</p> <p>Dael Devenport, an NPS archaeologist based in Anchorage, takes regular helicopter trips to survey the 70-mile coast of the park. There are groups of abandoned houses claimed by the sea and wind, containing items such as lamps, stone tools and ulus \u2013 a type of half moon-shaped knife used to skin seals and caribou. The Inupiat people who live in the region have retreated from this part of the coast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b6a809b58e7a19808d65b7355e13cf8b5ab3a628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6a809b58e7a19808d65b7355e13cf8b5ab3a628/0_0_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remote Cape Krusenstern national monument, on the northwestern coast of Alaska, is being claimed by sea and wind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remote Cape Krusenstern national monument, on the northwestern coast of Alaska, is being claimed by sea and wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danita Delimont/Getty Images/Gallo Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of these sites haven\u2019t been surveyed properly, we are trying to figure out which are most vulnerable and mitigate against that,\u201d Devenport said. \u201cYou can see houses that are washing away, if you walk along the coast you see the profile of houses.</p> <p>\u201cMost people haven\u2019t thought about how climate change affects archeological sites. A site is a snapshot in time, it\u2019s not like we can pick it up and move it somewhere else. We are in danger of losing a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by rampant looting of artifacts. A recent survey found almost all of a former settlement of the Thule culture, ancestors of today\u2019s Inuit, had been disturbed and stripped of items such as harpoon tips and figurines carved from walrus ivory. As permafrost melts and walls are washed away, more treasures are revealed to opportunists. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Devenport acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s probably done by people from local communities who know where the sites are. They can sell items onto dealers, who can get about $50,000 for a figurine from a buyer in Japan. </p> <p>\u201cWhen that artifact has been pulled out from the ground and not documented, we lose all of that information. You\u2019ve lost the whole story behind that item and how it was used.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The longer we wait, the more we lose\u2019</h2> <p>Further south, in the lower 48 states, a different heritage is at risk. Changing rainfall patterns are affecting a number of parks in the south-west. Extreme rain events caused two major wall collapses in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/indian/2006/park.htm\">historic structures</a> at Tumac\u00e1cori national historical park in southern Arizona.</p> <p>The structures, built by Spanish missionaries more than 300 years ago, are made from adobe, a type of sun-dried clay. The NPS already devotes 2,500 hours a year to maintain these buildings. However climate change is placing a further strain on this heritage.</p> <p>\u201cFor the more vulnerable sites, particularly adobe structures which seem to be the canaries in the coal mine in the south-western US, losses are already rapidly occurring,\u201d said the NPS\u2019 Lauren Meyer, who is heading new research into the issue. </p> <p>Meyer said there is a \u201cgreat urgency\u201d to intervene and save cultural sites at risk from a rapidly warming planet. \u201cThe longer we wait to act, the more history we lose,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Conservationists complain about a lack of funding to identify and preserve at-risk sites, but even if these locations could all be propped up and artifacts protected, the changes to the wider ecosystems march on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Climate change is set to alter American forests as much \u200bas the arrival of white settlers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Temperature increases vary slightly according to park (the Grand Canyon has warmed on average by 2.4F since 1916, while the Everglades has heated up by 1.5F) \u2013 but the trend is inexorably upwards.</p> <p>This warming is influencing a complex web of processes in national parks. As John Muir, considered the father of US national parks, put it: \u201cTug on anything at all and you\u2019ll find it connected to everything else in the universe.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change is set to <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/NationalParksClimate/?src=features-hp&amp;eocn=home&amp;eoci=feature\">alter American forests</a> as much as the arrival of white settlers did. The fire season is expanding dramatically. Some species are suffering, such as the native birds of Hawaii targeted by invasive mosquitos, which are able to survive in higher elevations as the forest habitat warms. </p> <p>The remaining 65 groves of huge sequoia trees in California, among the largest living things on the planet, could be decimated by a warmer, drier climate. High-elevation species, such as red spruce and balsam fir, could be pushed off the mountains. The tree that gives Joshua Tree national park its name <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/no_more_joshua_trees/\">may not be able to adapt</a>.</p> <p>Such changes cascade through the food chain. The grizzly bears of Yellowstone like to feast on the cone seeds of the white bark pine, a species under attack from the mountain pine beetle. If warmer winters fail to kill off the beetle, the bears will have to find another food source, impacting other species. A lack of snow for denning will affect bears and wolves; warming river waters will force out the salmon.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict exactly what will happen but some systems have been pushed over the threshold, certainly,\u201d said Schuurman. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to recognize that climate change is ongoing and we can only expect the impacts will get stronger time goes on. I tell park managers that whether they are thinking about climate change every day or not, it is likely to find you and tap you on the shoulder. We should take heed of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"766e5207a27b24810a209fb159b88b76e2b336a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766e5207a27b24810a209fb159b88b76e2b336a3/0_112_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The number of glaciers in Glacier national park, Montana, has halved since 1968 due to rising temperatures.

Last year was a record, with 305 million visitors to national parks. But Sally Jewell, secretary of the interior, recently warned that a lack of funding to deal with the \u201cexistential\u201d threat of climate change, along with unchecked development, will lead to ruin.</p> <p>Jewell said that current trends mean that the next century will mean \u201cnational parks and wildlife refuges will be like postage stamps of nature on a map. Isolated islands of conservation with run-down facilities that crowds of Americans visit like zoos to catch a glimpse of our nation\u2019s remaining wildlife and undeveloped patches of land.\u201d</p> <p>Some national parks are already looking at how to respond to this potentially diminished future. Parks in the south, for example, may offer nighttime activities such as star gazing or bat-spotting. </p> <p>Visitation could actually jump by nearly 25% in 2060 as it warms, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/climatechange/upload/NPS_visitation_climate_brief.pdf\">according to one forecast</a>.The summer months may become too hot for visitors to parks in the southwest.</p> <p>Either way, it will be hard to hide that a trip to the Rocky Mountains in Montana to see Glacier national park won\u2019t involve seeing any actual glaciers.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that will be a visible and dramatic change,\u201d said Schuurman. \u201cWithout being blas\u00e9 in any way, people are adaptable and Glacier national park without its glaciers will still be a stunningly beautiful place. That said, I think anyone would look back and be sad about the loss.\u201d</p> <h2>The effects of climate change</h2> <p><strong>Temperature rise</strong></p> <p>Temperatures across US national parks have risen by about 2.4F in the past century. </p> <p><strong>Disappearing snow and ice </strong></p> <p>The number of glaciers at Glacier national park has halved since 1968. All of the park\u2019s glaciers are on course to completely disappear by the middle of the century.</p> <p><strong>Sea level rise</strong></p> <p>Approximately 40 protected sites are at risk from a 1m sea level rise, with an NPS <a href=\"http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/coastal/coastal_assets_report/executive_summary.pdf\">analysis</a> calling it \u201cone of the most obvious and most challenging impacts\u201d of global warming. The Everglades could become inundated with salt water, with the ecosystem overwhelmed by invasive species drawn to its changed environment. More powerful storms could endanger the Statue of Liberty, which closed for nine months after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. </p> <p><strong>Wildfire</strong></p> <p>The wildfire season in the west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/wildfires-california-fueled-by-climate-change\">is far lengthier</a> than it was in the 1970s.

Nothing summed up the crazy, wonderful, chaos of Rio and these Games more than the sight of some 200 journalists storming the front of the station. Realising they were overwhelmed the police quickly announced they were moving the press conference to the lobby of a theatre across the street. A police banner was quickly dangled over a sign that read \u201cFree Territory of Democracy\u201d, a table was pulled up, chairs shoved behind it, the reporters wedged into every available space including windows, up a staircase and seated on the floor until it looked less like a press conference and more like a sit-in.

  "<p>There is something about corn and warm days that sits just right. Every single summer holiday I have been on has memories of corn: maybe I seek it out. Crunched straight off the cob, bathed in lime and butter, eaten with sandy feet on the beaches of Indonesia. Little plastic cups piled with <a href=\"http://www.yummly.com/recipe/Mexican-street-corn-_elotes_-370469?prm-v1\"><em>elote</em> corn</a>, trimmed from its kernels, topped with sour cream, mayonnaise, cayenne and a squeeze of lemon from stands that line Mexican beaches and roadsides, and tamales \u2013 little patties of fluffy cornmeal wrapped in their husks and steamed over fires on the Native American reservations of Arizona. There is something about the sweet pop of a kernel of corn that makes it OK to eat when its searingly hot, when almost nothing else (apart from an ice-cream or an ice-cold coconut) will do.</p> <p>Here in the UK, we are eating record amounts of it \u2013 4 million cobs a week in the summer of 2014 apparently \u2013 and here, too, there seems to be a rule that when its hot outside we reach for the corn. The first of the English corn arrived only a few weeks ago. It\u2019s so good that I have had it for dinner at least twice a week and will again tonight. In my local greengrocer, six fat cobs still in their husks cost just \u00a31: try to find me a cheaper dinner.</p> <p>The first, freshest corn I treat with restraint, just like the first asparagus: I cook them simply with little fuss and flavour; just a good dousing of sea salt and butter. The first heads have their green, papery husks peeled away and the cobs simply plunged into boiling water in my biggest pot. I use a lid from a smaller pan to weigh them down and stop them bobbing, so they cook evenly. I don\u2019t add salt when cooking, as it\u2019s said to toughen up the kernels, but I add it generously after to offset the sweetness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/15/summer-vegetable-tarts-recipes-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">Anna Jones\u2019 recipes for two summer vegetable tarts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the weeks draw on and the corn nears the end of its run, I look for more ways to use my six cobs for \u00a31. This week, I took my cobs to south India, with a dousing of spice and ghee and a fresh green herb and coconut chutney. My favourite combinations are mapped out below.</p> <p>Often a corn soup finds its way to the stove, or a chowder with some potato and musky smoked paprika, or a green, coriander-heavy Mexican soup (more of that in a couple of weeks).</p> <p>I make quick curries from quickly shaved ears of corn, with chilli, cumin seeds and toasted coconut and serve it piled next to chapatis with a spoonful of mango, thick cooling yoghurt and a few wedges of lime. I mix some freshly sheared kernels with a couple of eggs, a spoonful of flour and some cottage cheese and \u2013 corn\u2019s favourite flavour match \u2013 chilli, then fry spoonfuls into little fritters, eaten at breakfast with some mashed avocado, or at tea with some salad.</p> <p>Then there is cornmeal, the mainstay of cooking in Central America. Polenta recipes we\u2019ll leave for the winter, but one thing I often make with cornmeal is cornbread. This one I make on repeat, dotted with little tomatoes and eaten with avocado-and chilli-spiked black beans for a summer breakfast or brunch \u2013 but it has enough flavour to stand up on its own.</p> <p>Sweetcorn loses its sweetness by the hour. The quicker you can get it into the pot, or on to the grill, the better. Success depends more on shopping than cooking. If you find the corn still in its husk, make sure the husks are green and supple, not dry and pale, and that the corn underneath feels plump and full. Avoid the overly sweet varieties at the supermarket, which are, in my opinion, sweeter than necessary \u2013 and I have a very sweet tooth.</p> <h2><strong>Traffic-light tomato cornbread brunch (pictured above)<br></strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 6 </strong><br>150g cornmeal or polenta <br>A pinch of salt<br>1\u00bd tsp baking powder<br>1 tsp runny honey <br>A good pinch of ground cumin<br>A good pinch of hot smoked paprika<br>150ml milk<br>100ml natural yoghurt<br>\u00bd a bunch of fresh coriander<br>\u00bd a bunch of fresh basil<br>Olive oil<br>Zest and juice from 1 unwaxed lime <br>1 egg, beaten<br>2 ears of corn, husks removed<br>1 fresh green chilli, trimmed and sliced<br>400g ripe small or cherry tomatoes, halved<br>2 avocados</p> <p><strong> For the beans</strong><br>2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped <br>2 x 400g tins black beans with liquid<br>A pinch of cinnamon</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

For example, some <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/leading-scientists-explain-how-climate-change-is-worsening-californias-epic-drought-476ceae51a6d#.3pie25ln6\">research has suggested a possible connection</a> between the Arctic sea ice decline and the intensity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/dec/08/california-just-had-its-worst-drought-in-over-1200-years\">California\u2019s recent record drought</a> (although the connection is not definitive). Those record drought conditions in turn contributed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/blue-cut-fire-growth-climate-change-california-wildfires\">the intense wildfires currently raging across California</a>. Other research has suggested<a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/closer-look-at-arctic-sea-ice-melt-and-extreme-weather-15013\"> possible connections between disappearing Arctic sea ice and extreme weather events</a>, but again, these connections aren\u2019t yet definitive.<em><br></em></p> <p>The loss of ice causes what scientists call a feedback effect. Ice is highly reflective, while the ocean beneath is dark. When the ice on the ocean surface melts, the Arctic becomes less reflective and absorbs more sunlight, causing it to warm faster, melting more ice, causing more warming, and so on. This feedback is <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81214\">one of the main reasons</a> why the Arctic is Earth\u2019s fastest-warming region, with temperatures rising about twice as fast as in lower latitudes.<em> </em><br></p> <p>Swedish scientist <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=81214\">Svante Arrhenius predicted this Arctic amplification effect in 1896</a>.<em> </em>As a result, the Arctic is effectively the \u2018canary in the coal mine\u2019 of the Earth\u2019s climate, showing us the dramatic effects human-caused global warming can have on the climate system. The signal is clear, but the question remains whether we\u2019ll take action, or stay in the coal mine.<br></p>",

This case is a clear reflection of what we\u2019re trying to change with the new system, but these cases are still happening,\u201d Aguilar said.</p> <p>Under the new legislation, prisoners like Morales who were remanded under the old system are entitled to have their preventive imprisonment reviewed. <br></p> <p>But the judge has so far refused, according to Morales\u2019s lawyer, Rodolfo Moreno. \u201cThe judge is being very rigid and has rejected every appeal and effort to resolve this absurd case \u2013 something I see time and time again with indigenous defendants,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since international human rights standards were incorporated into the Mexico constitution in 2011, judges are supposed to remand suspects only in the most serious circumstances, such as when there is a risk of flight or violence.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to also take a step back from the judge and wonder why, when we have such big problems with organised crime and other important cases, that the public prosecutors think it\u2019s worth putting resources into a case like this,\u201d said Aguilar.</p> <p>The alleged crime was committed in 2012, when Morales \u2013 a car mechanic and member of the local council \u2013 was clearing a plot of land where he grows maize and beans. </p> <p>Court documents show that another family member admitted shooting the rabbits to police and paid a cash bond at the court, pending trial. But the case did not proceed, and was forgotten by the family.</p> <p>More than three years later, Morales was arrested in the municipal government offices where he was serving as the public security councillor. </p> <p>His relative\u2019s admission of guilt was rejected by the judge, who is also demanding that Morales prove his ethnicity by appointing an anthropologist as an expert witness. </p> <p>\u201cEven if he had killed the rabbits, this is completely disproportionate. It could take another year to meet the judge\u2019s demands, which is expensive and will cause even more damage to the whole family,\u201d said Moreno.</p> <p>Morales\u2019s 22-year-old son, also called Heliodoro, is studying law, but he finds the case against his father incomprehensible. </p> <p>\u201cMy dad has worked hard his whole life to give us opportunities he never had.

  "<p>It\u2019s two months since Britain\u2019s worst foreign policy blunder of the modern era and it still rankles. The vote to take us out of the European Union was not about economics, less still diplomacy; it&#xa0;was a collective act of myopia, distrust, arrogance and fury. It was about emotions, negative ones; and behaviour is something that economists struggle to capture.</p> <p>Joseph Stiglitz does better than most. For years the former chief economist at the World Bank and adviser to President Clinton has been inveighing against the rise in inequality and unaccountable elites. In his latest book, he returns to one of his pet hates, the single currency project of the Brussels establishment, and sets about disembowelling it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stiglitz is contemptuous of the advocates of austerity within a single currency straitjacket</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Flawed at birth in the 1990s, the euro is the story of platitudes \u201cuttered by politicians unschooled in economics who create their own reality\u201d. Its architects, or rather Argonauts, laboured under the misapprehension that economic integration would beget political integration, and strong economic growth shared by all. They&#xa0;did not take into account the diversity of the continent, nor did they&#xa0;build mechanisms that would withstand shocks.</p> <p>The flaws in the currency came to a head after the banking crash of 2007-08. The currency, he notes, was not the innocent victim of a crisis created elsewhere. \u201cMarkets, ever prone to irrational exuberance and pessimism, mistakenly and irrationally presumed that the elimination of exchange risk\u2026 meant the elimination of sovereign risk \u2013 the risk that a government could not pay back what it owed.\u201d While the bankers and the super-rich were bailed out, and have seen their share of GDP increase yet further, so the rest have either stagnated or suffered real-term declines from already low wages. With youth unemployment stubbornly high, an entire generation has been sacrificed. If we don\u2019t act, the author says, we will not be talking about a lost decade, but a lost quarter of a century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/joseph-stiglitz-the-problem-with-europe-is-the-euro\">Joseph Stiglitz: The problem with Europe is the euro</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stiglitz is contemptuous of the advocates of austerity within a single currency straitjacket. Jean-Claude Juncker, European commission president and scourge of UK Eurosceptics, is, he reminds the reader, \u201cthe proud architect of Luxembourg\u2019s massive corporate tax-avoidance schemes\u201d. As for Angela Merkel, she is trapped in a world of \u201cdeficit fetishism\u201d, as she invokes the thrifty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/angela-merkel-austerity-swabian-housewives\" title=\"\">Swabian housewife</a> who would never spend what she doesn\u2019t have safely tucked away in her pinny.</p> <p>Yet, having spent 300 pages dismantling the currency project, the author suggests it is still worth salvaging. The case he makes for a \u201cflexible euro\u201d needs more detail in order to convince. His would be a more \u201csocial Europe\u201d, with a stronger system of burden sharing, tax harmonisation, a progressive tax system and social safety net to be shared by all, and industrial policies to help those countries that are behind to catch up. To put it more crudely (in my words, not his), the Germans would have to give up a bigger chunk of their dosh. The chances of that happening in the near future are...&#xa0;zilch.</p> <p>The rights and wrongs of the single currency seem \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 a sideshow to the consequences of the referendum. In an addendum written as the book was going to the printers, Stiglitz seeks to make sense of that decision and to link it to his broader narrative.</p> <p>And yet, try as he might in the mere days he must have had to update the book, Stiglitz does not provide further insights into Britain\u2019s act of collective self-harm. He notes one of two of the Boris-isms, otherwise known as porky pies, told by the Leave campaign. There were \u201cplenty of false stories circulating\u201d, he declares, before adding: \u201cbut some were based on a grain of truth\u201d. No they weren\u2019t.</p> <p>He deals more convincingly with the consequences of the migrant flow across the continent. The countries that had done a better job of keeping unemployment low (Germany and the UK) have been the favoured ports of call, but the imbalances have had few positive effects. This influx was \u201clargely borne on the backs of ordinary workers \u2013 and among the beneficiaries were the corporations in western Europe who could obtain labour at lower cost\u201d.</p> <p>Their criticisms of Brussels may have been right and may have carried weight, yet many on the radical left failed the voters during the referendum. They refused to make the broader case for being at the heart of a European project that kept the peace, presented millions with opportunities they would otherwise not have enjoyed and gave so many people in so many countries a sense of identity that goes beyond narrow nationalism. Instead of taking on Juncker and the Eurocrats, they raised the white flag. In so doing they left the field to the agitators on the working-class estates, the blazer-wearing smug men of the shires and the tiny smattering of rightwing ideologues. As a result, the inequalities against which intellectuals such as Stiglitz so passionately rail will grow yet greater.</p> <p><em>John Kampfner is author of The Rich: From Slaves to Superyachts \u2013 A 2,000-Year History.

  "<p>It was the silence of the passengers that Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui first noticed. Usually when the humanitarian rescue boat sees a tiny dinghy bobbing about in the Mediterranean there\u2019s frantic waving and shouting. \u201cWhen our team approached in smaller boats and everyone was so quiet we realised something was wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cWe asked permission to go aboard and that\u2019s when we realised the others had been waiting for rescue for hours with dead bodies in the boat.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no school for this job, it\u2019s about passion and commitment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Twenty-two bodies were recovered <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-italy-casualties-idUSKCN1002QI\" rel=\"nofollow\">that day</a> (21 of them women) and 209 people were saved by the crew of the Aquarius, a boat run by Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) that patrols the refugee route between Libya and Italy. MSF advocacy manager Hadj-Sahraoui got an idea of how they died from the testimonies of survivors once they were safely on the Aquarius. A wooden board that had been placed along the bottom of the dinghy broke and water started to come in, mixing with leaking fuel cans. A panic ensued and the 22 people died either in a stampede or drowning in a mix of water and fuel.<br></p> <p>The people they rescued were in shock. \u201cThe priority \u2013 it\u2019s sad to say \u2013 is with the living,\u201d says Hadj-Sahraoui. \u201cSo there\u2019s a very quick medical team, trying to assess needs.\u201d Once the survivors were on the Aquarius they were each given a blanket, water and some food. The people who were soaked in fuel were sent for a shower, because the fuel and sea salt cause nasty burns. Then they registered them.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c988e09bdaf512935e3c55a2f64e7aac7a72d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c988e09bdaf512935e3c55a2f64e7aac7a72d72/0_284_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Among the people transferred from the sea watch vessel were three babies, the smallest only four months old.

She asks each person where they are from, how old they are, and if they are travelling alone. \u201cWe don\u2019t wear sunglasses, because we need to have eye contact. It\u2019s about humanity. It\u2019s big smiles saying: \u2018You\u2019re now safe. This is where you are. This is what\u2019s going to happen next.\u2019 What surprised me is how polite people are. How they take their time to say thank you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Once all the survivors were safely on board, and being tended to, the crew of the Aquarius also felt it was right on this occasion to recover the bodies of the women and one man who died. \u201cFor several hours we tried to keep the living on one side of the boat. The bodies had spent hours in the water, so we were trying to protect the living from seeing that. The doctor took pictures for identification, because families will never know what happened to their loved ones.\u201d When they reached the port in Sicily the Italian Red Cross were there, with coffins and flowers for every person who died.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe tough MSF doctors who have been going from war to war cried because of the flowers,\u201d says Hadj-Sahraoui. \u201cI was one of the suckers who cried a lot.\u201d She says that people who do humanitarian work need to learn to take care of themselves, because there\u2019s a lot of emotional burnout. MSF staff have psychological debriefings before and after they go on missions, and after extreme experiences like this one.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this type of job for a long time now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you never get used to it \u2013 that is a good thing. It gives you that drive. Now I feel we need to tell this story.\u201d She likes her job because there\u2019s a balance of on-the-ground work, seeing what refugees go through, and advocating at high levels for better treatment.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2de204cd1b58f6ed5eb27e201c0e126f10abe83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2de204cd1b58f6ed5eb27e201c0e126f10abe83/0_263_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teame Ggebremedihin, cultural mediator with MSF, gives information to a large group of people after being rescued at sea in the Mediterranean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teame Legesse Gebremedihin, cultural mediator with MSF, talks to a group of people who have been rescued.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Creta/MSF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She meets European policymakers, embassies, journalists, and directors of migrant detention centres to inform them about what she sees on the ground and to lobby for better conditions for refugees.

She also goes to international summits about migration \u2013 there\u2019s one at the UN in September 2016.<br></p> <p>As an advocacy manager, Hadj-Sahraoui\u2019s job on the boat was to interview as many people as possible, to understand what happened, and to collect testimonies that she can use in her campaigning. \u201cI collected a testimony from a woman who for the first day was just staring at the floor. Later she opened up and talked about fighting for her life, and how thankful she felt because it had been so close. And how she couldn\u2019t help a pregnant woman and she had died.\u201d<br></p> <p>Those testimonies support MSF\u2019s work campaigning for safe and legal ways for people to get to Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve had, since the beginning of the year, 3,000 die in the Mediterranean Sea trying to cross. And it\u2019s so unnecessary. I think it\u2019s important to remind people of the risks that migrants are taking in order to cross and the very high price they are paying.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some of the women Hadj-Sahraoui interviewed told her that they had been gang-raped in Libya for extended periods of time. \u201cSome European countries are considering doing a deal with Libya to send refugees back there. I do think that governments need to be made aware of these things. Really sending women back to Libya would be sending them back to hell.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hadj-Sahraoui studied law and is an expert in the Middle East. She worked for Amnesty International for 10 years before joining MSF three months ago. \u201cHaving regional or country expertise makes you very valuable for the organisation.

  "<p>Looking at the negligible returns offered on cash investments, Edward Cunningham started searching for alternatives. Instead of going to the stock market or buying up gold bars, however, the 45-year-old from Sherborne in Dorset turned to the internet, and last September invested in the digital currency bitcoin. Since then his stake has more than doubled.</p> <p>Bitcoin is a paperless, bankless, stateless currency which exists on computers, and carries with it a whiff of peril for investors. Cunningham admits to being nervous when he first signed up to trade in the currency, especially when he had to make his first deposit via a bank in Estonia. \u201cIt all turned out well and I bought my first coins for $225 each, well below today\u2019s price of around $575,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The price of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was launched in 2009. Six years ago, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoin. By 2013, each bitcoin peaked in value at $1,000.</p> <p>Coupled with these enormous peaks and troughs have been hacking controversies. Earlier this month almost 120,000 bitcoin, worth around $78m, were stolen from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, causing a 20% drop in the value of the currency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00eb9f776230a0b04e199d47de650dad79343a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00eb9f776230a0b04e199d47de650dad79343a43/45_35_398_398/398.jpg\" alt=\"Investor Edward Cunningham is confident in his bitcoin  holdings\" width=\"398\" height=\"398\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Investor Edward Cunningham is confident in his bitcoin holdings</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Cunningham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite such drops Cunningham is ahead on his investment and feels positive about the currency, which is now being used for payment by companies such as Tesla and Microsoft, and is confident his investment will grow further. So, is it time for others to follow his cryptocurrency lead?</p> <h2><strong>What exactly is bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p>Started by a small group of hackers, bitcoin is unlike traditional currencies in that it has no central bank, nation state or regulatory authority backing it up.</p> <p>The coins themselves are made by computers solving a set of complex maths problems, and people who use their computers to make coins and record transactions are called miners.</p> <p>To spend it, users buy bitcoin and transact using exchanges such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, they are all recorded on a public ledger, called the blockchain.</p> <p>Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21m of which more than 15m are in circulation, which supporters claim make it more stable than government-backed currencies that can be devalued by central banks printing money. They say this means its value will only rise over time, with some claiming the price could top $10,000 a coin. Bitcoin first came to the attention of many people after it was used on the online black market site Silk Road, known as a platform for selling illegal drugs.</p> <p>\u201cThe coins are \u2018manufactured\u2019 using cryptography, which is spooky to most people. Bitcoin is also a reasonably anonymous way to carry out large cross-border money transfers, so has inevitably become linked to illegal goods and services,\u201d says Dave Hrycyszyn, of digital agency Head, which advises companies on new technologies.</p> <p>The lack of regulation appeals to some, but also means it has none of the stability mechanisms typically associated with a currency, which can make it volatile, he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get a bitcoin debit card</p> <footer> <cite>Obi Nwosu, Coinfloor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>How do I buy it?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin is bought via online exchanges and platforms, with an increasing number of UK options. Fractions or \u201cbits\u201d can be bought instead of a whole bitcoin. Investment can start with as little as $10 on some sites. Bitcoin exchanges and brokers include <a href=\"https://coinfloor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Coinfloor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coincorner.com/\" title=\"\">CoinCorner</a> and <a href=\"https://quickbitcoin.co.uk/\" title=\"\">QuickBitcoin</a>. Transaction fees vary according to the exchange or broker, but typically range from 0.2%-1% of the currency bought, plus bank transaction charges. Fees of up to 1% can apply on sales.</p> <p>Bitcoin are stored in a \u201cdigital wallet\u201d, which can also manage transactions. It exists either in the cloud or on computers, and can be linked to bank accounts. If using an online wallet , investors must be sure they can trust the provider, because if hackers breach its server\u2019s security measures the bitcoin could be stolen.</p> <p>Typically, you can pay by bank transfer, mobile payments or with a Visa or Mastercard. There are also bitcoin ATMs, which allow for bitcoin to be exchanged for cash and vice versa, in London, Bristol, Brighton and Glasgow.</p> <h2><strong>What can you buy with it?</strong></h2> <p>A growing list of firms accept Bitcoin, including Tesla, Microsoft, CheapAir.com and Britain\u2019s first bitcoin pub, The Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, where a pint of Milton Pegasus costs \u00a33.70 or 0.0084 bitcoin.</p> <p>Obi Nwosu, managing director of Coinfloor, says you can spend it wherever you see the \u201cbitcoin accepted here\u201d sign, either online or at local stores, with no transaction charges. \u201cYou can pay using a bitcoin wallet app, and can even get bitcoin debit cards that you can use anywhere that accepts Mastercard or Visa.\u201d</p> <p>You can also cash in your coins at any time and get real currency in return, for a small broker fee, he adds.</p> <h2><strong>Should I invest in it?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin has grown strongly but with plenty of volatility along the way. Over the past 12 months its price has risen from $220 to $575, according to figures from Coindesk \u2013 a return of 161%. It has also shown resilience, with the price rallying after the Bitfinex hack. Yet it remains well below its all-time spike of $979.45, which it hit on 25 November 2013. In short, this is not a safe haven: despite excitable claims the price could hit $10,000, where it goes next is anybody\u2019s guess, so investors should approach with caution.</p> <p>Lex Deak, chief executive of alternative investment aggregator Off3r, says investing in Bitcoin isn\u2019t for the fainthearted. \u201cYou should only invest a small proportion of your money and be prepared for massive swings in value.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/bitcoin-stolen-bitfinex-exchange-hong-kong\">Bitcoin worth $78m stolen from Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The early gold rush days are over, he adds, and buyers shouldn\u2019t treat it as a get-rich-quick scheme. \u201cYou could double your money within a year, but you could easily lose it all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Marc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, a site where bitcoins can be bought, says novice investors should start modestly. \u201cJust buy a small amount to begin with, say \u00a330, to learn how it works, how to trade it, and how to handle it safely in a wallet,\u201d he says. He advises against investing large sums unless you really understand crypto currencies and computer security.</p> <p>As bitcoin has a finite supply, future price movement will depend on demand, Warne says. \u201cBitcoin will be used more in the future because it\u2019s the first time that something not fully controlled by any entity like a government or bank has been used over the internet. It has been around for about seven years now without any fundamental issues.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is it safe?</strong></h2> <p>Bitcoin cannot be hacked, manipulated or altered, but exchanges or digital wallets are vulnerable, just like online bank accounts, Warne says. \u201cIf you hold bitcoin in any form you instantly become a target,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Since bitcoin doesn\u2019t actually exist, what is stored in the wallet are the secure digital keys used to access specific details of the bitcoin. The private key is a secret code which allows the user to prove ownership of their bitcoin. Wallets can be installed on smartphones using an app or web-based wallets can be run by currency exchanges. Buyers need to make sure their computer\u2019s security is up to scratch, and must also trust the exchange, which needs high-level security to prevent hacking.</p> <p>James Hill, software developer at consultancy Scott Logic, says the core blockchain algorithm, which underpins all cryptocurrencies, remains secure. He says the real danger comes from losing the keys that prove buyers own their own coins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/bitfinex-exchange-customers-receive-36-percent-loss-tokens\">All Bitfinex clients to share 36% loss of assets following exchange hack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are hacked, there is no way of claiming a refund from a bank or regulatory authority because none exists.</p> <h2><strong>Word of warning</strong></h2> <p>Hrycyszyn warns that, as with all technology, something better may one day come along. \u201cWhen that happens, bitcoin\u2019s value could collapse to near-zero, probably in a matter of hours or minutes, in a spectacular ball of flames. It has no support structure to prop it up, like a normal currency does. Do not treat this as a long-term store of value to fund your retirement.\u201d</p> <p>Damien Fahy, founder of website MoneytotheMasses, says it will remain a fringe investment until it is officially recognised and regulated. \u201cOrdinary currency investing is risky enough, but bitcoin is even riskier.\u201d</p> <h2>BUYING AND SELLING</h2> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 1</strong> Set up a bitcoin wallet. You need somewhere to store the private keys that allow you to spend or exchange bitcoin. Security is vital, so check how your money is protected \u2013 otherwise you could lose all of it. Otherwise, this is similar to opening an ordinary bank account.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 2</strong> Get your bitcoin address. Once you have signed up and accepted the user&#xa0;agreement you will get a bitcoin address, a unique identifier of 26-35 numbers and letters, beginning with the number 1 or 3, which is the destination for a bitcoin payment.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 3</strong> Buy bitcoin. You can make your purchase through your wallet or a range of brokers and platforms. These are digital rather than physical coins. Input your bitcoin address, the amount of money you want to convert, how you plan to pay, and so on. You typically have to pay a fee of between 0.2% and 1%, depending on the site, plus a small bank transfer fee.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 4</strong> Make a payment. Once you have bitcoin in your account you can start making payments. You will need the bitcoin address of the recipient.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Step 5</strong> Sell bitcoin. If you want to cash in your bitcoin, or bank a profit, selling is pretty straightforward. You can register to sell direct on sites through an online exchange or platforms such as Coinbase, Coinfloor, BitBargain or Bittylicious. Again, there are transaction fees up to about 1% of your trade.</p>",
  "<p>In early June, when everyone in Britain was arguing about Europe, I found myself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/budapest\">Budapest</a>. I had fond memories of my only previous visit, in 2013, when I\u2019d been there for a literary festival. After one of the endless drinks parties I\u2019d fallen into step with a group in search of dinner and wound up talking to a tall man with prominent eyebrows and burgundy trousers. \u201cI got married in there,\u201d he said casually, pointing at <a href=\"http://en.bazilika.biz/\">St Stephen\u2019s Basilica</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt must have been hard to fill,\u201d I replied with a certain froideur. This was a bit like someone nodding at Wembley Stadium and mentioning their seven-night run there. I wasn\u2019t about to wave it through unchecked.</p> <p>\u201cNot really. In fact, people crowded outside and it was shown on television.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see. Why was that?\u201d \u201cWell, my grandfather was the last emperor,\u201d he explained, moments before I fell back to Google him. Though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/11/great-dynasties-habsburg-empire\">Habsburgs</a> no longer rule, I learned later that the name still secures preferential treatment in a steakhouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3b97717f826e67baf05313d9672e351b20e6895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b97717f826e67baf05313d9672e351b20e6895/0_217_6439_3864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man standing at a brightly painted bar and a woman in a hammock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Brooklynite dream for a tenth of the price\u2019: a ruin bar in the Jewish quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My other enduring impression was of an anarchic day that began as a walking tour of the old city and ended with hamburgers and beer in a pedal cart. My guide Zsuzsi and I stayed in touch through Facebook, and I looked her up as soon as I arrived this time.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t been to Budapest recently, you probably have the wrong idea about it. For my parents\u2019 generation it was a cheap weekend behind the Iron Curtain, where your interest was pitched against your growing boredom with goulash. Since joining the EU it has become a cheap favourite for stag and hen dos, a fact not unrelated to pints of beer that adhere stubbornly to a price of less than \u00a31. But a smarter and more interesting scene is emerging, too.</p> <p>The ruin bars \u2013 dilapidated buildings, mainly in the Jewish quarter, given new life over the past decade by canny entrepreneurs \u2013 have become markedly smarter and hipper. At bars like Mazel Tov, Racskert and <a href=\"http://mostbisztro.hu/\">Most</a> you can sit in designer furniture in airy atriums, enjoying the kind of night out Brooklynites dream of, for a tenth of the price. \u201cThe local owners complain about the noise but their apartments are worth five times what they were,\u201d Zsuzsi\u2019s boyfriend Alex told me. He owns a hostel himself, <a href=\"http://www.casadelamusicahostel.com/home/\">Casa de La Musica</a>, in an old dance school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The seats were all burgundy. I settled into mine and waited for a stranger to ask me to murder his father</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next morning I woke at six to catch a train to Berlin. I was excited about the journey. Over 11 and a half hours it would take me through four countries, three of which I hadn\u2019t visited before. My first-class ticket, bought the day before, was just \u20ac60. Take that, easyJet. The seats were wide and comfortable, with a plug for my devices. The next carriage along had old-fashioned private compartments with a corridor down the outside. Beyond that was a dining car. All were upholstered in deep burgundy. As we rolled out of the city, tracing the Danube back towards its source, a man served coffee and handed out newspapers. I settled into my chair and waited for a stranger to ask me to murder his father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"402138ae14ec8b6321be44e6fa953457a9e22e53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/402138ae14ec8b6321be44e6fa953457a9e22e53/0_171_5100_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People drinking on the banks of the River Spree at sunset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City lights: the banks of the River Spree at sunset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After half an hour we crossed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/slovakia\">Slovakia</a> towards Bratislava. From there we turned north towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/czechrepublic\">Czech Republic</a>, close enough to look into Austria but not quite crossing its frontier. At each border a new conductor got on to stamp my ticket. I was the only one in the carriage going the whole way. Nobody asked for a passport. As we left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jun/19/low-cost-fun-brno-czech\">Brno</a> I was peckish, so went to the dining car and ordered paprika chicken with dumplings and a cold beer. Sweeping crumbs off the tablecloth I pondered how many BLTs I\u2019d eaten on British trains. A hundred? What a sad waste of life.</p> <p>At Prague the platform was three-deep with Interrailers, who piled on to the train. Luckily none of them had booked into first class except for one American girl with a suspiciously new-looking backpack. We exchanged a glance which conveyed what we thought about the passengers at the back of the train, specifically that they were suckers.</p> <p>The physical geography of this part of the continent is quite uniform, at least to a man seeing it for the first time with half an eye on his WhatsApp. It slid past as a kind of Mittel-European diorama.

I have been delayed for longer between Charing Cross and Embankment. At Hauptbahnhof I tried to buy a ticket for the S-Bahn. The ticket machine listed options for refugees and those interested in a gay tour of the city but not, as far as I could tell, for \u201csingle journey to specific station\u201d. I chose something that promised \u201call access\u201d but it wouldn\u2019t take my Visa. Cursing, I made a mental note never again to be rude about Oyster cards and went to look for a cab. Time was tight: I had an early train to Paris to catch the next day and I wanted to spend some time with my cousin Kate.</p> <p>She moved to Berlin last year with her boyfriend, lured by cheap rent and exhilarating, keenly priced nightlife. They insisted on showing me some of the latter, or at least the parts of it in walking distance of their flat in Kreuzberg. I only recall the first two bars with any clarity. One was decorated with pictures of the Muppets. \u201cWe are the same, you and I,\u201d said the owner, with his hand on his heart in a gesture of solidarity. He seemed to have sampled some of his own wares. \u201cMe \u2013 Saxony. You \u2013 Saxon,\u201d he said. We ordered more beer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ticket machine in Berlin listed options for refugees and those interested in gay tours of the city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The train to Paris left just after seven the next morning.

  "<p>It is not a secret that the offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat is inhumane.

The leaked incident reports document assaults, sexual abuse and self-harm attempts mostly among the most vulnerable: children. They are a stain on Australia\u2019s conscience and its international reputation. Yet the federal government is unrepentant. The phobia that Australia might be overrun by \u201cboat people\u201d seemingly trumps everything else. Anything is acceptable, it seems, to stop the boats.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t. Throwing desperate people fleeing death and persecution in prison on small Pacific islands for having the temerity to seek refuge in Australia isn\u2019t just morally wrong, it\u2019s irrational, illegal and prohibitively expensive to boot. It must stop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/offshore-detention-still-has-support-after-nauru-files-says-coalition-minister\">Offshore detention still has support after Nauru files, says Coalition minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia is a wonderfully diverse country that is generally welcoming to foreigners. The arrival of some 200,000 immigrants a year is relatively uncontroversial; 28.5% of the population was born abroad. But that generally open attitude makes the paranoia about the perceived threat posed by relatively small numbers of boat people seem all the more irrational. Unauthorised arrivals by boat totalled fewer than 70,000 people between 1990 and 2013. That is a drop in the ocean for a country of 24 million people. Australia is not in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d.</p> <p>While the number of people detained offshore is relatively <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore#_Total_number_of\">small</a> and had fallen to some 1,300 at the end of June, the cost of locking them up is large. Each person detained offshore in terrible conditions costs Australian taxpayers an eye-watering A$430,000 a year each, <a href=\"http://www.ncoa.gov.au/report/appendix-vol-2/10-14-illegal-maritime-arrival-costs.html\">according</a> to the National Commission of Audit. Just think how much those people could contribute to Australian society if only a small fraction of that amount was instead spent on welcoming them and getting them into work.</p> <p>The evidence is clear. The Australian government allocated A$27.8m in fiscal year 2014-15 to support 2,750 \u201cauthorised onshore arrivals\u201d (people who arrive in Australia with a visa and then seek asylum), amounting to A$10,100 per person. That much smaller fiscal outlay is repaid many times over as refugees start working and contributing to society, as many economic <a href=\"http://apo.org.au/files/Resource/mda_assessing-economic-contribution-refugees-australia_2013.pdf\">studies</a> show.</p> <p>Indeed, investing one dollar in helping refugees can yield nearly two dollars in economic benefits within five years, according to my own recent <a href=\"http://www.opennetwork.net/refugeeswork/\">study</a>, published by Open, the international think-tank that I founded, and the Tent Foundation, whose mission is to help forcibly displaced people. So even from a heartless, self-interested economic point of view, it is perverse to be locking up at prohibitive expense people who have a lot to contribute to Australia.</p> <p>There is also the small matter of international law. Earlier this year the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/high-court-upholds-australias-right-to-detain-asylum-seekers-offshore\">ruled</a> that offshore detention was lawful under Australia\u2019s constitution. But Australia is also a party to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, an international treaty that extends the protections of the 1951 Refugee Convention to non-Europeans.</p> <p>The convention states that asylum seekers should not be penalised for their unauthorised entry to a country, provided they present themselves to the authorities without delay and show good cause for their unauthorised entry. Article 31.2 stipulates that receiving states \u201cshall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers can, of course, debate to what extent Australia\u2019s restrictions are \u201cnecessary\u201d. But however you interpret the convention, it certainly does not permit indefinite detention in inhumane conditions with no possibility for those with legitimate asylum claims to gain refugee status in Australia.</p> <p>Economics and the law are both important. But the overriding argument is a moral one. It cannot be right to inflict such suffering on people who have committed no crime, the vast <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore#_Total_number_of\">majority</a> of whom are later found to be refugees.</p> <p>The federal government\u2019s argument that locking people up saves lives by deterring others from coming is bogus. If the government was really concerned about asylum seekers\u2019 welfare, it wouldn\u2019t treat them so badly. And yes, people smugglers are often nasty people. But that doesn\u2019t make punishing innocent asylum seekers acceptable.</p> <p>The government of Papua New Guinea has just decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/manus-island-detention-centre-to-close-australia-and-papua-new-guinea-agree\">shut the detention centre on Manus Island</a>.

  "<p>The practice of art and the notion of restorative justice and therapeutic jurisprudence in attending to the offending behaviour of convicted criminals is something of a hand-in-glove affair. <br>  In the practice of art, a blank canvas is addressed and accepted in its raw state, is then primed and prepared and taken to task, altering it by strategically applying appropriate forms of medium, in varying techniques with the end result of producing a piece of what society would arguably concede to be \u201cart\u201d.   The key elements to producing that work are (loosely) committing to the process, gathering the resources, setting to the task while accepting that a series of mistakes will be made during the creative process, acknowledging that there will be discomfort and hard emotional realisations in correcting, and more importantly, learning from those events will occur that will forever alter the attitudinal framework and mindset of the artist at hand. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/my-art-is-a-personal-antidote-for-the-effects-of-colonisation\">My art is a personal antidote for the effects of colonisation | Katie West for @IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision making process alone teaches patience, resilience, attention to micro and macro detail, consequential responsibility for decisions made and put into practise as well as the reality of realised self expression, possibly for the first time.<br>  These tasks activate parts of the mind, intellect, social and emotional being that may otherwise lay dormant and unexpressed. Both sides of the brain are required to function and it has been proven time and again that self actuated desire to numeracy and literacy competence are a natural consequence of exposure to the pursuit of producing art. It\u2019s worth noting that around or over 80% of people in prison have literacy and/or numeracy challenges. In most cases this deficit has contributed to the circumstance of their offending behaviour.  The key element is educational empathic engagement.   If this holds water, perhaps suggesting that art programmes in prisons would be of benefit to prisoners is not too much of a stretch. Further to that then, perhaps pointing out that everybody inside prisons are directly affected by the climate and culture inside prisons, it might not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the staff of prisons would also stand to benefit from the effects of working with a population that is actively engaged in serving their time rather than dealing with the unrelenting boredom of current incarceration practise. </p> <p>Practising art is perfect for the emotional and intellectual wellbeing of those with nothing but time to kill because it is something that is never fully learnt. The results would be tangible and far reaching within and external to the prisons. The return on investment would be present in terms of decreased sick leave, stress leave, etc. quite rapidly.</p> <p> Of course, not everybody\u2019s an artist \u2013 that\u2019s so true \u2013 however pretty much everyone benefits from exposure to positive self expression, particularly when the content is driven by harsh, often destructive, unexpressed emotion, often born of historic trauma. <br>  Avenues for opportunistic, therapeutic intervention through art therapy practices naturally present themselves in creative environments as alluded to above and have been proven successful.   It is said that the hardest part of producing any painting is applying paint to the canvas. Once this step is taken the rest pretty much looks after itself. I\u2019d like to see that principal put into practice with those who could most benefit themselves and broader society, by the institutions charged with correcting offending behaviour. It\u2019s doable. It just needs doing. Because at the moment, with very few exceptions, it is not being done. We as a society pay for the results dearly.   The choice simply is this; what product do we want our correctional centres to produce? Do we want the to produce people who have learned from their mistakes and have bettered themselves? Or do we want them to produce people are released back into the world, profoundly damaged by the experience of punishment, deprivation of liberty, humanity and dignity by being purely punished by being locked up.   In Queensland, prisoners are not allowed to make any money from sales of work produced whilst incarcerated. The situation is born of legislation introduced early this decade. There seems to be no purpose served by the legislation. While it is in place it makes an already difficult situation much more challenging. The prisons are naturally, lawfully obliged to adhere to the existing legislation, regardless of its veracity, or lack thereof.   What happens inside the walls of our prisons is a very concentrated, intense version of the society of the day, which is perhaps an interesting, if unpalatable commentary on contemporary Australian society. It could even beg the question, how far has mainstream Australia, as a society progressed beyond it\u2019s prison colony beginnings.</p> <p>As a member of the Brisbane Council of Elders, I visit our brothers and sisters in all the prisons from Maryborough south to the Queensland/New South Wales border, as well as visiting our young ones in the Queensland Juvenile Detention Centre. </p> <p>In one particular prison, our visits go beyond the contact and non-contact visit areas where family and legal representative visits are conducted. We are deep within whichever complex our schedule throws up, and when we visit we are surrounded by what the outside world would call hardened criminals. Sometimes we will not have guards around us, save for the occasional cultural liaison officer during our visit and will never feel anything other than completely safe and comfortable. </p> <p>We will be in the company of around 40 inmates and I will watch Aunties melt young men with a few words and Uncles have a series of warm, demonstratively affectionate greetings that inevitably leads to a series of yarns that last the duration of our four hours inside. We will be regularly asked if we\u2019d like coffee, tea, cold water and biscuits brought to us where we sit, always with care and beautiful manners.</p> <p> The description of what we experience is perhaps a counterintuitive scenario to what you the reader may expect to read. This particular facility, even though it\u2019s as overcrowded as the rest, has a well supported, well resourced, well accessed arts centre and education centre. This is not the case everywhere, and it is incredibly noticeable in the demeanour of the inmates and staff alike. <br>  It\u2019s my intention to see the conditions of this prison as the rule rather than the exception. I\u2019m hoping, after reading this, it might become a consideration of yours too.<br></p> <p><em>\u201cOur stories, our way\u201d \u2013 each week, a new guest hosts the </em><em>@IndigenousX Twitter account</em><em> </em><em>to discuss topics of interest to them as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.

  "<p>The New Zealand media have warned of a \u201cBritish Invasion\u201d after government data revealed huge spikes in the number of queries from Britons in the wake of the Brexit vote. </p> <p>Typically the <a href=\"https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/\">Immigration New Zealand website</a> receives 3,000 registrations a month from British nationals interested in moving to, working or investing in New Zealand. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/what-is-it-really-like-to-live-in-new-zealand\">What is it really like to live in New Zealand?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But on the day of the Brexit referendum the website received 998 registrations from Britons, compared with 109 at the same time the year before.

That is not true, but it is generally true that New Zealand does avoid the worst trappings of modern, consumerist culture. There is a rush hour \u2013 but it is just an hour.\u201d </p> <p>Neal Curtis, a media studies lecturer at the University of Auckland and another expat, said he emigrated to New Zealand to escape the Tories, but the country of British imaginations was a long way from the reality. </p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand still has a legacy as a colonial outpost, as a liberal, socially progressive oasis on the other side of the world,\u201d said Curtis. </p> <p>\u201cIt can be quite a shock when you arrive to discover it is really just a more spacious version of what you left behind.\u201d</p> <p>According to Immigration New Zealand, in the year to June, 4,934 Britons were granted residency, 22,633 Britons were granted work visas and 1,176 Britons were granted student visas.</p>"
