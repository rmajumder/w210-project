  "<p>Parents are being urged to boycott requests to disclose their child\u2019s nationality and country of birth over fears it could turn teachers into de facto border guards and stoke divisions in the classroom. </p> <p>Human rights groups are concerned that the data, collected for the first time this year from pupils aged two to 19 as part of the schools census, could be used against children and their families by immigration enforcement. </p> <p>The Department for Education (DfE) insists that the information will not be handed to the Home Office and that the data is being collected and input to the national pupil database (NPD) to ensure children \u201creceive the best possible education\u201d. </p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/pupil_data_sharing_with_the_poli#incoming-846569\">disclosures under freedom of information laws</a> have shown that the Home Office has been handed NPD data on 18 occasions since 2012, while police requests for information from the dataset were granted 31 times.</p> <p>Disclosure is not compulsory, but a recent <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/pupils-who-were-not-white-british-told-to-send-in-birthplace-data/\">investigation by the trade magazine Schools Week</a> found that schools were misinterpreting official guidance by demanding pupils\u2019 passport numbers and even specifically targeting the parents of non-white children. </p> <p>\u201cThat creates a climate where half the class is being told you\u2019ve got to bring in your passport and the other half haven\u2019t,\u201d said Gracie Mae Bradley, from Against Borders for Children. \u201cIn a post-Brexit environment, kids are already precarious; they are already feeling like it\u2019s not a good thing to be a migrant child and this further divides them.\u201d </p> <p>She called on parents to boycott the census questions. \u201cIf every parent in the country exercised that right to refuse, that would protect all undocumented children from any potential enforcement action and it also sends a very strong signal about the kind of society that we want to live in.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, more than 20 groups are writing to the education secretary, Justine Greening, to ask her to reverse the requirement for schools to collect the data, warning that the plan risked violating the right to privacy of children and families.</p> <p>\u201cOur grave concern is that the new data will be shared with the Home Office and therefore used for immigration enforcement purposes,\u201d says the letter, whose signatories include Liberty, the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network and Privacy International. </p> <p>\u201cWe have already seen data-sharing between the Home Office and other departments increase since the government announced its commitment to creating a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for undocumented migrants. Such measures deter vulnerable children and families from accessing essential services, exercising their human rights and participating on an equal basis in our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners see the new census requirement as the latest step in a crackdown on what the government has dubbed \u201ceducation tourism\u201d. In 2013, ministers were forced to abandon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/27/ministers-immigration-crackdown-education-tourists\">proposals to exclude the children of undocumented migrants</a> from school, amid fears it would breach <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx\">international human rights law</a>.</p> <p>But two years later, Nicky Morgan, then education secretary, ordered officials to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11805477/Nicky-Morgan-orders-immigration-review-to-examine-education-tourism.html\">investigate how much of a \u201cpull factor\u201d state schools were for immigrants</a>, as part of measures to slash net migration. \u201cAnd then, in 2016, you get this announcement about monitoring the scale and impact of pupil migration on the education sector,\u201d Bradley said.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, policy director of Liberty, the human rights group, said the latest plan risked creating \u201ca chilling effect around school attendance\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cHostile-environment policies are deeply problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cThey outsource immigration enforcement to private citizens and public sector workers whose roles have nothing to do with border control. This latest wave of reforms targets sensitive public services like healthcare and education. It is insidious to be targeting the kids and risks making them additionally vulnerable if they are then kept away from school.\u201d</p> <p>Don Flynn, director of the Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, said the proposal jeopardised \u201ca decade of real advance\u201d in the relationships between schools and migrant communities. He said: \u201cPeople in migrant communities across the UK have been thrown into great uncertainty about their future as a result of the Brexit vote and the harsher tone of the public debate. </p> <p>\u201cThe DfE should not be adding to this anxiety by introducing a measure which will inevitably increase the sense of being watched and scrutinised by state agencies with a view to future deportations.\u201d</p> <p>The DfE insisted it took the privacy of children seriously and that the data would be used for research purposes and not be routinely published. A spokesperson said: \u201cThese data items will not be passed to the Home Office. They are solely for internal Department for Education use for analysis, statistics and research.</p> <p>\u201cThis information will be used to help us better understand how children with, for example, English as an additional language, perform in terms of their broader education and to assess and monitor the scale and impact immigration may be having on the schools sector.\u201d</p>",

He has previously defended free movement, saying people were more worried about the undercutting of wages.</p> <p>That position is not shared by a number of Corbyn\u2019s critics, including Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary, who has suggested there does need to be a curb on free movement. He said it was \u201cthe big issue\u201d that motivated many people to vote to leave and cannot be ignored.</p> <p>In a sign of tensions over the issue, Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister, warned that such views were allowing the party to wander down a \u201cred Ukip\u201d path.</p> <p>A discussion about Brexit was not one of the eight motions chosen by party authorities for debate at the party\u2019s conference in Liverpool.</p> <p>But Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, will focus on the subject during her speech on Monday, when she will say that the party supports the idea of continuing billions of pounds in EU funding for regeneration, among other projects, after Brexit.</p> <p>Before Thornberry\u2019s speech Labour will release an 80-page document listing all the projects and rights that could potentially be at risk from Brexit, including legislation on air quality and funding for peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe can guarantee that a future Labour government will make up any shortfall in structural funding into the 2020s and beyond.

The foreign secretary strayed from his brief during BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, as he was pressed on the extra money for the NHS after Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary, suggested <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37435648\">at least \u00a35bn a year could be available to the NHS</a> after Brexit.</p> <p>Asked whether the government could guarantee a \u201creally substantial\u201d extra amount of money per week for the NHS by 2020, Johnson said: \u201cWell, yes, in the sense that clearly once we leave, and that isn\u2019t possible until the final moment that of the change in our arrangements, and we take back control of the budgets we contribute to the EU.</p> <p>\u201cOnce that happens, clearly it will be possible for the UK government to spend people\u2019s money on our priorities.

He said the process should not be allowed to drag on and the UK should be out before May 2019 to avoid a new batch of British MEPs being elected to Brussels. That would imply article 50 would have to be triggered before May next year to allow two years of negotiations to take place.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s European elections coming down the track and people will be wondering whether we will be wanting to send a fresh batch of MEPs to an institution we are going to be leaving,\u201d Johnson said.</p>",

  "<p>Whenever a fresh study on the dangers of concussion in sport hits the headlines it reminds me of the ominous prophecy from Malcolm Gladwell: that playing American football will one day become akin to joining the army. \u201cWe will disclose the risks and dare people to play,\u201d he warned in 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s what the army does.

Increasingly we are aware that it is not only crushing hits that scramble the brain but repetitive sub-concussive blows, too. Then there are the dangers of playing on with concussion. One study in the academic journal Pediatrics, published last month, followed 69 high-school athletes who sustained head injuries in football, ice hockey, soccer and volleyball and found that those who stayed on the field took twice as long to recover (44 days compared with 22 days).</p> <p>Yet the conference of the World Rugby Science Network \u2013 a global body of researchers interested in both codes \u2013 in Bath this month suggested that in rugby union\u2019s case significant steps are being made in tackling concussion and more could be on their way.</p> <p>The starting point was acceptance. As the Rugby Football Union\u2019s Matthew Cross pointed out, since the 2009-10 season there has been a year\u2011on\u2011year rise in the reported incidents of concussion in the Premiership and head injuries are now the most common injury in the league. Given players have not got taller or heavier in the past six or seven years, that is probably down to improved reporting rather than the game getting more dangerous.</p> <p>Cross then outlined the RFU\u2019s strategy to identify better and then to manage concussions when they happen. As anyone who has watched the Premiership this season will know, all teams now have a designated person to watch matches on an iPad to look out for potential head injuries. The 10-minute window for a player to have a Head Impact Assessment (HIA) is now 13 minutes so doctors can also carry out the King\u2011Devick Test, where players are asked to read a series of numbers as accurately as possible and their score is compared with their baseline.</p> <p>However, potentially the most interesting findings have come from a research project looking at a database of 1,516 professional matches between 2013 and 2015, which involved 611 HIAs. As the sports scientist Ross Tucker explained at the conference, this allowed World Rugby to code where each head injury occurred \u2013 whether it was in a tackle, scrum, maul and so on \u2013 and how it had come about. Tackles, unsurprisingly, topped the list, so they started diving deeper. How many players were involved in tackles where head injuries occurred? What direction or angles did the tackle come from? What were the speed of the players and their body positions? And how did all this change the risk of serious injury?</p> <p>Among the interesting findings were that 76% of head injuries happen in the tackle and about three quarters of those happen to the tackler. Smother tackles, which are often thought to be particularly dangerous, turn out not to be. A tackler bent at the waist, or diving, has a lower risk of picking up a head injury than one who is upright. And the most dangerous tackle of all \u2013 by far \u2013 is when both players are upright because it increases the risk of one head hitting another or smashing into a shoulder pad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/24/national-anthem-protest-college-football-kaepernick\">College players join in raising fists for anthem as Kaepernick's protest speads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was what Tucker said next that was most interesting. These findings had been presented to senior figures in World Rugby, as well as elite coaches and referees, and they all agreed that there needed to be \u201czero tolerance\u201d on head injuries in the sport and ways found to get the tackler lower. The research had led to a range of proposals, which are expected to be discussed shortly.</p> <p>Tucker also revealed that he wanted to make this head injury database open-sourced and be as open and collaborative as possible. Meanwhile Cross highlighted another forthcoming brain study investigating the potential effects of playing rugby union and concussion on the long-term health of elite players, which will involve physical and cognitive assessments as well as blood and urine testing to look at potential biomarkers.</p> <p>Of course rugby will remain a dangerous game. The Wales captain, Sam Warbuton, illustrated that particularly vividly when I spoke to him about the breakdown a couple of years ago. As he put it, it is \u201ca pretty ugly place when you\u2019ve got three 18-stoners flying in, trying to take your head off. Sometimes I\u2019m struggling to shampoo my head the next day because my head is hurting so bad.\u201d</p> <p>Rugby remains a tough game with obvious risks. But when it comes to concussion significant progress has been made in the five years since the 2011 Rugby World Cup, when 56% of players who were concussed stayed on the field and were diagnosed only afterwards. As Tucker points out, the use of data has built a compelling case for further change \u2013 and, who knows, may help rugby union avoid Gladwell\u2019s grim vision of the future.</p>",

  "<p>This is the year my son fell in love with baseball and for reasons that are still unclear he declared the Miami Marlins his second-favorite team. He often wears a black Marlins shirt to school with orange pants to match the team\u2019s colors. And each night when we sit in front of the television to watch an hour of baseball before bedtime it is usually the Marlins we see. The most recent Marlins game we watched together was last Tuesday night when the team\u2019s best pitcher Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez sliced through the Washington Nationals, striking out 12 on his way to a 1-0 victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/25/jose-fernandez-miami-marlins-pitcher-killed-baseball\">Marlins pitcher Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez killed in boating accident at age of 24</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I had talked a lot to my son about Fern\u00e1ndez this season, telling him about the 24-year-old pitcher who had escaped Cuba in a boat and had already become one of the best players in baseball \u2013 he was easy to love.

The Nationals game we watched last week turned out to be the last start of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s life. Somehow this makes his death more personal. I imagine there are many other parents looking at their children today, wondering how they will break the same news. Should we be gentle and say a beloved baseball player was killed in an accident? Should we be more direct and tell them the details of a speed boat going too fast on the shore off Miami Beach, crashing into rocks and killing all three passengers? There are no simple answers.</p> <p>What do you say about the death of someone who was so alive? Watching those Marlins games this year gave me an even better appreciation for how exciting a player Fern\u00e1ndez was. He was probably the second- or third-best pitcher in the National League. In his short career he had done what seemed impossible and brought fans to the new stadium in Miami. Marlins fans were still angry at team owner Jeffrey Loria\u2019s penchant for dismantling winning teams when Fernandez arrived in the summer of 2013. The lure of a Cuban star in a city of so many Cuban exiles proved too tempting to keep people away. The nights Fern\u00e1ndez pitched were events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37b5239a64084c5ea4243f2c4c2ae86ed15c9d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37b5239a64084c5ea4243f2c4c2ae86ed15c9d69/0_480_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez was just 24 when he died\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez was just 24 when he died.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Today Sports/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who knows what would have happened had Fern\u00e1ndez lived. He will lead the league in strikeouts-per-nine innings pitched this year with a remarkable 12.488. There was a chance the Marlins, unable to afford a huge new contract for him, were going to trade him in the offseason. The team that got him would probably have been good and would have paid him a lot of money. He was about to become very wealthy.</p> <p>Instead we are left with the horrible irony of a man who escaped Cuba by water, now dying in the ocean off Miami. In a wonderful 2013 profile of Fernandez, Jordan Ritter Conn <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/marlins-rookie-pitcher-jose-fernandez-journey-cuban-defector-mlb-all-star/\">vividly described Fernandez\u2019s nighttime departure from Cuba</a>. Fern\u00e1ndez was 15 and had tried to flee three previous times when he and a small group, including his mother, jumped into a speedboat in a small cave on Cuba\u2019s southern coast. The vessel took them to a houseboat which eventually carried them to Mexico. Along the way, rough waves knocked Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mother off the boat. Fernandez dived into the churning sea, swam out to her and then pulled her back to the boat, saving her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc99a46a5640f509601cdc1441639b1f7fdbb29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc99a46a5640f509601cdc1441639b1f7fdbb29/0_185_4495_2696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez jersey hangs in the New York Mets dugout after the Marlins pitcher\u2019s death\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez jersey hangs in the New York Mets dugout after the Marlins pitcher\u2019s death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one could have saved Fern\u00e1ndez on Sunday morning. Early accounts suggest even a swift arrival by the Coast Guard would have been too late. What\u2019s left are threads that could have changed this narrative. He was supposed to have pitched on Sunday which meant he would have been home resting and not on a boat early Sunday morning. But the Marlins had slipped out of contention for the last wild card spot and they wanted to work in another young pitcher coming off injury. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s start had been pushed back a game. Perhaps if the Marlins had won a few more games this year or if Fern\u00e1ndez hadn\u2019t been so dominant against Washington last week, he might not have thrown as many pitches as he did that night \u2013 111 \u2013 and the Marlins wouldn\u2019t have given him that day of extra rest.</p> <p>All of that is irrelevant now. A sad conversation awaits with a boy in a black Marlins shirt and orange pants that match the team colors \u2013 it will be one of many around the country today. What do you say about a death that makes no sense? </p>",

  "<p>A failure by <a href=\"http://www.guardiacivil.es/en/institucional/Conocenos/index.html\">Guardia Civil</a> to provide female officers with bulletproof jackets specifically designed for women is discriminatory, dangerous and is affecting their ability to protect the public, a major Spanish policing group has said.<br></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.augc.org/\">United Association of Civil Guards</a> (AUGC), which has 30,000 members, has launched a campaign demanding the nationwide police service affords equal protection to male and female officers. </p> <p>It comes as a female Guardia Civil officer in Salamanca province faces disciplinary action for allegedly disobeying a superior\u2019s order to put on a bulletproof jacket for men. According to the association, the guard was working at a police checkpoint in August when she asked if she could wear the \u20ac500 (\u00a3430) women\u2019s bulletproof jacket she had bought herself rather than an official-issue men\u2019s one that did not fit. Despite being refused permission, she put on her own jacket. The guard is now facing insubordination charges under Spain\u2019s military penal code as the Guardia Civil is overseen by both the interior ministry and the ministry of defence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/female-police-officers-mexico-attractiveness-inspections-complains-queretaro\">Female police officers subjected to 'attractiveness' inspections in Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt may sound like that old joke \u2026 about soldiers asking the enemy for more bullets so they can keep on fighting the war, but sadly it\u2019s no joke,\u201d said the AUGC. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about workers who are trying to protect themselves in the face of apathy from the institution they serve and which, far from helping to solve things, chooses instead to prohibit them from taking their own steps to ensure their safety.\u201d</p> <p>Pilar Villacorta, women\u2019s secretary for the AUGC, said the case highlighted the desperate lack of bulletproof jackets for the thousands of women who serve in the Guardia Civil. \u201cThe jackets that we have to wear are men\u2019s jackets that are too big for us and which don\u2019t fit female bodies,\u201d she said. Not only do they not fit snugly \u2013 therefore reducing the protection offered \u2013 said Villacorta, they also make it hard for female officers to reach their guns, handcuffs and telescopic batons.</p> <p>Villacorta, who has been with the Guardia Civil for 23 years, said the situation reflected the scale of gender inequality throughout wider Spanish society. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re part of a society that is patently very masculine: we may be half the population, but it\u2019s men who get the big political jobs. It\u2019s exactly the same in the Guardia Civil: there aren\u2019t women in the big, decision-making jobs who can decide what we need. We shouldn\u2019t forget that out of 79,000 officers, only 5,000 are women.\u201d</p> <p>She said the decision to apply the military penal code in the Salamanca case was absurd given the routine policing context in which the incident had occurred, and pointed out that her colleague could face prison if found guilty of insubordination.<br></p> <p>Villacorta said the lack of bulletproof jackets for all officers had been a serious issue within the service for a long time. \u201cWe always need bulletproof jackets,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking is that when people graduate from the academy, they are given a bulletproof jacket along with their service weapon. If we are going to provide security and protection to the public, the Guardia Civil needs to be looking out for our own safety.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardia Civil did not respond to questions about the Salamanca case or the effect that badly fitting jackets could have on officers\u2019 ability to do their job. In a statement, it said the government had approved the purchase of 21,000 bulletproof jackets over the next three years. \u201cOf those, 2,000 will be female ones and will come in two different sizes adapted to the anthropomorphic characteristics of women\u2019s bodies. At the same time, a further 4,200 will be ordered as a reserve and for special necessities.\u201d</p> <p>According to the statement, the service currently has a total of 32,016 bulletproof jackets. </p> <p>The Guardia Civil, whose origins go back to the mid-19th century, performs a wide range of duties, from counter-terrorism and peacekeeping, to patrolling ports and airports and protecting the environment.</p>",

Do they have to moan and groan about handfuls of so-called Trots who have infiltrated?</p> </blockquote> <p>While predicting that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of shadow cabinet members who chose to quite would now return, McCluskey claimed it was their revolt which caused Labour\u2019s such poor current polling.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth of the matter is, until there was this mass hysteria and a rush by PLP members to abandon their roles and their jobs, the opinion polls were showing that we were level. In fact a few of them were showing that we were ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>The event was co-sponsored by the Daily Mirror, and McCluskey was no less diplomatic with them, saying: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be hypocritical of me if I didn\u2019t register my disappointment with the manner in which the Mirror has conducted itself during the leadership campaign.

The general secretary is essentially a functionary - the party\u2019s most senior administrator/bureaucrat - and generally the speech is very dull.</p> <p>But this year\u2019s - for anyone interested in Labour party Kremlinology - was fascinating. The general secretary is <strong>Iain McNicol</strong> and he has an awkward relationship with Jeremy Corbyn. He was appointed before Corbyn was elected, he is not loyal to Corbyn, he used to work for the GMB, which backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn, and that Corbynites suspect that fixed the leadership contest rules as far as possible to maximise Smith\u2019s chances. It has also been reported that Corbyn would like to get rid of him, and replace him with an acolyte, although at the moment Corbyn does not have the votes on the national executive committee to make that happen.</p> <p>To a casual listener McNicol\u2019s speech may have sounded routine. But in fact it was full of coded support for Corbyn\u2019s opponents.</p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol explicitly backed \u201cclause one socialism\u201d - the philosophy championed by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics that stresses the importance of Labour being an effective force in parliament. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour was created for a very specific purpose, explicit from the very start.</p> <p>And that purpose is stated in black and white in our constitution.</p> <p>\u2018To organise and maintain in Parliament and in the country a political Labour Party and \u2018The Party shall bring together members and supporters who share its values.\u2019</p> <p>That\u2019s our Labour party.</p> <p>A party founded to win elections and form governments.</p> <p>To make our values real through practical change.</p> <p>It\u2019s a powerful idea and I\u2019ve not heard a better one.</p> </blockquote> <p>This might sound like a statement of the obvious, and of course Corbyn would say that he wants Labour to be an effective force in parliament. But the leadership contest became a battle between those who said the wishes of Labour members should take priority (Corbyn) and those who argued a leader had to retain the confidence of MPs (Smith), and McNicol is explicitly siding with the latter. The quote about Labour being set up to \u201corganise and maintain in parliament ... a political Labour party\u201d is from clause one of Labour\u2019s constitution and Smith supporters quoted it during the leadership contest as a reason as a reason why Corbyn could not lead the party. And Progress, the Blairite pressure group which is loathed by some Corbynites, recently published <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2016/09/22/clause-one-socialists-will-win-the-day/\">an editorial explicitly urging \u201cclause one socialists\u201d to stay in the party and fight for their cause.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>McNicol said criticised people who wrote off the achievements of the last Labour government. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will always be those Tories who want to write off the Labour years, and pretend no good came from them.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make sure none of us ever falls into that Tory trap.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seemed clearly aimed at the Corbynites, some of whom seem to find it much easier to condemn the record of the Blair/Brown governments than to praise them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He praised party staff and said that he would always defend them \u201cwhenever they come under attack\u201d.</strong> There have been reports <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/08/how-jeremy-corbyn-will-reshape-labour-s-backrooms-after-victory\">(like this one, for example, by the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush) </a>suggesting that the Corbynites want to get rid of not just McNicol, but other staff at Labour HQ deemed insufficiently loyal. McNicol signalled that he would oppose this strongly. When he talked about staff coming \u201cunder attack\u201d, he did not mean from the Tories. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to say something about the people who work for the Labour party.</p> <p>We expect a huge amount from them.</p> <p>They work weekends and evenings. They drop everything to fight by-elections or local elections. They put this Party conference together year after year. They are some of the brightest and the best our movement has.</p> <p>I value them, I respect them, and I stand in solidarity with them whenever they come under attack.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explicitly praised the parliamentary Labour party (PLP), most of whom opposed Corbyn\u2019s re-election.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hard-working Labour champions, winning seats for Labour, and denying Tories, and SNP and Lib Dems an extra seat in Parliament.</p> <p>That\u2019s the PLP - Labour through and through, and deserving our whole-hearted gratitude and support.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca9c11883261d0817beb4f9be3788ea0f9582bc/0_19_3205_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain McNicol speaking at the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T13:21:45.682Z\">at 2.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7b70ae4b0f55a9f4030d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T11:39:26.486Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Heidi Alexander,</strong> who resigned as shadow health secretary, was on the Sunday Politics earlier.

But he insisted that he wants most MPs to stay. Asked if he wanted MPs to be reinstated, or if he wanted the process to result in a new breed of MPs being chosen, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wish them [existing MPs] well. The relationship between an MP and their constituency is a complex one. It is not necessarily all the policy, tick-boxing exercise. It is also the relationship with the community, the effectiveness of representation and all those issues. Let\u2019s have a democratic discussion. I think the vast majority of MPs will have no problems whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn was making the point that, if local parties want to get rid of MPs, it might not necessarily be because of their political views. But the phrase \u201cthe vast majority\u201d suggests that Corbyn expects at least a few MPs to be replaced before the next election.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was opposed to a so-called \u201chard\u201d Brexit (Brexit involving giving up access to the single market). </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly rejected Parry Mitchell\u2019s claim that it is difficult for Jews to remain in the Labour party.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/25/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyn-liverpool-formally-opens-after-jeremy-corbyn-re-elected-leader?page=with:block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8#block-57e783a8e4b0831a514021c8\"> 9.05am.)</a> Commenting on what Mitchell, a peer, said about why is is leaving the party, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s unfortunate he would say that, because it\u2019s not a fair comment and I would hope that he would reflect on that because clearly there are diverse views within the party on issues in the Middle East, but there is absolute unity in the party of opposing any form of anti-Semitism, any form of racism in the party. That is very clear.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he wanted party members, and the party conference, to have more say in Labour policy making.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the investigations into alleged abuses by British servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan should continue.</strong> Asked if he backed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/24/tony-blair-end-this-army-witch-hunt-into-britains-brave-soldiers/\">Tony Blair, who this weekend said the investigations should stop</a>, Corbyn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have spoken to a number of soldiers that have served in Afghanistan and Iraq and I recognise the awful conditions that they were asked to serve under, and the difficulties they had with that.</p> <p>But I do think there has to be a recognition that we have signed up for international law on the behaviour of troops. America is going through the same experience, as do other European countries even though they\u2019re not signed up to the international criminal court. So I think there has to be investigations. Saying never to prosecute I think would be a step too far.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He suggested the more of the defence budget should be spent on emergency relief. </strong>Asked if defence spending should be higher or lower, he said it should not be any higher.

Given the choice, I would choose to stand in safe standing areas (I used to swap a grandstand ticket for a terrace ticket at away games in the 80s) but I won\u2019t stand in seated areas, because I won\u2019t align myself with men (always men in my experience) who bully women, children and those less able to be on their feet for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Of course, it only takes a few at the front to stand and then we all have to, so the problem looks bigger than it is - but the solution is more straightforward too. Warn those standing to sit down and if they stand again, eject them from the ground. Firm stewarding, CCTV and (most of all) a will to eradicate it, has more or less banished racist chanting from football grounds - the same tactics should apply to standing in seated areas. And it will once someone is seriously injured.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t agree with all of this, I\u2019m afraid. In the first instance, it\u2019s not one or the other: most standing doesn\u2019t cause too much aggravation to the others around, in my experience. And, as I child, I stood on my chair and generally considered it part of the fun. I also find women to be generally capable of standing, though of course there is a problem with those who cannot, even if we must acknowledge that they are in the minority. </p> <p>So, I absolutely disagree that people who stand in seated areas should be hoofed out, and am generally loth to endorse anything that allows clubs to continue ridding their clubs of people they\u2019ve decided they no longer need; West Ham\u2019s use of \u201ccustomers\u201d is telling. Nor do I feel comfortable treating persistent standing in the same way as we treated racism, though you are right to note that sometimes people can get too aggressive; in experience, it is as much those who want to sit as those who want to stand.</p> <p>None of which is to say that you\u2019re wrong in identifying a problem, though luckily, the answer is simple: safe standing.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:38:26.233Z\">at 3.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e7dea2e4b0f55a9f40317b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-25T14:27:31.361Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As per the preamble:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Instruction to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHUSOU?src=hash\">#WHUSOU</a> stewards: &quot;Persistent standing will be discouraged &amp; in the 1st instance steward will ask customers to be seated&#39; 1/2</p>&mdash; Henry Winter (@henrywinter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034659207909377\">September 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/henrywinter/status/780034898577022977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;persistent offenders will be ejected if appropriate and the details of their seat recorded.

They needed late goals to see off Bournemouth and Accrington Stanley and lost to Astra Giurgiu and Watford, while supporters have also been taken time to, er, \u201c<em>settle in</em>\u201d. For all the branding and grandstanding, hype and hyperbole, they\u2019re still rattling around an athletics venue that has very little to do with them.</p> <p>The might have coped with upheaval were it for not some appalling luck with injuries. Diafra Sakho, Andy Carroll and Andre Ayew are all missing, Winston Reid has been absent too, and the squad no longer has a fit left-back \u2013 enough to unsettle any team. But, even so, three points from five games reflects neither the quality of West Ham\u2019s players nor the quality of their manager, and all concerned must advise themselves immediately.<br><br>Southampton, meanwhile, are improving. After a dicky start, they pushed Arsenal all the way and walloped Sparta Prague, before beating Swansea and Crystal Palace; Ronald Koeman and Sadio Man\u00e9 may have left, but the rest of the players know what to do.

  "<p>It\u2019s 6.45am at Camden ambulance station in north London, and the day shift is just beginning. Andy Donovan, who will drive the ambulance I will accompany for the next nine hours, is making me a cup of tea. His more senior paramedic partner, Dean Lowes, is running a few minutes late. When he does arrive, Lowes looks very sorry for himself: he\u2019s got an ear infection, picked up on a friend\u2019s stag weekend in Budapest. Lowes is the ambulance\u2019s first case of the day. They nip off to the nearby Royal Free hospital in Hampstead to get some ear drops. Paramedic, heal thyself.</p> <p>All this delays us for more than an hour, and we\u2019re not ready to \u201cgo green\u201d \u2013 telling the London ambulance service\u2019s call centre near Waterloo station that they are available for a job \u2013 until after 8.30am. Lowes, who along with Donovan is featured in the BBC\u2019s new three-part series on London\u2019s overstretched ambulance service, is suitably embarrassed. \u201cThis never happens to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m never ill.\u201d But full marks for at least getting here. Crewing an ambulance is challenging at the best of times.</p> <p>Soon after going green, our first assignment comes in, flashing up on a monitor at the front of the ambulance. It\u2019s just about as unpleasant as it could be. One word: \u201cHANGING\u201d, and the location. It is a \u201cRed One\u201d \u2013 the top-priority call sign, meaning life-threatening. Lowes and Donovan\u2019s speed of reaction is electrifying. One moment, Lowes had been playing a Kings of Leon track on his mobile and saying how much he liked the band; the next, the ambulance is tearing south towards King\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>The call comes through at 8.49, and we get to the scene five minutes later. My heart sinks when I realise it is student accommodation. Two policemen are arriving simultaneously, and we all head up two floors in the lift to a stuffy, antiseptic white corridor. I go up with the policemen, who are bemoaning the fact their car was the closest to the scene. \u201cYou had a feeling it was going to be a funny day,\u201d one says to the other. \u201cYou said you had a feeling in your bones.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d says the other with a grim laugh, \u201cI should shut the fuck up.\u201d In situations like this, black humour is sometimes the only way out.</p> <p>Lowes, as senior paramedic, is first into the little study-bedroom. He has to decide if the student, who appears to have hanged himself, is dead, or, in the official language they use, to declare \u201clife extinct\u201d. It takes him just moments to satisfy himself that he is. The student is pronounced dead at 8.57. I can\u2019t bring myself to look at the body \u2013 the young man is fully clothed \u2013 for too long. What strikes me most is how peaceful he looks, and how red his hands are \u2013 the blood drains down to the hands and feet, a sign he has been dead for several hours.</p> <p>Within minutes there are half a dozen police on the scene, taking a statement from the traumatised fellow student who discovered the body, talking to the staff in the hall of residence, looking through the young man\u2019s possessions to establish his identity. It has ceased to be a medical emergency and become a police inquiry \u2013 and a personal tragedy for the family who do not yet know what has happened. It appears the young man, who was 23, was anxious about a dissertation he had failed to deliver. What a terrible, pointless waste.</p> <p>This is a shocking beginning. A suicide by hanging is rare. It is the first Lowes has witnessed. \u201cHe looked like a wax dummy,\u201d he says as we wait downstairs while he does the paperwork to certify the death. \u201cIt\u2019s when you see his passport and the picture of how he looked when he was alive that it hits you. That humanises it.\u201d Having been a body, he becomes a person. \u201cI try not to look at a dead person\u2019s effects too much,\u201d says Lowes, \u201cbecause you start to build a little story about them.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go into it too deeply,\u201d adds Donovan. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff you lock in the box.\u201d</p> <p>A paramedic team leader turns up. He doesn\u2019t say so, but Lowes and Donovan know he is there for their welfare \u2013 to make sure that having to deal with the young man\u2019s death has not affected them too severely. \u201cIf you want to take a bit of a break, that\u2019s fine,\u201d the team leader tells them. They don\u2019t particularly, although they do have a fag standing next to their ambulance. The morning is hot, and people stroll past the student block, laughing in the late-summer sunshine, not realising that inside a promising young life has been extinguished.</p> <p>By 11am, they are ready to roll again. They go green, pressing the button that declares the ambulance available, and in a second \u2013 literally \u2013 their next assignment flashes up. It\u2019s another Red One \u2013 a cardiac arrest in West Hampstead, a couple of miles to the north. The siren screams, I lurch around in the back of the ambulance feeling sick, and Donovan swears at the vehicles that block his way, costing him vital seconds that could mean the difference between life and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5088d1e23f7f6ae33517af2778ef93098eb232/0_164_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call handlers at the emergency operations centre in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Dearing/BBC/Dragonfly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The job is undeniably exciting, or at least seems so to me. Horrible, of course \u2013 no one wants to discover dead bodies \u2013 but also fascinating because of its unpredictable nature. You have no idea where you will go next or what you will have to deal with. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d Donovan had told me earlier. \u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to from job to job.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s like roulette, I suggest, and he tells me that is exactly what they call the last job of the day. If you go green with, say, half an hour left of your shift, the call centre will play \u201cred roulette\u201d. Instead of giving you a less urgent call (categorised from C1 to C4, depending on the degree of seriousness), they will give you something life-threatening. It seems mad, but the logic is that whatever you do is likely to take hours \u2013 every callout seems to generate a mountain of paperwork \u2013 so you may as well go to something that is worth your while. A practical, if heartless, way of looking at it. Paramedics often work 12-hour shifts, and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to get a final Red One at the very end.</p> <p>We get to West Hampstead in about six minutes. Another ambulance is already on the scene, as well as team leader April Barter, who has come by car. I bumped into her earlier at the ambulance station in Camden, and she was complaining about having nothing to do that morning. Now she has something to do. A man in his 60s has had a cardiac arrest \u2013 a heart attack in which his heart has stopped completely \u2013 and the struggle is on to save him.</p> <p>The man is lucky. I hadn\u2019t realised where we were when we arrived, but then it dawns on me \u2013 it\u2019s a bridge club, and dozens of middle-aged and elderly card players are watching the paramedics\u2019 attempts to revive their fellow participant. Even before the first crew arrived, some medically trained members of the club had starting giving him CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), that pounding of the chest that aims to kick the heart back into action. Without their prompt action, he would be dead. The paramedics continue the CPR \u2013 by now his chest looks as if it has caved in, but apparently this is quite normal \u2013 and administer defibrillation, an electric shock designed to correct his heart rhythm.</p> <p>After half an hour of attention, his heart is functioning again and he can be taken to hospital. He is still unconscious, but has a reasonable chance of surviving. His bridge partner, who tells me they had just played a very successful rubber, offers to go to hospital with him, while his wife is given the news at home. There is an impressive calm at the club as the man is carried out. Who knew bridge could be an extreme sport \u2013 or bridge players so unflappable?</p> <p>A cardiac arrest involving two crews generates an especially large volume of paperwork, and we are stuck outside the Royal Free for more than an hour while all the forms are filled in. Soon after we deliver the man to the hospital\u2019s heart centre, Barter tells me he has regained consciousness. \u201cThe fact he\u2019s awake, his eyes are open, he\u2019s moving around tells us his brain has more oxygen. Although potentially it has been starved of oxygen for a short period of time, that\u2019s a really positive sign and it\u2019s a potentially good outcome for him. That\u2019s a massive lift for us. Good times.\u201d She says she is \u201cbuzzing\u201d. \u201cIf I can make a difference to one person in a day, then I go home happy,\u201d Donovan told me earlier. It looks as if he and his colleagues have made that difference today.</p> <p>It is that difference, rather than the material rewards of the job, that attracts Lowes and Donovan. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this job if you want money,\u201d says Lowes, who is 37 and comes from the north-east of England. \u201cIt has other benefits. You go home and you sleep at night. You don\u2019t take any work home with you. You might take some kind of emotional stuff away at the end of the day but, as far as the working day is concerned, once you\u2019re finished, you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes, who is a fully qualified paramedic, tells me he earned \u00a336,000 last year. Thirty-year-old Donovan, a friendly, buoyant east Londoner who is one rung below his partner in terms of clinical qualifications, says he earns \u00a320,000 a year basic, which rises to about \u00a328,000 with the inner-London allowance, rest-break compensation (they will typically work through their breaks) and overtime, lots of overtime. They are contracted to work 37-and-a-half hours a week, but can do up to 56. Without the overtime, they would struggle financially. The staff need the relentless pressure on the service to earn enough to live.</p> <p>The upside, apart from the drama of the job and the satisfaction of saving lives and helping people at moments of crisis, is the flexibility. \u201cThere are a lot of other things out there that I wouldn\u2019t want to do, sitting behind a desk being one of them,\u201d says Donovan. \u201cAt least in this job you\u2019ve got a little bit of freedom. Once you\u2019re out on the road, you\u2019re your own boss.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/03/my-life-as-a-paramedic-when-every-second-counts\">My life as a paramedic: when every second counts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the paperwork for the cardiac arrest case is being done, I talk to Gary Nicholls, one of the paramedics in the first crew to arrive.

The workload can be relentless, but your colleagues are there to get you through the shift.\u201d</p> <p>The London ambulance service was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/27/london-ambulance-service-special-measures-care-quality-commission\">put into \u201cspecial measures\u201d</a> last year because of a number of failings, including staff shortages, poor response times, lack of leadership and concern that the service was ill-prepared to deal with a major terrorist attack. The cynic in me thinks the BBC series \u2013 and my ride in the ambulance today \u2013 are part of the PR fightback, and maybe they are, but there is no doubting the commitment of the dozen or so paramedics and backup staff I meet. This is a service under pressure, but by no means one that has lost heart. Nicholls really does believe they can deal with anything, including his first job that day \u2013 chasing a naked man who it was feared was high on drugs across Hampstead Heath.</p> <p>It is already well past 1pm. The complexity of the jobs, the paperwork and the fact that you need a bit of a breather mean crews will only do four or five callouts in a nine-hour shift, and six or eight in a 12-hour one. Just before 1.30pm, Donovan and Lowes go green again. This time it\u2019s a Red Two \u2013 slightly less urgent but still potentially life-threatening, a woman in Kilburn with chest pains and breathing problems.</p> <p>She is sitting on the stairs of her house when we arrive six minutes later. She looks remarkably well, and within about two minutes of arriving Lowes has diagnosed an anxiety attack. She had a heart bypass operation five years earlier, and clearly fears a heart attack. She has already been to hospital for a checkup that day, and now wants to go back, despite getting the all-clear earlier. It is unlikely there is a serious problem, but Lowes and Donovan can\u2019t take any chances, so take her to the Royal Free. It\u2019s not their most productive couple of hours, but they talk to her respectfully, calm her down, deliver her to A&amp;E and fill in a fresh set of forms.</p> <p>It\u2019s now 3 o\u2019clock, and we\u2019re on our way back to Kilburn. This time they\u2019ve received a less urgent C2 call, after an earlier Red One to another fatality was aborted. The monitor in the ambulance advises \u201cman in his 70s with severe behavioural change\u201d. When we get to the flat, we find an elderly man close to collapse \u2013 probably through dehydration \u2013 and his wife at the end of her tether. She thinks he has undiagnosed dementia, and there are suggestions he can be violent towards his family, though today he can barely raise himself from the sofa.</p> <p>It is an example of the social work side of paramedics\u2019 work. They check him over physically, but he is in reasonable shape apart from the dehydration. What he may need very soon is a place in a care home. That is the shadow that falls across the conversation Lowes has in the corridor with the man\u2019s wife \u2013 the sad but all-too-common conclusion of a 50-year marriage \u2013 while Donovan talks to the man\u2019s son about sport.</p> <p>As their appearance in the BBC series shows, they are very good at being de facto social workers, counselling the anxious, the elderly, the confused, the demented. \u201cWhen I first started this job, going into people\u2019s homes took a bit of getting used to,\u201d says Donovan, \u201cbut because you\u2019re wearing a uniform, in the eyes of the public you\u2019re a goodie. You\u2019re welcomed into most situations, whether it\u2019s for social reasons or for emergencies.\u201d</p> <p>Lowes calls the man\u2019s GP, who promises to come round. For the moment, there is nothing more that can be done. More paperwork and another cigarette in the afternoon sun. The shift is drawing to a close, and the crew do not fancy any red roulette. There is a general callout for an ambulance, any ambulance, to go to Victoria station, where a girl has fainted. They decide it\u2019s too far and head back to base. That\u2019s enough excitement for the day.</p> <p>As we drive back to Camden, their monitor is reporting that University College hospital has been temporarily closed, St Mary\u2019s in Paddington is accordingly under severe pressure and the Royal Free is \u201cbreaching\u201d \u2013 A&amp;E is missing its waiting targets and patients are being left in ambulances longer than they should be. It\u2019s going to be quite a night shift, and Lowes and Donovan are happy to be out of it. But tomorrow they will be back, and who knows where the spin of the roulette wheel will take them?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/39/ambulance\"><em>Ambulance</em></a><em> starts on BBC1 at 9pm on 27 September. </em></p> <p><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

  "<p>The contest is over, the result was decisive and the question of the Labour leadership is settled. So Jeremy Corbyn is right to move things on and put the Labour party on a general election footing, given that this may well come next May or sooner. It is a recognition that, while creating a \u201csocial movement\u201d has its place, the primary function of a political party is to seek to implement its values in government. How else could we have established the modern welfare state, the NHS, the Equal Pay Act, the minimum wage and more?</p> <p>Divided parties don\u2019t win elections, but the unity we need won\u2019t come through demands and threats. It will come through dialogue and understanding. That is why the nod and wink given by the leadership to threats of deselecting good, hardworking, popular MPs must cease. Our leader has already said he sees no need to change the rules on the selection of parliamentary candidates, so he shut down that counterproductive debate by making it clear that the only talk of removing MPs that will be entertained is replacing Tories with Labour ones at the next general election.</p> <p>Believe it or not, we all share the same values in the Labour party, but there will always be differences of opinion on policy \u2013 that is in the nature of the broad-church political parties we have under our flawed first-past-the-post electoral system. We can\u2019t win under FPTP if any one strand of the Labour tradition is forced out of the party for not being slavishly \u201con message\u201d(I thought we had rightly given \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d the boot several years ago) \u2013 we need to build a coalition of support spanning from left to centre-left to be successful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can address immigration without aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are some MPs who will choose to rejoin the frontbench. Fine. Some, like me, will seek to hold the executive to account through parliament\u2019s increasingly important select committees \u2013 as Margaret Hodge and Tom Watson did in the last parliament in respect of the Murdoch press and big multinationals on tax. Others will run campaigns from the backbenches, like Stella Creasy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/25/stella-creasy-labour-wonga\">crusade against loan sharks</a>. Wes Streeting recently tabled no fewer than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/06/labour-mp-wes-streeting-higher-education-bill-amendments-nus\">30 amendments to make the higher education bill work</a> for students. There are many ways of contributing, and all are vital parts of Labour\u2019s campaign for social justice.</p> <p>To win at the next election we have to be future-facing and relevant to those we represent \u2013 and those we aspire to represent, too. Currently we fail this test. So we must all drag ourselves out of the trenches and look forward. This starts with dumping the obsession with redundant labels, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/20/labour-launches-tougher-policy-on-tsunami-of-online-abuse\">ending the online thuggery and abuse </a>to which too many lifelong Labour members have been subject. \u201cBlairite\u201d is a redundant term \u2013 Tony Blair ceased to be leader almost a decade ago and New Labour is over. Calling Labour people \u201cTories\u201d, \u201cRed Tories\u201d or \u201cTory-lite\u201d is not only juvenile but hardly sends the right message to the millions of people who voted Tory last time whose support we need to form a Labour government \u2013 giving potential converts to our cause the impression we think they are the devil incarnate is a curious way to win them over.</p> <p>And to be relevant it is no good endlessly talking about the things we like to talk about to those with whom we agree. In order to grow our support and win an election, I want to see our leadership addressing our weaknesses and engaging on the difficult issues where many take a different view from us. You cannot duck the difficult issues in the middle of an election campaign. True courage requires us to find a Labour response that talks to those concerns, heals the divisions in society and is consistent with our values.</p> <p>It is extraordinary \u2013 given that a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/\">third of Labour voters opted to leave the European Union</a> and took a different view from the party\u2019s official position on the EU referendum \u2013 that immigration hardly featured during this year\u2019s leadership contest. As democrats, we should not ignore the referendum result, which is why I disagree with calls for a second referendum. Nor should we patronise those who voted to leave by simply dismissing them as bigoted and racist.</p> <p>This does not mean aping and accepting the division and prejudice peddled by Ukip \u2013 that should always be challenged. But it does mean recognising that, while immigration has brought huge benefits, it has also posed challenges to local labour markets and to community cohesion. But it need not do so if we put in place the right policies to support communities and move away from a laissez-faire approach to integration.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/jeremy-corbyn-not-unpopular-but-divisive\">Professor John Curtice</a>, the pollster who came closest to predicting the result of the 2015 general election, found that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/21/pollster-john-curtice-warns-labour-majority-2020-election-improbable-politics\">concern about our ability to provide competent government</a>, particularly on the economy \u2013 aside from any considerations of ideological positioning \u2013 that did most to deny us office in last year\u2019s election. Even if voters did not believe the economy had improved under the Tories, too few believed it would get any better under Labour. This is still a widespread concern, more than a year on from that election. We rightly oppose the austerity of the Tories, but what exactly is our alternative? </p> <p>A prerequisite to the inclusive prosperity that will increase equality and reduce poverty is growth. This requires an innovative economy in which productive businesses, the state and citizens work together to create wealth and ensure that globalisation works for many more people. Investment is important \u2013 particularly in affordable housing \u2013 but a simple arms race on investment spending will not solve the long-term challenges presented by automation displacing people\u2019s jobs and the competition coming from emerging market economies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/labour-moderates-learn-lessons-team-corbyn-andrew-rawnsley\">If you can\u2019t beat Jeremy Corbyn, you\u2019d better try to learn from him | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nationally, we must take a view on which UK sectors can be winners globally and back them to the hilt through active government.

At higher-ranking institutions, the figure tops 20%. They include some of the leading researchers in the country: more than half the European research council\u2019s prestigious mid-career grants in the UK are held by EU researchers.</p> <p>The pro-remain campaign group <a href=\"http://scientistsforeu.uk/\">Scientists for EU</a>, which has been collecting evidence on the impact of the Brexit vote, said it has received more than 430 responses, including nearly 30 cases of EU nationals turning down UK jobs or withdrawing applications, and eight of EU academics who were working in Britain and have left.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The group also received 40 reports from British members of international research projects, who were being asked by their EU partners to scale down their role or withdraw from the consortium altogether, and nearly 50 reports citing xenophobia as a concern. Several people said they had personally experienced abuse, such as being told to go home. </p> <p>More than 120 EU academics said they harboured fears about the future of UK science or prospects for their own careers if they remained in Britain, while more than 90 said they or their colleagues were making concrete plans to leave the UK as a result of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Some have already applied to do so. Giorgio Bellettini, an Italian economics professor, said he had noticed a sudden post-referendum spike in applications for a vacancy in his department at the University of Bologna.</p> <p>\u201cBefore 23 June, we had seven applicants from the UK in two-and-a-half months,\u201d Bellettini said. \u201cThen on 24 and 25 [June] alone, we had 12, including six Italians ...

It wants future immigration reforms to reflect the importance to the UK of international students and academic employees.</p> <p>But many EU academics are not sure they will wait. Mar\u00eda Huete-Ortega, a postdoctoral researcher at Sheffield University working in algae biotechnology, and her husband, Javier Iglesias-Gonz\u00e1lez, who is doing postdoctoral research into embryo development and regeneration at Manchester University, said the referendum result marked \u201cone of the saddest days\u201d of their lives. </p> <p>\u201cWe came to the UK because the research opportunities were so much better than in Spain after the economic crisis,\u201d Huete-Ortega said. \u201cWe thought we would stay and make our life here, and have a family.

Gutted, in fact. I couldn\u2019t even vote. Northern Ireland voted to remain, so at least my local community still wants me. But I feel there is little incentive to stay.\u201d </p> <p>Dillenburger, who has brought her university more than \u00a31m in research income, much of it European, and set up two successful master\u2019s courses, said she was \u201calready not getting the emails about future international collaborations I would have been getting before. UK universities are becoming irrelevant\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Ladomery, an Italian associate professor of biomedical science at the University of the West of England, said he too felt very uncomfortable. \u201cThe nationalistic and xenophobic climate really puts me off, and I don\u2019t want my child to be exposed to it,\u201d he said. Ladomery said he had received \u201cno interest whatsoever from EU applicants\u201d for a recently advertised, fully funded research fellowship. </p> <p>British academics are also considering moving away. Helen Fletcher, an associate professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Horizon 2020 funding for her consortium of about 30 Europe-wide partners was secure for the next two years. </p> <p>But because she is British, her continental partners are \u201cworried for the future ... They are thinking of the next tranche of funding,\u201d Fletcher said, adding that she would seek future funding through UK sources, rather than Horizon 2020. </p> <p>\u201cMy home is here, in the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if it gets to the point that I can\u2019t get research funding because the environment is detrimental to that, then I would move.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Off the coast of San Diego, America\u2019s eighth largest city, commercial fishermen harvest about 1,100 metric tons of seafood from the Pacific every year.<br></p> <p>That sounds like a lot. But it isn\u2019t much to Don Kent, who says he can do better with just one fish farm.</p> <p>If Kent gets his way, he would raise 5,000 metric tons of yellowtail jack and white sea bass in a grid of net pens measuring about a square mile, anchored four miles off San Diego in federal waters.

Whether consumers know it or not, about half of that is farmed in aquaculture facilities much like the one Kent wants to build. While the federal government has permitted shellfish farming for years, it didn\u2019t allow farming of finfish such as bass and salmon until earlier this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/15/wild-caught-salmon-seafood-sustainable-alaska-fishing\">This Colorado poet is disrupting Alaska\u2019s commercial fishing industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy are we buying all of our yellowtail from farms in Japan when I could grow them four miles off our coast and lower the carbon footprint and the trade deficit at the same time?\u201d says Kent, president and CEO of<a href=\"http://rosecanyonfisheries.com/\"> Rose Canyon Fisheries</a>, which aims to build the project. \u201cThis is done around the world. It\u2019s just not done here.\u201d</p> <p>But Kent isn\u2019t likely to get approval soon, because the location is all wrong. The government is eager to promote offshore fish farming to alleviate pressure on overfished wild species. But it wants that to happen first in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Marine Fisheries Service adopted its first rules for finfish farming in federal waters for the gulf region in January this year. Next up is the Pacific Islands region around Guam, Hawaii and Samoa, where in August the agency began preparing a report to analyze the environmental impact of aquaculture.</p> <p>The mismatch between the proposal\u2019s location and the new rules reflects the government\u2019s difficulties in incubating a new industry. Kent\u2019s proposal, first submitted in October 2014, is the only fish farm proposal that the federal government has received so far. A lawsuit filed in February contends the new rules for the Gulf of Mexico could significantly harm the environment and commercial fishing, and it may be keeping away potential applicants who want to wait for the case\u2019s resolution before filing plans.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this on an industrial scale until we have better information,\u201d says Marianne Cufone, a professor of environmental law at Loyola Law School in New Orleans. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible the Gulf of Mexico will be altered forever if we move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Raising fish in coastal farms isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet in federal waters, which range from 3-200 miles offshore.

They are fed a diet that may include other fish \u2013 waste from canneries and commercial fishing \u2013 and processed pellets that may include corn, soybeans and other vegetables along with fish byproducts.</p> <p>The US is currently a small player in running coastal fish farms, though its long coastlines and<a href=\"http://www.afdf.org/wp-content/uploads/14d-The-Political-Economics-of-Marine-Aquaculture-in-the-US-Knapp-and-Rubino-2016.pdf\"> appetite for seafood could change that</a>.<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5798e.pdf\"> Norway leads the world</a>, followed by China, Chile, Indonesia and the Philippines, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> <p>Opening up the far offshore could ease the nation\u2019s trade imbalance in fish commerce and rebuild waterfront industries that have slipped away as a result of overfishing, says Dianne Windham, aquaculture coordinator for the West Coast region of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p> <p>\u201cI think we actually have a great opportunity here to pursue the responsible and sustainable development of offshore aquaculture, and set the standard for what it ought to look like,\u201d Windham says.</p> <p>The opportunity was slow to materialize, though. The new rules for the Gulf of Mexico took 14 years to complete. Congress repeatedly considered \u2013 and then failed \u2013 to pass legislation to legalize offshore fish farming. So the fisheries services stepped in to regulate the industry under the<a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/laws_policies/msa/\"> Magnuson-Stevens</a> Fishery Conservation and Management Act, a law passed in 1976 to govern commercial fishing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for the Gulf of Mexico, but it\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d says Joe Hendrix, president of Seafish Mariculture in Houston, Texas, an aquaculture consulting group. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to implement these things because of a lot of ignorant people who have misplaced concerns.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a78db4ff6663346b00f21f9c74b26be46a0f87/0_0_3072_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adult yellowtail, one of the species Rose Canyon wants to farm off the San Diego coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose Canyon Fisheries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hendrix is referring to critics who say their concerns are very real. This includes the risk of farmed fish escaping from their nets and breeding with wild fish and competing for food; water contamination \u201chot spots\u201d caused by fish excrement leaving the nets; and pharmaceuticals and genetic modifications used in some aquaculture operations. (The US Food and Drug Administration allows<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> 18 different drugs</a> to be used on farmed fish).</p> <p>For instance, the new federal rules for the Gulf of Mexico require permit holders to report to the government only \u201cmajor escapement events\u201d, defined as 10% or more of cultured fish escaping from a pen. Anything less doesn\u2019t require reporting but may still disrupt the feeding and breeding of wild species.</p> <p>Interbreeding is a concern because farmed fish become a weaker genetic line, less able to avoid illness and parasites and to survive the hardships of the open ocean.</p> <p>\u201cTo date, we\u2019ve been unsuccessful in preventing escape from aquaculture facilities,\u201d says Cufone, who is also executive director of the<a href=\"http://www.recirculatingfarms.org/\"> Recirculating Farms Coalition</a>, a nonprofit that promotes aquaponics, a type of aquaculture in which fish and food crops are grown together. The group is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit to halt the aquaculture rules for the gulf. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think we would be 100% successful in the Gulf of Mexico, either.\u201d</p> <p>Examples of escapes are plentiful. In January 2015, for example, some 51,000 farmed Atlantic<a href=\"https://www.asf.ca/public-kept-in-dark-on-aquaculture-isa-and-escapes-in-nb.html\"> salmon escaped</a> from their pens off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada. In another case, farmed salmon have been found in Canada\u2019s Magaguadavic River and the rivers of British Columbia during spawning season.</p> <p>Hendrix and others in the industry counter that escaped fish are not a problem because, raised in pens and hand-fed, they lack the \u201cfitness\u201d to survive for long in the open ocean. In other words, they\u2019ll be eaten by wild fish before they have a chance to compete for food or interbreed.</p> <p>The new aquaculture rules for the Gulf of Mexico also have no conditions governing fish welfare or humane treatment of fish. Other nations, including<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/319323/Opinion_on_the_welfare_of_farmed_fish.pdf\"> Great Britain</a>, have recognized that fish feel pain and stress, and that aquaculture facilities should be designed and managed to prevent such suffering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/11/seafood-industry-sustainable-fishing-salmon-overfishing\">Reeling it in: global sustainable seafood market hits $11.5bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US federal government should have fish welfare rules in place before opening the sea to aquaculture, says Bernard Rollin, a professor of ethics and animal sciences at Colorado State University.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s well known by fish biologists that fish are enormously susceptible to stress, noise and crowding,\u201d says Rollin, a pioneer in the field of agricultural animal welfare. \u201cIf you screw it up, they\u2019ll all die.\u201d</p> <p>The fight over developing a sustainable industry means a longer wait for fish farm developers like Kent, who grew up in San Diego and remembers the city waterfront was once known as \u201cTuna Town\u201d because it served a huge tuna fishing fleet with businesses that built boats, repaired equipment, caught and processed fish. That work mostly left for Asia when regulations and public sentiment arose in the 1970s against the bycatch of dolphins by tuna fishermen.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got a working waterfront where the only work it\u2019s doing is entertaining people. It\u2019s not feeding people,\u201d says Kent, who is also CEO of Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, a nonprofit arm of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment.</p> <p>Kent says his $50m Rose Canyon project would generate 200 jobs for the region and employ newer cage technology that is submersible, a design that prevents the cages from getting destroyed by tussling waves during storms.</p> <p>Rose Canyon already faces opposition from environmental groups, and commercial fishermen are concerned that aquaculture could affect the wild fishery.</p> <p>Peter Halmay, a commercial fisherman based in San Diego and founder of the<a href=\"http://communityfisheriesnetwork.net/SDFWG.html\"> San Diego Fishermen\u2019s Working Group</a>, worries that farmed fish could develop viruses during captivity that would be released into the ocean and devastate native fish.</p> <p>He\u2019d rather see the government continue working to revitalize commercial fishing. For example, catch limits have been in place for years to limit harvest of important species, especially numerous varieties of rockfish. These programs have been successful, he says, and it will soon be time to increase catch limits again, a move that holds a lot of promise for the industry.</p> <p>\u201cOur vision is for a vibrant working waterfront based on the capture of wild fish,\u201d Halmay said. \u201cOnly if this project is a supplement to this vision will it work.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On a hot day in late August, <a href=\"http://www.linmanuel.com\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> sits in a lecture theatre at Columbia University in uptown Manhattan, fizzing with the kind of energy that only comes, one imagines, from the experience of creating a billion-dollar Broadway show. Two weeks earlier, Miranda took his last bow before leaving the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/18/hamilton-review-founding-father-gets-a-hip-hop-makeover\">Hamilton</a>, the rap musical he wrote and starred in and for which the word <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/how-did-hamilton-become-broadway-breakout-hit\">\u201chit\u201d seems, at this point, inadequate</a>.</p> <p>Since its opening last year, not only has Hamilton sold $1bn worth of tickets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/18/hamilton-pulizer-prize-drama-lin-manuel-miranda\">won a Pulitzer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/13/tony-awards-2016-winners-hamilton-the-humans-broadway\">11 Tonys</a> and become the most successful Broadway opening of all time, but Miranda has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/03/hamilton-tony-awards-broadway-lin-manuel-miranda\">credited with everything</a> from reinventing musical theatre to revolutionising the way Americans think about their own history. He has rapped with Barack Obama in the Rose Garden, been quoted by Hillary Clinton in her speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president, and seen his beard and ponytail combo become almost iconic. Such is the pitch of his fame that it is hard, today, not to encounter the 36-year-old, who is slight and boyish and unexpectedly clean shaven, and not simply burst into laughter. What does one do after a year like Miranda\u2019s, I ask. He grins widely. \u201cYou cut your hair off,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The success of Hamilton, which tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, <a href=\"http://www.constitutionday.com/hamilton-alexander-ny.html\">one of America\u2019s lesser-known founding fathers</a>, from the American revolution to the drafting of the constitution, is down in large part to a brilliant cast, made up almost entirely of African-American and Hispanic performers, and told exclusively in rap. In that one act, Miranda simultaneously upended expectations of American history, made a point about inclusion, and also found the perfect idiom for the story at hand; after watching Hamilton, you find yourself wondering how the tale of a scrappy, post-revolutionary nation being born could ever have been told in a medium other than hip-hop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5cb0846a904fe8124908725e64bbf440bc0e18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5cb0846a904fe8124908725e64bbf440bc0e18/0_110_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda \u2013 minus the pony-tail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Tony Awards Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is rare for a Broadway show to cross over and become cool with other genres of musician; at its height, even a hit such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/26/the-producers-musicals-we-love-nathan-lane-mel-brooks\">The Producers</a> had a limited appeal. On any given night at Hamilton, however, so many celebrities were present that Miranda and the cast would joke that \u201cthe internet came to see the show tonight\u201d. A single example: \u201cBusta Rhymes coming on the same night as Mandy Patinkin and Salman Rushdie. It was the dream dinner party every night.\u201d (Or, almost every night; there was the one at which Dick Cheney sat chuckling away in the front row.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/16/spamilton-hamilton-parody-triad-new-york-lin-manuel-miranda\">Spamilton: Hamilton parody is a supplement, not a substitute</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the day I saw the show, mounted police patrolled the street, the queue stretched around the block and ticket holders looked with pity across the way at the poor sods queuing up for Finding Neverland. Compared with the drama outside, the show itself was, almost inevitably, anticlimactic; original, funny, shocking, but still, you know, a Broadway show, rather than the announcement of the second coming.</p> <p>It was, nonetheless, breathtaking, a combination of dazzling verbosity and polysyllabic brilliance, combined with the deep joy and bathos of rapping about dull subjects such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers\">the Federalist Papers</a> with the fever of a rap battle: \u201cThomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President / Reticent \u2013 there isn\u2019t a plan he doesn\u2019t jettison / Madison, you\u2019re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine / Damn, you\u2019re in worse shape than the national debt is in.\u201d And so on. You get the idea.</p> <p>As a result of the subject matter, Miranda\u2019s first expectation for the show was simply that it would be popular with teachers. After its New York run, he envisaged it living on as a worthy staple of community theatre. \u201cI thought, if they can get over our use of the F-word, this will be a good school group show.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deApjIhhhC4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/deApjIhhhC4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a video of scenes from Hamilton, starring Lin-Manuel Miranda</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is only his second Broadway show \u2013 the first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/14/in-the-heights-review-utterly-huggable-musical-lights-up-london\">In the Heights</a>, has just been <a href=\"https://www.intheheightslondon.com/\">extended in London</a> \u2013 and Miranda is still reminded daily of the fact that, 10 years ago, he was a supply teacher. In spite of the fact that his estimated royalties from the show total a mind-boggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/hamilton-musical-creator-lin-manuel-miranda-royalties\">$105,000 a week</a>, he still flies commercial \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t care about private jets\u201d \u2013 and lives a stone\u2019s throw from his old neighbourhood in Upper Manhattan; the reason we meet at Columbia is that it is around the corner from the apartment Miranda shares with his wife Vanessa and their 18-month-old son Sebastian, who was born two weeks before rehearsals for Hamilton started. (It strikes me that, were Miranda a woman, much more would have been made of this timing \u2013 the difficulty of having to be on stage every night with an infant at home. As it is, he says, it all worked out fine because, in spite of being \u201ca very sleepless two years, my wife is a superhero. That\u2019s the answer.\u201d)</p> <p>Clearly, Miranda works hard to keep himself grounded and surviving the experience has, he says, been a question of \u201cstaying on top of the emotions\u201d. Nonetheless, so feverish has the acclaim for Hamilton been, I wonder if, as the frenzy around it grew, he ever thought; \u201cGod, what have I done?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/01/lin-manuel-miranda-ancestry-hamilton-mexico-texas\">Lin-Manuel Miranda's ancestry is as multifaceted as Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He shout-laughs. \u201cWhat have I done?! I have to give enormous credit to [the director] Tommy Kail, who\u2019s great at keeping the temperature low inside the theatre, especially when we moved to Broadway and the yell became a roar. That never came into the studio where we were working.\u201d Instead, he says, they carried on with business as usual, telling themselves: \u201cWe\u2019re making our thing better and still have 10 things a day to fix.\u201d</p> <p>One of the current questions surrounding Hamilton, as preparations are made for it to be rolled out, Phantom of the Opera-style, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/10/hamilton-the-musical-transfer-west-end-london-lin-manuel-miranda-broadway-tonies\">across the world</a>, is how hard it will be for foreign audiences to love a show that rests, in large part, on knowledge of, and interest in, the American origin story. The life of Alexander Hamilton is a great tale, but the show\u2019s real resonance comes from its interrogation of the American national character.</p> <p>\u201cI think that if we\u2019ve done our job well and we articulate this individual\u2019s life well, the themes inherent in that translate,\u201d says Miranda. \u201cIt\u2019s about legacy, about how much do we do with the time we\u2019re given? And then there are themes that wrestle with the American character, but only in that Hamilton\u2019s life is a rough-draft version of the arguments we still have as a country.\u201d These too, he hopes, will travel. He tells the story of what happened when Fiddler on the Roof made its Japanese debut, after which a theatre-goer approached the producers and said: \u201cThey like it in America? But it\u2019s so Japanese!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e2ac9dd2ecd7a446e0fd3b7f70bc71db2b54908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2ac9dd2ecd7a446e0fd3b7f70bc71db2b54908/0_185_1733_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda and other cast members of Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda and other cast members of Hamilton at the Public Theater, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miranda sees the arguments started by the founding fathers as analogous to his fights with his sister. \u201cThe arguments a country has are its family arguments. I fight with my sister and it\u2019s a version of the fight we had when she was 16 and I was 10. I think that\u2019s true of both countries and families. We\u2019ll always argue about the size of government in our lives and the role we play in the affairs of other countries.\u201d</p> <p>That these dry-sounding debates should animate such an electric show is, of course, a reflection of the scale of Miranda\u2019s talent and his success in answering the challenge set up in the opening line, rapped by Aaron Burr, nemesis to Hamilton and foil to his character: \u201cHow does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore / And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot / In the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor / Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?\u201d</p> <p>Miranda says: \u201cI think I threw the ball very high in the air with the opening line of the show. This big-ass run-on sentence, and we are going to purport to try to answer it. How does he get from here, to here?\u201d In the first version of Hamilton, which was written for the Public Theater, off-Broadway, Miranda combined song and speech in a much more conventional-looking show. It didn\u2019t work, \u201cbecause the songs \u2013 especially our opening number \u2013 is really heightened speech, with melody in it. So when we went to regular speech, you could feel the audience pull out.\u201d At some point, Miranda realised he was going to have to dispense with a script and simply \u201cmusicalise every second\u201d of the show, a huge undertaking and one that saw him wandering around his neighbourhood muttering to himself every day, as he tried to fit lyrics to music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6274d39ed1039c4304cde3c0025df684db81db64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6274d39ed1039c4304cde3c0025df684db81db64/0_396_4228_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The London cast of In The Heights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The London cast of In the Heights, Miranda\u2019s first foray on to the Broadway stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had never wanted to be a solo rap star, he says. \u201cMy ego is healthy, but it doesn\u2019t extend in that direction.\u201d Instead, from school age onwards, he had only ever wanted to be involved in the theatre. His parents had moved to New York from Puerto Rico before Miranda was born and landed in Upper Manhattan, where his mother was a psychologist and his father a political adviser to, among others, former New York mayor Ed Koch.</p> <p>Miranda grew up in a household rich in intellect but not particularly wealthy and he was aware, at college, that sacrifices were being made in order to educate him. As a result, he was highly motivated and started writing In the Heights, a show about his Washington Heights neighbourhood, before he graduated, slogging away at it for the next six years while working as a supply teacher to pay the rent, until, in what he still regards as a miracle, it came to Broadway. Overnight, \u201cI went from being a professional substitute teacher to a Broadway composer.\u201d It was, he says, an even more \u201cdrastic life change\u201d than the one brought about by the success of Hamilton.</p> <p>In the Heights was a hit, winning four Tony awards, but the one disappointment was that it didn\u2019t bring Miranda the interest or admiration of his heroes in the rap community. As an adolescent, did the part of him that loved hip-hop disparage the part that loved Broadway musicals? No, he says. \u201cThere are a few people who only like hip-hop music, and a few who only like theatre music, and the rest of us just like good shit. It doesn\u2019t matter what form it comes in. I think we\u2019re all a lot more eclectic than we give ourselves credit for. And I feel lucky to have grown up in the era when we made mix cassettes. I think it affected how I write scores. Because when you\u2019re making a mix tape for your friends, it\u2019s 90 minutes of music, in the order in which you curate it, so you\u2019re creating the ebb and flow. That prepared me to write scores more than anything else. You want to surprise them, tell them how you feel about them, you want to express the wealth of your taste. How is that different from writing a Broadway score?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/16/hamilton-broadway-film-lin-manuel-miranda-original-cast\">Hamilton's original Broadway cast to be filmed before Lin-Manuel Miranda exits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Can he remember any of his mix tapes from that era? \u201cYes. I still think of the mix tape my friend Antonia made me that had both Sam Cooke\u2019s Bring it On Home to Me and D\u2019yer Mak\u2019er from Led Zeppelin, which were the first two songs on side B. When I grew up, one of my favourite artists was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/30/weird-al-yankovic-interview\">Weird Al</a>, who taught me that genre is just the clothes of the artist. Instrumentation can change, but we\u2019re all dealing with the same 12 tones and a good melody is a good melody.\u201d</p> <p>For Miranda, one of the most gratifying aspects of Hamilton\u2019s success has, therefore, been the fact that every high-profile rapper in the US has dropped backstage to tell him how much they love the show. \u201cWhat hip-hop artists pick up on that your average theatre-goer doesn\u2019t is that I\u2019m using different flows for every character, the way a classical composer would use a different theme in, say, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfM7Y9Pcdzw\">Peter and the Wolf</a>. Everyone raps in a way that is consistent with their character and I\u2019m modelling that after my favourite hip-hop artists. Hercules Mulligan is Busta Rhymes in my brain, and Hamilton is from the school of Eminem and Big Pun, where it\u2019s how many syllables can I rhyme within a line, versus [George] Washington, which is much more straightforward and on the down beat. Because that\u2019s who Washington is. Very regimented and a moral authority. To hear what Eminem, Andr\u00e9 3000, or Chris Rock caught that I embedded in there \u2013 that is really fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc87ff3ec81ba0da802744ee50f32d1a4c339f6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc87ff3ec81ba0da802744ee50f32d1a4c339f6a/0_52_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamilton cast at Tony awards June 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Song and dance man: an extract from Hamilton being performed at the Tony awards in June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, the period after his exit from the show, could have been an anticlimax for Miranda but, for now, he says, he is happy finishing up some back-burner projects \u2013 the score for the Disney animated movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFuXETZUsI\">Moana</a> and the filming of a <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/disney-announces-release-date-for-mary-poppins-sequel-1201785893/\">Mary Poppins sequel</a> opposite Emily Blunt.

Failure is the norm. So you have to walk away from the years that you spent on something, thinking: \u2018I did it for these reasons and I got that.\u2019 Financial success cannot be your goal. But if your goal is, \u2018I want to tell this story\u2019, or \u2018I want to learn from working with these people\u2019, then things have a good chance of working out.\u201d</p> <p>It is also a question of understanding one\u2019s own motivation, he says. \u201cI think when you\u2019re making something, you\u2019re trying to fall in love with it; to express the best version of that idea.

  "<p>La Cressonniere, who had been France\u2019s best hope of a home victory in next Sunday\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, will miss the race. The unbeaten winner of the French Oaks was found to have a minor injury after exercise on Saturday and will be treated with anti-inflammatories which will not clear the filly\u2019s system in time for her to take part.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a problem, not a very strong problem but we had to do treatment and that means we cannot run her on Sunday,\u201d said her trainer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/makahiki-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-chantilly-aidan-obrien-derby-curragh-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Rouget,</a> who is based in Pau. \u201cIt\u2019s not very important for the future but enough for her not to run on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what it is,\u201d added Rouget, who suggested the problem may originate in the filly\u2019s pelvis or vertebrae. But he expects her to recover in time to play a full part in the 2017 season.</p> <p>La Cressonniere had been 5-1 second-favourite to give Rouget a first victory in the Arc. He immediately quashed speculation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/almanzor-irish-champion-stakes-christophe-soumillon-frankie-dettori\" title=\"\">Almanzor,</a> who is in the same ownership, might take her place in the Chantilly contest, saying: \u201cAlmanzor will not run. He will go to Ascot.\u201d</p> <p>Even so Almanzor shortened to 15-1 for the Arc on the Betfair betting exchange. The winner of the French Derby and a hotly contested Irish Champion Stakes, he had been trading above 40-1 prior to the news about his stablemate. His Ascot target is the Champion Stakes on 15 October, for which he is 5-2 favourite.</p> <p>Postponed shortened to 2-1 from 11-4 for the Arc after La Cressonniere was ruled out. The five-year-old was reported in good health by his Newmarket trainer, Roger Varian, who was pleased by his final bit of fast work on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cHe went well over nine furlongs and Andrea [Atzeni] was very happy with him,\u201d Varian said. \u201cHe\u2019ll do routine exercise every day and he might have a blow before the race but the bulk of his main work is done now and hopefully we\u2019ll get a smooth run from here.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief to get to this stage, obviously. You can\u2019t go into these races undercooked, so a certain amount of tough work is required and unfortunately it can be in those tough bits of work that things can go wrong or problems can be revealed.\u201d</p> <p>A final bit of work on Tuesday morning will determine whether the Derby winner, Harzand, takes part in the Arc. The colt was injured when a rival struck into him in the Irish Champion this month and his trainer, Dermot Weld, hopes to see confirmation that the horse has recovered and is fit enough to take his chance in Europe\u2019s most prestigious Flat race.</p> <p>Weld has another possible runner in Fascinating Rock, the winner of last year\u2019s Champion Stakes at Ascot, whose target will also be determined on Tuesday. \u201cHarzand will do a bit of work on Tuesday, as will Fascinating Rock, and we\u2019ll make a decision after that,\u201d the Curragh trainer said. He added that Harzand would \u201cmost likely\u201d take part in the Arc, having appeared to make a good recovery from the incident just over a fortnight ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/james-doyle-loses-leading-saeed-bin-suroor-william-buick\">James Doyle loses leading role for Saeed bin Suroor as William Buick books in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe had a V-shaped cut in a back leg and initially we thought he\u2019d need three stitches but we got away without it,\u201d Weld said. \u201cThere was a lot of bruising but he\u2019s healed well; he shows good healing, this horse. We\u2019ve got the bruising under control and he\u2019s back in full swing.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed as to whether the horse could be close to his peak fitness after such a preparation, Weld said: \u201cTime reveals all. Look, it was a hold-up. We\u2019d rather he hadn\u2019t had it but he\u2019s back in full swing now.\u201d</p> <p>Harzand has already shown remarkable powers of recovery, having spent the morning of the Derby with one foot in a bucket of ice, the consequence of pulling a shoe off during the journey to Epsom. He won again in the Irish Derby later in June but was having his first run since when injured in the Leopardstown race, finishing eighth of 12.</p> <p>Fascinating Rock was also beaten in his reappearance race after a midsummer break, finishing strongly but too late to catch Success Days at The Curragh in August. Having missed the Irish Champion because his blood was not quite right in the last few days beforehand, he could go to the Arc or back to Ascot a fortnight later.</p> <p>Weld pointed out that the five-year-old has won over the Arc\u2019s mile and a half but conceded that the shorter distance of the Champion Stakes is a better fit for the horse. \u201cHis best trip would appear to be 10 furlongs, I think we have to accept that. But he\u2019ll do a little bit of work on Tuesday and we\u2019ll make a call then.\u201d He has not decided who would ride in the event of Fascinating Rock lining up at Chantilly.</p> <p>Harzand is a 10-1 shot to give the 68-year-old Weld his first win in the Arc, while Fascinating Rock is generally on offer at 25-1.</p> <p>While Postponed has proved versatile as to ground, the early signs are that Harzand and Fascinating Rock may not get the cut underfoot at Chantilly that suits them best. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if they\u2019re not racing on something close to good,\u201d Varian said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good for Trials Day [a fortnight ago] and it\u2019s been largely dry since. They\u2019re due a bit of rain today and it\u2019ll be dry thereafter, cooler temperatures but not cold.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, there have been a handful of times this year when we\u2019ve had that kind of forecast and then the complexion has changed completely by the time the weekend comes around.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Brien clarified his Arc plans, suggesting that the star filly Minding would skip the French race in favour of Champions Day at Ascot, where she has three possible targets. O\u2019Brien expects to rely on three others in the Arc: Order Of St George, winner of the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, Highland Reel, whose year peaked with victory in the King George, and Found, who has been second in her last five races, including in the Irish Champion.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien presumably has alternative plans for Seventh Heaven, Idaho and US Army Ranger, who all feature in betting lists for the Arc.</p>",

However, May declined to back that promise this month when she travelled to the G20 in Beijing.</p> <p>Johnson was pressed on the extra money for the NHS after Andrew Lansley, the former health secretary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37435648\">suggested at least \u00a35bn could be available to the NHS </a>after Brexit. Asked whether the government could guarantee a \u201creally substantial\u201d extra amount of money per week for the NHS by 2020, Johnson said: \u201cWell, yes, in the sense that clearly once we leave, and that isn\u2019t possible until the final moment that of the change in our arrangements, and we take back control of the budgets we contribute to the EU.</p> <p>\u201cOnce that happens, clearly it will be possible for the UK government to spend people\u2019s money on our priorities.

Romney, Rendell said, \u201cwas a very good suburban Republican candidate.

The Guerrero-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Revolutionary_Army\">Popular Revolutionary Army</a>, however, staged attacks on oil facilities as recently as 2007 and has since been blamed for kidnappings and violent demonstrations.</p> <p>The longest-enduring groups, however, are in Peru, Paraguay and Colombia \u2013 all countries that are not coincidentally centres of drug production and smuggling, which is a source of funds and guns.<br></p> <p>Last month, the small Paraguayan People\u2019s Army carried out an attack that killed eight soldiers. But it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/paraguay-guerrillas-epp-aca\">lost several of its leaders in recent years and is thought to have only between 20 and 150 members</a>, which makes it more of a local gang than a national threat. The same might be said for Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru. Once a formidable force, it was blamed for more than 30,000 killings between 1980 and 2000.

In 2012, the weakened rebels agreed to begin negotiating a peace deal. At the time, leftist governments were in power across the region, giving the Farc confidence that since they were unable to take power via their armed struggle, they might achieve it through the ballot box. <br></p> <p>Before his death, former Venezuela president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 a former army officer who attempted a failed coup before securing power in an election \u2013 declared <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/armed-revolution-in-latin-america-is-over-says-chavez-843553.html\">armed guerrilla movements to be \u201cout of place</a>\u201d, a conclusion reached many years ago by his allies in Cuba, Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro. They have been key backers of the Colombian peace process and fittingly hosted the negotiations that led to the end of an era that also began in Cuba.</p> <p>Malcolm Deas, of the Latin American Centre at Oxford University, said the Farc is the last of the major guerrilla insurgencies inspired by Castro and Che Guevara, but argues that the significance of the deal should not be overstated, partly because the smaller ELN is still active, but also because the armed struggle in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America never genuinely threatened the stability of one of the world\u2019s most peaceful continents.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo say this is like a civil war is very much an exaggeration. The struggle is at a very low level. It hasn\u2019t really affected urban life very much.

But for most of its history the National Liberation Army (ELN) has played second fiddle to the country\u2019s larger and more powerful Farc.<br></p> <p>Now that the Farc have committed to lay down their weapons and shift to party politics, the ELN \u2013 founded the same year as the Farc in 1964 \u2013 becomes the oldest and largest insurgency in Latin America. </p> <p>\u201cThe ELN have lived in the shadow of the Farc,\u201d says Jerry McDermott, director of InSight Crime, a thinktank that studies insurgencies and organised crime in Latin America. \u201cNow will be the first time they will be in the limelight they have always craved,\u201d McDermott says.</p> <p>From the beginning, the ELN combined Marxist-Leninist ideology with liberation theology; some of the group\u2019s first recruits came from the church, including Camilo Torres, a popular Colombian priest who died in his first battle in 1966 and later became a cultural icon of the group. The group was nearly decimated in the 1970s as a result of a military offensive and internal fractures that led to bloody purges. </p> <p>But it recovered, and at its peak in the 1990s boasted an army of 5,000, after turning to kidnapping, extortion of oil companies and involvement in the drug trade. The group earned international notoriety in 1999, with the kidnapping of 186 people from a Cali church, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/28/features11.g23\">hijacking of a passenger aircraft</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f3bcb82aba54e8ca6eb1abae3597800e5e5f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f3bcb82aba54e8ca6eb1abae3597800e5e5f97/0_97_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti for the ELN is seen at the entrance of the cemetery of El Palo, Cauca, Colombia, on 10 February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti for the ELN is seen at the entrance of the cemetery of El Palo, Cauca, Colombia, on 10 February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaime Saldarriaga/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of the ELN negotiating a peace deal with the government remains remote, despite an announcement in March that the two sides were ready to begin talks. Strong anecdotal evidence is emerging that as the Farc move out from areas historically under its control, ELN units are moving in, scooping up some dissident Farc fighters.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ELN, while hardly a threat to the state, is still potentially disruptive. \u201cThey can\u2019t take power but they can be a right pain in the ass for a very long time,\u201d says McDermott. </p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Shining Path, Peru</strong> </p> <p><strong>Estimated size:</strong> 300 combatants</p> <p>Founded in the late 1960s by philosophy professor<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n\"> Abimael Guzm\u00e1n</a>, Sendero Luminoso expanded rapidly \u2013 and initially peacefully \u2013 in the 1970s by recruiting university students. But in 1980, it declared war on \u201cbourgeois democracy\u201d, burned ballot boxes and established military bases and training camps in the Andean highlands, where they won the support of poor local farmers. </p> <p>In the years that followed, there were massacres on both sides. Shining Path guerrillas set off bombs in Lima and killed dozens of individuals, including rival Marxist leaders and union bosses. By its peak in 1991, the movement controlled much of south and central Peru but came under fierce assault from the armed forces during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, who was also blamed for massacres and human rights abuses. </p> <p>A 2003 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report estimated Shining Path was responsible for just over half the 69,280 people who were killed or went missing from 1980 to 2000 as a result of armed conflict in Peru. The security forces were blamed for about a third of the casualties and the rest were attributed to militias and other guerrilla groups, including the now defunct T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.</p> <p> Following the arrest of Guzm\u00e1n in 1992, Shining Path has declined and the government declared it destroyed in 2012. But the group is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/artemio-peru-shining-path-commander\">rumoured to have made a comeback</a> in recent years. At least one faction continues to be active in cocaine production and sporadic attacks, most recently on the eve of this year\u2019s election, when eight soldiers and two civilians were killed.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.bydanslater.com/\">Dan Slater</a>\u2019s new non-fiction book <a href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Wolf-Boys/Dan-Slater/9781501126543\">Wolf Boys </a>recounts the story of two Mexican-American teens in Texas seduced by the violent cartels across the border and the Mexican-born Texas detective who hunts them. It is grim and violent, yet it is a detailed and thoughtful look at American society and the war on drugs. It has also been condemned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Directors Review Committee, which <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/a-nonfiction-book-about-drug-cartels-has-been-bann.html\">declared Wolf Boys off limits to all Texas prisoners </a>before it was even published this month.<br></p> <p> TDCJ spokesman Jason Clark cites one page, which \u201ccontains information on how to conceal and smuggle illegal narcotics.\u201d In other words, while the book shows the downfall of the two boys who cross over to the dark side - both are serving decades in the TDCJ system \u2014 it was banished for these two sentences on page 124:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mario purchased pickup trucks from which he removed panels and lights. The trick was packing the drugs in a part of the vehicle where the body wouldn\u2019t lose its hollow sound when slapped.</p> </blockquote> <p> \u201cThe system is so aggressive and arbitrary,\u201d says Slater. \u201cIf you asked me to name 100 sentences that might have gotten my book banned those would not have made the list.\u201d</p> <p> The TDCJ\u2019s verdict does inadvertently draw attention to <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/bbooks/bannedbooksweek\">Banned Books Week </a>- an annual campaign sponsored by numerous organizations, including <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/\">American Library Association</a> - which begins on Sunday. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s truly tragic,\u201d says the ALA\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom deputy director Deborah Caldwell Stone, referring both to the removal of Wolf Boys and the larger issue. She says prisoners who read tend to behave better and rehabilitate sooner but prison officials care only about maintaining power and control. \u201cThere is probably a new story every day like this.\u201d </p> <p> Paul Wright, executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsdefensecenter.org/\">Human Rights Defense Center</a> and editor of Prison Legal News, says Texas has 15,000 banned books but the list \u201cis growing exponentially. Once a book goes on it never comes off.\u201d </p> <p> The Texas list is not just long but diverse. It includes former Senator <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/an-illustrated-history-of-world-war-ii-bob-dole/1007864597\">Bob Dole\u2019s World War II: An Illustrated History of Crisis and Courage</a>; <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1457464.Ana_s_Story\">Jenna Bush\u2019s Ana\u2019s Story: A Journey of Hope</a>; <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/706.America_The_Book_\">Jon Stewart\u2019s America; A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Democracy Inaction</a>; and 101 Best Family Card Games. Then there are books banned for what TDCJ calls \u201cracial content,\u201d such as <a href=\"http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/truth50/summary.html\">The Narrative of Sojourner Truth</a>, the Texas football classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/feb/13/friday-night-lights\">Friday Night Lights</a>, <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218659.Everything_That_Rises_Must_Converge\">Flannery O\u2019Conner Everything That Rises Must Converge</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/belkin-hero.html\">Lisa Belkin\u2019s Show Me a Hero</a>, which depicts the struggle to desegregate housing in Yonkers, New York in the face of institutional racism.</p> <p> But don\u2019t worry: Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf, David Duke\u2019s Jewish Supremacism, and the Nazi Aryan Youth Primer are all kosher. (Clark would not directly respond regarding this issue.)</p> <p> \u201cTexas is less rational than other states,\u201d says Michelle Dillon program coordinator of the Seattle-based non-profit <a href=\"http://www.bookstoprisoners.net\">Books to Prisoners</a>, although it\u2019s a national problem she adds, particularly in more conservative states in the south. Wright says federal prisons have even banned President Obama\u2019s books.</p> <p> The process for Wolf Boys was an exception. In Texas, as in most states, the judge and jury on a book\u2019s fate is typically an anonymous mailroom clerk, \u201cwho often don\u2019t have high school diplomas,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThe bureaucratic system rubber stamps it from there.\u201d</p> <p> Texas is one of the few states with a comprehensive database; that committee typically acts as a court of appeals. (Prisoners wishing to appeal obviously cannot have a copy of the book to prepare their case.) While most states allow each prison to operate haphazardly, Wright says the states with databases \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina \u2013 \u201care the most systematic and organized in their censorship.\u201d </p> <p> The lists are generally not accessible, Wright says, and the lack of transparency means publishers or groups or people sending books don\u2019t know what\u2019s banned. </p> <p> \u201cThere is no accountability,\u201d Dillon says, adding that some inmates have complained that one clerk might ban a book that another would let through, either because the one clerk is grouchy, doesn\u2019t like the prisoner for whom it is intended, or has more conservative values. Wright says any minority viewpoint\u2014racial, ethnic, political or religious is especially likely to be shot down. </p> <p> But it goes beyond that. A collection of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets and a collection of Leonardo DaVinci\u2019s sketches have both been banished in Texas for sexual content (the Shakespeare edition had a painting with nudity on the cover) while a book like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pleasures-All-Mine-Professional-Submissive/dp/0786716487\">The Pleasure\u2019s All Mine</a>, filled with descriptions of kinky sex made it through. </p> <p> Dillon and Stone both acknowledge that certain books should be banned \u2014 books about lock picking or bomb making, for example. But the paranoid approach taken is a \u201cslippery slope because everything becomes suspicious,\u201d Dillon says, so a prisoner cannot learn about American sign language because it may be used to flash signals or to read biographies of black leaders or about the inequities of our justice system because it may make them less cooperative. </p> <p> \u201cWe understand there are sometimes concerns,\u201d Stone adds, but points out that it would make more sense to take certain books away from specific prisoners (such as books with scenes of rape or pedophilia from people convicted of those crimes) than to create blanket bans. \u201cUnfortunately, the courts have not been friendly to us and support the rights of prison officials instead of the rights of prisoners to educate and rehabilitate themselves.\u201d</p> <p> Wright, who says the \u201cvery, very occasional victories\u201d come in less conservative states, is harsher in his assessment, saying the courts \u201chave abdicated their duty\u201d by letting prison officials make law based on \u201cBecause we said so.\u201d</p> <p> Slater is disheartened by the entire situation. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the dark ages,\u201d Slater says. \u201cI believe strongly in the power of knowledge and enlightenment and in what books can do, especially for someone who is down and who feels a connection to a story.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In March of 2015, after being recruited for months, Ryan Bishop was thrilled to receive an invitation to join his university\u2019s chapter of of Chi Phi, America\u2019s oldest fraternity. But a week before his induction, Chi Phi\u2019s national office notified the Ohio Wesleyan University chapter that Bishop wasn\u2019t eligible. </p> <p>Chi Phi\u2019s official rules only allowed men, and Bishop was born a woman.</p> <p>Bishop was raised in Sofia, Bulgaria. He always said his sex felt wrong, but never felt safe enough to transition in the conservative Balkan country. America offered a sort of gender asylum and so three years ago, on his first night at university, Bishop introduced himself as Ryan. </p> <p>\u201cIt was life changing,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIt felt like the moment I arrived here I was seen as who I truly am, and could just act like myself.\u201d<br><br>Bishop jumped into campus activism and devoted his studies to zoology. Former Chi Phi president Kyle Simon, 22, said he recruited Bishop to join the fraternity because he was so impressive.</p> <p>\u201cRyan represented the best student leader that I had seen as a first year since coming to the university,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAs an international student and transgender, we would get a really amazing person, with another diverse perspective. He was everything I wanted Chi Phi to become.\u201d</p> <p>When Chi Phi rejected Bishop, Simon was shocked and ashamed. \u201cI had sold him on this idea that he could be a fraternity man, and it was a smack in the face,\u201d Simon said.</p> <p>In July, Chi Phi opened membership to transgender individuals that were \u201cmale as defined by valid legal documentation.\u201d The decision was widely publicized and celebrated, but the fine print was ignored.</p> <p>For Bishop, Chi Phi\u2019s requirement for \u201cvalid legal documentation\u201d meant that to join the fraternity, he would need to change his government issued identification and likely undergo costly and intensive sex reassignment surgery.</p> <p>\u201cNot being allowed into the fraternity was humiliating because they were saying, we see you the way you are on paper,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cNo one deserves to be excluded or discriminated against based on their gender or based on genitals.\u201d</p> <p>Chi Phi did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but representatives from Ohio Wesleyan University said the school supports Bishop. </p> <p>\u201cThe issue of transgender students participating in Greek life is important to Ohio Wesleyan on multiple levels,\u201d said Cole Hatcher, media and community relations director for Ohio Wesleyan University. \u201cWe seek to be open, inclusive, and supportive of the LGBTIQ community. The university believes Ryan and all students have the right to participate fully in every aspect of campus life. Therefore, we support Ryan and his effort to participate in Greek life based on his self-identity and not his birth certificate.\u201d</p> <p>Bishop\u2019s experience comes when many institutions defined by gender binaries \u2013 American schools, the US military, and even the International Olympic Committee \u2013 are adopting transgender-inclusive policies. This May, the US Department of Education informed American schools in a <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/index.html\">Dear Colleague letter</a> that it is illegal to discriminate against students based on their gender identity. </p> <p>But Title IX, the US law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs and activities, does not apply to fraternities and sororities. And because gender identity is not a protected class like race, religion, or sexual orientation, individual Greek organizations can decide whether to allow transgender members in, as well as whether membership will be based on gender identity or genitalia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1309604a7a0ce3f24dc88a7b8e8dff5273ab1a86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1309604a7a0ce3f24dc88a7b8e8dff5273ab1a86/0_54_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha Sigma Alpha Bid Day in 2016.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha Sigma Alpha Bid Day in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leigh Angel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greek houses have been central to American university life for more than 200 years. Infamous for raging parties, members tout familial bonds and swear lifelong loyalty. In the US, more than 200,000 students rush Greek houses every year, and some of those individuals identify as transgender.</p> <p>Lawyers say excluding transgender students because of their gender identity could put fraternities at risk of discrimination complaints and threaten their staying power. </p> <p>Currently the policies vary by organization, but several prominent Greek houses have adopted transgender inclusive policies in the last year. The sorority Gamma Rho Lambda is open to all gender identities, and recently opened a new chapter at the University of Texas. The fraternities Sigma Phi Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, Delta Tau Delta, and the sorority Delta Gamma, have also recently changed their bylaws to allow for anyone who \u201cidentifies as\u201d male or female, and don\u2019t require any paperwork.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24d8c304c9d5ba329a7a43c6a9d8ca45b88aa943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24d8c304c9d5ba329a7a43c6a9d8ca45b88aa943/0_65_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Leigh Angel (centre) with her sisters.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leigh Angel (center) with her sisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leigh Angel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leigh Angel, 19, a second-year transgender woman at Adrian College in Michigan, never thought she would be allowed to join a sorority. But then friends from Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority invited her to a party and three weeks later, Angel was asked to join.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt really really amazing to know that I had a home,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single member of the sorority was so open and accepting, and I didn\u2019t imagine every single person in such a large group to be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Angel thinks the process of sorority rush can be intimidating and discourage transgender women from rushing. Unlike fraternity rush, which is usually a few nights of spending time with brothers at one house, the process is more intensive for women, who usually attend a series of parties at many different sororities. At the end of each party, the sorority sisters rank the participants by who they liked the most, and the participants are invited back to the next round of events accordingly.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think many of us feel that if we were to try to rush a sorority we would be rejected almost instantly, and I think that plays a big part of why we don\u2019t see many [transgender women],\u201d Angel said. \u201cThe beauty of what happened to me was that they came to me.\u201d </p> <p>Alpha Sigma Alpha did not respond to requests to clarify their position on transgender membership, and didn\u2019t say if transgender women are welcome to join other chapters of the sorority. </p> <p>Generally, gay friendly organizations are more welcoming to transgender members. Sean Finn, 20, a transgender man at the University of Iowa was welcomed into Delta Lambda Phi, which was founded in 1986 \u201cfor gay men by gay men\u201d. By the time Finn joined, he had begun to transition medically through surgery and hormone therapy, although it wouldn\u2019t have been necessary for membership.</p> <p>Ben Ross, 21, president of Delta Lambda Phi at the University of Iowa, said there was never any question if Finn could join. \u201cWe have a defined set of values and we try to use those values as a benchmark for deciding whether or not someone is the right fit for our organization,\u201d Ross said. \u201cChecking with my national office, and what was written down in our national policy, it was clear to me after reading it that Sean was certainly welcome.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc92c9a51eed88b6cd0df502338e86f13ac71cc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc92c9a51eed88b6cd0df502338e86f13ac71cc3/0_5_1343_806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Finn with fraternity friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Finn with fraternity friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sean Finn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Delta Lambda Phi is committed to accepting transgender men into the fraternity, inviting cis-gendered women, or women who identify with the sex assigned at birth, is still inconceivable. According to Ross, his chapter feels masculinity is deeply rooted in Delta Lambda Phi\u2019s values, and female members would change the club\u2019s basic nature. </p> <p>\u201cI struggle with the idea of a cis-gender female in this organization, and I don\u2019t have a very good reason,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut the justification I can provide for now, is that a similar but not the same experience is open for female-identified individuals through sororities.\u201d</p> <p>Stevie Van Tran, a lawyer and consultant who works on the intersection of Title IX and transgender issues, said the debate over which genders can join which Greek houses could easily end up before the courts.</p> <p>\u201cThis may be the issue that blows open the entire door,\u201d Van Tran said.</p> <p>According to the first amendment of the US constitution, private organizations have the right to define membership on their own terms. But on a university campus, it is very hard to for an organization like a fraternity to be considered completely private. Which means if Greek houses decide they don\u2019t want to let in transgender members, and are willing to fight in court to keep these students out, there is a good chance they\u2019d lose.</p> <p>\u201cA court is going to say: \u2018You say you are a private organization dedicated to building character among men, but you party a lot and you have a lot of activities with the public, so how can you call a 500-member chapter a private organization?\u2019 Then it comes crashing down,\u201d Van Tran explained.</p> <p>It is possible, in the future, all Greek houses will have to become co-ed. In 1990, the supreme court of New Jersey decided that Princeton\u2019s elite fraternity-like eating clubs, Ivy Club and Tiger Inn, had so much contact with the public that they did not qualify as private organizations, and had to allow women to join. Now, all of Princeton\u2019s eating clubs are coed.</p> <p>Harvard is already pushing their fraternities, sororities and finals clubs to drop gender distinctions. In May of this year, Harvard\u2019s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that any student joining an unrecognized single-gender club couldn\u2019t hold leadership positions in campus organizations, athletic teams, and wouldn\u2019t receive recommendations from the school for scholarships or other academic opportunities.</p> <p>For now, Ryan Bishop has given up on joining Chi Phi. He considered a lawsuit against the fraternity, but decided it would be expensive and complicated as an international student to pursue a case. Plus, he feels there has been enough social fall out. </p> <p>\u201cI definitely feel like I have lost friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a visible minority on campus the way that I am it is not at all easy, but I try to fall back on the people that support me.\u201d<br></p> <p>Bishop said he longer feels welcome at Chi Phi, but has found a place for himself on campus and will keep pushing for transgender rights.</p> <p>\u201cCollege is a place to grow and to learn,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cI think it is really important at a place like this to say, listen, \u2018Here\u2019s how things are, it is time to be educated about this,\u2019 and show queer and trans people you are understood, you are accepted, you belong here, and we stand behind you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The German writer Norman Ohler lives on the top floor of a 19th-century apartment building on the south bank of the river Spree in Kreuzberg, Berlin. Visiting him there is a vertiginous experience. For one thing, he works \u2013 and likes to entertain visitors \u2013 in what he calls his \u201cwriting tower\u201d, a flimsy-seeming, glass-walled turret perched right on the very edge of the roof. (Look down, if you dare, and you will see his little boat moored far below.) For another, there is the fact that from this vantage point it is possible to discern two Berlins, one thrusting and breezy, the other spectral and grey. To our left, busy with traffic, is the Oberbaum Bridge, where there was once a cold war checkpoint, and beyond it the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, its doleful length rudely interrupted by the block of luxury flats that went up in 2013. As for the large building immediately opposite, these days it\u2019s the home of Universal Music. Not so very long ago, however, it was the GDR\u2019s egg storage facility.</p> <p>Does all this press on Ohler as he sits at his desk, the light bouncing off the screen of his laptop? Is it ghostly sometimes? \u201cYes, it is strange,\u201d he says, smiling at my giddiness. But then he has long believed in a certain kind of time travel. \u201cI remember the 90s. The wall had just come down, and I was experimenting with party drugs like ecstasy and LSD. The techno scene had started up, and there were all these empty buildings in the east where the youth [from east and west] would meet for the first time. They were hardcore, some of those guys from the east \u2013 they didn\u2019t understand foreigners at all \u2013 and the ecstasy helped them to lose some of their hatred and suspicion. Sometimes, then, you could step into a room, and you could just <em>see</em> the past. Of course, it\u2019s not like that now. I don\u2019t take drugs any more. But I can remember it, and maybe that was why I was able to write this book.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d/307_1677_3991_4989/800.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Ohler in Berlin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Ohler photographed in Berlin last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MalteJaeger/laif</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book in question is <em>The Total Rush</em> \u2013 or, to use its superior English title, <em>Blitzed</em> \u2013 which reveals the astonishing and hitherto largely untold story of the Third Reich\u2019s relationship with drugs, including cocaine, heroin, morphine and, above all, methamphetamines (aka crystal meth), and of their effect not only on Hitler\u2019s final days \u2013 the F\u00fchrer, by Ohler\u2019s account, was an absolute junkie with ruined veins by the time he retreated to the last of his bunkers \u2013 but on the Wehrmacht\u2019s successful invasion of France in 1940. Published in Germany last year, where it became a bestseller, it has since been translated into 18 languages, a fact that delights Ohler, but also amazes him.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only that he is \u2013 as <em>Der Spiegel</em> helpfully pointed out \u2013 a non-historian (the author of three novels and the co-writer of the Wim Wenders film <em>Palermo Shooting</em>, this is his first work of nonfiction). It\u2019s that there was anything new to be said at all. Arrange all the books that have been written about the Nazis end to end and they\u2019d be longer than the Spree.</p> <p>\u201cI guess drugs weren\u2019t a priority for the historians,\u201d he says. \u201cA crazy guy like me had to come along.\u201d Still, crazy or not, he has done a remarkable job. If <em>Blitzed</em> is gripping, it is also convincing. Ian Kershaw, the British historian who is probably the world\u2019s leading authority on Hitler and Nazi Germany, has described it as \u201ca serious piece of scholarship\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The invasion of France was made possible by the drugs. Rommel and all those tank commanders were high</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unlikely as it sounds, it was Ohler\u2019s friend, the Berlin DJ Alexander Kramer, who first put him on to the idea. \u201cHe\u2019s like a medium for that time,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cHe has this huge library, and he knows all the music from the 20s. One night he said to me: \u2018Do you know the massive role drugs played in National Socialism?\u2019 I told him that I didn\u2019t, but that it sounded true \u2013 and I knew immediately it would be the subject of my next book.\u201d</p> <p>His plan was to write a novel, but with his first visit to the archives that changed completely. There he found the papers of Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler\u2019s personal physician, previously only a minor character in most studies of the F\u00fchrer. \u201cI knew then that this was already better than fiction.\u201d In the months that followed, supported by the late, great German historian of the Third Reich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/hans-mommsen\">Hans Mommsen</a>, Ohler travelled from archive to archive, carefully gathering his material \u2013 and how much of it there was! He didn\u2019t use half of what he found. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he says, jumping up. When he returns, in his hand is a copy of a letter from Martin Bormann, Hitler\u2019s private secretary, in which he suggests that the \u201cmedication\u201d Morell is giving the F\u00fchrer needs to be regulated for the sake of his increasingly wobbly health.</p> <p>The story Ohler tells begins in the days of the Weimar Republic, when Germany\u2019s pharmaceutical industry was thriving \u2013 the country was a leading exporter both of opiates, such as morphine, and of cocaine \u2013 and drugs were available on every street corner. It was during this period that Hitler\u2019s inner circle established an image of him as an unassailable figure who was willing to work tirelessly on behalf of his country, and who would permit no toxins \u2013 not even coffee \u2013 to enter his body.</p> <p>\u201cHe is all genius and body,\u201d reported one of his allies in 1930. \u201cAnd he mortifies that body in a way that would shock people like us! He doesn\u2019t drink, he practically only eats vegetables, and he doesn\u2019t touch women.\u201d No wonder that when the Nazis seized power in 1933, \u201cseductive poisons\u201d were immediately outlawed. In the years that followed, drug users would be deemed \u201ccriminally insane\u201d; some would be killed by the state using a lethal injection; others would be sent to concentration camps. Drug use also began to be associated with Jews. The Nazi party\u2019s office of racial purity claimed that the Jewish character was essentially drug-dependent. Both needed to be eradicated from Germany.</p> <p>Some drugs, however, had their uses, particularly in a society hell bent on keeping up with the energetic Hitler (\u201cGermany awake!\u201d the Nazis ordered, and the nation had no choice but to snap to attention). A substance that could \u201cintegrate shirkers, malingerers, defeatists and whiners\u201d into the labour market might even be sanctioned. At a company called Temmler in Berlin, Dr Fritz Hauschild, its head chemist, inspired by the successful use of the American amphetamine <a href=\"http://www.liquisearch.com/doping_in_sport/benzedrine\">Benzedrine at the 1936 Olympic Games</a>, began trying to develop his own wonder drug \u2013 and a year later, he patented the first German methyl-amphetamine. Pervitin, as it was known, quickly became a sensation, used as a confidence booster and performance enhancer by everyone from secretaries to actors to train drivers (initially, it could be bought without prescription). It even made its way into confectionery. \u201cHildebrand chocolates are always a delight,\u201d went the slogan. Women were recommended to eat two or three, after which they would be able to get through their housework in no time at all \u2013 with the added bonus that they would also lose weight, given the deleterious effect Pervitin had on the appetite. Ohler describes it as National Socialism in pill form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e03fc24ad9b14754ce2e8be9ba554fb046b8af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e03fc24ad9b14754ce2e8be9ba554fb046b8af3/3_0_1012_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers at the Temmler factory in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers at the Temmler factory in Berlin produced 35m tablets of Pervitin for the German army and Luftwaffe in 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Temmler Pharma GmbH &amp; Co KG, Marburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, it wasn\u2019t long before soldiers were relying on it too. In <em>Blitzed</em>, Ohler reproduces a letter sent in 1939 by Heinrich B\u00f6ll, the future Nobel laureate, from the frontline to his parents back at home, in which he begs them for Pervitin, the only way he knew to fight the great enemy \u2013 sleep. In Berlin, it was the job of Dr Otto Ranke, the director of the Institute for General and Defence Physiology, to protect the Wehrmacht\u2019s \u201canimated machines\u201d \u2013 ie its soldiers \u2013 from wear, and after conducting some tests he concluded that Pervitin was indeed excellent medicine for exhausted soldiers. Not only did it make sleep unnecessary (Ranke, who would himself become addicted to the drug, observed that he could work for 50 hours on Pervitin without feeling fatigued), it also switched off inhibitions, making fighting easier, or at any rate less terrifying.</p> <p>In 1940, as plans were made to invade France through the Ardennes mountains, a \u201cstimulant decree\u201d was sent out to army doctors, recommending that soldiers take one tablet per day, two at night in short sequence, and another one or two tablets after two or three hours if necessary. The Wehrmacht ordered 35m tablets for the army and Luftwaffe, and the Temmler factory increased production. The likes of B\u00f6ll, it\u2019s fair to say, wouldn\u2019t need to ask their parents for Pervitin again.</p> <p>Was Blitzkrieg, then, largely the result of the Wehrmacht\u2019s reliance on crystal meth? How far is Ohler willing to go with this? He smiles. \u201cWell, Mommsen always told me not to be mono-causal. But the invasion of France was made possible by the drugs. No drugs, no invasion. When Hitler heard about the plan to invade through Ardennes, he loved it [the allies were massed in northern Belgium]. But the high command said: it\u2019s not possible, at night we have to rest, and they [the allies] will retreat and we will be stuck in the mountains. But then the stimulant decree was released, and that enabled them to stay awake for three days and three nights. Rommel [who then led one of the panzer divisions] and all those tank commanders were high \u2013 and without the tanks, they certainly wouldn\u2019t have won.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ac735dbed31252301672e421a0e07622084bfce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac735dbed31252301672e421a0e07622084bfce/0_98_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tube of Pervitin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pervitin: Nazi Germany\u2019s drug of choice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout/Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thereafter, drugs were regarded as an effective weapon by high command, one that could be deployed against the greatest odds. In 1944-45, for instance, when it was increasingly clear that victory against the allies was all but impossible, the German navy developed a range of one-man U-boats; the fantastical idea was that these pint-sized submarines would make their way up the Thames estuary. But since they could only be used if the lone marines piloting them could stay awake for days at a time, Dr Gerhard Orzechowski, the head pharmacologist of the naval supreme command on the Baltic, had no choice but to begin working on the development of a new super-medication \u2013 a cocaine chewing gum that would be the hardest drug German soldiers had ever taken. It was tested at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, on a track used to trial new shoe soles for German factories; prisoners were required to walk \u2013 and walk \u2013 until they dropped.</p> <p>\u201cIt was crazy, horrifying,\u201d says Ohler, quietly. \u201cEven Mommsen was shocked by this. He had never heard about it before.\u201d The young marines, strapped in their metal boxes, unable to move at all and cut off from the outside world, suffered psychotic episodes as the drugs took hold, and frequently got lost, at which point the fact that they could stay awake for up to seven days became irrelevant. \u201cIt was unreal,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t reality. But if you\u2019re fighting an enemy bigger than yourself, you have no choice. You must, somehow, exceed your own strength. That\u2019s why terrorists use suicide bombers. It\u2019s an unfair weapon. If you\u2019re going to send a bomb into a crowd of civilians, of course you\u2019re going to have a success.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Berlin, Hitler was experiencing his own unreality, with his only ally in the world his podgy, insecure personal physician, Dr Morell. In the late 20s, Morell had grown a thriving private practice in Berlin, his reputation built on the modish vitamin injections he liked to give his patients. He met Hitler after he treated Heinrich Hoffman, the official Reich photographer, and sensing an opportunity quickly ingratiated himself with the F\u00fchrer, who had long suffered from severe intestinal pains. Morell prescribed Mutaflor, a preparation based on bacteria, and when his patient\u2019s condition \u2013 Patient A, as Hitler was thereafter known \u2013 began to improve, their codependent relationship began. Both were isolated. Hitler increasingly trusted no one but his doctor, while Morell relied solely on the F\u00fchrer for his position.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone describes the bad health of Hitler in those final days. To me, it's pretty clear that it was partly withdrawal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Hitler fell seriously ill in 1941, however, the vitamin injections that Morell had counted on no longer had any effect \u2013 and so he began to ramp things up. First, there were injections of animal hormones for this most notorious of vegetarians, and then a whole series of ever stronger medications until, at last, he began giving him a \u201cwonder drug\u201d called Eukodal, a designer opiate and close cousin of heroin whose chief characteristic was its potential to induce a euphoric state in the patient (today it is known as oxycodone). It wasn\u2019t long before Hitler was receiving injections of Eukodal several times a day. Eventually he would combine it with twice daily doses of the high grade cocaine he had originally been prescribed for a problem with his ears, following an explosion in the Wolf\u2019s Lair, his bunker on the eastern front.</p> <p>Did Morell deliberately turn Hitler into an addict? Or was he simply powerless to resist the F\u00fchrer\u2019s addictive personality? \u201cI don\u2019t think it was deliberate,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut Hitler trusted him. When those around him tried to remove Morell in the fall of 1944, Hitler stood up for him \u2013 though by then, he knew that if he was to go, he [Hitler] would be finished. They got along very well. Morell loved to give injections, and Hitler liked to have them. He didn\u2019t like pills because of his weak stomach and he wanted a quick effect. He was time-pressed; he thought he was going to die young.\u201d When did Hitler realise he was an addict? \u201cQuite late. Someone quotes him as saying to Morell: you\u2019ve been giving me opiates all the time. But mostly, they talked about it in oblique terms. Hitler didn\u2019t like to refer to the Eukodal. Maybe he was trying to block it off from his mind. And like any dealer, Morell was never going to say: yeah, you\u2019re addicted, and I have something to feed that for you.\u201d So he talked in terms of health rather than addiction? \u201cYes, exactly.\u201d</p> <p>The effect of the drugs could appear to onlookers to be little short of miraculous. One minute the F\u00fchrer was so frail he could barely stand up. The next, he would be ranting unstoppably at Mussolini. Ah, yes: Mussolini. In Italy, <em>Blitzed</em> will come with an extra chapter. \u201cI found out that Mussolini \u2013 patient D, for Il Duce \u2013 was another of Morell\u2019s patients. After the Germans installed him as the puppet leader of the Republic of Italy in 1943, they ordered him to be put under the eyes of the doctor.\u201d Again, Ohler springs up. Again, he returns with a document in his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough material to say he was an addict. But he was being given the same drugs as Hitler. Every week there was a doctorly report.\u201d He runs his finger along the typewritten lines, translating for me as he goes. \u201cHe has improved, he is playing tennis again, the swelling of his liver is normal\u2026 It\u2019s like he\u2019s a racehorse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e10fa2d77365ddab48729b2a1fb92917f7777aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e10fa2d77365ddab48729b2a1fb92917f7777aa/0_111_1181_1476/800.jpg\" alt=\"An unwell-looking Adolf Hitler in July 1944.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unwell-looking Adolf Hitler in July 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ullsteinbild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Hitler, though, a crisis was coming. When the factories where Pervitin and Eukodal were made were bombed by the allies, supplies of his favourite drugs began to run out, and by February 1945 he was suffering withdrawal. Bowed and drooling and stabbing at his skin with a pair of golden tweezers, he cut a pitiful sight. \u201cEveryone describes the bad health of Hitler in those final days [in the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin],\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut there\u2019s no clear explanation for it. It has been suggested that he was suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. To me, though, it\u2019s pretty clear that it was partly withdrawal.\u201d He grins. \u201cYeah, it must have been pretty awful. He\u2019s losing a world war, and he\u2019s coming off drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Two months later, Hitler and his new wife, Eva Braun (like Leni Riefenstahl, another of Morell\u2019s patients), killed themselves, as the world knows. What happened to Morell? We know he survived, but did he get away unscathed?</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of Nazis did get away with it,\u201d says Ohler. \u201cBut not him. He wasn\u2019t able to shed his skin, make a new career, get rich on his memoirs \u2013 even though he could have said, truly, that he hadn\u2019t committed any war crimes. He lost his mind. He disintegrated. He\u2019s a tragic figure. He wasn\u2019t evil. He was only an opportunist.\u201d</p> <p>In 1947, the Americans, having tried and failed to extract useful information from him, deposited Morell in Munich. There he was picked up by a half-Jewish Red Cross nurse who took pity on this dishevelled, shoeless figure. She delivered him to the hospital in Tegernsee, where he died a year later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nazi Germany was a place of complete chaos. Meth kept people in the system without their having to think about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Blitzed</em> looks set to reframe the way certain aspects of the Third Reich will be viewed in the future. But Ohler\u2019s thesis doesn\u2019t, of course, make National Socialism any more fathomable, and for him, perhaps, there is an element of disappointment in this, for he has been seeking to understand it ever since he was a boy (the son of a judge, he grew up close to the border with France). \u201cIt was the whole reason why I wanted to write,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought with writing that you could counter propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>His maternal grandfather worked as a railway engineer during the war, the head of a small station in occupied Bohemia. \u201cOne day at school we watched a film of the liberation of a concentration camp, and it was so shocking to me. That same day, I asked him about the trains going to the camps. He told me that he saw one in the winter coming from the west, and that he said to himself: these are Russian POWs. But since it came from the west, and he heard children, and it was a cattle train, he kind of realised something weird was happening.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t much older than 10, and I was trying to understand: what kind of person is this, my grandfather? Because he continued being a railway engineer. He didn\u2019t join the resistance. He said the SS was guarding the train, and he was afraid, and so he just went back into his little office to continue with his drawings. He always said Hitler wasn\u2019t so bad. In the 80s, you used to hear that a lot: that it was all exaggerated, that Hitler didn\u2019t know about the bad things, that he created order.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses. \u201cYou think it [nazism] was orderly. But it was complete chaos. I suppose working on <em>Blitzed</em> has helped me understand that at least. Meth kept people in the system without their having to think about it.\u201d His hope is that his book will be read by a younger generation of Germans who would rather look to the future than dwell on the past. Is the right rising again? Is that why he wants them to read it? \u201cIt is quite a dangerous time. I hate these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/germany-braces-for-rise-in-anti-immigrant-attacks\">attacks on foreigners</a>, but then our governments do it, too, in Iraq and places. Our democracies haven\u2019t done a very good job in this globalised world.\u201d That said, he doesn\u2019t think the new party of the right, Alternative for Germany, may be the threat it appears (in elections earlier this month, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/mecklenburg-vorpommern-german-anti-immigrant-party-strong-regional-election-exit-polls-merkel\">outperformed Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats</a>). \u201cThe right wing always had so little purchase here [after the war] because of our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was young, you would never even see a German flag. The first time I did was in 1990, when Germany won the World Cup. So perhaps this is just a correction.\u201d</p> <p>Before I head to the airport, Ohler agrees to take me to see what remains of the Temmler factory \u2013 which last time he looked still stood in Berlin-Johannisthal, a part of the city that used to be in the east \u2013 and so it is that we set off on a bright blue day (in the movies, the east seems always to be grey and cold) in search of what remains of Dr Hauschild\u2019s white-tiled laboratory. Twenty minutes later, we pull up in a residential street, all window boxes and net curtains, as quiet as the grave. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d he says, unfolding his long, thin legs from the car. \u201cWow. It\u2019s completely gone.\u201d</p> <p>For a few moments, we peer wonderingly through a chain link fence at the barren expanse of dust and concrete, and the neat white and red houses beyond it. But there\u2019s nothing to be done: try as I might, I can\u2019t superimpose the eery monochrome photographs I\u2019ve seen of the factory in <em>Blitzed</em> on to this Technicolor suburban scene. What was almost tangible to me on Ohler\u2019s roof, only half an hour ago, now takes on the unreal quality of a dream \u2013 or, perhaps, just a very bad trip.</p> <p><em>Blitzed is published by Penguin on 6 October (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blitzed-434323.html\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to order a copy for \u00a316.40 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846</em></p>",
  "<p>It took a visit to a sports bar for Daniel Amokachi to realise exactly what he had got himself into. He had been in Oulu for a matter of weeks and decided to venture into town for the weekend\u2019s big Premier League match. Manchester City v Manchester United would surely draw a crowd, even up here in northern Finland, and the scene when he arrived was encouraging.</p> <p>\u201cThe place was jam-packed, and I assumed everyone was there to watch the game,\u201d Amokachi says. \u201cBut then it just emptied; they\u2019d all been watching ice hockey, and when that finished there were only three of us left. A Manchester derby, and only three of us. That\u2019s when it hit me that ice hockey is number one here and nobody cares about football, and it\u2019s when I realised: \u2018Ooh, there are a lot of obstacles here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As it turned out, Amokachi did not know the half of it. \u201cOnly in Finland\u201d is a phrase that recurs during an hour in his company at the offices of JS Hercules, the third-tier club he has managed since January. No amount of experience at the top level could have prepared the former Everton and Nigeria striker for the challenges he has faced in what, 107 miles south of the Arctic circle, is by the kindest of measures a backwater. If it feels surreal to see Amokachi here then it is as well to remember this was an opportunity he felt there was little choice but to take. The number of Africa-born managers at any level in Europe comes nowhere near to troubling the double-digit mark; no easy solution has been offered and Amokachi grasped his chance to do things the hard way.</p> <p>\u201cMy colleagues in Nigeria said: \u2018Listen, it\u2019s the platform all Africans are looking for so why don\u2019t you take it?\u2019\u201d Amokachi had been between jobs when, in October, the phone rang with an unexpected offer. A long spell as assistant manager with the Nigeria national team, helping the late Stephen Keshi guide them to success at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, had finished and he coached a local club, Ifeanyi Ubah, winning six games out of nine before parting ways because \u201cto survive back home in Africa you have to be someone who kisses assess, and I\u2019m not one of those\u201d. When the call came from Marko Saranlinna, the co-founder of TopSpot \u2013 an Oulu-based scouting company that develops talent in Africa with particular attention on Nigeria \u2013 the decision was surprisingly easy to make.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk about Finland the only name you really know is Jari Litmanen,\u201d Amokachi says. \u201cBut I said: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u2019 The club told me their vision and made it clear that they couldn\u2019t really pay me, that the money they would be giving me would basically be an allowance. But if I make up my mind to take on a challenge, money isn\u2019t an issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfb70d4f045c13657733a1422bf2426b838c906c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb70d4f045c13657733a1422bf2426b838c906c/0_136_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Amokachi instructs his JS Hercules players from the side of the pitch. \u2018You have to know how to relate to these guys\u2019 he says\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Amokachi instructs his JS Hercules players from the side of the pitch. \u2018You have to know how to relate to these guys,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katariina Leinonen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI arrived on a Wednesday. It was -38C, and I\u2019d come straight from Nigeria. But I saw the facilities, met the team and felt comfortable. I decided to see it through.\u201d</p> <p>Acclimatising to the harsh winter was the easy part. JS Hercules were founded in 1998 as, essentially, a kickabout between a group of computer engineering students from the University of Oulu. Among them was Mikko Perala, TopSpot\u2019s other founder, who first began working with African footballers in 2004 when he met the Nigerian player Stanley Festus at a tango class in Bangladesh and has placed a number of individuals with Scandinavian clubs since. Last season, they were unexpectedly promoted to Kakkonen, Finland\u2019s third level, but the club\u2019s annual budget is just \u20ac100,000 and it takes imagination to compete.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re financially crippled so can\u2019t make many transfers like the other teams,\u201d Amokachi says. \u201cAnd there are other frustrations. We started the season really well but then you find things that you only see in Finland \u2013 players missing games because they\u2019ve already booked holidays, their friend is getting married, things like that. You can\u2019t protest because you\u2019re not really paying them.</p> <p>\u201cThe professionalism angle is difficult. For them, football is just about getting together with friends and having fun but that\u2019s not what our vision is all about, we want to take them to a different level and we\u2019ve lost some who aren\u2019t used to that kind of push. When you put something on the plate for them, it\u2019s kind of new, but they\u2019re learning fast. You have to know how to relate to these guys \u2013 when to hit, when to hold back \u2013 so that you see them at training again the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Amokachi cannot quite get his head around a Finnish mentality that he believes is \u201ctoo nice\u201d and lacks \u201cthe edge, the cockiness, the madness\u201d to make serious progress in football. When the sport attracts national interest the reasons are not always wholesome and JS Hercules have found themselves subjected to unwelcome media scrutiny in recent months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b0e7c227c351badbc7a095671249fb320be6f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b0e7c227c351badbc7a095671249fb320be6f5/0_224_1613_2015/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Amokachi in action for Everton in October 1994\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Amokachi in action for Everton in October 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allsport Uk/Allsport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problems began when, on 3 July, Amokachi\u2019s side lost a 3-0 lead at home to Vaasa-based side VIFK, who won 5-3. They had started the season strongly but this was the catalyst for a four-game losing run that came to a head with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj9YFxo63R4\">4-1 defeat to Virkia</a>, who at the time of writing have lost 17 of 20 league games and have a goal difference of -77. The YouTube footage of the latter fixture went, by Finnish league standards, viral; it is certainly a comedy of errors and led to conclusions swiftly being drawn and betting being suspended on their matches. Were JS Hercules\u2019 players involved in match-fixing?</p> <p>To understand why the question was asked so readily, some context is needed. Group C of Kakkonen, which takes in the west coast and the Arctic region, is one of Europe\u2019s stranger football leagues. This season it averages exactly four goals a game; standards are low, money is scarce and many teams are bolstered by obscure, manipulable imports desperate for a way into European football through the back door.</p> <p>The Finnish league runs through the summer, while western Europe rests; there is considerable gambling interest as a result and there have been scandals in the past. In 2011, nine players from RoPS, in Rovaniemi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/09/match-fixing-trial-finland-football\">were convicted of match fixing along with the Singaporean businessman Wilson Raj Perumal</a>. It would take an optimistic soul to conclude that the wider problem was eliminated there and any suspicion of a repeat brings a sensitive reaction.</p> <p>\u201cI had a call from the chairman saying there had been an allegation,\u201d Amokachi says. \u201cAt the next training session it was crazy; the media came up from Helsinki, there were paparazzi everywhere. I knew that, whatever happened, this was my responsibility \u2013 I\u2019m the coach, I\u2019m the one who works with these players every day. After training, I called the players inside, we all sat down together and had a good meeting. We talked about it and I was satisfied that nothing was going on.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone for thinking it, though. We were relegation favourites, went on a great run and then it flipped, with silly mistakes everywhere. The last huge scandal involved African players and I have Africans here playing for free; you can never tell and they are entitled to ask the question. But I hope, and think, there is nothing going on because I have not seen any signs. I\u2019m a member of Interpol\u2019s match-fixing enquiry initiative so for shit like this to happen around me is not healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Sceptics may or may not have been quietened by the fact that JS Hercules won their following match 9-0. Their form has been patchy since but with two games remaining, they are five points clear of the relegation places and the aim is to push for promotion next season. The ambitious Perala believes they will be placed to qualify for the Champions League within a decade, although Amokachi hopes to have achieved a lifelong goal of his own by then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c1c6ba9510cc0cedab258a8411239962249cb7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c1c6ba9510cc0cedab258a8411239962249cb7b/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Amokachi believes joining JS Hercules will provide a platform for other Africans to become managers in Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Amokachi believes joining JS Hercules will provide a platform for other Africans to become managers in Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katariina Leinonen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI know that one day I\u2019ll be the head coach of the Nigeria national team and I will take Nigerian football to a level nobody has taken them to before,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ability of player we have these days \u2026 any coach given this job is lucky. In my head, I know how we\u2019d play and the blueprint is ready to go. With the talent there now, we should be surpassing my generation, the players from the 1990s. It\u2019s sad, because people still refer back 20 years without looking at what we\u2019ve got today, but the quality is second to none. They seem to have given everybody except me an opportunity but, by God\u2019s grace, it will happen.\u201d</p> <p>Amokachi would countenance a return to England, too. He stops short of making predictions on that front \u2013 \u201cWhen you\u2019re passionate about the job you do, the good lord will never take his eyes off you\u201d \u2013 but is more effusive about his friendship with a former Everton team-mate Duncan Ferguson, who turned up unannounced at his wedding in Tunis in 1995 and who he describes as \u201cjust a lovely, sweet guy, one of the best human beings I\u2019ve ever met \u2013 nothing like he was on the field\u201d.</p> <p>Oulu is home for Amokachi now and on an early September evening, it is easy to see how this footballing extremity can be seductive. The sun is lowering in the sky and casts that dreamy, ethereal Arctic light over the nearby delta; Amokachi is enjoying a career detour he could never have foreseen and although he says most of his spare time is spent reading football literature, there is no rush to move on hastily.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m 44 this year and I\u2019m still learning, tactically and managerially,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, to be head coach here is incredible, a grace from heaven. You have to start somewhere to get somewhere, and Africans just don\u2019t get these opportunities. We\u2019ll see how things go at the end of the season. I feel at home here, and that\u2019s the most important thing. It\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. If I didn\u2019t feel at home I\u2019d be long, long gone.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s early September, the Colombian football team has just scored against bitter rivals Brazil, and the crowd gathered around a tiny TV screen rises and whoops, as it does in bars all over the country. Only this wooden hut is not exactly a bar; it is the recreation area for Camp Diamante, deep&#xa0;within the Colombian interior, a strategic nerve centre for the world\u2019s longest-running guerrilla insurgency.</p> <p>On neat rows of chairs, some girls sit on their boyfriends\u2019 laps; elsewhere it is a crowd of mainly young men and women sitting alongside each other \u2013 almost all in military fatigues. These are fighters from the Farc (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or the&#xa0;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). They are out for the evening, some distance away from their beds of bamboo cane and palm leaves, dug deep in the jungle. Until recently they were under ferocious bombardment by the Colombian air force.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/colombia-farc-rebel-ceasefire-agreement-havana\" title=\"\">a historic peace deal</a> is being forged with the Colombian government, ending the 52-year conflict between the Farc and the state; the evening is relaxed and playful. It is as unlike a guerrilla camp as is possible to imagine.</p> <p>This week, guerrillas from all over the country converged on this remote encampment to attend Farc\u2019s historic 10th congress and to ratify a&#xa0;peace agreement that ends the conflict. In doing&#xa0;so, they will also vote for their own dissolution as an armed organisation. The future, they say, is to turn the Farc into a political, not military, force.</p> <p>Tomorrow, 26 September, in the Caribbean city of Cartagena, before diplomats from around the world, Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, and the Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri (known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko), will add their signatures to the peace treaty negotiated over four years in Havana, Cuba. Then the last stage in this tortuous process comes on 2 October, when Colombia votes in a plebiscite on whether to accept or reject the deal.</p> <p>If Brexit was momentous for Europe, then Sunday\u2019s vote will be Latin America\u2019s most important in decades. A Yes would end the world\u2019s longest-running war, one that has killed 220,000 people. The figure rises to 800,000 if you include the victims of narco cartels \u2013 indelibly linked to the conflict that cursed Colombia and caused the internal displacement of six million people. A No vote might plunge Colombia back into the violence that has scarred it for centuries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The paramilitaries have already started killing people. Peace depends on the government too.

But in the near distance an incredible structure is&#xa0;being built. In a race against time to be ready for&#xa0;the 10th congress, cabanas, conference halls, and sleeping quarters for journalists are being built. The site is abuzz night and day with activity, trucks crisscrossing it with building materials, bedding and audiovisual equipment, while fighters move purposefully from construction site to construction site.</p> <p>It\u2019s like a set from the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jun/24/dvdreviews\" title=\"\"><em>Fitzcarraldo</em></a>, this large space cleared in the middle of the jungle to make way for the congress\u2019s huge structure of bamboo cane and timber. From everywhere comes the sound of hammering, drilling, cement-mixing in wheelbarrows. Guerrillas work two shifts, one group on site from 6am to 6pm, to be replaced by another, who take the night shift.</p> <p>The young fighters \u2013 disappointed at a narrow 2-1 loss to Brazil \u2013 leave the bar and wander back to their bivouacs under palm trees, where guns now hang from hooks alongside clothes, water bottles, combs, toothbrushes and the small number of personal items they dot around their simple sleeping places.</p> <p>If Colombia endorses the peace process, those guns will soon be handed over to the UN as part of the agreement. If, on the other hand, Colombia rejects the deal, the future for this country is less certain, although the Farc has said that there will be no return to war, irrespective of the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a622a7645c2cfc04ed4702644289a708f71fff1/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Farc fighter Duan\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc fighter Duan, who joined the group at age 19. \u2018We are ready to return to normal life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Down the track from the main camp walks the lone figure of Duan, like many of these fighters drawn from a local indigenous tribe. He smiles broadly beneath the rim of his wide hat. \u201cI joined the Farc when I was 19,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019d like to study, preferably go back to working the land in Tolima. That\u2019s what God intended for me to do, but we were driven from our land by criminals, and had no option but to fight. But no one likes war. We have fought for so long, for our rights and for the poor, but we have families, and we are ready to return to normal life, still keeping a role within the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The vote is no foregone conclusion. A former president with significant support, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, vehemently opposes it. Many fear too that the Farc, with their communist origins, are a danger to the economic stability of the country. President Santos says: \u201cIf No wins, we will return to what we had at the beginning of this government, six years ago. We return to armed conflict. That would be a catastrophe for the country.\u201d</p> <p>To try to understand South America\u2019s most brutal and complex cycle of violence, the <em>Observer</em> has, during the past year, gone deep inside this last Marxist guerrilla movement. We have travelled into the jungle, to this redoubt in the Farc\u2019s heartland, and also to Havana, where we conducted interviews of unprecedented depth and detail with all five of the senior Farc commanders who negotiated the treaty with the Colombian government.</p> <p>Camp Diamante lies in the heart of an area known as the Yar\u00ed, after the river of that name, at a meeting point between the departments of Caquet\u00e1, Meta and Guaviare; it is steeped in the long history of war between narco-trafficking cartels, the Farc, the army and rightwing paramilitary formations.</p> <p>The Yar\u00ed land is strikingly beautiful; lush vegetation, soaring vultures and thick clusters of tiger butterflies at this time of year. It lies on a hinge between great plains to the north and thick Amazon jungle to the south-east, so that the terrain is perfect for both cultivation on the savannah and concealment within the pockets of dense equatorial foliage scattered across it. By the 1970s, the main crop across much of this terrain was coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.</p> <p>Few people can remember peace. \u201cWe and our&#xa0;parents have seen the worst of the war around&#xa0;here,\u201d says a woman called Marcela, hosing the mud off motorbikes in Las Damas, deep within Farc territory, a sort of bandit town where the government remit has never extended.</p> <p>The Farc were formed in 1964, in response to a government attack on rural enclaves of land occupied by armed peasants affiliated to the Communist party. These peasants had organised&#xa0;themselves into communes after being forced to resettle in remote lands. They were protesting against the systemic concentration of agriculture in the hands of a few landowners (often aided by powerful militias to help seize land), which had continued from Spanish colonial rule into independence. The narrative of&#xa0;conflict in Colombia cannot be told without the story of land&#xa0;concentration in a country of plenty fenced off to many. One especially merciless attack by the state in May 1964 was mounted against the so-called Marquetalia Republic, where 1,600 troops assailed up to 1,000 armed peasants in their rural enclave. The survivors scattered and retreated further into the jungle, and from among them the Farc was&#xa0;born.</p> <p>Soon after the Farc\u2019s formation, this part of Yar\u00ed was dominated, cultivated and variously contested by its enemies: the famous Medell\u00edn cartel of Pablo Escobar and rivals from Cali, which saw these untamed lands as ideal for coca cultivation \u2013 beyond the reach of the state.</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, Farc challenged the narcos. \u201cBy 1993, we had driven out the last of the&#xa0;mafia. There is blood in this soil,\u201d says a guerrilla officer, Juan Su\u00e1rez. \u201cAnd the following&#xa0;year we established Diamante camp.\u201d It is the control centre for Farc\u2019s extensive Bloque&#xa0;Oriental, or Eastern Front, which stretches for thousands of kilometres from the east-central plains towards the Brazilian Amazon&#xa0;forests.</p> <p>\u201cWe have taken on the role of government in an area where the Colombian state has never been,\u201d continues Su\u00e1rez. \u201cPeople here pay their taxes to us; we\u2019ve built 1,000km of road; we run the schools, hospitals.\u201d It is in these remote, neglected areas of Colombia that the Farc has thrived, developing the rural economy, providing medicine, building schools, imposing taxes \u2013 and running cocaine to pay for its war. Unlike other guerrilla groups, the history of the Farc is one of holding and governing territory, across significant swaths of Colombia\u2019s hinterlands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the country votes 'Yes', you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was here, deep in its heartlands of Caquet\u00e1 and Meta, that the Farc faced intense bombardment over the past 15 years, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/plan-colombia-cocaine-narcotics-farc-peace-deal\" title=\"\">Plan Colombia</a> battle strategy. Plan Colombia was initiated and supported by the United States in 2000 when the country bordered on collapse \u2013 under an attack from a combination of the Farc and narco-terrorism that disabled the institutions of the state. The police, press, judiciary and the body politic were all compromised by money or violence from leftwing terrorism, rightwing paramilitaries or cartels. Internationally, Colombia was widely seen as a failed state.</p> <p>Plan Colombia utterly changed the military balance between the government and the Farc. Laser and GPS technology turned the air force\u2019s clumsy 500lb bombs into weapons of deadly accuracy. Farc commanders could be targeted using their mobile phones. The onslaught reduced the numbers fighting for the Farc from some 15,000 in 2004 to an estimated 8,000 now \u2013 and, crucially, took out dozens of high-ranking leaders, killed by a new range of US guided missile technology. Hiding in their bamboo and canvas shelters and fighting with old Kalashnikovs and R-15 rifles, the Farc were beaten back, and very nearly wiped out. The government negotiating team in Havana are in no doubt that they bombed the guerrillas to the negotiating table.</p> <p>It was also here in Yar\u00ed that the politician \u00cdngrid Betancourt, three Americans and many others including Colombian senators and officials, were kidnapped. Betancourt was held for six years, much of that time alongside the three Americans. They were all eventually released by an intelligence sting in 2008. The three Americans subsequently wrote a book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/26/ingrid-betancourt-colombia-hostage-farc-book\" title=\"\"><em>Out of Captivity</em></a>, which detailed the horrific deprivations, loneliness and fear they suffered throughout their time in captivity. They recalled that, after weeks of marching through thick jungle when they didn\u2019t see the sun for days, they finally arrived at a jungle camp, were put in cages and forbidden to speak to one another. One of the men, Keith Stansell, a US intelligence analyst and an ex-marine recalled in an interview: \u201cYou have these kids who are just brainwashed and brought into this thing. They will, in one second, turn on you and kill you if they have to. In another second, they\u2019re just playing yo-yos.\u201d</p> <p>Kidnapping \u2013 which Farc calls \u201ctaking prisoners\u201d \u2013 of innocent people is the one activity&#xa0;many Colombians cannot forgive.</p> <p>They took 40,000 people hostage, sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for years. This was designed to fund the war effort, but also to enrich certain commanders. People&#xa0;were chosen as victims because their families were presumed rich enough to pay for their release. \u201cThey would stop buses full of people, and pick out the lighter-skinned people. They assumed that they would have more money,\u201d said one well-known Colombian journalist. He recalls a relative, a small&#xa0;dairy farmer who was kidnapped twice. The second time he was released after three weeks, but only after having paid a down-payment, and agreeing to monthly payments for a further three years.</p> <p>The Farc say that this was a system of imposing taxes in areas where they \u201cgoverned\u201d and provided services such as water, schools and&#xa0;hospitals where none existed. But for those who were kidnapped \u2013 and lived in fear even after their release, as they tried&#xa0;to pay the monthly instalments \u2013 it was a system of terror. At times, the Farc had upwards of 1,000 people in captivity.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Colombian army has been accused of \u201cdisappearing\u201d thousands of innocent civilians it claims were Farc combatants \u2013 the so-called \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 for which many army officers have been convicted. Rightwing paramilitarism in Colombia also has an inglorious history of targeting \u2013 or \u201cdisappearing\u201d \u2013 peasants, unionists, human rights activists and supporters of leftist political movements. The soil of Colombia is steeped in the sins of all these groups.</p> <p>Now, finally, the leaders of the Farc are starting&#xa0;to admit that this orgy of \u201cdisappearing\u201d people had nothing to do with their original struggle against political and economic injustice. Last Monday, in a significant intervention, and in recognition of the problem this issue poses for Farc, Ivan Marquez, leader of the Farc\u2019s delegation in Havana throughout the four-year talks, made an explicit apology for the kidnapping of thousands of people. He said: \u201cWe want to acknowledge, with humanity and reconciliation, that during the conflict the Farc caused great pain with the retention of people for ransom. That conduct, while always used to sustain the needs of the rebellion, resulted in harming entire families.\u201d</p> <p>Like other players in this conflict, the Farc lost their way in their fight for a more just Colombia. Finally, they are coming to terms with this past, in pursuit of a new political future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c474d8fd8bca8c860d4595771d7f13b503ab47/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc guerrillas butcher meat at Camp Diamante.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the regional centre of Florencia, gateway to the old heartland of Farc, vultures snack on the roundabouts, old carthorses share the streets with motorbikes and crackheads sniff from their plastic tubes and bags of paste. Emaciated, desperate and close to death, these are the lost, the forgotten victims of a toxic conflict of cocaine, politics and economic injustice.</p> <p>In a basic, tiny bar, a singer of traditional vallenato music, Tito, makes a gesure of zipping his mouth when asked what he thinks about the peace process. Fear, suspicion and anxiety stalk every corner of these parts of rural Colombia. \u201cI don\u2019t think the peace can work, there are too many economic interests at stake.\u201d Tito, who is from a nearby city, cautions against speaking loudly \u2013 \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s here, or who\u2019s in control... narcos, rightwing paramilitaries, the Farc...\u201d \u2013 and motions us to quieten down. Nearby, Flora, from Florencia, is more optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it all here: narcos, Farc, the paramilitaries \u2013 it\u2019s been too much, we need peace at last.\u201d</p> <p>But Lisa, who works in a leather store in this hardscrabble town, shares the view of many Colombians when she says: \u201cWe cannot allow terrorists and kidnappers into politics.\u201d</p> <p>However, there are remarkable signs of forgiveness and reconciliation in these parts, and throughout the country, too. Javier, a driver, will vote for peace, despite the fact that his father, cousin and brother-in-law were all killed by the Farc for \u201ccrossing an invisible line in the territory\u201d when the turf war was at its worst. But Javier welcomes the accord, because, he says, \u201cit is better they do not have the guns than have them. It is better they are handed to the UN than kept in the jungle.\u201d You sense from all these people in the rural outposts of Colombia that bore the brunt that they have seen no winners in this 52-year war, only losers. They were the bystanders, the collateral, and feel beaten and brutalised. They are divided between those who hope for a better future, and those who long ago lost all hope.</p> <p>The plebiscite will deliver the popular verdict on whether the Farc are ready to be offered a way back into Colombian society. But many of those poised to vote Yes to peace are under no illusions. They are desperate for an end to the conflict, but are not driven by warmth toward the Farc. As one renowned Colombian writer \u2013 unwilling to be seen to be commentating openly \u2013 told us: \u201cTimochenko is not Mandela. If the country votes Yes, you won\u2019t see street parties and wild celebrations. It will be relief. We want peace, yes, because we are all tired, and it is better than war.\u201d</p> <p>And, unlike Mandela and the ANC, there is no prospect of the Farc storming to power in the near future. Even diehard supporters estimate that their initial electoral support might amount to about a million Colombians, which would represent a small minority of the total.</p> <p>There is also ambivalence from many of those who live in Colombia\u2019s large urban centres such as Medell\u00edn, Cali and Bogot\u00e1. In many respects the conflict did not impact much on their lives, as the Farc-army battles took place in the remote heartlands and only rarely, later on, did this war find its way into the cities. In fact, many Colombians will tell you that the savage narco wars between Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels of the 80s and 90s were a far greater scourge on their lives, when brutal massacres and car bombings ripped the hearts out of Colombia\u2019s major cities.</p> <p>But there was nothing minimal about the impact of the war in places like San Vicente del Cagu\u00e1n. Three hours south of Florencia, the Farc held this \u201cfrontier\u201d town until losing it a decade ago, during Plan Colombia. But the Farc, until now, has still controlled the trade routes in cocaine \u2013 which it \u201ctaxes\u201d \u2013 through San Vicente and beyond, with an iron hand. With the prospect of peace and the exit of the Farc as the enforcer in this town comes a vacuum and, already, armed criminal gangs and their paramilitary allies have arrived to fill it. There was a shootout and execution by men delivering drugs and cash from an armoured vehicle just days after we passed through town.</p> <p>Past San Vicente lies Las Damas. Truck after truck grinds its way down the pueblo\u2019s only street carrying supplies: bedding, food, clothing, fuel and the Farc\u2019s hallmark wellington boots. They are on their way to help with preparations for the 10th congress. A convoy of guerrillas from Farc\u2019s Bloque Sur \u2013 Southern Front \u2013 pitches up in the town for a meal, guns left in the rear of their 4x4s, barely drawing a glance from the locals. Their commander, Fernay, is pleasant, and eager to talk. War, he says, dehumanises us. \u201cWe have come to the end of our armed struggle. It had to end, and our war is now political.\u201d The pickups are full of very young guerrillas, who wait patiently for the food to be served before the ramshackle armed convoy heads off towards Camp Diamante beneath an indigo sky, through a torrent of rain.</p> <p>The headteacher at the school, built by the Farc, admits that the town\u2019s economy is dependent on the guerrilla presence, and their absence will empty its coffers. \u201cBut for as long as I can remember, Las Damas has lived outside the state; peace will bring the state to this place for the first time, and for the first time, Las Damas will feel like part of Colombia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbd04d54229ca7b0ca0918d28e2e1b4664446db2/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camp Diamante is in a remote, rural area where the Farc take the place of the absent state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her observation touches on one of the deeper wounds in this war-torn country. There is no doubt that Las Damas \u2013 and many places like it that have lived under narco, paramilitary or Farc control \u2013 is ready to embrace the nation that has overlooked it. It wants, finally, to come in from the cold. It wants to lie within, not outside, the reach of the state. But is the state ready to embrace places like Las Damas? Colombia has unique physical challenges, with three Andean mountain ranges slicing between its Pacific, Caribbean, mountain and jungle identities. Transport is difficult, and the Caribbean north feels a world away from the rainforests of the south-east. For much of its 200-year-plus history the state has at best ignored, and at worst deprived, those living in the rural margins of this vast country. Does Colombia now, finally, have the will, the power and the money to bring to these regions the advantages of hospitals, schools, law and order and infrastructure that the urban areas enjoy? The peace deal says it is ready to do so. If so, it would be for the first time in history.</p> <p>Colombia is a country of extremes. There are bars and restaurants in central Bogot\u00e1 that would not be out of place in London or Rome \u2013 nor would the prices. But millions live in extreme poverty, either in shanty barrios on the edges of the big cities (mostly displaced by war in the countryside), or in rural areas. Neither of these two groups have access to basic sanitation, power, proper education or healthcare. The peace deal is partly about the Farc leaving its weapons behind, but it is also about trying to open a new chapter of social, economic and political justice in a country where these have long been absent.</p> <p>Las Damas is one such place, now a guerrilla protectorate, and where our rendezvous with the Farc for onward transport to the camp is supposed to happen. It fails to materialise and instead we meet a man \u2013 let\u2019s call him Ernesto \u2013 who is part of the Farc\u2019s underground political wing, also waiting for transport to the camp. Once the Farc comes into open electoral politics \u2013 which is an explicit part of the peace deal \u2013 its centre of gravity will not be the armed men and women in the camps but men like Ernesto, who operate in a network of affiliated organisations across the land and in the cities. Farc, to succeed, will work with the churches, unions, women\u2019s groups and environmentalists to try to build a social and political movement that will give voice to Colombia\u2019s marginalised and overlooked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/colombia-farc-female-fighters-in-pictures\">Colombia: Farc's female fighters, then and now \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ernesto does not want to be identified, because he fears \u2013 as does almost every guerrilla and their civilian Farc affiliates \u2013 that known connections to the Farc could be a death sentence once the movement emerges into the open, as the peace process requires. And with good reason. The Farc\u2019s last attempt to contest elections after a peace process was during the late 1980s, when they jointly founded \u2013 with the Communist party \u2013 the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. This party won several towns and local seats, even a few in parliament. But over three years between 1987 and 1990, Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica was systematically wiped out by rightwing death squads. There are many shameful episodes in the recent history of Colombia \u2013 and the Farc is implicated in many of them \u2013 but the political extermination of UP ranks among the worst stains on a country with pretensions to being a mature democracy.</p> <p>\u201cFarc has many layers,\u201d explains Ernesto, \u201cacross the social movements. I\u2019m with an ecologist movement which will join with the new Farc, but not everyone will do so. And remember environmentalism in Colombia is not soft green politics. It has been a violent frontline between multinational interests and indigenous and land rights.\u201d In Colombia, environmentalism is about balancing access to land between business interests and indigenous people, an issue that has torn the country apart for decades.</p> <p>These remote lands on Colombia\u2019s margins, rich in mineral resources, are often settled by indigenous groups, and the clash of values and commercial interests threatens to spark a whole new battle once the peace deal is sealed. As if to illustrate this, while we journeyed towards the camp, an indigenous rights leader, Cecilia Culcu\u00e9, was murdered at her home in the state of Cauca by what is presumed to be a paramilitary hit squad. Culcu\u00e9 had been contesting investment by international conglomerates and also negotiating the rural reforms to which the peace deal is committed.</p> <p>Murders of people like Culcu\u00e9, human rights and trade union activists, have increased rather than abated with the peace process \u2013 there have been nine prominent executions in Cauca alone this year. \u201cOnce the government signed the peace with the guerrillas, many zones now free of conflict can be handed over to the multinationals for exploitation, which for our communities means pushing even harder to protect our natural resources,\u201d one of Culcu\u00e9\u2019s colleagues told the <em>El Pais</em> newspaper in Cali.</p> <p>Ernesto arranges a ride for us on the back of a truck in a Farc convoy with a troop of Medell\u00edn guerrillas. And so, with not a little irony, we end up hitching a lift to a remote camp with a group of guerrillas who until recently had specialised in kidnapping people. It turned out they are neither the best drivers, nor are the trucks the best equipped; a journey that should take two hours takes us eight as the vintage truck is held up time and again by deep potholes and mud. The frequency of the stops, and the depth of the water-filled craters, seem to defeat the Medell\u00edn troops who, time and again, drive straight into the holes, from which it takes hours to emerge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ac78653de813ab353fe4db51e55aa5f4c57234/0_153_3945_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre Timochenko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc supreme commander Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, known by his nom-de-guerre, Timochenko, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mulholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, the track improves, at which point the elated driver presses hard on the accelerator, hurtling us on at frightening speed. Those in the back are thrown from side to side, praying that the truck stays upright and estimating what course of action would offer best protection if, as seems more likely, we career off the road. Eventually and safely, we arrive a few kilometres short of the camp where the Farc\u2019s warehouse stores are filled with mountains of grain, rice and flour. Outside, as if to preface the coming of peace, a group of guerrillas are playing keenly contested football on a pitch complete with makeshift goalposts.</p> <p>The entrance to the Diamante camp is marked by a Colombian flag with Farc\u2019s emblem on it and a red flag with the initials of the clandestine communist party, the PCCC, with hammer and sickle. Yet all around are the sights of everyday life. To the right, on a riverbank, a guerrilla fishes with a bamboo rod, while others cut meat and prepare an oven. To the left, the guerrillas\u2019 quarters are dug into the jungle; canopies of canvas strung atop bamboo poles. Most are empty while their occupants are about their business; in others, rebel fighters read, cook, watch films on their iPads, prepare coffee, play with a puppy or tend to weapons they will soon be handing over to UN monitors.</p> <p>Farc officer Juan Su\u00e1rez takes us through the camp. \u201cPlaces like this used to move every two or three days,\u201d he recalls of the Plan Colombia era. \u201cWe camped in groups of less than 25 comrades, the number below which a heat scanner can\u2019t detect us.\u201d He points to the deep mud at his feet, after another tropical downpour: \u201cThat\u2019s our other enemy,\u201d he says. And he recalls: \u201cMy worst moment in this war, when my father was killed during a bombing raid \u2013 I was 100 metres away. My mother left the camp after that, into the civilian movement.\u201d</p> <p>Chickens cluck and strut everywhere, steam rises from a beef stew. \u201cI want to stay with the movement whatever it does,\u201d says another guerrilla, Laura, preparing coffee. \u201cMy parents were in Farc, but they\u2019ve gone back to civilian life, still in the movement. I want to see them again. I\u2019ll do whatever the general staff says, but I\u2019d like to go back into the world.\u201d A guerrilla called Antonio makes his way along a little path, bare-chested. \u201cThere are still many problems out there,\u201d he fears. \u201cI\u2019ve been threatened by the paramilitaries before, and they\u2019ve already started killing people. This peace depends on the government too, as well as us. But we can\u2019t go back to war.\u201d</p> <p>These are the footsoldiers who, without&#xa0;exception, show remarkable,&#xa0;and sometimes unnerving levels of loyalty to their commanders and the organisation. There is a whiff of unhealthy group psychology at play, something that a new and flexible Farc will have to dispense with if they are to survive in a world of less-doctrinaire, open politics. The upside to that loyalty is a strong sense of collective spirit, and an organisation that provides a surrogate family, long after most guerrillas had left their own.</p> <p>One of these leaders, among the most charismatic, and likely to lead the Farc\u2019s new political movement, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/jun/25/farc-rebel-leader-colombia-interview-carlos-antonio-lozada-supreme-urban-commander-peace\" title=\"\">Carlos Antonio Lozada</a>. A little distance from the camp, he sits beneath a gazebo, sipping whisky, and talking animatedly about the past and future. He was one of five leading commanders at the negotiating table in Havana. Since March, the <em>Observer</em> has interviewed all five commanders at length for a documentary film, and can reveal the essential logic of the Farc\u2019s high command.</p> <p>When we met in Havana earlier this year, Lozada was still amazed at the idea that he \u2013 a senior Farc commander who had fought battles for years in the jungle, and lived clandestinely in the city too \u2013 was sitting opposite the very generals he had fought against. Here was adversary versus adversary. And it was this, the inclusion of serving Colombian military \u2013 from the army and police \u2013 in the negotiations that Lozada judges to have been critical to the peace deal. \u201cSince the first dialogue in the 1980s, we always said that the armed forces had to be at the negotiating table. And until now, we never managed to get a government to take that step. I never thought guerrilla fighters and military men could talk to each other and to get to know how we both see things.</p> <p>\u201cUndoubtedly we have a connection with the other side. Both sides faced the same risks, the same situations, and we started to get to know each other and found out that we speak the same language. We lived through the same places, the same battles; the same suffering. We can talk about situations we have experienced from different sides of the spectrum, particular battles, and we hear the story from the other side. That generates empathy, understanding.\u201d</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s supreme commander, Timochenko,&#xa0;is a former coffee plantation worker who cut a relaxed figure in Havana last March as we interviewed him for several hours in the garden of &#xa0;a restaurant on the city\u2019s outskirts, near the hotel in which his negotiating team had been locked in talks with the government for four years.</p> <p>He explained why he thought now, after so many years, the Colombian government and the Farc had been willing to find a way out. \u201cThey hit us very hard with Plan Colombia, yes. We never deny that. But they didn\u2019t finish us off. We\u2019re still there, firm. The guerrilla fight is very dynamic, it has fluxes and refluxes. And then Santos opened the door to talks. And I think it is because they didn\u2019t defeat us. Because they are tired. Because war has limits. The machinery gets tired and also men get tired.\u201d</p> <p>But those years of talks have clearly impacted all sides, including veteran guerrillas such as Timochenko. \u201cAll Colombians have felt the pain, for one reason or another. The pain of the mother of a guerrilla fighter is the same as the pain of the mother of a soldier. We are from the same fatherland, so we cannot use this process to throw salt into the wounds of the other side. It\u2019s about how we agree to heal those wounds. We cannot sow the seeds of another conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Timochenko paid tribute to Cuba and to the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for enabling talks. \u201cUntil his dying breath, Ch\u00e1vez wanted us to find peace,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wanted us to enter politics and win our wars through elections as he did. He gave us the security to know that nothing would happen [to us] if we entered these talks. He was our guarantor there would be no dirty tricks.\u201d President Santos\u2019s first call as he considered initiating a peace process was to Ch\u00e1vez, to see if the Venezuelan president would support and, in effect, offer guarantees to Farc ahead of the talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03427eee9cc750b7e1162b82406d305a6aaff2b1/1437_25_3043_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation for the peace deal, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, in Havana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Muholland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a remarkable move from Santos given that, under the hardline presidency of his predecessor, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, Colombia and Venezuela had been on the brink of war just months earlier. The Farc\u2019s relationship with Ch\u00e1vez was especially problematic, since Venezuela offered sanctuary to many guerrillas and senior commanders. Ch\u00e1vez also did little to close down narco routes across their shared border and helped arm the Farc at a time when Colombia\u2019s own army was under extreme pressure.</p> <p>The Farc\u2019s proximity to Ch\u00e1vez drew strong resentment from many Colombians who resented Chavez\u2019s influence over the Farc. In retrospect, given the then-tension between the two countries, the call from Santos to Ch\u00e1vez may prove to have been the most important of all.</p> <p>One of those Farc leaders who was given refuge in Venezuela was the leader of Farc\u2019s negotiating delegation, Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez. He studied philosophy with a priest before joining the Communist party and then the Farc, emerging as a senior military commander and crucial figure in the guerrillas\u2019 strategic and doctrinal direction during war and towards peace. His discourse on war and politics is studded too with moments of personal loss, something common to Colombians from all walks of life in this conflict.</p> <p>We meet him in Havana in March among the lambent colours of a floral display in another restaurant garden, with the sound of crowing cockerels drifting through the tropical suburb. M\u00e1rquez too has had time to reflect on the pain caused both by the Farc, and to him personally.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of my brothers were victims of the repression and persecution. My brother Alvaro&#xa0;was murdered horribly in Florencia. He was captured by the intelligence services. I could&#xa0;never imagine those things could happen. His toes were cut off, his eyes were pulled out, he&#xa0;was burned with cigarette butts and they dragged him from Florencia to Morelia. There\u2019s a beautiful river there, and a high bridge. They threw him from the bridge into the river. He was&#xa0;not an activist, just my brother. In Florencia,&#xa0;a&#xa0;couple of years later, they took my other brother Alfonso. That was the fault of the military bosses.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/11/farcs-child-soldiers-start-new-life-after-peace-deal\">Farc's child soldiers start new life after peace deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is horrors such as these \u2013 perpetrated by all sides \u2013 with which Colombia now has to reckon. The peace agreement, says M\u00e1rquez, \u201cis a starting point. Because the political fight continues, but not with weapons any longer. With words, discourse, looking in earnest for a country in which people can live with more humanity.\u201d</p> <p>It is Carlos Lozada and others who are likely to be in the vanguard of pitching the Farc\u2019s new political project (and newly named party) to a sceptical public. Lozada insists that \u201cwhen Farc comes into the open, our idea is to embrace a rainbow of Colombians\u201d \u2013 an ambition that would&#xa0;make Farc a rare organisation, incorporating Caribbean Colombians from the north coast, mostly black Colombians from the Pacific edge, mountain people from the Andes, peasants from the vast plains and indigenous tribes of the rainforest \u2013 in addition to the urban masses, which include all of these.</p> <p>\u201cWe are betting on having a space in the political spectrum that runs from the democratic&#xa0;sectors to the left. It is not going to be&#xa0;a Marxist movement; it will be a wide proposal,&#xa0;where different sections can converge. When the Farc come out in the open, legal political fight, you will see an organisation that is a reflection of how we think of Colombians \u2013 if you go to the pacific coast, you will see a guerrilla made up of Afro-Colombians, if you go to the Cauca, those are indigenous, if you go to the Meta, they are people from the Llanos, and if you go to the northern front they are Caribbean. Our political proposal is going to be a reflection of our nation and an alternative to a regime of political domination over the decades.\u201d</p> <p>But at the heart of those talks in Havana were the victims of the conflict. Five groups representing those who had been bereaved in the war went to Havana to confront the government and the Farc. It was their participation that proved a turning point for all sides.</p> <p>Lozada recalls: \u201cWhen we started welcoming the delegates from the delegations of victims, we stopped seeing the victims as just&#xa0;statistics and numbers, but [instead saw them] as human beings and they have pain and suffering and inevitably that produces a transformation. We were quite struck that none of the victims that came here to Havana asked for revenge. They all asked us to continue this discussion at the table and not to stand up until we finish what we came here to do \u2013 which is essentially a peace&#xa0;agreement.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one sees the tenderness of the people, the capacity of human beings for reconciliation, to forgive, that generates commitments, and one understands there is in the deep soul of our people a wish for peace and reconciliation. And so none of the opposing camps on the table can fail on that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago President Santos recognised this same mood when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/08/colombia-juan-manuel-santos-farc-peace-violence\" title=\"\">told the <em>Observer</em></a>, \u201cI am doing everything possible to teach people how to reconcile, and one thing I have discovered is that the victims are more ready to pardon and reconcile than the average citizen. If the victims are ready to pardon and to forgive, then that is a very strong basis for peace to be sustainable in the&#xa0;long run.\u201d</p> <p>Another day begins at Camp Diamante, with low but strong sunlight on the roof of a cowshed next to our quarters, from which \u201cranchera\u201d accordion music drifts across the savannah morning. A cowboy called Dimas herds cattle towards their milking parlour and says: \u201cI want peace, but I\u2019m a cowboy and I just want to stay here. I don\u2019t want to change my life and I don\u2019t want to risk it.\u201d</p> <p>Concealed deep into the jungle lies the encampment\u2019s hospital compound, at the centre of which is a large, open-sided canopy hung with the Farc\u2019s emblem, the PCCC flag and a portrait of Che Guevara. In charge here is Dr Uriel Quindio, who has been performing state-of-the-art surgery in this remotest corner of Latin America. \u201cI learned medicine here,\u201d he says, \u201cat our own medical school \u2013 as good as any in Colombia.\u201d</p> <p>Quindio\u2019s worst memory, he says, was during the bombing, when many were badly injured: \u201cOne man in particular, after a 150mm mortar fell \u2013 he lost both arms and legs and had internal injuries. I attended to him and he kept saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die, hold me.\u2019 He survived here for two months.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6366ec35e1fe2a6de57ab765fdce5c5d8a0f63e8/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Antonio Lozada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farc commander Carlos Antonio Lozada, who came face to face at the peace talks with an army general who had tried to kill him during the war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quindio\u2019s story is as ironic as it is timely at this moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t join a guerrilla organisation,\u201d he explains. \u201cI joined in the village of C\u00f3rdoba, near here, when Farc had become a political organisation during the 1980s; Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica. There were no opportunities in the area, and so much poverty and violence I believed in a legal communist movement. But the UP was exterminated, and I was one of many young people at that time who found myself in the armed struggle because the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica had been eliminated.\u201d He agrees that \u201cthings have come around again, but this time we will surrender our weapons, so I hope for a different outcome\u201d.</p> <p>Diamante will now become one of 31 so-called \u201ctransition zones\u201d to which all the Farc\u2019s guerrillas and supporters in the clandestine networks are to converge after Sunday\u2019s vote, if it returns a Yes to the peace accords. There, the Farc\u2019s arsenal will be progressively handed over to monitors from the UN\u2013 proportionately, according to an agreed timetable \u2013 with rings of police and military nearby but not present. The process is to be completed within six months \u2013 the longest armed insurgency disarmed.</p> <p>Every organisation in Colombia\u2019s conflict has a justified charge sheet to answer for. The army, paramilitaries, narco cartels, and the Farc have all committed appalling atrocities. Reckoning with these is the guiding principle of a groundbreaking transitional justice mechanism devised between&#xa0;Farc and the government in Havana, and is crucial to the legacy of next Sunday\u2019s vote. Its guiding principles include one whereby confession to serious crimes by all parties entitles perpetrators to \u201calternative sentences\u201d such as house arrest and community service, while failing to come forward to confess crimes against humanity is punishable by lengthy jail sentences.</p> <p>The transitional justice mechanism was hammered out in the context of those that followed peace and justice arrangements in South Africa, Rwanda and Ireland \u2013 and is hailed as a landmark attempt to incorporate the best from all these experiences, while avoiding some of the&#xa0;pitfalls.</p> <p>It carefully balances all three models to create what seasoned international lawyers deem to be a gold standard, with the former president of the international criminal court in The Hague, Argentine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/luis-moreno-ocampo\" title=\"\">Luis Moreno Ocampo</a>, going so far as to liken it to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f31dd84-68b5-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f.html#axzz4KuREXWXA\" title=\"\">\u201ca work by Van Gogh that only gained public recognition after he died\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Salient whispers from both sides in Havana indicate that the process of truth and justice stands a chance of reckoning with three generations of violence. However, rigidity digs in, and to those voting against the peace process next weekend, this tentative common reckoning amounts to amnesty for, and appeasement of, terrorism. For those voting in favour, the plebiscite and peace constitute the epic moment of a lifetime: that is, not just to end South America\u2019s longest conflict, but to transform Colombia into a more equal, just society, free of the entrenched privilege that has scarred it since independence in 1810. A chance, too, to begin the search in earnest for Colombia\u2019s tens of thousands of missing, as well as reckon with its dead.</p> <p>To no small degree, the accords wrought in Havana, unthinkable five years ago, have been a&#xa0;matter of face-to-face encounter, and a mutual&#xa0;will to understand the other. M\u00e1rquez, reflecting in Havana on the past four years, says something extraordinary about General Mora, against whom he fought so many battles in the jungle. \u201cMora is a good guy. If I knew him beforehand I would not have battled him the way I did. It\u2019s surprising for me.\u201d</p> <p>If peace holds, maybe together they can help build a new Colombia, one where the next three generations escape the terrors of the last three.</p> <p>Before night falls at the camp, we repair to our quarters next to the cowshed, where one female guerrilla cuts, plaits and arranges another\u2019s hair. Both giggle uncontrollably, their 1980s Yugoslav-made weapons slung on to hooks beside the cooking area, in which meal after meal of rice, beans, plantain and beef soup are prepared. The cowherds and a couple of young fighters come in to watch a football game. This is all they have: the Farc is their family, the ideology their identity; none has a clear idea of life without this routine.</p> <p>On the other hand, a guerrilla called Antonio squelches his way from the riverbank bivouac to a sodden track through dense, dripping palm leaves. The cicadas chirp loud on the slipstream of the downpour, the red earth is soft with water \u2013 from across the road comes the sound of an axe chopping carcasses of meat, and the scent of woodsmoke. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of war,\u201d says Antonio. \u201cYes, there are risks out there, risks for everyone and especially for us, coming into the open. But we can\u2019t go back to war, to all that killing. No one wants to die; we don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/jun/25/farc-rebel-leader-colombia-interview-carlos-antonio-lozada-supreme-urban-commander-peace\">Farc rebel leader: \u2018We repent everything, not just the war\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even deeper within the jungle, further from the central camp, lies a haunted monument to these changes, to the very real possibility of peace. This vast camp is now entirely abandoned, its installations reaching far into the dense foliage: bivouacs, tents and sturdier structures in what little dappled sunlight penetrates the roof of leaves overhead.</p> <p>There is a school, or what some would call a centre for indoctrination: a few sturdy wooden chairs remain and from the cane beams hang posters for ideological education: there\u2019s a eulogy to Timochenko, and a warning of: \u201cTotal Crisis. One day, the poor will have nothing left but to eat the rich.\u201d A poster with a hammer and sickle promises that \u201cThe Workers and Peasants Bring Change and Regeneration\u201d. And another, \u201cYou buried me and did not know I was a seed.\u201d Then there\u2019s one instructing on the use of Microsoft Office and Windows.</p> <p>Beneath the school, there is a large bomb shelter. Nearby, the commander\u2019s discreetly private quarters and beneath that another smaller shelter, his own. All now lie empty. There are cooking stations, bathing pools and innumerable paths that guerrillas presumably took to escape \u2013 for moments \u2013 the reality of endless war.</p> <p>There is almost total silence here, apart from the lazy purr of cicadas\u2019 wings and the occasional&#xa0;caw of a bird, and rustle of wings through the trees. Not a trace of wind in the humid pyrexia of mid-afternoon. The camp was evacuated eight days before our visit, in anticipation of the peace deal: the bustle and grime of guerrilla life, the bedlam of bombing, wailing of the wounded and crash of ordnance are all in the mind now. And if the peace deal is endorsed, in the past.</p> <h2>The peace accord: the key provisos</h2> <p><strong>1 Comprehensive rural reform</strong> in a country where unequal land ownership has been the cause of much violence, and of thriving coca-growing due to paramilitary and guerrilla control over tranches of land. The government will support rural communities and promote sustainable economic growth by granting more land accessibility though a special fund. There will be specific development, infrastructure and poverty reduction programmes as well as food and nutritional security initiatives.</p> <p><strong>2 Political participation by Farc, under a new name, in the democratic process. </strong>The condition of Farc laying down weapons and abandoning armed struggle is absolute. Having done so, Farc members will be provided with the possibility of advancing their political agenda through the Colombian democratic system. They will do so under the same rights and obligations as other political parties and movements. The government is committed to provide the necessary security measures to make sure Farc members can exercise their right to participate in politics, after the annihilation of Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica.</p> <p><strong>3 End of the conflict.</strong> Immediately after the final agreement, Farc members will start to establish 23 \u201cTransitory Rural Settlement Normalisation Zones\u201d and eight \u201cTransitory Points of Normalisation \u201d (smaller, for fewer guerrillas). Farc will then have 180 days to surrender all weaponry to the United Nations. At the end of the 180 days, the Normalisation Zones and Points will be disabled; Farc members, once totally and irreversibly disarmed, will start their reintegration process into Colombian society and the political process.</p> <p><strong>4 A solution to the problem of illicit drugs.</strong> A landmark achievement in the wider aim of the Colombian government to rewrite the premises of the war on drugs, solving the crisis at the production end, and turning a spotlight on the responsibilities of consuming countries. Farc commits to cut all links to drug trafficking, support an illicit crop eradication programme, and to provide information and support for mine-clearing efforts that will alleviate humanitarian concerns and make coca eradication more efficient. Pilot programmes involving joint patrols between the army and Farc have already begun.</p> <p><strong>5 Victims and transitional justice.</strong> A framework to satisfy victims of the conflict will balance reintroduction of guerrillas into public life and the punishment of war crimes. Negotiations drew on experience in the wake of crises and conflicts in South Africa, Ireland, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The government and Farc agree to create the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition. All sides will collaborate to tell and document historical truth, search for and identify missing persons, repair individuals and communities affected by conflict and investigate, prosecute and punish the most representative human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Tsai Ing-wen is new to the job and the strain is beginning to show. Elected president of Taiwan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/taiwan-elects-first-female-president\" title=\"\">a landslide victory</a>, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/taiwans-new-president-tsai-ing-wen-vows-to-reduce-dependence-on-beijing\" title=\"\">took office in May</a>, buoyed by high approval ratings. Yet in a few short months, Tsai\u2019s popularity has plunged by 25%. The reason may be summed up in one word: China. Suspicious that Tsai\u2019s Democratic Progressive party, which also won control of parliament, harbours a pro-independence agenda, Beijing suspended official and back-channel talks with its \u201crenegade province\u201d and shut down an emergency hotline.</p> <p>More seriously, for many Taiwanese workers, China also curbed the lucrative tourist trade, which brought millions of mainland visitors to the island during the accommodating presidency of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-tsai-snap-story.html\" title=\"\">Cross-strait investment and business</a> have also been hit.</p> <p>Tsai faces contradictory pressures. The public wants the benefit of closer economic ties with China but Beijing\u2019s intentions are rightly distrusted by a population that increasingly identifies itself as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Given President Xi Jinping\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-apec-china-taiwan-idUSBRE99503Q20131006\" title=\"\">ominous warnings</a> that reunification cannot be delayed indefinitely, China\u2019s military build-up and hawkish suggestions that Beijing may resort to force, Taiwanese ambivalence is wholly understandable.</p> <p>This dilemma \u2013 how to work constructively with a powerful, assertive China without compromising or surrendering national interests \u2013 grows steadily more acute. It is shared by states across the east and southeast Asian region. From Indonesia and the Philippines to Vietnam, Japan, Seoul, Malaysia and Singapore, the quandary is the same. But the answers proffered by national leaders are different and sometimes sharply at odds.</p> <p>The China dilemma is felt strongly in Washington. The US has striven in recent years to strengthen Asian alliances, increase trade and raise its regional military profile \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s so-called rebalance or <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/03/the-legacy-of-obamas-pivot-to-asia/\" title=\"\">pivot to Asia</a> \u2013 in a bid to contain and channel China\u2019s ambitions peacefully. But analysts say the pivot appears to be in trouble. For Europeans fixated on Syria and immigration, this may not seem especially worrying or relevant. That\u2019s shortsighted. If Obama and future US presidents get China wrong, the resulting damage could be global, threatening the security and prosperity of all.</p> <p>Obama is already badly off-track. His grand plan to promote interdependent economic self-interest across the Pacific Rim while excluding China \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP (similar to the controversial US-Europe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/trans-pacific-partnership-provisions-questionable-says-productivity-commission\" title=\"\">in deep trouble</a>.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, declared last week that the TTP was a crucial \u201cpillar\u201d of future US influence. \u201cSuccess or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system and [shape] the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d Abe said.</p> <p>His warning reflected alarm in Tokyo that a risk-averse Obama is again proving an unreliable partner and will fail to get the deal ratified by Congress. It has already been disowned by both his most likely successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e0893e6786bda86d6309e0b9869771507e2fbf/68_0_2063_1238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from United States Navy video purportedly shows Chinese dredging vessels in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington\u2019s painfully obvious inability to curb China\u2019s controversial island-building programme straddling the international shipping lanes of the South China Sea is seen as further evidence that the pivot is failing. Each week seems to bring news of another Chinese airstrip or newly fortified reef. Ignoring neighbouring countries\u2019 rival claims, Chinese has effectively unilaterally annexed 80% of the sea\u2019s area, through which passes $5tn of world trade annually. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by US warships, soon to be backed by Japan\u2019s navy, have had little discernible impact while increasing the risk of direct military confrontation.</p> <p>China has flatly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\" title=\"\">rejected a precedent-setting UN court ruling</a> that deemed its claim to own the Spratly Islands, also claimed by the Philippines, to be illegal. Beijing has taken a similarly intransigent stance in its dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.</p> <p>Some observers detect ulterior motives. China\u2019s military construction on the Spratlys and \u201cits effort to exhaust and eventually displace Japan in a contest for the Senkakus can be seen as an attempt psychologically and physically to isolate Taiwan and to prepare the battle space for China\u2019s possible use of military force to unify the PRC and Taiwan\u201d, an <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/publications/strategic%20comments/sections/2016-e7c1/turbulence-in-the-taiwan-strait-c26e\" title=\"\">analysis</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies said.</p> <p>Perceived American weakness has led some allies to take matters into their own hands. It <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-taiwan-idUSKCN11R109\" title=\"\">emerged last week</a> that Taiwan\u2019s military is also engaged in island fortification, at Itu Aba, its sole possession in the South China Sea.</p> <p>More dramatically still, the maverick Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-14/duterte-turns-back-us-orders-philippines-buy-weapons-russia-and-china\" title=\"\">switched sides last week</a>, announcing Manila would cease maritime co-operation with the US. China, he said, was the stronger partner. Duterte\u2019s shift reflects his anger at American criticism of human rights abuses rather than a deep strategic rethink. But it will certainly hearten Beijing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This feeble anxiety to play down differences, and evident lack of confidence in US leadership, plays into China\u2019s hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other regional players are more cautious, an attitude encouraged by Beijing\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics. Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, meekly agreed in talks with Xi this month that \u201cmaritime co-operation through friendly negotiations\u201d was the best way forward. But like China, Hanoi is rapidly building military capacity and cementing alliances with India, among others, in anticipation of less amicable times ahead.</p> <p>Similar diplomatic hedging of bets was on display in Laos this month, when an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit deliberately avoided mention of the UN court ruling. This feeble anxiety to play down differences \u2013 and evident lack of confidence in US leadership \u2013 plays into China\u2019s hands.</p> <p>The China dilemma extends far beyond the South China Sea. Having made nuclear disarmament a top priority in 2009, Obama has failed dismally to halt North Korea\u2019s accelerating pursuit of nuclear weapons. The threat was underscored by Pyongyang\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/north-korea-nuclear-test-earthquake\" title=\"\"> biggest ever test explosion</a> earlier this month. China, the only country with real leverage, has helped impose additional UN sanctions on North Korea. But it has consistently balked at taking game-changing measures, such as cutting off fuel oil supplies, which could force Kim Jong-un to think again. Beijing also says it will block \u201cunilateral\u201d measures by other countries.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s impotence has intensified questions in Japan and elsewhere about the credibility of the American security umbrella, encouraging nationalists who argue that Tokyo should re-arm in earnest \u2013 or even deploy its own nuclear weapons. But their main concern is not North Korea \u2013 it is China.</p> <p>Xi is not looking for a fight. His first-choice agent of change is money, not munitions. According to Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan, his preferred path to 21st-century Chinese hegemony is through expanded trade, business and economic partnerships extending from Asia to the Middle East and Africa. China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.clsa.com/special/onebeltoneroad/\" title=\"\">massive Silk Road investments</a> in central and west Asian oil and gas pipelines, high-speed rail and ports, backed by new institutions such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, are part of this strategy, which simultaneously encourages political and economic dependencies. Deng Xiaoping once said to get rich is glorious. Xi might add it is also empowering.</p> <p>Western neoliberals are optimistic. They typically argue that market-based economic exchanges can produce a win-win situation for rival states. In this way, China\u2019s rise may be peacefully accommodated, they say.</p> <p>Xi must also calculate that time is on China\u2019s side. \u201cChina\u2019s economic development and military modernisation programmes have witnessed dramatic progress since the early-1980s,\u201d said Karl Eikenberry in the <a href=\"http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/09/chinas-place-in-u-s-foreign-policy/\" title=\"\"><em>American Interest</em></a>. \u201cChina\u2019s aggregate GDP in 1980 was the seventh largest in the world\u2026 By 2014, China\u2019s GDP had multiplied 30 times to more than $9tn and is now the second largest in the world\u2026 The PRC\u2019s military spending, less than $10bn in 1990, grew to more than $129.4bn in 2014, second only to that of the US.\u201d On current trends, China\u2019s 2035 GDP could be a third larger than the US, Eikenberry said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319fa7dff33d84e5d4a210edbbd8b957d66d6d87/0_146_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People watch a TV news showing an image that North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper reports of the ground test of a high-powered engine of a carrier rocket at the country\u2019s Sohae Space Centre in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet for less sanguine analysts, this prospective disparity, this growing lack of balance, plus the expanding number of potential flashpoints in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere, point only one way \u2013 towards future military conflict between the US and China. The Pentagon now officially refers to the Chinese \u201cthreat\u201d.</p> <p>This is the so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\" title=\"\">Thucydides Trap</a>\u201d, a reference to the Athenian historian\u2019s account of the seemingly inevitable conflict between the rising city-state of Athens and the status quo power Sparta in the fifth century BC. Nowadays, the US is the status quo power and China the bumptious usurper.</p> <p>Open conflict is not inescapable, but it is under active discussion. A recent <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-report-details-why-war-between-china-america-would-be-17210\" title=\"\">study by the Rand Corporation</a> made a detailed examination of who might \u201cwin\u201d such a military showdown. It concludes that it would probably be catastrophic for both sides. Yet the study also suggests that, if war cannot be avoided, the US might be best advised to strike first, before China gets any stronger and the current US military advantage declines further.</p> <p>The dilemma is clear: amid rising nationalism in both countries, China is not willing to have its ambitions curbed or contained and the US is not ready to accept the world number two spot. These two juggernauts are on a collision course. It\u2019s unclear who or what can prevent a pile-up.</p> <h2>The other players in the conflict between Beijing and Washington</h2> <h2><strong>JAPAN</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Faced by what it perceives to be a growing threat from China, Japan\u2019s government, led by its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has sought greater freedom to project military force beyond the country\u2019s borders. This is controversial, since it involves the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution. Concrete steps include joint naval patrols with the US in the South China Sea and direct help for coastal states such as the Philippines.</strong></p> <h2>VIETNAM <br></h2> <p><strong>The communist one-party regime in Hanoi is an unlikely partner for the US, given still painful memories of the Vietnam war. But Vietnam has been wooed by Obama and George W Bush as part of Washington\u2019s attempts to control and channel China\u2019s regional ambitions. Vietnam has been involved in deadly fishing grounds clashes with China, with whom it fought a war in 1979. It has also sought help elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered a $500m credit line for defence co-operation. But Hanoi is</strong> <strong>also carefully hedging its bets by keeping</strong> <strong>diplomatic lines open to Beijing</strong>.</p> <h2>INDONESIA<br></h2> <p><strong>The world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia has vast human and natural resources and is seen as one of the new 21st-century economic players. Anxious to balance development needs and national pride, President Joko Widodo </strong><a href=\"http://time.com/4379401/indonesia-china-jokowi-natuna-sovereignty-maritime-fishing-dispute/\" title=\"\"><strong>recently visited the Natuna Islands</strong></a><strong> in the southern South China Sea, scene of repeated, minor fishing boat clashes with Chinese vessels. Widodo vowed to defend \u201csovereign territory\u201d against foreign encroachment. But, officially, Indonesia calls itself a \u201cnon-claimant\u201d country and says it is not formally in dispute with Beijing. This suits both countries, at least for now. By sidestepping their differences, they can get on with business.</strong></p> <h2>SOUTH KOREA <br></h2> <p><strong>The Seoul government is more worried about its unpredictable northern neighbour than it is about China. Its defence minister said last week that South Korea has </strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/23/asia/south-korea-plan-to-assassinate-kim-jong-un/\" title=\"\"><strong>plans in place to assassinate Kim Jong-un</strong></a><strong> and the North Korean leadership if the nuclear threat becomes critical. Seoul sticks close to the US, which maintains military bases in the country. But abiding South Korean distrust of Japan, Washington\u2019s other key east Asian ally, dating back to the Second World War, has undermined attempts to present a united front to Beijing \u2013 with which Seoul maintains friendly relations.</strong></p> <h2>INDIA<br></h2> <p><strong>Like China, India is rapidly expanding its military capabilities, spending an estimated </strong><a href=\"http://www.defenseworld.net/news/15986/Reliance_Defense_Eyeing_Indian_Defense_Market_Worth__100_Bn__Receives_16_New_Licenses#.V-U8hXqHr7I\" title=\"\"><strong>$100bn on new defence systems</strong></a><strong> since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. Like China, its ambition is to project itself as a regional superpower looking both east and west. This potentially brings the two countries into conflict. They have long-standing border disputes in the Kashmir/Xinjiang and Arunachal Pradesh areas. In a forerunner to Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia, George W Bush\u2019s administration launched a strategic partnership with Delhi, partly as a counterbalance to China. For its part, Beijing maintains close</strong> <strong>ties with Pakistan, India\u2019s historical foe.</strong></p> <h2>RUSSIA <br></h2> <p><strong>China and Russia are old enemies dating back to the cold war, but these days, they claim to be close friends. A visit to Beijing by President Vladimir Putin in June saw the launching of a number of </strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/348391-putin-china-visit-rosneft/\" title=\"\"><strong>trade and oil deals worth up to $50bn</strong></a><strong>. China sees Russia as a valuable provider of raw materials but also as a political and military partner in relation to the US. In defiance of Washington, the two countries held large-scale war games in the South China Sea last week, practising taking over islands in disputed waters. Putin also values collaboration as a way of circumventing sanctions imposed by the US and EU after Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea.</strong></p>",

  "<p>The Rose at Kingston has suddenly bloomed. John Malkovich\u2019s production of <a href=\"https://www.rosetheatrekingston.org/whats-on/good-canary\"><em>Good Canary</em></a> makes much of London theatre look slow-witted and slow-eyed. This is the first time Zach Helm\u2019s play, which he finished in 2004, has been performed in English. Malkovich took an early interest in it but \u2013 mysteriously \u2013 claimed it would be better staged in French. So it was, in Paris. Then it played in Mexico.

But you don\u2019t need to know it to feel the vitality \u2013 sad and biting \u2013 of the action. It begins conventionally, as a picture of a talented, troubled, loving young couple. A bartender\u2019s first novel is being published to great acclaim. His wife descants on his success. She is thought by publishers and critics to be a liability. High on amphetamines and her own words, she spends days in ferocious cleaning; it comes on her to-do list between \u201cget up\u201d, \u201ctake speed\u201d and \u201cvomit\u201d. Unleashed on a literary cocktail party \u2013 where a publisher all too persuasively dances around his non-reading of the book \u2013 she glugs a bottle of vodka, tells the hostess she wears too much makeup, and quite brilliantly eviscerates a critic who has praised her husband\u2019s book.</p> <p>She is a nightmare and she is in the right. Her speech about male pronouncements on women\u2019s novels is not merely splenetic but accurate. Freya Mavor\u2019s dervish performance \u2013 gangling, cartwheeling (literally), poignant and droll \u2013 would be worth the trip alone. She is balanced very finely by Harry Lloyd in the less spectacular role of the husband who, unusually, suggests unswerving love with a mild manner.

  "<p>I admit my heart sank a little \u2013 only a little, mind you \u2013 when I first heard that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/15/whit-stillman-the-cosmopolitans\" title=\"\">Whit Stillman</a> was making a Jane&#xa0;Austen adaptation. A singularly literate comic voice in American cinema, he doesn\u2019t work often enough as it is: we can ill afford to donate his gifts to someone else\u2019s comedy of manners, right? Happily, I was wrong; in <strong>Love &amp;&#xa0;Friendship</strong> (Lionsgate, U), Austen\u2019s brisk sense and Stillman\u2019s wily&#xa0;sensibility make for about as perfect an&#xa0;arranged marriage as you could hope for.</p> <p>A quick, zesty take on Austen\u2019s novella <em>Lady Susan</em> that adores and embellishes her language with equal care, Stillman\u2019s film bridges the social and romantic politics of her era with ours. Beneath its whipped-cream quippery, it shows a very real and ruthless understanding of why we pursue relationships \u2013 for a multitude of reasons quite apart from love, friendship or even a compromise of the two. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/kate-beckinsale-phones-tapped-jane-austen-love-friendship\" title=\"\">Kate Beckinsale</a>, an actress too few film-makers have thought to challenge over the years, turns out to be an optimum fit for Austen \u2013 all surface serenity masking Stanley-knife severity. But it\u2019s Tom Bennett, so inspired and endearing as the most gormless of Austen suitors, who is the revelation here, finding exquisite possibilities for physical comedy amid all those impeccable words. Stillman, for his part, lets no opportunity for a laugh, however rueful, slip. Ang Lee\u2019s <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> remains the most&#xa0;gracious of Austens on film, but it\u2019s no longer the funniest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-_HQ0bUzS8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-_HQ0bUzS8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/z-_HQ0bUzS8\">Watch the trailer for The Nice Guys.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a good week for film comedy, as it happens. The jokes in Shane Black\u2019s underworld odd-couple comedy <strong>The Nice Guys</strong> (Icon, 15) are certainly broader and bro-ier than those cultivated by Stillman, but they land just as deliciously. Black has always managed a surprising balance of brawny genre muscle with fleet comic footwork, and while this throwback effort \u2013 stewed in 1970s sweat the colour of tea \u2013 is a straighter, less subversive party than 2005\u2019s <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, he still has considerable fun at the expense of Hollywood\u2019s most po-faced masculine archetypes.</p> <p>The character names are your first clue. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe\" title=\"\">Russell Crowe</a> is brutish enforcer Jackson Healy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\" title=\"\">Ryan Gosling</a> is louche private eye Holland March.

Concentrating its focus on the tiny Sicilian isle of&#xa0;Lampedusa, a key passage point for many North Africans desperate for a better life, Rosi\u2019s patient camera&#xa0;absorbs both the&#xa0;everyday and&#xa0;more extreme frailties of resident&#xa0;and refugee communities, resisting both patronising parallels&#xa0;and sanctimonious assertions of difference. It\u2019s graceful but upsetting viewing, perhaps best viewed with the&#xa0;relatively hopeful chaser of Netflix\u2019s 40-minute original <strong>The White Helmets</strong>, in which documentarian Orlando von Einsiedel (recently Oscar-nominated for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/22/guy-lodge-dvds-fury-serena-effie-gray-life-itself-virunga\" title=\"\"><em>Virunga</em></a>) ventures into Aleppo to study&#xa0;the work of the Syrian Civil Defence, a volunteer group charged with retrieving human life from the rubble.

Market research group NPD, which claims to measure around 70% of the UK toy trade, has recorded a 20% rise during the past year in the sales of tabletop games (including card and dice games, war games played with miniature figures and role-play titles such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, in which players imagine themselves as heroic warriors and wizards in imaginary, fantasy worlds).</p> <p>Ben Hogg, marketing manager at UK distributor <a href=\"http://www.esdeviumgames.com/\">Esdevium Games</a> (which imports the US-produced railway adventure Ticket to Ride, among many other titles) estimates that growth at closer to 35%.

But specialist retailers were rare, so they put in an offer on a small, semi-constructed shop space. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a floor,\u201d Wooding says. \u201cIt was all just rubble.\u201d They raided skips to decorate the shop\u2019s interior in medieval dungeon style and scattered straw over the unfinished floor.

She chose it as one of four focus games, alongside chess, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose\">Game of the Goose</a> and Monopoly, in her exhibition <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/exhibitions/gameplan/\">Game Plan: Board Games Rediscovered</a>. Howell describes herself as more of a traditional gamer, whose strongest memories of childhood are playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2016/sep/05/braconid-brett-smitheram-2016-world-scrabble-championship-quixoty-felty\">Scrabble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/09/cluedo-dr-orchid-sexy-scientist\">Cluedo</a> with her family. She confesses that, until she began thinking about the exhibition around five years ago, she wasn\u2019t familiar with the new wave of board games that populate the shelves of Orc\u2019s Nest and Thirsty Meeples, part of what she calls a \u201cdesigner-led resurgence\u201d that originated in Germany, then spread across Europe and North America. But she was struck by advances in game design that made the experience of playing these games far less fractious (and more enjoyable) than those family Monopoly sessions. </p> <p>\u201cEurogames\u201d, as they are known, are notable for their relatively gentle themes (farming, landscape-building, dock-working), the fact that they reduce the element of luck and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the way they ensure no player is eliminated before the end. The game zero for this revolution is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan\">The Settlers of Catan (now rebranded Catan)</a>, created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Since its publication in 1995, it\u2019s sold more than 22m copies in 30 languages. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players, deeping participants fully engaged and sustaining the drama of the narrative right to the conclusion. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d says Howell, \u201cbecause nobody feels left out.

He was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia\">Reiner Knizia\u2019s 2000 Eurogame title Lord of the Rings</a>, which requires players to cooperate as one of the four questing hobbits from Tolkien\u2019s fantasy epic. \u201cWhen I played that with friends we got scared,\u201d recalls Leacock. \u201cThere was self-sacrifice.

At the time, he recalls, pandemics were \u201cin the news\u201d, with outbreaks of bird flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a>, \u201cso that was very much in the back of my mind\u201d.</p> <p>Pandemic has been a runaway success, and the latest version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/25/pandemic-legacy-review-emotional-highs-agonising-lows\">Pandemic Legacy: Season One</a>, represents another leap forward in game design. Co-created with rising board-game star Rob Daviau, it incoprorates, Leacock explains \u201ca tremendous amount of storytelling. It\u2019s similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes. Irrevocably, in fact. It is an unveiling story. We named it Season One because it has an arc, so it\u2019s akin to watching a season of one of your HBO favourites.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/dont-worry-board-games-video-games-cant-steal-what-makes-you-great\">Don't worry, board games: video games can't steal what makes you great</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The growth of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/12/uk-video-game-industry-gets-4m-funding-boost\">video games industry</a> has, perhaps counterintuitively, been one of the biggest factors in the proliferation of these modern, innovatively designed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/board-games\">board games</a> \u2013 largely because the presence of games consoles under so many millions of TVs and the rise of mobile gaming have normalised game-playing.</p> <p>\u201c[Video games and board games have] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/22/what-video-games-can-learn-from-board-games\">learned an awful lot from each other</a>,\u201d says Esdevium\u2019s Ben Hogg. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a mobile gamer now.

If we\u2019re to emerge from the goddamn dumpster fire that is 2016 intact, we\u2019re gonna need to see our shared humanity, and I [hope to] show by example that tabletop gaming can be about the journey you go on together when you\u2019re playing a game. It can be about the friendships and relationships that form. So when I hear games are selling out all over the place, that thrills me. It means that people who are not already gamers, or maybe not as insane about it as I am, they\u2019re going out and buying them. It\u2019s like Muggles are buying tickets to Hogwarts.\u201d</p> <p>Back at Thirsty Meeples in Oxford, I talk to owners John and Zuzi Morgan. In 2012 they decided to sell tickets to Wheaton\u2019s Muggles, quitting their jobs as social workers to try and turn their love for tabletop games into a full-time business. </p> <p>They already had an extensive game collection, and John had heard about a cafe in Toronto named Snakes &amp; Lattes \u2013 the menu listed games rather than meals \u2013 that had sparked the spread of board-game cafes across North America. After a visit to sample its appeal, the Morgans opened Thirsty Meeples (a \u201cmeeple\u201d is a game component that represents the player, typically in Eurogames a plump, triangular wooden figure), and it\u2019s certainly paid off. \u201cThe trend is upwards,\u201d John tells me when I ask how business is doing.</p> <p>Why does Zuzi think the love of tabletop games grew to such a point that she and John could turn their hobby into their livelihood? \u201cThere\u2019s so much technology,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s busy and you want to bring people back together in a way that\u2019s not just staring at screens.

Then multi-player video games moved online, and fellow players became physically removed from one another, if not completely anonymous. In some digital gaming arenas, that anonymity brewed a poisonous atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cMulti-player video-gaming was fun,\u201d says Wil Wheaton. \u201cAnd then dickheads ruined it.

I wonder if people who had enjoyed all that at first started looking for another way to play games where you could see the person you were playing with.\u201d</p> <p>Direct interaction is important to Matt Leacock, too. \u201cYou connect with people across the table,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing.\u201d And it\u2019s tactile: \u201cYou need to handle the physical components, to get the feel for the texture on the cards and see the wood grain on your components.\u201d</p> <p>Gaming has always had a social function. Fernand Gobet, Professor of Psychological Sciences at the University of Liverpool and co-author of <em>Moves In Mind \u2014 The Psychology Of Board Games</em>, says that in some countries \u201cplaying a board game is part of the culture \u2014 such as mancala games in some African countries \u2014 and can be seen as a soft kind of initiation ritual. But in most countries, the benefit of board games is to offer the opportunity for families to play. In a sense what matters is having such a common activity, and not the detail of the game being played.\u201d</p> <p>These points are echoed by Thirsty Meeples\u2019 patrons. \u201cIt\u2019s the more social thing to do these days,\u201d says Mark, a 35-year-old information modeller from Portsmouth.</p> <p>Roger and Eveline, the couple playing Ticket to Ride, explain that they are in the middle of packing up all their worldly possessions to return to the Netherlands because, says Roger, \u201cwe can no longer afford to live in Oxford.\u201d As cafe regulars, they couldn\u2019t depart without enjoying one final session. \u201cWe seem to be living in an age where we\u2019ve become scared of our sophistication,\u201d he says. \u201cWe crave things that feel authentic.

  "<p>The bitter divisions between David Cameron and Theresa May over Brexit have been revealed in two books about the EU referendum campaign, in which May is described as \u201clily-livered\u201d and an \u201cenemy agent\u201d by Cameron and his allies.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s director of communications, Sir Craig Oliver, says in his expos\u00e9 of Downing Street that the former prime minister\u2019s advisers used the nickname \u201cSubmarine May\u201d because she never came to the surface to support his efforts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/that-didnt-go-to-plan-cameron-spin-doctor-brexit-vote-craig-oliver\">'Well, that didn't go to plan': Cameron's spin doctor on the Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In extracts from Oliver\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/26/david-camerons-spin-doctor-writing-book-eu-referendum\"><em>Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of the EU Referendum</em></a>, published in the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>, Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor says the prime minister pleaded with May to \u201ccome off the fence\u201d about Brexit.</p> <p>Oliver also describes how Boris Johnson \u201cflip-flopped\u201d between Leave and Remain before finally deciding to join the Brexit campaign, and he called Michael Gove a \u201cpolitical suicide bomber\u201d, who had promised Cameron that he would stay loyal at a family gathering at Chequers at Christmas.</p> <p>The second book, <em>All Out War: The Full Story of How Brexit Sank Britain\u2019s Political Class</em>, by <em>Sunday Times</em> political editor Tim Shipman, claims May refused to support Cameron\u2019s hardline approach to negotiations with EU leaders and rejected his plans to ask for an \u201cemergency brake\u201d on immigration \u2013 a stance Cameron described as \u201clily-livered\u201d.</p> <p>The two books are likely to emphasise divisions within the Conservative party over Brexit with former Cameron supporters coalescing around the former chancellor, George Osborne, who said last week he wanted to champion the \u201cliberal mainstream majority\u201d.</p> <p>Oliver\u2019s book is based on conversations with Cameron and Osborne, detailed notes from his time at Downing Street, and conversations with other politicians including Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>The former BBC News executive, who joined Cameron\u2019s Downing Street team in 2011, says the prime minister became intensely frustrated with May over her unwillingness to declare her position before the referendum campaign.</p> <p>Oliver says May failed to support Cameron on 13 separate occasions before she did reluctantly \u201ccome off the fence\u201d for Remain.</p> <p>After one conversation, Oliver wrote: \u201cFrom her point of view, it\u2019s a smart strategy, trying to demonstrate she is her own person, allowing her to have her cake and eat it, but it doesn\u2019t seem fair on DC, who has treated her well. \u201cHer sphinx-like approach is becoming difficult, with the press questioning which way she will jump. The conversation turns around this being the biggest thing the PM has faced and him not even knowing if the home secretary is backing him.\u201d</p> <p>After a newspaper report that Cameron would face \u201clast-minute opposition\u201d to the EU reform deal, the prime minister became \u201cvisibly wound up\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40fe68a4b55a30e734018b31890292201528cd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40fe68a4b55a30e734018b31890292201528cd3f/0_140_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former director of communications for David Cameron Sir Craig Oliver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former director of communications for David Cameron Sir Craig Oliver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSuddenly, he picks up his mobile and calls May, asking her to make clear we have been victorious in our plan to crackdown on \u2018swindlers and fiddlers\u2019 attempting to come into the UK,\u201d Oliver wrote.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he hangs up, he seems to think he\u2019s made an impact. Later, the home secretary issues a statement saying she believes there\u2019s \u2018the basis for a deal here\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThis is interpreted as the moment she climbed down off the fence. After all the concern around her, it all seems to have ended not with a bang, but a whimper.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver also describes how Johnson vacillated between Leave and Remain, sending conflicting text messages to Cameron the day before he came out for Brexit. \u201cI ask DC what makes him so sure Boris is wobbling. He reads out some parts of the text, including the phrase \u2018depression is setting in\u2019, followed by a clear sense that he\u2019s reconsidering. Neither of us is left in any doubt,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI am struck by two things: Boris is genuinely in turmoil, flip-flopping within a matter of hours; and his cavalier approach.\u201d</p> <p>The following day Cameron received a final text from Johnson saying he would be backing Leave \u2013 just nine minutes before he publicly announced his intentions in a chaotic press conference outside his London home.</p> <p>Oliver said that Cameron later phoned him to say Johnson\u2019s final message had been clear that he did not expect to win, believing Brexit would be \u201ccrushed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe says Boris is really a \u2018confused Inner\u2019, and their previous conversations confirmed that view to him,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Shipman\u2019s account of May\u2019s position tallies with Oliver\u2019s. He says that on 27 November 2014, the day before Cameron made a major speech announcing his plan to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, the prime minister met May and Philip Hammond, then the foreign secretary, to outline his strategy.</p> <p>Cameron told them he wanted to ask Angela Merkel and other EU leaders to allow Britain to limit the numbers of EU migrants \u2013 but both May and Hammond rejected the idea.</p>"
