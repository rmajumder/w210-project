Instead it wants something that is perhaps even more of a threat to the EU\u2019s future: it wants to stay part of the union \u2013 and subvert it from the inside. Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, seeks what he calls a counter-cultural revolution within the EU \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/hungarian-prime-minister-viktor-orban-praises-donald-trump\">greater autonomy for nation states and less emphasis on liberal and humanitarian principles</a>.</p> <p>While Hungary has traditionally played a minor role within European politics, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ambitions turned him into the leading populist voice in contemporary Europe. Sunday\u2019s referendum was his latest attempt to build political momentum for an illiberal European future \u2013 and Orb\u00e1n himself presented the vote as a victory.</p> <p>But analysts noted that he had ultimately failed to encourage a majority of his own population to vote against refugees and against a more humanitarian vision of the EU. As a result, this failure has arguably given some unexpected breathing space to the European politicians whose ideas Orb\u00e1n so strongly opposes \u2013 notably Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be viewed as a relief in Brussels,\u201d said Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy, a former EU official and the head of research at Policy Solutions, a Budapest-based thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a disappointing result for Orb\u00e1n and I think his European ambitions will suffer as a result. In domestic politics, he\u2019ll try to spin that he won this \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t send a strong message to Brussels.

But despite the biggest and most divisive advertising campaign in Hungarian history, Orb\u00e1n failed to entice enough voters to the ballot box.</p> <p>Early results suggested that about 43.9% of the Hungarian electorate participated, significantly less than the 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum. </p> <p>This could slow Orb\u00e1n\u2019s political momentum within Europe, said Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy, a former EU official, and a fellow at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. \u201cHow can he win a cultural counter-revolution in Europe if he can\u2019t get a valid referendum result on his strongest issue in his own country?\u201d B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy asked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/01/hungarian-referendum-slam-door-migrants-new-era-europe\">Hungarian referendum decides whether to slam the door on migrants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The deputy head of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, Fidesz, also framed the vote as a triumph. \u201cToday is a sweeping victory for all those who reject the EU\u2019s mandatory, unlimited quotas,\u201d said Gergely Guly\u00e1s. \u201cIt is a sweeping victory for all those who believe that the foundations of a strong European Union can only be the strong nation states.\u201d</p> <p>But Fidesz\u2019s critics said the party had exaggerated the result. Viktor Szigetv\u00e1ri, the leader of Egy\u00fctt, a liberal opposition party, said: \u201cIn his speech, the prime minister failed to recognise the reality. The majority of Hungarians stayed away from the polls and what\u2019s been left behind is a divided country. To heal this, we need a change in government.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts said that the low turnout was ultimately underwhelming for a man who bases his arguments on their popular appeal and whose toxic advertising campaign was five times larger than the next biggest in Hungarian history. Of Hungary\u2019s 20,000 advertising hoardings, 5,888 were used for the referendum campaign \u2013 considerably more than the 1,200 used by a tobacco firm in the mid-1990s, according to research by Transparency International.</p> <p>Csaba T\u00f3th, strategy director at the Republikon thinktank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment for him, but it doesn\u2019t make it impossible for him to claim it as a victory; there are still more than three million people voting for him. But expectations were higher. Despite the very distorted media landscape, and despite all this advertising, it was only enough to mobilise voters from Fidesz and Jobbik,\u201d a far-right opposition party.</p> <p>Liberal opposition politicians argued that the referendum was an attempt to distract from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s domestic failures and told their supporters to boycott the vote in order to render it invalid. Questions were raised over the amount of state funds that were used to pay for referendum adverts in government-friendly media outlets or on hoardings owned by government allies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/hungary-freedom-viktor-orban-rabble-rousers-migrants-refugees-racism\">Hungarians fought for freedom in 1956, not Orban\u2019s rabble-rousers | George Szirtes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government denies any wrongdoing and says the adverts were placed in a \u201ccompletely transparent\u201d manner.

  "<p>Brexit may be the greatest constitutional and political challenge facing Britain in living memory; but Theresa May is determined that it must not dominate the Conservatives\u2019 annual conference in Birmingham this week.</p> <p>Instead, she wants her ministers to get down to the business of creating what giant banners throughout the conference centre call \u201ca Britain that works for all\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the prime minister took the unusual step of addressing the party faithful at the start of the gathering, in addition to the traditional end-of-conference rallying cry on Wednesday, to reassure them she has no intention of backsliding on Brexit \u2013 and, she hopes, to set the issue aside for the next few days.</p> <p>With that aim in mind, May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">told her party three things</a> about how she hopes to ensure that \u201cBrexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it\u201d \u2013 words that have become her catchphrase since the 23 June referendum, but which still raised enthusiastic applause from delegates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\">Don't trust Brexit 'three blind mice', says Tory former minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she will trigger article 50, and the formal process of negotiating an exit, by the end of March. That sets a two-year clock ticking, within which time Britain must agree new trading arrangements with its EU partners, and most likely some transitional agreement that would apply until Brexit formally happens.</p> <p> Secondly, she plans to pass a grandly titled \u201cGreat Repeal Act\u201d in the new year. It will strike down the 1972 legislation that took the UK into the European community, as it was then, and enshrine the so-called acquis, the body of EU legislation, in UK law so that control of it will be returned to Westminster at the moment of Brexit. </p> <p>That\u2019s aimed at providing stability for businesses, by maintaining the status quo for the time being, while opening up the possibility that legislation originating with the EU could be unpicked over time.</p> <p>This Great Repeal Act, which at the outset will do little more than replicate EU law in domestic legislation, is a pragmatic act of housekeeping: it would be simply impossible for Britain\u2019s lawmakers to run the slide-rule over every piece of EU legislation pre-Brexit to decide what to keep and what to ditch.</p> <p>Yet May is keen to satisfy what her Brexiteer colleagues saw as a key part of the appeal of the Vote Leave campaign: the urge to \u201ctake back control\u201d from Brussels. So she painted the Great Repeal Act as returning Britain to being a \u201cfully independent, sovereign country\u201d. </p> <p>But she was quick to pledge that she had no intention of unpicking EU law in one key area in which Brexiteers whinge about Brussels bureaucracy: workers\u2019 rights. That promise undercuts one of the key warnings of remain campaigners in the run-up to the referendum, that hard-won freedoms including maternity rights and paid holidays could be up for grabs if Britain voted to leave.</p> <p> Thirdly, May repeatedly said she would not give a running commentary on Brexit negotiations or set out Britain\u2019s demands in advance. That was a mistake that her allies feel David Cameron made in his ill-fated EU renegotiations last winter. </p> <p>But May does want to make clear that regaining control over migration is key. However, senior politicians across the EU have repeatedly made clear they believe unfettered freedom of movement to be an indivisible element of the single market, and most experts believe Britain will have to pay some price for \u201ctaking back control\u201d of migration.</p> <p>May herself refused to accept a trade-off between Britain\u2019s economic relationship with the EU after Brexit and the ability to decide who comes to live and work here. Instead, she said, she hopes to negotiate \u201cthe kind of mature, cooperative relationship that close friends and allies enjoy\u201d.</p> <p>Anyone who has witnessed the hard-nosed tit-for-tat of global trade negotiations over recent years, or the uncompromising way in which the EU has handled the many rounds of brutal bailout talks with Greece, knows that appeals to friendship and maturity are unlikely to cut much ice in Brussels, or indeed at the World Trade Organisation\u2019s HQ in Geneva.</p> <p>May knows that very well, too, but she will hope that by flourishing her Great Repeal Act, and setting a hard deadline for Brexit, she has done enough to quieten the grumblings from her own backbenches \u2013 and allow her to switch attention this week to her real political project, to occupy the political centre ground.</p>",
  "<p>The slogan around the hall read \u201cA country that works for everyone\u201d. Though not for David Cameron. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative party conference</a> opened with a rather muted film tribute to the former prime minister, featuring shots of a a younger, happier Dave hugging a husky. There were a few claps but most of the audience shuffled in their seats and looked away. They had not come to Birmingham to be reminded of past embarrassments: they wanted to celebrate new triumphs. A brave new world with Britain firmly at the centre of it. A world where the EU bowed before the British Hush Puppy. The king is dead, long live the queen.</p> <p>There are two ways of scheduling a party conference: either you space out your potential liabilities throughout the week or you have done with it and put most of them on together at the start. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> went for the Snow White approach of putting three of her cabinet dwarves, Grumpy, Dopey and Happy, out first on a Brexit-themed day.

We would be going into all negotiations determined to get whatever it was it turned out we wanted and, if we didn\u2019t, the EU could just sod off. The single market; who cares?</p> <p>Snow White\u2019s words should have been music to David Davis\u2019s ears, but Grumpy was even Grumpier than usual. Grumpy doesn\u2019t like having his thunder stolen and is much more comfortable being the wronged outsider than actually being expected to do something constructive.</p> <p>Grumpy had nothing really to add to anything Snow White had said, but he said it again anyway to fill up time. This wasn\u2019t the barnstorming speech he had imagined the day before. \u201cWe just need to be positive in our thinking,\u201d he said, grumpily. The key to Brexit was the Power of Grumpily Positive Thinking and Paul McKenna\u2019s mind control.</p> <p>Next up was Dopey. Priti Patel was not entirely sure why she had been lumped in to the Brexit session and Snow White had not had the heart to tell her it was because she was so boring and a bit dim and she had to be sneaked in somewhere. Dopey used her 15 minutes to pledge \u00a3750m to Afghanistan. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to cut it down from \u00a31.5bn.\u201d Dopey considers the brief of international development minister to be do as little as possible to anyone. Keep Britain\u2019s money British and all that.</p> <p>The last of the dwarves to appear was Happy. Boris Johnson only knows he\u2019s alive when he\u2019s got people laughing at his gags, so he began by telling a story making fun of the Russians. It went down well in the hall, but probably won\u2019t go a long way to helping resolve the crisis in Syria. Happy then continued on the Snow White script. Britain just needed to be confident. Don\u2019t listen to the \u201cgloomadon poppers\u201d. The rest of the world needed Britain far more than we needed them. Foreigners were basically a bit thick and useless compared with us and Britain was singlehandedly responsible for everything good that had ever happened anywhere. Don\u2019t worry about a thing. The world loves us and owes us a living. The world may not see it that way but it made Happy happy.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cSpiritual leaders pray for peace\u201d is not a headline to set the pulses racing. It is news only when they pray for war. Even that, unfortunately, is common enough to raise little attention these days. But something happened last week, almost entirely neglected by the media, which was&#xa0;remarkable and sinister. The Dalai Lama&#xa0;did not pray for peace at the great interfaith meeting in Assisi, where world spiritual leaders, invited by the pope, do gather to pray and witness for peace. There were representatives of almost every other faith whose followers are engaged in violence: Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Japanese Buddhists, Orthodox Christians \u2013 even the archbishop of Canterbury; but the <a href=\"http://www.asianews.it/news-en/The-Dalai-Lama-was-not-invited-to-the-Assisi-meeting-38541.html\" title=\"\">Dalai Lama&#xa0;was not invited</a>. He had to content himself with <a href=\"http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/1460-observing-the-international-day-of-peace-at-the-church-of-peace-swidnica\" title=\"\">a small meeting</a> in an obscure Polish town at which all present pledged themselves to peace.</p> <p>The Dalai Lama had been present at the first of the big Assisi meetings, in 1986, which was then hugely controversial among religious conservatives, for it demonstrated that the Catholic church, under John Paul II, was serious in its efforts to acknowledge the good faith of other religions. But this time he was not invited and it seems clear that this was the result of Chinese pressure. Pope Francis most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/pope-francis-denies-dalai-lama-audience-china-concerns\" title=\"\">refused to see the Dalai Lama</a> in 2014, but he has been persona non grata at the Vatican for many years now. Getting other governments to snub the Dalai Lama has been an occupation of Chinese diplomats for the last nine years or so, ever since <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/washington/18lama.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">George W Bush awarded him the Congressional Medal of Honor</a>. That public recognition of the Tibetan spiritual leader seems to have stung the Chinese state into a furious and long-lasting reaction. The public rhetoric had always been angry, but now it was matched by private pressure. Government after government has quietly cancelled meetings with him. It is in the interest of no side of these squalid little transactions to publicise them: the host countries look weak and unprincipled, the Chinese spiteful and bullying, and the Tibetans just look powerless. In all cases, this appearance corresponds to reality.</p> <p>So, officially, there are hardly any invitations not made. The veil only lifts occasionally. In 2011, the South African government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/dalai-lama-desmond-tutu-visa\" title=\"\">excluded him</a> from Archbishop Desmond Tutu\u2019s 80th birthday celebrations while the British government had to do some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/30/david-cameron-distance-britain-dalai-lama-china-visit\" title=\"\">spectacular grovelling</a> after he visited twice and met David Cameron in 2012. This corresponds very badly with the view of the western general public, which is that the Dalai Lama is one of the most significant and benevolent religious leaders in the world today, a man who genuinely stands for a spirituality of peace and mutual understanding.</p> <p>There is something extremely distasteful in these displays of realpolitik. The Chinese government is engaged in a long-term power struggle with the Vatican over who should have the right to choose bishops: an old story from European medieval history now played out with an Asian power. There are separate official and underground churches. The Vatican clearly calculates that the prize of a thriving unified church in <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/china/christianity-china/p36503\" title=\"\">the potentially huge growth market</a> of China (where most Christianity now is Protestant) is worth a few snubs to a man who is, after all, the leader of a rival religion. But this policy diminishes the moral authority of both parties.</p>",

Conservatives must beware Brexit fundamentalism, or giving themselves up to a romanticised 1950s vision of Britain, a country of imperialist chauvinism. We should be talking about financial passporting and the need to prevent a haemorrhage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/hard-brexit-will-cost-city-of-london-its-hub-status-warns-bundesbank-boss\" title=\"\">banking jobs from the City</a>, not fixating on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/eu-passport-british-passport-brexit-referendum-home-office\" title=\"\">colour of our passports</a>.

But our markets on the continent did not suddenly vanish in an act of democratic will. Our businesses still export there. Inward investors with plants in the UK \u2013 major companies such as Nissan \u2013 still want to sell there, and they are worried. They might have thought of selling in Brazil, India or China already without the helpful advice of politicians that they should just try harder.</p> <p>The collective naivety about the ease of doing global trade deals or what they would entail is staggering. One senior minister said there would be a trade deal with New Zealand before Christmas. Another leading Brexit campaigner predicted a deal with India \u201cfaster than you can say masala bond\u201d. Those who talk so excitedly do not stop to consider the inevitable first demand of major agricultural exporters, which is that we drop our farm subsidies. And they clearly haven\u2019t understood that even poor deals take years to complete.</p> <p>A high quality trade deal with Australia would be a great thing \u2013 but it would account for under 2% of our trade. A deal with India would be a prize \u2013 if ever they would open their markets to us. Yes, let\u2019s try to drive trade deals on the far side of the world. Let\u2019s beat our chief executives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/golf-businessman-liam-fox-lazy-brexit\" title=\"\">with their golf clubs</a> until they sell more in Bangalore and Beijing. But it\u2019s folly to believe that new trade deals are a simple or swift substitute for unhindered access to the world\u2019s largest market of 500 million people on our doorstep, a bloc with which we do half our trade.</p> <p>In case we don\u2019t notice while we\u2019re \u201cre-joining the world\u201d, to use one particularly glib Brexit slogan, trade deals aren\u2019t exactly flavour of the month with the public. On either side of the Atlantic and the Pacific, big proposed deals are foundering. Voters supported Brexit less in a rush of enthusiasm for free trade than to pull up the drawbridge. Prominent Brexiteers who now preach free trade urged sanctions against imports of Chinese steel during the campaign.</p> <p>So if part of the seduction of a hard Brexit is that there\u2019ll be comfort for us across warm oceans, we need to wake up quickly. There won\u2019t be. That\u2019s why we must above all drive the most advantageous deal possible with Europe. It\u2019s not just a question of ensuring that tariff barriers remain down. The single market removes non-tariff barriers, too, while being in the customs union makes it far easier for businesses to sell into Europe.</p> <p>The ideologues may see it as obvious that we abandon these arrangements as we leave the EU, but pragmatists will want to weigh the consequences and the options. During the campaign, many Brexiteers extolled the virtues of Norway or Switzerland, countries which are outside the EU but retain access to the single market. We should at least understand the costs and benefits of these kinds of options \u2013 if not the exact models \u2013 before peremptorily ruling them out.</p> <p>If there is an emerging consensus, it is that Britain must now have more control of immigration. It suits hardline Brexiteers and European politicians alike to argue that this means a binary choice for the UK, either in the single market with free movement of labour, or outside with control over migration. But weren\u2019t we told, time and again, that Britain is big enough to drive its own bespoke deal? It\u2019s hard to see why it\u2019s wise or attractive to say that what we want from the outset is the most brutal severance with the least advantage to us and the most potential economic damage.</p> <p>The jury is out on the new government structure to deliver our departure from the EU. The so-called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/johnson-davis-fox-three-brexiteers\" title=\"\"> \u201cthree Brexiteers\u201d </a>have so far rather more resembled three blind mice, stumbling around the world\u2019s capitals with inconsistent messages, united only in their assurance that it will be all right on the night.</p> <p>Business, which above all prizes certainty, is not so sure. Now the politicians who were already inclined to be deaf to business concerns have been emboldened by the apparent resilience of Britain\u2019s economy in the face of a predicted short-term shock. The risk is that important concerns about the long-term impacts of a hard Brexit will be dismissed.

Here are the key points.</p> <p>Put bluntly, we\u2019re heading for \u201chard\u201d Brexit.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May firmly rejected adopting a Norway or Switzerland-style relationship with the EU when the UK leaves, in what will be seen as the clearest sign yet that the government is heading for a \u201chard\u201d Brexit.</strong> She claimed that it was wrong say Britain faced a choice between \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe there is a lot of muddled thinking and several arguments about the future that need to be laid to rest. For example, there is no such thing as a choice between \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and \u201chard Brexit\u201d. This line of argument \u2013 in which \u201csoft Brexit\u201d amounts to some form of continued EU membership and \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a conscious decision to reject trade with Europe \u2013 is simply a false dichotomy. And it is one that is too often propagated by people who, I am afraid to say, have still not accepted the result of the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>But May defined \u201chard\u201d Brexit as the rejection of trade with Europe. In reality, though, \u201chard\u201d Brexit is generally taken to mean a Brexit that puts an emphasis on independence, and rejects EEA (Norway) or EFTA (Switzerland) arrangements that involve retaining a measure of pooled sovereignty. May made it clear that this was exactly what she was proposing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we are now talking about is very different. Whether people like it or not, the country voted to leave the EU. And that means we are going to leave the EU ...</p> <p>So the process we are about to begin is not about negotiating all of our sovereignty away again. It is not going to be about any of those matters over which the country has just voted to regain control. It is not, therefore, a negotiation to establish a relationship anything like the one we have had for the last forty years or more. So it is not going to a \u201cNorway model\u201d. It\u2019s not going to be a \u201cSwitzerland model\u201d. It is going to be an agreement between an independent, sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May made it clear that, although she wanted companies to have \u201cthe maximum freedom\u201d to trade with the single market, she would not accept any deal that involved the UK having to accept European court of justice rulings or EU free movement laws.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want it to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market \u2013 and let European businesses do the same here. But let me be clear. We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that workers\u2019 rights would continue to be protected as long as she remained prime minister.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the \u2018acquis\u2019 \u2013 that is, the body of existing EU law \u2013 into British law. When the great repeal Bill is given royal assent, parliament will be free \u2013 subject to international agreements and treaties with other countries and the EU on matters such as trade \u2013 to amend, repeal and improve any law it chooses ... Any changes in the law will have to be subject to full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate. And let me be absolutely clear: existing workers\u2019 legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law \u2013 and they will be guaranteed as long as I am prime minister. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the government would invoke article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process, \u201csoon\u201d and before the end of March.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was right to wait before triggering article 50. But it is also right that we should not let things drag on too long. Having voted to leave, I know that the public will soon expect to see, on the horizon, the point at which Britain does formally leave the European Union. So let me be absolutely clear. There will be no unnecessary delays in invoking article 50. We will invoke it when we are ready. And we will be ready soon. We will invoke article 50 no later than the end of March next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is marginally more specific than what May said on the Andrew Marr Show this morning; this morning it was just \u201cbefore the end of March\u201d.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Scotland would not have a veto on Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are the responsibility of the government and nobody else ... Because we voted in the referendum as one United Kingdom, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, and we will leave the European Union as one United Kingdom. There is no opt-out from Brexit. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She implied that she would block further attempts to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will never allow divisive nationalists to undermine the precious Union between the four nations of our United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected the argument that parliament should take the decision to trigger article 50. </strong>The government is being taken to court over this point, but May said Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, would be in court himself to argue the government\u2019s case. (The attorney general is the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, but it is unusual for him to appear in court in person on behalf of the executive.) She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it legislated to establish the referendum, Parliament put the decision to leave or remain inside the EU in the hands of the people. And the people gave their answer with emphatic clarity. So now it is up to the Government not to question, quibble or backslide on what we have been instructed to do, but to get on with the job. </p> <p>Because those people who argue that Article Fifty can only be triggered after agreement in both houses of parliament are not standing up for democracy, they\u2019re trying to subvert it. They\u2019re not trying to get Brexit right, they\u2019re trying to kill it by delaying it. They are insulting the intelligence of the British people. That is why, next week, I can tell you that the attorney general himself, Jeremy Wright, will act for the government and resist them in the courts.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted a future in which \u201cBritain is always the most passionate, most consistent, most convincing advocate for free trade\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She condemned those politicians (like Labour\u2019s Owen Smith and the Liberal Democrats) who are arguing for a second referendum.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Because even now, some politicians \u2013 democratically-elected politicians \u2013 say that the referendum isn\u2019t valid, that we need to have a second vote.</p> <p>Others say they don\u2019t like the result, and they\u2019ll challenge any attempt to leave the European Union through the courts.</p> <p>But come on. The referendum result was clear. It was legitimate. It was the biggest vote for change this country has ever known. Brexit means Brexit \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make a success of it.</p> <p>The final sentence is one that May repeated continually over the summer. She used it again this afternoon with the familiarity of a comedian using a favoured catchphrase.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She reaffirmed her intention not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the Brexit talks.</strong> She implied that speculative media stories about the UK\u2019s negotiating position could harm the national interest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But we will not be able to give a running commentary or a blow-by-blow account of the negotiations. Because we all know that isn\u2019t how they work. But history is littered with negotiations that failed when the interlocutors predicted the outcome in detail and in advance. </p> <p>Every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She praised David Cameron for being willing to \u201cput his trust in the British people\u201d.</strong> May said that was her answer to those who said Cameron made a mistake when he called the referendum.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11c78e4b05962fdf4a25b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:41:17.368Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says if the UK wants to be treated with good will in the Brexit negotiations, it needs to act with good will too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b8be4b015be6383365c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:37:37.333Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Davis says he is \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d the government will get a deal that allows EU citizens to remain in the UK.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f11b34e4b015be63833659\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T14:35:58.135Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Davis says the UK does not want the EU to fail.

After Theresa May told Andrew Marr that she would invoke article 50, starting the formal two-year EU withdrawal process by the end of March, we now have a government commitment to a timetable. The UK has six months at most before article 50 tips us down the slipway towards leaving the EU. In theory at least, once the article 50 letter has arrived in Brussels there is no going back.</p> <p>This is a more important announcement than the overnight one about the \u201cgreat repeal\u2019 bill. It was inevitable that leaving the EU would involve repealing the 1972 European Communities Act, and the press statement from the Tories about the bill said relatively little about what this legislation would look like. But by announcing that she will trigger article 50 before the end of March, May will firmly quash the speculation that has been bouncing around Westminster about the EU withdrawal process being delayed for a year, or even more.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of March\u201d sounds quite soon, but arguably May is announcing a one-month delay. In public, until now, all she had said was that article 50 would not be invoked this year. But in private she has been telling EU leaders it would be triggered early next year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/theresa-may-likely-trigger-article-50-brexit-talks-early-2017\">Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said after a recent meeting with May that he expected the article 50 declaration in January or February.</a></p> <p>Article 50 was easily the key story in the interview, but other bits were interesting too. In particular, May sounded less evangelical about grammar schools than she has done in the past. She preferred to describe the policy in terms of extending selection, and she was very keen to stress that this was only one aspect of a policy document intended to improve standards for everyone.</p> <p>I will post a summary with the main quotes soon, as well as rounding up some reaction.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:33:18.705Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f0cc4de4b015be638334ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T09:04:04.492Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Are you trying to restore cabinet government?</em></p> <p>May say she wants to ensure ministers are involved as policy develops.</p> <p><em>Q: Was government too informal under Cameron?</em></p> <p>May says the last government achieved a great deal.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329#block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\">8.42am.) </a>But here are some of the other lines from Tim Shipman\u2019s interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>May was more explicit than she has been before about ruling out a general election before 2020.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s right that the next general election is in 2020. This isn\u2019t about political games, it\u2019s about what is right for the country. I think an early general election would introduce a note of instability for people.</p> </blockquote> <p>May has ruled out a \u201csnap\u201d election before, and argued that there is \u201cno need\u201d for an election before 2020. But if May is now saying an early election would introduce \u201cinstability\u201d, then it would be harder for her to justify changing her mind on why there might be a need for a pre-2020 poll.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She hinted that she would not wait until the German elections in September 2017 to trigger article 50, starting the EU withdrawal process.</strong> Number 10 has signalled that it will be triggered early next year, probably in January or February.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said that the Tories wanted to build \u201ca new centre ground\u201d and that she wanted to appeal to people who had not backed the party before. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there will be many people who have not been traditional Conservative voters who will see we\u2019re the party that is actually respecting their views, listening to their concerns and responding to them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she thought government should be \u201csmall, strong and strategic\u201d. </strong>Asked her view on government intervention in the economy, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in that position of thinking that all government is somehow bad. Government is good. But it\u2019s important that government is small, strong and strategic.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She denied having Margaret Thatcher as a role model.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t had a role model in my political career and I\u2019m not somebody who says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be like X\u2019. I just look at the issues that I\u2019m faced with and get on and do what I believe to be the right thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that, unlike David Cameron, she stayed up late to do her prime ministerial paperwork. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m an owl rather than a lark, so I will tend to work late. I carry on working and do the boxes that I have.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shipman says it is not unusual for May to finish working at 2am. Cameron preferred to get up at 5.45am to get through his ministerial red box.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She took a swipe at Jamie Oliver.</strong> May loves cooking, but not necessarily Oliver, Shipman suggests. He writes:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her approach to the kitchen is as averse to gimmicks and quick fixes as her politics. I suggest that, with time tight, she might make use of Jamie Oliver\u2019s book Jamie\u2019s 15-Minute Meals. \u201cYes, 15-minute meals with 45 minutes of preparation,\u201d she said wryly, followed by a quick \u201csorry\u201d as she realises she is traducing a national treasure.</p> </blockquote> <p>Towards the end of the interview Shipman also includes this unusual, and possibly quite telling, anecdote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a world that has often portrayed her as humourless but the tape of our conversation is punctuated by laughter. The transcription service sent it back with a note saying: \u201cTheresa May is a very nice woman and the transcriber thoroughly enjoyed listening to her.\u201d No one has sent such a message to me about a politician before.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03c29e4b015be6383332b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T08:02:58.172Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory conference policy announcements</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Conservative conference policy announcements from yesterday.</p> <p>I will be updating the list as new policy announcements get made.</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">Matthew Taylor, head of the RSA thinktank and former head of the Number 10 policy unit under Tony Blair, appointed to lead an independent review of employment practices in the modern economy.</a></strong> Announcing the move, Tory HQ said: \u201cSignalling the importance she attaches to extending workers\u2019 rights - and ensuring they keep pace with these developments - the prime minister today launches an independent review of modern employment practices.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/01/dwp-scraps-retesting-for-chronically-ill-sickness-benefits-claimants\">People with the most severe health conditions who receive employment support allowance, a disability benefit, to be exempt from having to undergo regular health assessments to continue receiving payments.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-make-the-uk-one-of-the-most-digitally-skilled-nations\">Free training to be offered to adults who lack basic digital skills.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/220-million-for-cutting-edge-new-technology\"><strong>A \u00a3220m investment to help life science companies and universities develop viable business projects.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/building-to-start-on-new-nuclear-submarines-as-government-announces-13-billion-investment\">A \u00a31.3bn investment with BAE Systems to enable construction work to begin on the generation of submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles.</a></strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f03aa0e4b015be63833329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-02T07:42:02.312Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May became prime minister this summer with voters having only a relatively hazy view as to what her views are. She had been home secretary for six years but she is something of a political introvert and as a cabinet minister she only gave speeches addressing matters outside her home office brief on perhaps two or three occasions. During the Conservative leadership contest she was all set to elaborate on her thinking during the final stage of the contest. But then Andrea Leadsom pulled out, with the result that only one of the series of speeches May was planning,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf#block-5783a105e4b0ea445f0fe2bf\"> the Birmingham economy speech,</a> actually got delivered.</p> <p>So that is one reason why this promises to be more interesting than the average Conservative party conference. Normally, if the party leader is prime minister, we already know quite a lot about them. This week, and particularly in her keynote speech on Wednesday, May has the chance to flesh out her politics and to present herself to the country she runs in a sharper focus.</p> <p>But there is second issue that will dominate proceedings too: Brexit. Over the summer ministers have said very little about how they will proceed with the EU withdrawal talks, beyond the vacuous and tautologicial \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. This week, and particularly this afternoon, when the conference holds a session on Brexit, May and her team are going to have to say a little more. Equally importantly, conference fringe meetings on the subject are going to give members and MPs the chance to set out what their Brexit demands are.<br></p> <p>Overnight May has announced that Brexit will involve a \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill. Here is the our story on this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">Theresa May to propose 'great repeal' bill to unwind EU laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>May and the Brexit secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a>, will use the opening day of the conference to detail plans for their \u201cgreat repeal\u201d bill that will allow Britain to \u201ctake back control\u201d of its legislation. The bill will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which gives direct effect to all EU law, and at the same time convert Brussels regulations into domestic law. </p> <p>This will give parliament the power to unpick the laws it wants to keep, remove or amend at a later date, in a move that could be welcomed by MPs who are keen to have a say over the terms of Brexit. The move is also designed to give certainty to businesses and protection for workers\u2019 rights that are enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>Davis will say: \u201cTo those who are trying to frighten British workers, saying, \u2018When we leave, employment rights will be eroded\u2019, I say firmly and unequivocally, \u2018No, they won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9am: </em>Theresa May is interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show.

  "<p>Financial markets are preparing for an uncertain final quarter of the year as traders fret about Theresa May\u2019s more concrete Brexit timetable, the health of European banks and the US presidential elections.</p> <p>The British prime minister suggested on Sunday that the country\u2019s exit from the EU would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d</a>, as she implied regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market. May earlier announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>.</p> <p>Some traders fear the prime minister\u2019s moves might lead to a swift fall in the value of pound, mirroring the markets\u2019 reaction immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU on June 23, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/23/british-pound-given-boost-by-projected-remain-win-in-eu-referendum\">sterling slumped to a 31-year low</a>.</p> <p>One trader said that financial markets had not taken account of a \u201ctimetabled hard Brexit\u201d when markets closed on Friday evening, meaning the pound could \u201cgap lower\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>However, others argued that the triggering of article 50 in early 2017 was expected, but the debate about what that move would mean would create uncertainty. <br></p> <p>Joshua Raymond, a director at financial trading firm XTB, said he expected volatility in the value of the pound, with both sides of the Brexit argument using the media to sway public opinion to their side of the argument. He believes that the government had hedged its bets by also implying a soft Brexit.<br></p> <p>He said that the prime minister\u2019s indication that the UK would enact article 50 before the end of March could actually be supportive of the pound in the very short term \u201cbecause of the certainty it provides investors and businesses that the roadmap to Brexit has begun\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cHowever, the main support could come from recent comments from both the prime minister and chancellor, who spoke out against the idea of a hard Brexit to end freedom of movement. That leaves the door open for positive conversations about remaining in the single market, which is the markets key area of concern\u201d.</p> <p>The wavering over what Brexit eventually means comes as traders also try to take stock of how prices might be affected by a host of geopolitical issues, such as the increasingly bitter US presidential election.</p> <p>Alastair Winter, the chief economist at the investment bank Daniel Stewart, wrote in a research note on Sunday: \u201cBarclays Bank\u2019s latest survey shows geopolitical developments to have become the biggest concern to investors. Moreover, concern over the developed market economies (i.e. democracies) continues to overshadow those over China and other emerging markets. This suggests rising fears that the \u2018sans culottes\u2019 with their pitchforks will yet storm the great citadels of the west.</p> <p>\u201cIn summary, the political fundamentals are bad enough but may not get much worse soon. Of course ... the economic fundamentals also look grim.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 rose by 6% in the July-September quarter, its best performance since 2013, as the weaker pound pushed up the value of internationally focused blue-chip companies. Sterling, though, fell against the US dollar for the fifth quarter running \u2013 the worst run since 1984.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">What will happen now timescale for article 50 has been revealed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James Stanley, a currency analyst at foreign exchange group DailyFX, also believes the fourth quarter will be challenging.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some very pertinent themes for markets as we enter the final quarter of 2016,\u201d he said, referring the US election and concerns about the health of European banks following last week\u2019s gyrations in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\">Deutsche Bank</a> share price. The Deutsche sell-off followed reports that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/commerzbank-job-cuts-restructuring\">hedge funds were pulling assets from the bank amid suggestions that Berlin may be forced into a bailout</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. </p> <p>Stanley said: \u201cThe big worry here isn\u2019t just one bank getting hit. The bigger concern is a contagion effect; because banks trade with each other and if one major bank gets taken out, this can create a nasty cascade effect across markets as other banks get pinched by counterparty risk. </p> <p>\u201cSo going into Q4 this is the top theme for markets to watch because, frankly, it can have the most firepower. It\u2019s also going to be one of the most difficult to time and follow, as this is basically a liquid situation that will continue to morph and develop as there isn\u2019t a template-response for the European Central Bank to handle such situations.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May has given her strongest indication yet that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will lean towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, suggesting that regaining control of immigration was more important than access to the single market.</p> <p>Addressing the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, the prime minister also promised that all EU workers\u2019 rights would remain protected for as long as she was in power.</p> <p>Controlling immigration would be the key basis for departure, May said. The government would seek access to the EU\u2019s single market if possible, she said, adding: \u201cBut let me be clear. We are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Reiterating her announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">article 50 \u2013 the legal device to begin the process of departure \u2013 would be triggered by the end of March</a>, May stressed the task of overseeing the negotiations would be entirely up to the government, which would \u201cget on the job\u201d without being delayed or derailed by parliament or devolved administrations.</p> <p>On the final terms for Britain\u2019s EU exit, May argued that debate over a soft or hard Brexit was \u201csimply a false dichotomy\u201d, mainly put forward by those who had not accepted the result of the referendum.</p> <p>People were \u201cletting their thinking about our future relationship with the EU be defined by the way the relationship has worked in the past\u201d, May argued.</p> <p>The negotiations were going to be based on \u201cthe freedom to make our own decisions on a whole host of different matters, from how we label our food to the way in which we choose to control immigration\u201d, May said.</p> <p>She continued: \u201cIt is not, therefore, a negotiation to establish a relationship anything like the one we have had for the last 40 years or more. So it is not going to be a Norway model. It\u2019s not going to be a Switzerland model. It is going to be an agreement between an independent, sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union. </p> <p>Controlling immigration would be the primary concern, May said: \u201cWe have voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent, sovereign country. We will do what independent, sovereign countries do. We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration. And we will be free to pass our own laws.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the speech, the prime minister dismissed the idea of some hardline Conservative Brexiters that the government could walk away from post-article 50 negotiations if they did not go well.</p> <p>\u201cEverything we do as we leave the EU will be consistent with the law and our treaty obligations, and we must give as much certainty as possible to employers and investors,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means there can be no sudden and unilateral withdrawal: we must leave in the way agreed in law by Britain and other member states.\u201d</p> <p>May told the conference that when the European Communities Act is repealed, the EU law would be converted into British statute, which could be changed or repealed as parliament chose.</p> <p>She added: \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: existing workers\u2019 legal rights will continue to be guaranteed in law \u2013 and they will be guaranteed as long as I am prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, May promised to trigger article 50 before the end of March 2017, having also announced plans for a \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d to incorporate all EU regulations in UK law as soon as Brexit takes effect.</p> <p>May told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that she wanted to give \u201cgreater degree of clarity about the sort of timetable we are following\u201d over the process for leaving the EU.</p> <p>Speaking after May at the conference, the secretary of state for Brexit, David Davis, gave no extra details on how the process might take place, while also stressing that \u201cthe clear message from the referendum is this: we must be able to control immigration\u201d.</p> <p>He said this would be balanced as best as possible with trade: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all the options. And we\u2019ll be prepared for any outcome. But it certainly won\u2019t be to anyone\u2019s benefit to see an increase in barriers to trade, in either direction.</p> <p>\u201cSo we want to maintain the freest possible trade between us, without betraying the instruction we have received from the British people to take back control of our own affairs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After 40 hotel-bound hours \u2013 save for a game of golf on an adjoining course \u2013since arriving in Bangladesh, England\u2019s cricketers experienced their first full armed convoy when travelling to the Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka for their first training session before the one-day international series begins on Friday.</p> <p>The five England and Wales Cricket Board vehicles were lined by armed motorbikes and 4x4s. The task force included government troops, special forces, intelligence agencies and scores of police at ground level, with rooftop gunmen in attendance. Roads were closed for the majority of the 15-minute journey (normally it would take four times as long), but on the approach to the ground many fans \u2013 cordoned off by police \u2013 lined the streets for a glimpse of the team bus.</p> <p>As many as 500 people were involved in the security effort, which was funded by the Bangladeshi government; they worked in conjunction with the Bangladesh Cricket Board and the ECB\u2019s security adviser, Reg Dickason, whose visit last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/england-players-skip-bangladesh-tour-terror-fears\" title=\"\">declared Bangladesh safe to tour</a>. Such a convoy will join the team \u2013 who have the director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, for company \u2013 each time they travel to and from the ground.</p> <p>Upon arrival the players seemed at ease as they were whisked into the stadium. Jos Buttler, the captain in the absence of Eoin Morgan, faced close to 100 local journalists, who echoed the public\u2019s sentiment of goodwill that the tour is taking place. \u201cTouring the subcontinent, security is paramount,\u201d said Buttler. \u201cWe are looked after very well. That is part and parcel of making the tour OK. Now we are here we will focus on cricket. Those things will go back into the background.\u201d</p> <p>After Buttler spoke, England trained. First at the nets behind the ground \u2013 overlooked by Dhaka high-rises (with armed gunmen on top) \u2013 before doing fielding practice under lights on the ground (preceded, of course, by the obligatory game of football). All three ODIs \u2013 the first two are here, with the third in Chittagong \u2013 are day-night matches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46ddd1093b64b0b47fa689fc50246533491d33eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46ddd1093b64b0b47fa689fc50246533491d33eb/93_28_5258_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed police guard the England team bus at Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armed police guard the England team bus at Sher-e-Bangla stadium in Dhaka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images,</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier the assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, said he was \u201cmassively disappointed\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/andrew-strauss-disappointed-eoin-morgan-alex-hales-bangladesh\" title=\"\">with the withdrawal of Alex Hales and the regular white-ball captain Morgan</a>, who pulled out because of security concerns, although he believes their absence presents an opportunity to some fringe players. That said, Farbrace was unequivocal in his belief that Morgan should captain the ODI side on their next tour, to India in January.</p> <p>The identity of those who will replace Hales and Morgan, and Joe Root, who has been rested for this leg of the tour, should become clearer on Tuesday when England face a BCB XI at Fatullah. James Vince, Ben Duckett, Jonny Bairstow and Sam Billings are competing to replace the trio, although Farbrace did not rule out Moeen Ali returning to the top of the order. Farbrace said Buttler would keep wicket.</p> <p>\u201cI was massively disappointed that the two of them chose not to go,\u201d Farbrace said. \u201cBut you get over that disappointment and you realise that there are opportunities for others to get a go. If we are going to be challengers in 2019 our pool of players needs to keep expanding. I feel we have 20-21 guys who could play for England and we wouldn\u2019t have necessarily a weaker side.</p> <p>\u201cThe ideal is that the guys coming in do brilliantly, so Alex and Morgs know that getting their place back will be very tough. That\u2019s the only risk that the pair run, that the guys come in, do brilliantly, then in India obviously selection will be very tough.\u201d</p> <p>Farbrace \u2013 who like the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, who arrives from Sydney on Sunday night after visa trouble, was aboard the Sri Lankan team bus that was shot at in Pakistan in 2009 \u2013 seemed unperturbed by the security arrangements. \u201cAround the hotel it\u2019s not too in your face, like Pakistan where there are guards sat outside your door with guns. First thing you see in the morning is a pair of boots and the butt of a gun. It\u2019s not like that here and I don\u2019t think we could be in a better place really.\u201d</p> <p>Like Buttler, the management hope that after the first training session the focus will shift from security to cricket, and Farbrace was quick to warn that England will face a stern foe here. On Saturday Bangladesh completed their sixth straight ODI series win at home, a run that includes victories over South Africa, India and Pakistan, while they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/england-crash-out-cricket-world-cup-bangladesh\" title=\"\">knocked England out of the 2015 World Cup in Adelaide</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a tough place to come, which it didn\u2019t used to be apart from the conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a few of our lads will be quite surprised by the standard they are up against \u2013 not just the tough conditions, but the quality of the opposition. They might not admit it, but I think they will be surprised.\u201d</p>",

It will take effect on the day Britain leaves the EU, now set at no later than the end of March 2019, with future governments able to unpick EU-derived laws as desired.</p> <p>Much of all this work will plainly need to be completed before article 50 is triggered, at which point the two-year clock starts ticking. Liam Fox\u2019s international trade department, meanwhile, is to focus primarily on exploring new trade deals with non-EU countries (none of which can be signed before Britain has left).</p> <h2>The long goodbye</h2> <p>As far as the exit process then goes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> lays down the basic steps. The very first \u2013 a significant potential obstacle \u2013 states that the decision to leave has to have been taken in accordance with Britain\u2019s \u201cown constitutional requirements\u201d.</p> <p>That is one reason why nothing can happen before next year: several cases are currently before the courts arguing that the government does not have the power to invoke article 50 without parliament\u2019s approval. The issue is likely to move swiftly to the supreme court, which will be under pressure to deliver a final judgment by Christmas.</p> <p>Assuming that hurdle is cleared, article 50 says the leaving state must notify the European council \u2013 made up of the 28 heads of government, the council president, Donald Tusk, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 of its intention. This could be in the form of a letter, or a formal statement at a council meeting; the first full European council meeting of 2017 is on 9-10 March.</p> <p>Article 50 then states: \u201cIn the light of the guidelines provided by the European council, [the EU] shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with the state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/hard-brexit-new-bigotry-warns-nicky-morgan\">Hard Brexit will breed new bigotry, warns former Tory minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the university of Essex, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/how-eu-works-leaving-eu/\">points out</a>, article 50 goes on to define three distinct stages of that withdrawal process. First, the council, in the form of its chief Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/belgian-diplomat-to-head-eus-brexit-taskforce\">Didier Seeuws</a>, and the member states it represents \u2013 without the UK \u2013 must agree the broad guidelines for negotiations. </p> <p>This in itself is likely likely to take some months \u2013 and may be complicated by elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany that could well see the arrival of new governments with new positions. </p> <p>Next, the commission\u2019s negotiating team, headed by the French former foreign minister and EU commissioner, Michel Barnier, and his German deputy, Sabine Weyand, negotiates the exit agreement with Britain on behalf of the EU.</p> <p>The third stage of article 50 requires the deal to be approved by the UK and qualified majority of the council: 20 of the 27 remaining states. The European parliament also has to approve it, by a simple majority (and will, its president Martin Schulz and Brexit representative Guy Verhofstadt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/osborne-warns-may-against-hard-brexit\">have said</a>, be no pushover.)</p> <p>All of this, the article states, must be concluded within two years after notification \u2013 at which point Britain, unless it has won the unanimous agreement of the rest of the council, or the agreement specifies an earlier or later date, will no longer be an EU member.</p> <h2>What will the deal need to cover? </h2> <p>Charles Grant of the <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/\">Centre for European Reform</a> likens it to a divorce settlement, \u201cdividing up the properties, institutions and pension rights, and dealing with budget payments and ... the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa\u201d.</p> <p>The most sensible way to tackle the process, <a href=\"https://infacts.org/article-50-process-will-cats-cradle-complexity/\">according to David Hannay</a>, a highly experienced former UK ambassador to the EU, would be for both parties to first sit down and, in a largely technical first stage, agree on a list of everything that has to be covered.</p> <p>Among the most complex issues Hannay identifies are the \u201cacquired rights\u201d of UK and EU citizens, and Britain\u2019s international obligations under agreements it entered into as an EU member \u2013 such as the commitments made on its behalf at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/paris-climate-deal-set-signed-record-number-states-un\">Paris climate change conference</a>.</p> <p>There will also, he predicts, be \u201clengthy and contentious\u201d arguments over Britain\u2019s remaining budgetary and other financial liabilities \u2013 many complicated by the fact that EU programmes in fields such as scientific research and regional development often involve commitments beyond the exit date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/tory-conference-brexit-divisions-moderate\">Bitter fight over Brexit set to overshadow Conservative conference</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>And that\u2019s not all ...</h2> <p>That is not the end. Most experts understand the phrase \u201ctaking account of the framework for its future relationship with the union\u201d to mean, however, that Britain will have to conclude two separate agreements: one on its legal separation from the union, and the other on its future trading relationship.</p> <p>Both the commission and Tusk have said talks on the trade agreement cannot start until after Britain leaves, but several member states \u2013 including Germany \u2013 have indicated that in practice, they will have to be conducted in parallel. </p> <p>In any case, Grant has argued that there will almost inevitably have to be a <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/theresa-may-and-her-six-pack-difficult-deals\">third agreement</a>, too: an interim arrangement to bridge the gap between Britain leaving the EU and the entry into force of the trade deal.</p> <p>That final agreement, trade experts say, could take several years to negotiate, and will be subject to unanimous voting and national ratification by all 27 remaining EU states, leaving open the possibility of almost endless haggling by every member with something to ask of Britain \u2013 think, for example, of Spain and Gibraltar. </p>",

Today registered voters with a college degree favour Clinton by 23 percentage points, while those without a college degree prefer Trump by five.

He belongs to the National Rifle Association and intends to vote for Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton won\u2019t come round here,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cWe\u2019re too low class for her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05ccee6aa359478074fffa7f6cf4dcc910511095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05ccee6aa359478074fffa7f6cf4dcc910511095/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wayne Stonesifer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wayne Stonesifer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton\u2019s followers would object to him hunting deer, Stonesifer believes. \u201cThey have their opinions and I have mine. As long as we don\u2019t bother each other, that\u2019s fine. If you try to interrupt me when I\u2019m hunting, that\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>The country has a bigger divide now than ever, he added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your gay rights, abortion laws, racism. Everybody\u2019s split. It wasn\u2019t this bad when I was growing up. Everybody\u2019s afraid to say something \u2019cos you\u2019re going to hurt someone\u2019s feelings. The 80s were better. I think God needs to be back in the picture; everyone\u2019s taking him for granted. Times are getting nearer.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Dobereiner, 36, owns two small businesses and complains that taxes are too high. He is also supporting Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not a liberal and we\u2019re $20 trillion in debt and unemployment is too high and our healthcare is terrible. The community organiser-in-chief has no qualifications and Hillary Clinton is just an extension of that.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Trump says; I care what he does and he\u2019s not a billionaire because he\u2019s stupid. I like a guy who puts his foot in his mouth because at least he tells the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s plain speaking has been identified as one of the sources of his appeal to voters angry at the status quo in general and Republican establishment in particular. Even his outlandish gaffes are said to humanise him, emphasising his status as outsider and non-politician. His anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim diatribes have disgusted liberals and been cheered at raucous rallies, where he declares his love for \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/john-hudak/\">John Hudak</a>, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cI think supporters look at Donald Trump and see a bit of an everyman, even though his biography completely opposes that worldview. Then they look at Hillary Clinton and see her as more elite than her background would actually suggest. Trump is the person you want to see on TLC; Clinton appears to live the way an average wealthy person lives.\u201d</p> <p>There is a crucial gender dimension, Hudak argues. \u201cA female candidate would not be allowed to ramble like Trump does or Bill Clinton did. Only in a race between a man and a woman could her polish be a liability and his freewheeling be an asset.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has scrambled the orthodoxy of class, for example by tweeting a picture of himself eating McDonald\u2019s fast food and drinking Coke on his luxurious private jet. He loves both boxing and golf. He has named Orson Welles\u2019s masterpiece Citizen Kane as his favourite film but also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/05/19/trump-solo\">once told the New Yorker</a> that Bloodsport, a violent action flick starring Jean Claude Van Damme, is \u201can incredible, fantastic movie\u201d. The music at his rallies ranges from Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s opera Turandot, to Elton John. His properties are crammed with chandeliers, gold leaf, mirrors and marble \u2013 tacky to some, aspirational to others. Both patrician and plebeian, his reading list is said to consist mainly of articles about himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de463ffc89e6f9af955206d01524e1d9cb6c49bf/0_153_2624_1575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloodsport, starring Jean Claude Van Damme \u2026 right up there with Citizen Kane, according to Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some would say he lacks class, in every sense. And there is a tenacious myth that, free of the ossified layers of agricultural and industrial Europe, America is a class-free land of opportunity, where someone born into poverty can become president. It is not so simple, according to sociologists. Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, said: \u201cClass is profoundly important, imprinting all aspects of childhood, self, character and behind, and the denial of it is in the service of keeping alive the hope of lifting out of it. But America would be far better off talking about the realities of it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robert-h-frank.com/\">Robert H Frank</a>, a professor of economics at Cornell University and author of Success and Luck: Good Fortune and the Myth of Meritocracy, added: \u201cPeople here, if you ask them, will say they are \u2018middle class\u2019. Even relatively rich people will answer middle class because we deny there\u2019s such a thing as class here, which is of course preposterous. The barriers are different from England but they\u2019re real.\u201d<br></p> <p>Research suggests that Trump\u2019s core support should not be simply characterised as the white working class. Many earn an average of $70,000 but are caught in the downdraft of deindustrialisation, losing jobs to factory or mine closures, lacking the skills for a digital economy, anxious that their children will be worse off than they were. Joe Sims, a member of the national board of the <a href=\"http://www.cpusa.org/\">Communist Party USA</a>, said: \u201cMy sense is that Trump\u2019s support comes not so much from the white working class but the lower middle class and small business people who have been pushed into the ranks of the working class. The wages are flat and they\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>But in a supposedly classless society, there is often a gap between perception and reality. Sims added: \u201cDuring the 1950s and 1960s there was a myth propagated about the American dream and the American way of life and the sense that everyone was middle class and upwardly mobile. Certainly during that period there was at least a steadiness in increase in income and their children were able to do a little better than them. But this idea of everyone being middle class has crashed on the rocks of reality. Wages have been stagnant since the 1970s.\u201d</p> <p>Numerous academic studies have found that the extent of social mobility was probably always exaggerated and, in the past generation, may have become deteriorated. The <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html\">soaring cost of studying at university</a> has been blamed for stifling upward movement and allowing middle-class families to entrench their advantage. Pew\u2019s research, published last week, found a growing ideological divide, with highly educated adults holding increasingly liberal attitudes, while under a third of the less educated held liberal views.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gqrr.com/stanley-b-greenberg\">Stanley Greenberg</a>, a veteran political consultant and senior pollster for Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the biggest divide between working-class voters and those with a college degree in this election. It\u2019s already there in the polls. Trump is reinforcing it by the nature of the campaign he\u2019s running and the issues he\u2019s running on. He\u2019s driving away college graduates as well as the whole Republican party.\u201d</p> <p>In the Republican primaries, Trump the class warrior made Ted Cruz, the conservative Christian ideologue, look quaint. Greenberg admits that he was surprised. \u201cThe college-educated Republicans keep moving year after year more to the Democrats but this election has really accelerated it because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a candidate running on a straight working-class campaign. [George W] Bush was very much centred on faith; that\u2019s legitimate but it wasn\u2019t an economic argument.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dc7a677059bc63c7fddeaebf61f57d116739e6/0_69_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders stressed income inequality in the primary campaign but Hillary Clinton has yet to emulate his success with the issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he warned against an oversimplified binary split, pointing to the success of Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, in the Democratic primaries. Sanders stressed issues of economic inequality and access to college education, to the extent that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/03/bernie-sanders-failure-diversity-hispanic-black-voters\">criticised by some for neglecting race</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of Democrats who were voting for somebody who was a self-described socialist, running against big money, getting big money out of politics, going after Wall Street and big banks, attacking Hillary for being a creature of the big banks, so you need a third bucket,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThere are others who are not so focused on the racial and cultural issues who are quite ready to rally. Sanders, in the polls at least, was stronger than Hillary against Trump because he actually was winning both millennials and working-class voters.\u201d</p> <p>But now Sanders is out, there are two historically unpopular candidates and a fear of two classes, or tribes, or nations, mutually hostile and suspicious. Like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote in Britain,</a> a painful rift has been exposed and polling day itself will not necessarily heal it. If diehard Clinton and Trump supporters sat down to dinner tonight, would they find much to talk about?</p> <p>In Chevy Chase, an affluent neighbourhood in north-west Washington DC, an area where deer roam audaciously in the gardens of multimillion-dollar houses, Trump fans are hard to find. The owner of the retro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/american-city-diner-owner-fights-trump-puns-signs-jeffrey-gildenhorn\">American City Diner</a> has endorsed Clinton with a giant billboard and sign that says: \u201cTrump exercise: lifting bags of money.\u201d Up the road, the Avalon Theatre, an independent cinema that opened in 1923, sells organic ice cream and shows films including the French-language Les Cowboys.</p> <p>Levon Avdoyan, a 69-year-old librarian strolling nearby, said: \u201cThere are people who live the life of the mind and people who live the life of emotion. Trump is a regrettable example of the latter. He has no politics and caters to the worst part of the American psyche. He caters to people who don\u2019t know what fascism is.\u201d</p> <p>Asked his opinion of Trump\u2019s supporters, Avdoyan replied: \u201cThey\u2019re scared little people.\u201d</p> <p>And how would they regard him? \u201cI\u2019m gay. I\u2019m an atheist. I have a PhD. It\u2019s almost a trifecta.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Shaker, 64, had just been to see the Beatles documentary Eight Days a Week. He said: \u201cTrump\u2019s a vulgar man who knows nothing. He\u2019s a very privileged individual who came from wealth. You\u2019d think he would be cosmopolitan but there\u2019s something primitive about him. I don\u2019t think he would fit here in Chevy Chase but he should because of his background.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d963c7e00d36c614c5eebbe11c465c4914becdfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d963c7e00d36c614c5eebbe11c465c4914becdfd/331_260_2274_2842/800.jpg\" alt=\"Wendie Lubic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendie Lubic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The retired IT contractor added: \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous chasm in the US. In many respects it comes down to urban verus rural. The people who go to a Trump rally are a different crowd. There is a divide between them and other Americans. It confounds me that he\u2019s doing so well in the polls.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in the alfresco dining area of the Chevy Chase Lounge were Diana Blitz, a school counsellor, and <a href=\"http://www.collegeladydc.com/About_Wendie.html\">Wendie Lubic</a>, an education consultant, both of whom intend to vote for Clinton. Blitz, 59, rejected the notion of a class divide. \u201cThere are some poor people who are Clinton supporters; there are wealthy people who are Trump supporters,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing to a disenfranchised group in the US. After a black president, the idea of a woman president is abhorrent to them.

It may come down to an education divide. Colleges try to encourage empathy with others. Many of the Trump supporters are lacking in empathy for people who are not like them.\u201d</p> <p>At another table, Joel Cohn, 52, a lawyer, and his partner Ellen Anderton, 50, a freelance writer, disagreed on one point. Anderton said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to talk to people who were Trump supporters. I wouldn\u2019t want to engage with them.\u201d </p> <p>Cohn responded: \u201cI would, even if they\u2019re \u2018deplorables\u2019. Bring them on. Those voting for Trump think it\u2019s two different countries and two different cultures. They see liberals and Democrats as alien life forms. I grew up in a rural environment and it\u2019s not like guns are totally alien to us. It\u2019s part of class, educational, geographical resentment: it\u2019s more their perception than my perception.\u201d</p> <p>America has been described as a split-screen nation and it is, of course, about much more than class: some polls show Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/\">at 0% among African American voters</a>. But this is the year that a Republican, campaigning as an anti-intellectual vulgarian, won over many who feel neglected by what they view as the metropolitan intelligentsia. America, home of the class divide that dare not speak its name.</p>",

  "<p>Three months ago it looked like a reasonable assumption. In the light of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership, the annual meeting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund </a>would surely be a re-run of the knife-edge affair in October 2008, held less than a month after Lehman Brothers went bust and no western bank was deemed safe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/01/imf-annual-meeting-agenda-economics-growth-brexit\">Brexit, low growth  and the spectre  of protectionism stalk an IMF in sombre mood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The expectation was that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>vote would push the UK economy into an immediate recession, with severe knock-on consequences for the eurozone. Financial markets would be sent into a tailspin, just as they were eight years ago when finance ministers and central bank governors assembled in Washington with the global banking system hanging by a thread. Credit had dried up, trade had stopped, factories were being mothballed. Talk of a return to the 1930s was common and not misplaced.</p> <p>But history has not repeated; Brexit has not proved to be nearly as disruptive to global financial markets as many feared. The strongest echo of 2008 is the speculation surrounding Deutsche Bank; but unlike Lehman Brothers, Deutsche will survive. There will be no talk this week of a second Great Depression. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yet there is a sense in which the challenge for policymakers is even more testing than it was back then. At least in 2008, they knew what they had to do. It was obvious the banks needed a lot more capital to ensure they remained solvent and it was also clear that the public sector would have to provide it.</p> <p>Instead of the normal lengthy communique, the G7 issued a succinct <a href=\"http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm081010.htm\">five-point plan </a>designed to show that the world\u2019s leading industrial nations would act swiftly and decisively. Recapitalisation of the banks was followed in the ensuing months by aggressive measures to boost growth: deep cuts in interest rates, quantitative easing, extra public spending and reductions in taxes.</p> <p>That, in retrospect, proved to be the easy bit. Global capitalism lost its mojo in 2008 and never got it back. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/21/no-economy-is-even-close-to-achieving-its-personal-best\">Growth has remained weak and fragile, even though central banks have kept monetary policy looser for longer than even the deepest pessimist expected when the stimulus programmes began</a>. Brexit is the manifestation of a problem that surfaced in 2008 and has never remotely been solved: how to make the globalised model of finance-dominated capital work for the mass of voters in the developed world. Voters are no longer satisfied when they hear politicians say there is little they can do in the face of global forces. They think that is a cop out, which indeed it is. Governments retain enormous powers: they just have to be prepared to use them. Governments of the left have proved to be just as pusillanimous as governments of the right, which helps explain why the politics of the post-crisis period has not gone to script.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The belief on the left was that 2008 sounded the death knell for the model of capitalism that dominated the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st; one based around privatisation, trickle-down economics, and a shift in the balance of power away from organised labour and towards international banks. Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy would prove to be the equivalent of the Opec oil shock of 1973, the moment the pendulum swung, only this time from right to left.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work out like that. There was no social democratic moment because social democratic parties had largely bought into the idea that markets knew best. They had no critique of what had gone wrong so they lacked a strategy to put things right. What\u2019s more, they still don\u2019t, which is why challenges to Jeremy Corbyn from his Labour party rivals have been so feeble.</p> <p>While the social-democratic left has been flailing around, the public mood has darkened. In Britain at least, this cannot be blamed on rising inequality because inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has not risen since the financial crisis and has stayed pretty much unchanged for the past 25 years.</p> <p>The problem in the UK has been that living standards for those on average incomes have flatlined while those of the 0.1% at the very top have continued to rise. In the years leading up to the crisis, rising living standards meant there was less anger among the workers on \u00a320,000 at the generous pay deals being awarded to their bosses. Now there is barely disguised fury and a political backlash against globalisation that has made negotiating new trade deals a thankless task.</p> <p>Individual governments can sniff the way the wind is blowing. As John Gray wrote in a recent edition of the New Statesman: \u201cMost people are unimpressed by visions of an imaginary egalitarian capitalism. They turn instead to the power of the state to protect them from the anarchy of the market.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the appetite among voters for controls. Ask them whether they support a financial transactions tax and they answer yes. Ask them whether they support curbs on the dumping of cheap Chinese steel that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/tata-steel-financial-aid-pledge-remains-despite-scrapping-of-sale\">threatening jobs in Port Talbot</a> and they answer yes. Ask them if they want controls on immigration and they answer yes.</p> <p>In this, the public shows more consistency than the politicians. Conservative Brexiters are in favour of free movement of capital and goods, but not of people. The Labour party is up for controls on money and goods but supports free movement of labour. The freedoms integral to globalisation are increasingly at odds with democracy. Something has to give.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In the introduction to <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119120950.html\">a recently published book of essays</a>*, Michael Jacobs and Mariana Mazzucato say that the state has a crucial role to play in making economies more prosperous and successful, not least through the role the state can play in nurturing and supporting innovation. This runs counter to the idea that governments should limit themselves to correcting occasional and short-lived market failure, but as Jacobs and Mazzucato rightly note markets are the result of political decisions.</p> <p>The past eight years have been spent trying and failing to get the pre-2008 model of capitalism back on its feet. In its recent trade and development report, UNCTAD conjured up the memory of Karl Polanyi, the Hungarian-American economist who insisted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Transformation_(book)\">a \u201cgreat transformation\u201d was needed to ensure that markets delivered a stable and prosperous future for all</a>. </p> <p>As UNCTAD wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cTrust would have to be rebuilt, regulations strengthened, and rights and representation expanded. Western governments after the second world war were able to strike a balance between market-driven efficiency and the demands for shared prosperity and greater economic security.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There is one big difference with eight years ago. Central banks have become hyperactive in their determination to prevent weak growth and low inflation becoming recession and deflation. Ironically, the great transformation of central banks has helped ensure that nothing else has fundamentally changed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119120950.html\">*Rethinking capitalism; Wiley; \u00a314.99</a><br></p>",
  "<p>The road to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/07/retail.theobserver\">Haparanda</a> in Sweden winds through elk country. Where there are clearings in the birch and pine the view is snowy tundra, empty as the moon. It is a bus route, but it could be heading to the rim of the world, an impression that is only reinforced, as the bus I\u2019m on begins to slow, by the appearance of the terminal itself. Round, sleek and built of glass and steel, it hovers in the mud and snowdrifts like a spaceship making an unscheduled call. High on its flank, bold lettering announces that it serves the twin towns of Haparanda-Tornio, one here in Sweden and the other in Finland.</p> <p>The border, on an island just outside the shopping mall, is 50 yards away. Marked by an artificial stream, it would be obvious, but for the ice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Locals are fond of their Ikea, the planet\u2019s northern-most blue box, built to attract Russians and Finns</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The midnight sun in summer must be magical here, and if I had arrived in February I might have seen the Northern Lights. But the timing was not my choice; I had to follow someone else. In April 1917, at the height of the first world war, the Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, came through here on his way from Switzerland to Petrograd, the capital of revolutionary Russia.</p> <p>It was the most momentous rail journey in history, the first step on the road to Soviet power, and Lenin completed it in eight days. A hundred years on, and sticking exactly to his schedule, I boarded my first train in Zurich five days ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6ba2e04d106ca633dd57007597107761fa65e13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ba2e04d106ca633dd57007597107761fa65e13/294_223_3102_1861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ticket to ride: the architecurally stunning bus station at Haparanda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ticket to ride: the architecurally stunning bus station at Haparanda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Architect: Anja Geigant, DANA arkitektur/MAF.

As I hand him my passport, the hostel-keeper positively snarls. \u201cSheeps?\u201d he blusters. \u201cYou want sheeps?\u201d I look blank, so he tries again, this time adding saliva for emphasis. \u201cSheeps\u2026cheaps\u2026 BED cheaps?\u201d</p> <p>Sheer panic helps me grasp the point (I\u2019m going to have to hire my sheets), but then I glimpse a notice in Cyrillic script about the hefty fines for smoking here. I switch into Russian myself, inducing an immediate transformation in my host. Like me, he lived in Moscow years ago; like Moscow\u2019s, this cold landscape turns out to conceal a warm, generous heart.</p> <p>Still, do not come here for the food. The speciality is reindeer steak; rye bread may be a safer bet. At breakfast, the hostel-keeper is quick to swoop on my plastic-wrapped croissant. \u201cI\u2019m upgrading you,\u201d he explains, handing me an identical package. \u201cThis one is fresh.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73018dcfeb90bed6c9e00b5905b59d5bca8fc14a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73018dcfeb90bed6c9e00b5905b59d5bca8fc14a/0_178_5415_3248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water mark: sunset over the lake.

In search of jam, I find a pickled herring floating in every jar. My Stockholm friends had always said the safest place to eat would be Ikea.</p> <p>The Haparanda locals are still proud of their Ikea, the planet\u2019s northernmost blue box. Built in 2006 to attract Russians and Finns, it is another alien presence, an intergalactic dock to the bus station\u2019s spaceship. It must be packed at some point \u2013 each year, they say, two million shoppers tramp through \u2013 but now the car park is empty.</p> <p>Trade in the town was brisker in the first world war. Back then, unending Swedish trains brought rubber, British boots and broadcloth, jute sacks marked for Tokyo, and oranges for old Peking. The border town was flooded by a sea of crates, a shadow-city with its own dark streets and dead-end squares. No bureaucrat could possibly keep pace, still less search every crate for contraband. By day, the bars in town were full of men in cheap, ill-fitting suits; at night the action shifted to the forest, where fortunes could be made from army-issue guns and fuses, German pharmaceutical supplies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905a75d9d591c76736fd1916dd4a48ec4a4313ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905a75d9d591c76736fd1916dd4a48ec4a4313ad/0_50_4011_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another country: the Tornio river follows the border between Sweden and Finland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another country: the Tornio river follows the border between Sweden and Finland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strangers could disappear in moments in those primal woods. Bad debts were settled with a bullet in the dark; it would have been a simple matter to have dealt with Lenin by the same technique. The British even sent an officer to see to it. The man did what he thought he could. He strip-searched Lenin and he questioned him, but in the end he sent the Russian on his way. Lenin went on to create the first ever Communist superpower. The British officer received an OBE.</p> <p>Haparanda is still a tricky place to leave. I plan to catch an early bus that should connect to the Finnish railway at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2004/feb/28/culturaltrips.finland.homesandgardens\">Kemi</a>. At least, I think that I have got that right.</p> <p>The bus station displays two clocks, one set to Swedish time and one (an hour ahead) to Finnish. My heart stops for a second; I just can\u2019t afford to miss this one. But the bus station ticket office has a man inside: so early, so efficient, such a great relief. He tells me that he has no tickets for sale. \u201cKemi is in Finland,\u201d he says. \u201cThis office is in Sweden.

  "<p>Akram Khan\u2019s new production of <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/\"><em>Giselle</em></a> for English National Ballet is one of the most eagerly awaited dance works of recent years, and for the most part the excitement and anticipation are justified. <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/tim-yip\">Tim Yip</a>\u2019s designs are dramatic, <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/vincenzo-lamagna\">Vincenzo Lamagna</a>\u2019s score is compelling, and Khan\u2019s choreography is very fine indeed. But the work is seriously flawed by structural deficiencies and a thready storyline.</p> <p>We discover a group of figures in parchment coloured shifts and tunics facing a massive wall. Their attitudes are those of helplessness and frustration; they are, the programme informs us, migrant workers. <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/mark-henderson\">Mark Henderson</a>\u2019s lighting places them in silhouette, as enclosed in their individual solitude as Giacometti statuettes. We hear ominous electronic reverberations, and then, as the dancers pick up a massed folk dance, recognisable melody lines from Adolphe Adam\u2019s original <em>Giselle</em> score begin to surface.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A ballet is a story told in movement; you should be able to understand every nuance without having to buy a programme</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Giselle (<a href=\"http://www.alinacojocaru.com\">Alina Cojocaru</a>) and Albrecht (<a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/the-company/dancers/isaac-hernandez/\">Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez</a>) detach themselves. He places a tender hand on her belly. Is she pregnant? They dance together, their exchanges infused with longing. Khan\u2019s background is in contemporary and kathak dance, but he understands far better than most classically trained choreographers how emotion is generated by the chemical wedding of music and balletic geometry. As Hern\u00e1ndaz turns Cojocaru in his arms, her form evanescent as a wisp of smoke, you see the absolute expression of her vulnerability and of his wonder and desire.</p> <p>A security klaxon sounds, an ingenious echo of the hunting horn in the original. Wealthy figures emerge, decked out in elaborately sinister finery. En bloc they resemble a nightmarish vision of an imperial court painted by Vel\u00e1squez. The migrants entertain them with dances that make reference to the work\u2019s traditional choreography but gleam with Khan\u2019s idiosyncratic detail, especially in the alignment of hand, wrist and arm. <a href=\"http://www.ballet.org.uk/the-company/dancers/begona-cao/\">Bego\u00f1a Cao</a> is a superbly cold Bathilde. In her rigid condescension, we read not only her sense of entitlement, but her knowledge of Albrecht\u2019s habitual philandering. To Giselle\u2019s anguished discovery of his treachery, she reacts with barely the flicker of an eye. In Act 2, she treats him with undisguised contempt.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMcHPDN41q0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JMcHPDN41q0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMcHPDN41q0\">Watch Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle in rehearsal.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By this point, however, the piece\u2019s surface pleasures have been compromised by deeper issues of storytelling. Who exactly is Albrecht? Who is Giselle, and why should we care about either of them? In the original 19th-century ballet, the first fact to be established is that Albrecht is a nobleman in disguise. From this deception \u2013 from our knowledge of it and Giselle\u2019s ignorance of it \u2013 stems the ballet\u2019s tension and, indeed, its entire narrative impulse. It\u2019s what makes us invest in Albrecht. We deplore his behaviour, but there\u2019s not a man alive who doesn\u2019t shiver with fellow-feeling for this duplicitous but ultimately contrite figure. The ballet\u2019s called <em>Giselle</em>, but it\u2019s Albrecht\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44e9e4be32b3441d4769490c4cf423ffc3b66545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e9e4be32b3441d4769490c4cf423ffc3b66545/0_360_5406_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cesar Corrales, centre, in Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cesar Corrales, centre, in Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not here. For all the dark splendour of the production, and the luminosity of the choreography, this version by Khan and dramaturge <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/creative-team/ruth-little\">Ruth Little</a> is no one\u2019s story. We\u2019re never told who Albrecht is. He is apparently one of the migrants, without past or hinterland. As is Giselle, in the original a fully realised character, precisely situated in the village hierarchy, but here rendered anonymous. So while you marvel at the spectacle, and at Cojocaru\u2019s affecting performance, you remain uninvolved. One structural problem leads to another. If Albrecht\u2019s real identity is not established, his interactions with Bathilde and his rejection of Giselle make no sense. Nor does her death, whose cause we never learn. The confusion is compounded when, once unmasked as a member of the privileged caste in Act 1, Albrecht remains dressed as a migrant worker throughout Act 2. Why?</p> <p>As presently configured, Khan and Little\u2019s version of the story is a dream-like meditation on <em>Giselle</em> for those already familiar with the ballet. But not everyone is in the know, and there were some puzzled discussions in the interval on Tuesday\u2019s first night. A ballet is a story told in movement \u2013 you should be able to understand its every nuance without having to buy a programme. If it\u2019s not clear who Hilarion (<a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/principal-cast/27-september-2016/cesar-corrales\">Cesar Corrales</a>) is from his actions on stage, it doesn\u2019t help to read that he\u2019s \u201ca shape-changing fixer who trades with and mimics the Landlords for his own and his community\u2019s profit\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/27/akram-khan-giselle-migrant-english-national-ballet-tamara-rojo-interview\">Akram Khan's refugee Giselle: 'A real woman in a catastrophic situation'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These issues are fixable, and they\u2019re worth fixing, because there\u2019s so much here that\u2019s excellent. In Act 2, obsessed with the dead Giselle, Albrecht performs his own mad scene, a solo with subtle kathak inflexions. We meet Myrtha (a truly chilling turn by <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/principal-cast/27-september-2016/stina-quagebeur\">Stina Quagebeur</a>), who drags Giselle\u2019s body centre stage and reanimates it through sorcery. This intrusion of the supernatural is abrupt; it would help if the legend of the Wilis (here ghosts of garment factory workers) was seeded earlier in the piece. But the Wilis themselves are terrific. Lank-haired, dingy-frocked and baleful, they materialise in vengeful ranks, armed with giant sewing needles.</p> <p>Albrecht and Giselle\u2019s final pas de deux is entrancingly sad. She\u2019s not dead, but she\u2019s not quite alive, either. They circle each other, their touches feather-light. He embraces her; she slips through his arms and vanishes, never to return. Flaws and narrative lacunae notwithstanding, this is a hugely impressive production and ENB\u2019s dancers do it full justice.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk/book-tickets\">Touring</a> to Bristol Hippodrome, 18\u201322 Oct; the Mayflower theatre, Southampton, 26-29 Oct; and Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 15\u201329 Nov</p>",
  "<p>One Friday afternoon, I decided to check out a pea-sized lump on my neck that was causing me consternation. I started by calling my GP\u2019s surgery in south London. A recorded message informed me there were no appointments that day; after a few minutes, a receptionist came on the line and said that I could have an appointment on Monday. Not too bad, I thought, until I realised she was not talking about the Monday three days hence, but the one 10 days away. Not so good. I could also try for a walk-in slot or a phone consultation from 8am to 10am on weekday mornings.</p> <p>At this point, I downloaded the app from <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/babylon-health/id858558101?mt=8\" title=\"\">Babylon Health</a>, one of the leaders in online doctor consultations, on to my smartphone. The homepage was purple and teal, the writing welcomingly blobby. I tapped on \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d and after half-a-dozen questions, it suggested that I \u201cbook a consultation\u201d. I was offered a choice between a GP, a specialist or a therapist. The appointment could be on the phone or a video call.</p> <p>I selected a GP and a video call and was booked in to see Dr Patel 34&#xa0;minutes later. As I waited to speak to him, I learned from his biographical detail that he was practising in Leeds, that he\u2019d visited five of the seven continents and enjoyed cycling and skiing. At exactly 3.30pm, he materialised on my phone and welcomed me to Babylon. Our appointment was much like a regular exchange with a GP. There were some surreal moments: as I tried to show Dr Patel my neck, I was reminded of an Amy Schumer comedy sketch on the precariousness and indignity of sexting.</p> <p>But he was engaged and reassuring, calling back when the video feed dropped, and after a few prompts he determined we were probably looking at a sebaceous cyst. They are non-cancerous and can be left alone, as long as they don\u2019t change in size or shape. Soon after the consultation, in case I\u2019d forgotten anything, a video of it was available on my Babylon app and I was sent a short text from Dr Patel that summarised his findings and advice. If I had needed a prescription, it would have been sent within the hour to a local pharmacy. Two days later, my phone beeped with a message to check how I was feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e8d45168196bb44f3bb3846d4be12068596f3e/0_0_696_1294/538.jpg\" alt=\"GP on iPhone\" width=\"538\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a very thorough service, but there was a cost. Babylon offers its triage services, which advise on the urgency of treatment, free, but to speak to a doctor, it\u2019s a rolling monthly payment of \u00a34.99 or a one-off fee of \u00a325. In my case, it provided peace of mind 10 days quicker than if I\u2019d waited to see my GP. But the bigger question is what impact online doctors will have on the provision of healthcare in the UK: are they a valuable tool to reduce the demands on our overloaded doctors and nurses or are they, as one GP I spoke to said, opening \u201ca door to NHS destruction\u201d?</p> <p>The offices of Babylon in South Kensington have been designed to evoke the hanging gardens, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. A tough brief, you\u2019d imagine, and the original designers estimated a cost of \u00a31,000 per square foot. Ali Parsa, the founder of Babylon, bristled at such extravagance and decided to oversee the decorations himself. The result is a long, open-plan office with fake trees and hanging plants dotted around. All the accoutrements of the kidult, forward-thinking workplace are present: free toast and cereals, ping-pong tables that double as large desks for team meetings. An adult scooter leans against a desk, although it\u2019s not clear if this is personal transportation or to whizz along the banks of desks.</p> <p>Why the name Babylon? \u201cFirst, I was born in Iran,\u201d says Parsa, an energetic, fast-talking 51-year-old with a bald head and statement Cutler &amp; Gross spectacles, \u201cso Babylon was always part of our culture as one of the big Persian cities. And two, there is a story about Babylon that goes really well with healthcare. If you got sick in Babylon about two and a half thousand years ago, you\u2019d stand on the square that was designated as a square of the sick and every resident that passed by would tell you if they\u2019d ever come across that disease and, if they had, how they cured themselves. And with that very simple peer-to-peer health service, they had the longest life expectancy in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are going to put an affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth</p> <footer> <cite>Babylon's mission statement</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parsa laughs: \u201cBut the truth is that all of that is nonsense. We called it Babylon because we were too cheap to pay a design agency or a PR agency to go out and figure out some funky&#xa0;name.\u201d</p> <p>In the reception area, the mission statement of Babylon is written on a large mirror: \u201cOur purpose is to democratise healthcare. We are going to put an accessible and affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth.\u201d That\u2019s quite an ambitious goal, I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he nods. \u201cBut actually, if you dissect that, the most difficult part is that you put something in the hands of every human being on Earth. Well, somebody already has. Almost every human being on Earth now has a mobile device. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/27/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony\" title=\"\">Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX</a>, creating a ship, sending it to space, that\u2019s difficult! Putting a doctor on your mobile phone, relatively speaking, is not difficult.\u201d</p> <p>A number of progressive tech entrepreneurs appear to agree with Parsa. <a href=\"https://www.pushdoctor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Push Doctor</a>, founded by Eren Ozagir, claims to be the largest service of its kind in Europe, with about 7,000 NHS doctors in its network. It came about, apparently, after Ozagir fell sick on a trip to the US and bemoaned the fact that you could organise a taxi, a boat, even a helicopter through your phone, but not a doctor. Push Doctor does not attempt to triage or diagnose patients, but instead puts them straight in touch with GPs doing consultations during the time they could otherwise be doing private practice. An appointment costs at least \u00a320 and a premium membership is the same price per month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/googles-deepmind-shouldnt-be-sucking-up-our-nhs-records-in-secret\">Google's DeepMind shouldn't suck up our NHS records in secret</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other players in this market include <a href=\"http://www.drnow.com/\" title=\"\">Now GP</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/GB/app/id1051208054?mt=8\" title=\"\">GPDQ</a> (GP delivered quick). GPDQ can arrange for a doctor to come in person to a home, office or hotel in central London between 8am and 11pm, 365 days a year. The average wait is about 90 minutes.</p> <p>The core message of all of these services is that they are not threatening the NHS, but working alongside it to reduce the burdens it faces coping with a growing and ageing population. Babylon, for example, has started a trial scheme with two GP surgeries in Essex where all patients can use the service free of charge. Early reports apparently found that the average waiting time for appointments came down by a week, to two weeks.</p> <p>The development also fits with the idea that millennials now expect all their services to be streamlined and efficient: from getting the new ramen joint to deliver via Uber to having your dry cleaning picked up from your desk. David Mott from Oxford Capital, which raised \u00a38.2m in funding for Push Doctor, even suggested the NHS should be left to the elderly and infirm, while time-poor 18-40-year-olds use the new app-based services.</p> <p>Where Babylon seems to be taking the lead \u2013 and, Parsa believes, reducing the crisis of the global shortfall of doctors \u2013 is with its use of artificial intelligence. When I tried its \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d feature for the lump on my neck, I was actually being quizzed by what they consider the world\u2019s first accurate AI triage service. In June, an in-house \u201clive challenge\u201d pitted Babylon\u2019s AI against a senior A&amp;E nurse and an Oxford-educated junior doctor. UCL professor Irwin Nazareth compared the results. According to Nazareth, \u201ccheck a symptom\u201d was consistently faster and more accurate in triaging patients than its human rivals: it scored 92% accuracy compared to the doctor\u2019s 82% and the nurse\u2019s 77%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c886d33987eb8aa75a356eb33165d77ab578769d/136_146_2462_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Push Doctor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Push Doctor offers video consultation with NHS GPs, who can provide sick notes, referral letters and prescriptions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Agency One</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This experiment was not the most rigorous of scientific evaluations, but it has shown enough promise for some heavyweight backers to get behind Babylon. In January 2016, the company raised \u00a319m to further develop its artificial-intelligence platform. Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, co-founders of DeepMind, the AI startup bought by Google for $500m, who had already been advising Babylon, invested, as did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/18/theobserver.observerbusiness12\" title=\"\">Richard Reed, Adam Balon and Jon Wright</a>, the men behind Innocent Drinks. For Parsa, the next stage, probably as soon as next year, is that the Babylon app will be able to diagnose patients without a doctor ever needing to be involved.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d trust a machine over a human any day of the week \u2013 and I already do,\u201d says Parsa, whose background is in engineering, not medicine. He arrived in Britain as a refugee in his late teens and has been, among other things, an investment banker and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/09/circle-patients-hinchingbrooke-sick-dream-impossible\" title=\"\">Circle</a>, the private healthcare company that runs hospitals in Bath and Reading and in 2011 took over the struggling Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire. Parsa stood down as Circle\u2019s chief executive in 2012, before launching Babylon in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe machine doesn\u2019t get worked up, it doesn\u2019t get angry, it doesn\u2019t get pushed because there are 20 people outside in the queue,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cA machine learns every time a diagnosis happens. A doctor might do 7,000 consultations. The machine will do thousands of times more. Therefore the speed at which it learns and everything it sees increases. So we believe in time we will do this more accurately than a human.</p> <p>\u201cEven the specialists. How many papers were published last year on dermatology? It was 11,000; 11,000 pieces of research that were worthy of being written down for somebody to take note. Which dermatologist reads this? They say, \u2018Oh yeah, I spend my weekends catching up.\u2019 How many can they read? So the idea that a human brain can keep in touch \u2013 ha!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/05/google-deepmind-nhs-machine-learning-blindness\">Google DeepMind pairs with NHS to use machine learning to fight blindness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parsa does not think that artificial intelligence will replace humans \u2013 at least not in the foreseeable future. But the potential is clearly there. He cites the example of <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/\" title=\"\">DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program</a>, which inflicted a stunning 4-1 defeat on the 18-time Go world champion Lee Sedol earlier this year. The 3,000-year-old Chinese boardgame had been considered one of the \u201cgrand challenges\u201d of AI because of its almost infinite number of possible moves. DeepMind puts the success of AlphaGo down to the fact that the program almost mirrored a human brain: it used trial and error, allied to a dense historical database of games from the past, to play both creatively and minimise mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cThe one game AlphaGo lost was because the guy [Lee] did something that the machine had never imagined can be done,\u201d says Parsa. \u201cHe used his intuition to say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to do something very human here.\u2019 As opposed to something very machine. And the machine got confused. So the methodology we employ is very similar to the way a human brain works, whereby we teach a human how to become a doctor and the same way we teach a machine how to become a doctor. We don\u2019t just use ginormous amounts of data, we give them rules and functions.\u201d</p> <p>It takes around seven years to train a human to become a doctor \u2013 how long then for a machine? \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been at it for three years,\u201d says Parsa, \u201cso maybe it will take us seven years too.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone is excited about the boom in online doctors. While there has been a rush by GPs to supplement their incomes with shifts at places such as Babylon \u2013 it has about 100 doctors on call \u2013 others are concerned about the impact that paid-for services will have on the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d192878149bacd2cc3c7b5a3464b5122dac3049c/0_0_616_1255/491.png\" alt=\"Now GP\" width=\"491\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Now GP offers video GP services and can courier prescription medicines to your home for a fee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NowGP handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGeneral practitioners are a resource in short supply and in great need,\u201d says Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow, Radio 4 regular and author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/state-of-medicine.html\" title=\"\"><em>The State of Medicine: Keeping the Promise of the NHS</em></a>. \u201cWe as a profession are under huge strain and enormous pressure. These companies are essentially using market forces to determine access to GPs rather than need. GPs working in these companies will probably make more money and have a less stressful career. However, patients are far less likely to benefit. This might work in your favour if you are basically healthy, need a one-off appointment and have the money to pay to put yourself in the front of the queue. But if you have an ongoing condition, or multiple or complex needs, the research shows that your care will be better if you have continuity and are looked after by a team that can care for you holistically.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of \u201ca GP in your pocket\u201d emphasises speed and convenience, but McCartney fears that it may ultimately derail our health service. \u201cThese schemes may mean that you end up having to wait even longer to see your NHS&#xa0;GP, as the workforce becomes more depleted,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of these companies won\u2019t see people with chronic diseases or mental illness. This kind of cherry-picking is rife in the private sector and I see these companies as the thin end of the wedge of sleepwalking us into an insurance-based model of healthcare. It needs to be resisted by everyone who cares about the values of the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is aware that not everyone will approve of services such as Babylon. \u201cListen, there will be many comments from your readers that say, \u2018That is brilliant.\u2019 And there will be many that say, \u2018That is awful.\u2019 That\u2019s OK. Think of anything: Facebook \u2013 lots of people say it\u2019s brilliant and lots of people think it\u2019s awful. But the existing model of healthcare we\u2019ve got, guys, is nothing to write home about. One in five of us can\u2019t see a doctor when we need to. One of eight of us gets misdiagnosed. About a thousand of us a month get killed because of avoidable mistakes. So the system we are protecting so much is good but it\u2019s not great.\u201d</p> <p>There has been much discussion of the failure of Britain\u2019s technology sector to produce a Facebook, Uber or Airbnb. Parsa feels that Babylon has the potential to become a similar, game-changing enterprise. <em>Wired </em>magazine recently named the company as one of Europe\u2019s 100 hottest startups and the <em>FT</em> made a conservative valuation of it \u201cin excess\u201d of \u00a377m. Babylon is certainly thinking globally; although its main operation is in the UK, the service is also launching in Rwanda, a country of 11.75 million people that has only a few hundred doctors.</p> <p>Parsa insists that Rwanda is not a publicity stunt: it\u2019s a country where mobile phones are commonplace and it has a progressive, if often heavyhanded, government. Besides, if Babylon can work in sub-Saharan Africa, then it should thrive anywhere. \u201cIn Rwanda or in many countries in the world, people are dying from things that a doctor can fix in no time,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this is not populist. If you\u2019re not doing it, it\u2019s stupid. If you\u2019re waiting two weeks to see a doctor and you can press a button and see it on Babylon, it\u2019s not right.\u201d A shake of the head: \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>Parsa is a convincing pitchman and my first experience with Babylon for my neck was a good one. But, until it becomes clearer how online doctors can coexist with our health service without diminishing it, it will remain hard to savour the benefits it can&#xa0;provide.</p>",

  "<p>Seven hundred or so pages containing 10 years of a diary, two scripts, also essays, eulogies, lectures\u2026 You could call this book a bumper bonanza bargain, except it\u2019s the work of Alan Bennett, so such over-the-top adjectives feel inappropriate. Bennett\u2019s reputation is for wryness, modesty, pointed but unshowy observation. Thwartedness, also: ambitions unfulfilled, passions fumbled. Nothing grandiose or overheated. It would take a braver critic than I to sully his image. Ostentation is not Bennett\u2019s style.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/14/alan-bennett-diaries-lady-in-the-van\">Alan Bennett\u2019s Diary: The Lady in the Van</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His diaries are true to this, though from time to time he insists that he would like to shake things up. \u201cI am in the pigeonhole marked \u2018no threat\u2019 and were I to stab Judi Dench with a pitchfork I should still be a teddy bear,\u201d he writes at the end of 2005. He worries that his work \u2013 that he \u2013 is considered cosy. Discussing the scene in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45OsKkHhv90\" title=\"\"><em>The History Boys</em></a> where sixth-former Dakin seduces Irwin, his teacher, Bennett remarks that \u201cwhere sex is concerned directors think I\u2019m not that sort of writer\u2026 and so don\u2019t entirely trust what I\u2019ve written\u201d. What to do? Actually, he\u2019s written about sex quite a bit \u2013the short book, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lfSHIF9HZk\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a>, written during the timescale of these diaries, consists of \u201ctwo unseemly stories\u201d \u2013 but his sex is always realistic and within character, whether repressed, comic, or vicious. There is no sex at all in these diaries and not much lust, carnal or otherwise. About the cast of <em>The History Boys</em> he comments that they \u201cplay football against the playground wall with an openness and abandon I have never managed in all my life\u201d.</p> <p>This inhibition is a recurring theme; sometimes he regrets it, sometimes it\u2019s embraced. But we would be wrong to deem Bennett a teddy bear. There is righteous anger here. He writes excoriatingly about Tony Blair, Jeremy Hunt, Rupert Murdoch. He is appalled by the Met\u2019s shooting of \u201cMr de Menezes\u201d. He calls Margaret Thatcher \u201ca mirthless bully\u201d, who \u201cshould have been buried, as once upon a time monarchs used to be, in the dead of night\u201d. In 2015, a couple of days after the general election, he is upset by a woman who says casually to him that all politicians are the same. \u201cI hear myself as very rarely shouting at the top of my voice, \u2018No, they are not all the same. This lot are self-seeking liars, the cabinet included, and we\u2019re landed with them for another five years.\u2019\u201d He mentions that if he were a member of the Labour party, he would vote for Jeremy Corbyn, \u201cif only out of hope that the better part of salvation lies not in electoral calculation but the aspirations of the people\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lfSHIF9HZk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2lfSHIF9HZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Alan Bennett reads from Smut</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tolerant of flaws in people who deserve tolerance, he sees the humanity in traitors, the brutality of the elite. He does not really like the police (a dislike that proves wholly reasonable when he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/14/alan-bennett-ice-cream-robbery\" title=\"\">robbed in the street</a>. He reports it and the police immediately inform the <em>Daily Mail</em>). He loathes public schools. He loves libraries. None of this is surprising, really, but is it cosy? I think not. If we find Alan Bennett comforting, the comfort comes partly from his morals, which are robust and uncosy, though of another age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bennett is prolific, but never sloppy. His sentences are always beautiful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unlike some writers, Bennett doesn\u2019t give much away about what the loftier might call his \u201cprocess\u201d. Occasionally, there is a mention of too many notes taken, too much actual writing. He gives away boxes and boxes of his unpublished prose to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He does note the odd structural breakthrough and points out flaws in his earlier work, but pointedly he also says this: \u201cWriters feel threatened by biography, their lives as they see it are what they have put in the shop window, the rest \u2013 what\u2019s in the back place \u2013 their business.\u201d Not all of Bennett\u2019s life is on display or for sale, even in his diaries. He withholds, he edits. He knows what he is doing.</p> <p>(Actually, I assume that this is not merely due to self-preservation. A polite man, Bennett must also be motivated by good manners. He doesn\u2019t want to bore his readers with a long list of aches and pains, of tedious medical work, of the arguments he must surely occasionally have with Rupert, his partner. At one point he has a seven-hour operation, but restricts himself to commenting on the nurses\u2019 uniforms. He mentions his deafness, but mostly for the consequent misunderstanding and jokes.)</p> <p>He is funny, sometimes screamingly so. Some of the diary entries are short, just gags really, shafts of light to leaven the everyday. \u201cIn Dorset, passing a signpost: \u2018That\u2019s where Hardy\u2019s buried.\u2019 \u2018Really?\u2019 Pause. \u2018Laurel\u2019s in Ulverston.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be as bald as that. You\u2019d never know when to stop washing your face.\u201d \u201cWe are in the car when a pretty girl crosses too slowly. If I\u2019d been bold (or insane) I\u2019d have wound the window down and said \u2018Listen. We\u2019re nancies. Big tits mean nothing to us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s his diaries that make up most of this book, Bennett\u2019s other works aren\u2019t afterthoughts. They represent just a small part of what he has been up to, aside from his diligent diarising, his regular articles for the <em>London Review of Books</em>, his books and his plays (during this decade alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/30/fiction\" title=\"\"><em>The Uncommon Reader</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/18/smut-unseemly-stories-alan-bennett-review\" title=\"\"><em>Smut</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/22/the-habit-of-art-bennett\" title=\"\"><em>The Habit of Art</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/08/people-alan-bennett-lyttelton\" title=\"\"><em>People</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/17/hymn-cocktail-sticks-review\" title=\"\"><em>Hymn</em> and <em>Cocktail Sticks</em></a>). Bennett is prolific, but never sloppy. His sentences are always beautiful. So we have a short entry covering the making of the film of <em>The History Boys</em>, the introduction to <em>The Habit of Art</em> (which I loved) and other plays. The two screenplays included are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04j9z7c\" title=\"\"><em>Denmark Hill</em></a>, a radio play written in 1972 and performed on Radio 4 in 2014, and an old film script, <em>The Hand of God</em>. The latter is quite bonkers really, an art whodunnit, an examination of class that also says (as in <em>The Habit of Art</em>) that it\u2019s the art that matters, that the characters are just barrow boys moving it around. There is, you note, a bit of bedroom shenanigans.</p> <p>This book is a pleasure, though, yes, a temperate one. Is it strange to read such even-tempered diaries? If there\u2019s no sex, do we desire more action? Bennett\u2019s life is not commonplace \u2013 too many famous friends and invitations to speak at venerable institutions \u2013 but it isn\u2019t dramatic. He and Rupert go to Yorkshire a lot. They walk around churches and National Trust properties. They have their sandwiches in scenic spots. He goes into detail \u2013 a bit too much detail for me, though other readers may well love it \u2013 about medieval glass, church pews, alabaster monuments.</p> <p>Deaths occur: he is mostly unsentimental. His ex-lover, Anne Davies, dies (he refers to her as \u201cmy friend\u201d), but he says little, other than to commend her son\u2019s impromptu speech. At such times, his reticence can seem chilly, though he is kind about Anne at other moments and earlier makes the quiet point about her that \u201cthe highest form of courage there is, it seems to me, to take away the burden of concern from friends and family\u2026 so that they can go away feeling better about you\u201d. You have a strong sense, sometimes, that he is doing the same.</p> <p>In short, then, don\u2019t read this enormous tome for thrills. This is a life being lived, some of it privately, and we all know what life can be like. Same-same, routine, ordinary. But there is a joy in gentleness, in emotions kept in check, in kindness and domesticity, in nature, in history, in hilarious detail. Bennett knows his age (81 in 2015) and he knows what this means. He is keeping on keeping on \u2013 with his writing, his particular way of going about things, his non-stabbing of Judi Dench \u2013 because that is what he does. Long may it continue.</p> <p><em>Keeping on Keeping on is published by Profile (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/keeping-on-keeping-on.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a320.50</em></a></p>",

The temptation is to pile the scallop under dunes of spinach and crumb, to make a spendy ingredient go further. Here it is a light brioche crust, with a small hillock of spinach underneath. There is the addition of impeccable dry-cured bacon, and lots of garlicky melted butter. We scrape at the shell and wonder out loud whether it would be OK to lift them up and run our tongues along the grooves to get to the best bits.</p> <p>Saying that Northern Ireland has good produce is like pointing out that Hockney isn\u2019t bad at the whole art thing. But the quality does shine through, especially in a lobster and crayfish cocktail, full of pertness and bounce. Here, the Marie Rose sauce has started hanging out in bad company and become a fiery Bloody Mary sauce. The usual ballast of iceberg has been spun through with a fine hand-cut guacamole, which turns it from texture to substance. The innovations are thoughtful rather than for their own sake.</p> <p>The main-course section of the menu is dominated by a box offering various cuts from <a href=\"http://www.hannanmeats.com/\">Hannan Meats</a> over in Moira. Peter Hannan is a one-man PR machine for Northern Irish food culture. At base he is a processor, but oh what a process. Prime cuts from short horns raised on clovered hillsides are allowed to go longer before slaughter and then aged in a Himalayan salt lined room, full of pink bricks that shimmer and sparkle under the light. I\u2019ll be honest. I have no idea what the salt does, and those who understand the science of these things have speculated to little effect. I imagine it can dry the air, which is good for ageing. Is it also mildly antibiotic, knocking out the sort of bugs that might lend a rancid edge to longer-aged beef?

There\u2019s also a daily menu at \u00a318.95 for three courses, and a Sunday lunch at \u00a315.95 featuring meat that\u2019s more mature than I am.</p> <p>The 40-day aged sirloin is about as good a piece of meat as you are ever likely to find, full of depth and intensity and care. Mind you, the accompanying bone marrow gravy, as deep and satisfying as a Jonathan Franzen novel only with more narrative, would make anything dipped in it delicious, even, say, Michael Gove.

The lamb comes from an animal that tastes like it\u2019s seen enough winters to join the grown-ups. The beef and the pork are cuts that once were on nodding terms with a bone, but now stand four square on the plate, that perfect mix of fibrous meat and jellied fat and a glorious dark stickiness. There are sides of sweet potatoes roasted with chilli, of a crunchy slaw and springy greens treated sensitively. A small note: I have seen pictures online of all this served on a dreaded board at the Bull &amp; Ram. I got mine on a plate, which strikes me as a terribly good idea. Plates are brilliant.</p> <p>Naturally, there is a sticky toffee pudding to finish, alongside rum and raisin ice cream. It needs to be broken up and allowed to wallow in the sauce for a few minutes to become properly sodden and shameless. Gingerbread, with the salty tang of bicarb, finishes off both the meal and, frankly, us. This is food for cold nights and roaring fires; for sofa comas, and waking up with a jolt to something on the telly you don\u2019t want to watch and the sweet breathy memory of perfect grilled and glazed meats. It\u2019s worth noting that the day we went was the start of McMichael\u2019s first holiday since opening in June. We wouldn\u2019t have known had we not been told.

  "<p>It was a grey day in October 1998 when I had my first brush with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>. In those days he was just Alex Ferguson, but to me he was already a man whose presence could illuminate any room.</p> <p>It was still the relatively early years of the Premier League and names such as Beckham, Giggs and Cole were showing the world how football should be played. I was working for Sky Movies at the time and, somehow, I managed to get invited to sit in the director\u2019s box at Derby County FC for their game against the Red Devils.</p> <p>Pride Park was a shiny new ground and the boardroom, in which lunch was served after the early kick-off had ended in a scrappy 1-1 draw, was equally impressive. I had already been wowed by the heated seat I was given for the game, but my levels of awe rocketed when \u201cthe Boss\u201d came in about an hour after the final whistle.</p> <p>He mingled with the various footie types, making a particularly respectful fuss of an old gentleman who had been a famed player for Derby in the 40s. But then the moment arrived. He joined the small knot of people I was with.</p> <p>By this stage in my TV career I had been in the presence of countless \u201cstars\u201d, I had worked on primetime shows and even been to the Oscars not once but twice. Surely I couldn\u2019t be starstruck? But I was a jibbering wreck, laughing too eagerly, staring a little too intently, scrabbling for that pearl of chatty wisdom that would impress this brilliant man.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a jibbering wreck, laughing too eagerly, staring a little too intently, scrabbling for a pearl of chatty wisdom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suddenly I became aware of the match programme bulging in my jacket pocket.

He\u2019d broken the ice for me. The Boss obliged, signing his programme and, as he did so, I began to reach inside my jacket, poised to repeat the request.

  "<p>I have not seen an advance copy of the speech that Theresa May will give to the Conservative conference, but I can nevertheless reveal that it will include chunky passages dedicating her government to doing a lot more for the \u201cjust about managing\u201d. I know this because the \u201cjust about managing\u201d, also known as \u201cordinary working people\u201d and sometimes appearing as \u201cthe many, not the privileged few\u201d, have populated every important speech about her domestic ambitions that she has made in the past 100 days.</p> <p>Who exactly does she have in mind and why are they such a preoccupation for the prime minister? Whether or not you regard yourself as a member of this group rather depends on your expectations in life. There are rich folk who will complain that they are \u201cjust about managing\u201d to afford a holiday on a palm-fringed island because of the cost of paying the school fees. Mrs May does not seem to have them in mind. \u201cYou have a job, but you don\u2019t always have job security,\u201d is one of her definitions. \u201cYou worry about the cost of living and the quality of the local school.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of people, then. Much has been written about \u201cthe left behind\u201d, especially in the context of the vote to leave the EU. The group that has her attention is better described as \u201cthe struggling to stay afloat\u201d.</p> <p>In her view, working families with relatively low earnings have been neglected by both the major parties: by Labour because of its central preoccupation with the poor and by her own party under its previous management. So this emphasis strikes a contrast while also seeking to expand the Tory party\u2019s electoral base. When Margaret Thatcher was at the height of her powers, she secured her victories, two of them landslides, with the help of \u201cblue-collar Tories\u201d. To her three victories, John Major added a fourth for the party by keeping that coalition intact. Concentrating on the \u201cjust about managing\u201d is a possible way for the Tories to lure support from Ukip and to go fishing for voters who used to back Labour, but won\u2019t buy Jeremy Corbyn and his \u201c21st-century socialism\u201d. Mrs May will be encouraged to think that she is in promising territory by the focus groups of voters who currently say they like what they are hearing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To rebalance the distribution she will need to demonstrate she is as steely as her friends claim her to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than anything else, her emphasis on the \u201cjust managing\u201d is founded on a view about the EU referendum and why a majority voted to leave. Mrs May keeps telling us that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d. She actually believes that Brexit did not just mean Brexit. The rejection of EU membership was a symptom of something much deeper; the vote for Out was the boiling up of discontents that have been brewing for years. The victory for Leave was powered by the economic and social distress of the less affluent. Not just among the white, working class whose disaffection has been much reported and whose revolt against their traditional party so terrifies many Labour MPs. This alienation went much wider than that.</p> <p>Mrs May and her strategists will be encouraged to think that their analysis is correct by a couple of recently released studies. One comes from the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/hanging-on-the-stresses-and-strains-of-britains-just-managing-families/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a>. It identifies the \u201cjust managing\u201d as the six million working-age households that receive the majority of their income from employment, but who are counted among the poorer half of households. It finds that they have suffered a pronounced degradation in their incomes since the Great Crash of 2008. That has been accompanied by a significant rise in the cost of living, notably the amount spent on housing. They have been squeezed at both ends. For many of the \u201cjust managing\u201d, the rise in housing costs since the turn of the century is the equivalent of an extra 14p on the basic rate of income tax. That\u2019s huge. Little wonder they are very unhappy with the status quo.</p> <p>Since the Brexit vote, people have been dicing and slicing the result to describe the different ways in which it revealed us to be a divided nation. Old versus young. City versus town. England and Wales versus Scotland and Northern Ireland. An analysis by the <a href=\"https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/48-52-healing-a-divided-nation-october-2016-pdf.pdf?sfvrsn=2\" title=\"\">Centre for Social Justice and the Legatum Institute</a> looks at the referendum through another lens. It contends that how you voted came down, most of all, to class and wealth. The upper AB income group was the only one in which a majority voted to remain in the EU. In all the other, lower income groups, the majority was for Leave. Of people living in households earning more than \u00a360,000 a year, 65% supported Remain. Among households earning less than \u00a320,000 a year, 62% backed Out. The authors\u2019 conclude that \u201cthe vote was a cri de coeur<em> </em>from millions of people who feel Westminster no longer knows, or even cares, how it feels to walk in their shoes\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/may-under-pressure-to-name-article-50-date-in-tory-conference-speech\">May under pressure to name article 50 date in Tory conference speech</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mrs May strives to sound as if she does know what it is like to walk in their shoes, even if her preferred footwear is probably not the same as that of most of the people to whom she is trying to appeal. There are the potential ingredients for a guiding mission for her government here. Ultimately, though, she is going to be judged not by what she says, but what she delivers. Her rhetorical flourishes have yet to be backed by much solid policy, apart from a distracting diversion into trying to revive grammar schools. There is a signal that she is interested in doing something about zero hours contracts and other forms of employment insecurity with the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewtaylorrsa\" title=\"\">Matthew Taylor</a>, a former adviser to Tony Blair, to head a review into the \u201cgig economy\u201d. She has made noises about cracking down on unscrupulous bosses and curbing excessive executive remuneration. Her people show awareness that near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing have most benefited those who are already asset-rich, fuelling the resentment and discontent of the many more who are asset-poor.</p> <p>To be serious about rebalancing the distribution of rewards in the economy would mean demonstrating that she is as steely as her friends claim her to be. For it will entail taking on big vested interests which are powerfully represented within her own party. The Tory party\u2019s traditional friends in the City, already unhappy because of Brexit, are pushing back against reform of corporate governance.</p> <p>The prime minister has promised the \u201cjust managing\u201d that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/theresa-may-becomes-britains-prime-minister\" title=\"\">when it comes to taxes, we\u2019ll prioritise not the wealthy, but you</a>\u201d. That sounds like a rebuke to George Osborne for cutting the top rate of tax and easing inheritance tax while jacking up VAT and raiding tax credits that support the living standards of lower earners. Is this just a barb at the expense of the previous chancellor or does it hint at a more meaningful intent? Will her government tilt the tax burden in the other direction by asking for more from the wealthy to fund relief for the less affluent? The introduction of a wealth tax would be bold and counterintuitive from a Tory prime minister. It would also be hugely unpopular with a great many Tory MPs and donors.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s team identify the chronic shortage of affordable housing as an issue that requires intense attention. They are correct. It is and it does. Being serious about that will mean confronting the Nimbyism that is especially prevalent in her party.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Brexit, the great question that dwarfs all others for this government. Inescapably, the fortunes of the \u201cjust managing\u201d are contingent on her government finding a way of departing from the EU which is not disastrous for the trade, investment and jobs on which so many livelihoods depend. The vision of our economic future promoted by some Tory fundamentalists \u2013 an ultra-low tax, ultra-low regulation Britain \u2013 does not sound at all reconcilable with Mrs May\u2019s promises. She will address her conference today on the subject of Brexit and does so under mounting pressure to get more specific about her plan, if she has a plan. What the government is seeking, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\" title=\"\">official communique</a> that was released after the Chequers cabinet at the beginning of September, is \u201ccontrols on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services\u201d. That\u2019s as defined as mush.</p> <p>In the absence of a clearer direction from Mrs May, the hard Brexiters have been making nearly all of the running in the Tory party. This is making business increasingly nervous that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on trade that they can live with. Hear the anxiety coming from the car industry, which directly or indirectly employs nearly a million people, many of whom would regard themselves as \u201cjust managing\u201d.</p> <p>Britons are already poorer for Brexit because of the devaluation of the pound. Anyone who went abroad for a holiday over the summer will have noticed that. Anyone who buys anything made abroad (and this country buys a lot of things manufactured elsewhere) will also be increasingly aware that there is a cost to Brexit even before it has happened. If Britain\u2019s departure is botched, many of the \u201cjust about managing\u201d will be left considerably poorer. Some will no longer be managing at all. Mrs May\u2019s fine words about them will then come back to haunt her, horribly so.</p>"
