Trump has since claimed that microphone issues had affected him, and that online polls declared him the winner \u2013 despite <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/27/donald-trump-s-online-trolls-turn-on-their-god-emperor.html\">reports claiming those numbers were rigged</a> by Trump supporters. </p> <p>But Trump made sure to claim last night\u2019s win as his own; part of his narrative of being a successful businessman who knows how to make deals.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of vice president debates, and last night Americans also got to look firsthand at my judgment \u2013 you need judgment for people, for deals,\u201d Trump continued. </p> <p>\u201cWell, Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America \u2013 his opponent only talked about small and petty distractions,\u201d said Trump in Nevada.</p> <p>But during the debate, Kaine mostly focused on things that Trump had said or done. Kaine questioned Trump\u2019s behavior, such as saying women should be punished for getting abortions (a statement he later backtracked), that Vladimir Putin was a better leader than President Obama or his plans to build a wall between Mexico and the United States.</p>",

Ever since the former Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino almost accidentally ascended to the Fifa president\u2019s office following the fall from grace of Michel Platini the question has been whether the Swiss-Italian who hails from the next village along from Sepp Blatter\u2019s birthplace represents a break from the past or a continuation of it.</p> <p>Allegations that swirled about his predilection for private jets and apparent desire to use his new powers to water down the independence of Fifa\u2019s oversight committees were dismissed by staff as rumours propagated by those who resisted the winds of change blowing through the world body\u2019s HQ.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/03/world-cup-expand-48-teams-fifa-gianni-infantino-suggests\">World Cup could expand to 48 teams, Fifa\u2019s Gianni Infantino suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Infantino\u2019s enthusiasm for his Fifa Legends side, with whom he was endlessly photographed playing alongside and flew to Mexico City at great expense for his inaugural Congress in May, has been put down by supporters to his desire leave the politics behind and focus on football.</p> <p>Yet there was something about his throwaway line positing a 48-team World Cup that was pure Blatter. Apparently off-the-cuff yet clearly designed to start a hare running? Check. Capable of winning votes among those confederations disgruntled with their allocation of World Cup places (that is, anywhere but Europe)? Check. Completely ill-thought through and bearing only passing acquaintance with common sense? Check.</p> <p>Infantino\u2019s proposal for a 40-team World Cup, made to persuade floating voters during the presidential campaign at a time when all the candidates should have been focused only on the mess left behind by the corruption that had eaten world football from the inside out, was bad enough. It made little arithmetical sense and was almost impossible to implement without destroying the competitive balance of a competition that showed in Brazil that on the field at least it was still capable of delivering the goods.</p> <p>But it is so very Fifa, and so very in keeping with the gigantism that infects modern football (see also Euro 2016, Fifa\u2019s endless spin-off tournaments, Uefa\u2019s Champions League mission creep) that, instead of ditching the idea and sticking with 32, Infantino has instead proposed expanding to 48 teams.</p> <p>Not only that but in proposing 32 teams play off to enter the group stages he gives rise to the ludicrous prospect of 16 sides flying in from around the globe to play a solitary match before heading home again. Each of those sides would have to budget and plan for a potential stay of several weeks, bringing all their players to the host country for a pre-tournament training camp with all the attendant hype, before turning around and heading home after one game.</p> <p>The new president may counter that Fifa would pick up the tab but, as with the millions wasted on pointless committees, congresses and publications, this is all cash that could otherwise be diverted into growing the game.</p> <p>The proposal would be funny if Infantino were not so serious. Rather than boosting interest and TV broadcasting income, as he no doubt envisages, it just may go some way to adding to the growing sense of disillusionment with the international game. \u201cIt means we continue with a normal World Cup for 32 teams but 48 teams go to the party. Fifa\u2019s idea is to develop football in the whole world, and the World Cup is the biggest event there is. It\u2019s more than a competition, it\u2019s a social event,\u201d Infantino said.</p> <p>The idea of the World Cup as a party for fans did not seem to be so high in his mind when he was insisting recently that the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar would be triumphs.</p> <p>The expansion idea is so simple minded, and so transparent in its aims, that it barely merits discussion. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that what the president wants he usually gets, despite the reforms that are on paper designed to dilute his influence, and the proposal is sure to receive serious consideration around the table of the Fifa Council next week.</p> <p>The former executive committee may have been rebranded and expanded as part of Infantino\u2019s reform process, but it remains to be seen how much else has changed. Won\u2019t get fooled again? Don\u2019t bet on it.</p>",

Nothing else of substance matters, only reassurance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conference-panel-verdict\">Will Theresa May\u2019s speech appeal beyond Tory conference? Our panel\u2019s verdict | Jonathan Freedland, Polly Toynbee, Anne McElvoy, Joseph Harker, Giles Fraser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May gave that reassurance on Wednesday. She is unscrutinised by the public and is the most opaque of politicians. She duly had to plead with her party to come with her on the \u201cquiet revolution\u201d, entrusted to her government by the voters, to fashion a new \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. She was unequivocal. They should \u201cstop quibbling\u201d and withdraw Britain from the European Union. It should become again a \u201cfully sovereign and independent country\u201d, outward-looking and embracing free trade. As for filling in the details, that was for the \u201cgive and take\u201d and wait and see. It was hardly satisfactory, but it served its purpose.</p> <p>May\u2019s other ambition was harder to articulate. It was to carve out a Mayism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-draws-line-under-cameron-era-with-return-to-small-c-conservatism\" title=\"\">distinct from a Cameronism</a>, to put her own stamp on a government for which the electorate did not vote. Her desire for that most tedious of cliches, change, in \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d, was beyond banality. It is one of those political phrases that reads the same in any word order. In comparison, Tony Blair\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\" title=\"\">\u201cthird way\u201d</a> and David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10680062\" title=\"\">\u201cbig society\u201d</a> seem like white papers. May\u2019s constant reference to \u201ceveryone \u2026 ordinary people \u2026 working people\u2026 working-class people\u201d bordered on a speechwriter\u2019s tic.</p> <p>We know May wants to be cut from a different cloth from Cameron. We are told of her supposed puritanism. She is Thames Valley lowland, not Cotswolds upland.

May\u2019s ruthless culling of the Cameroons was clearly an emotional release, but it suggests a lack of tolerant collectivism. One chumocracy has gone, but only to make way for new chums.</p> <p>May claims to oppose privilege, and believes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/theresa-may-tory-leadership-pitch-andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">fairness, justice, hard work</a> and love of country. Who would not? There was certainly a mischievous, leftwing tinge to her remarks. She ridiculed Labour as the new \u201cnasty party\u201d and must be the first Tory in decades to demand we should \u201cremember the good that government can do\u201d. She is certainly the first to speak in favour of taxation, if only to threaten tax dodgers, multinationals and \u201ccitizens of the world and of nowhere\u201d \u2013 a felicitous phrase. May attacked the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, people who \u201cpatronised the electorate\u201d over immigration and Brexit. We might forget that she too voted for remain. She clearly has \u201cremorse issues\u201d.</p> <p>Of all vacuities, Tory centrism is the most empty. May ruined her pitch by then advocating the brutal divisiveness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/thatcher-grammars-poison-theresa-may-tories\" title=\"\">selective schools at 11</a>. Her belief that this \u201cgives every child access to a good school place\u201d is bereft of intellectual coherence.

She seems likely to do the same on Heathrow. These hard choices mock her professed eagerness to boost under-privileged regions, the powerless and the poor. They suggest the Downing Street apparatchiks cannot tell good infrastructure from bad, or disentangle private gain from public interest. If this is the template for Brexit, it augurs chaos.</p> <p>May is gambling. She feels she is on a roll. She shows no sign of humility towards her lack of a personal mandate. She is cruelly dismissive of the legacy of the man, David Cameron, who holds that mandate, and who put her where she is. She may regard the June referendum as trumping the 2015 election, but she too \u201clost\u201d that referendum. And however it is spun, the referendum was on Brexit, not a government as a whole.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May won a rousing conference reception.

She is defying constitutional propriety by trying to give MPs as little say in the Brexit process as possible.

The Cameroons and the remainers may be crushed and silent, but when the going gets tough, they may become what John Major called \u201cthe bastards\u201d.

Mrs May has to make a reality of that convulsive decision. She will be judged by how she handles it. She gave little away on the EU today that she had not already signalled on Sunday. Migration law will be the&#xa0;priority. The economic consequences remain unclear. But Mrs May\u2019s real aim this week was to get her party behind her. She succeeded in that.</p> <p>Yet this was also a speech that went a long way to revealing what makes Mrs May tick, whether you agree with all, some or none of what she said. The woman who was scorned as \u201csubmarine May\u201d by David Cameron\u2019s circle surfaced today to make some big public declarations. This was not the speech of a liberal, either in economics or in social policy. But it was the speech of someone who thinks government can do genuine economic and social good. It was a speech of ambitious claims, some of them nasty but many not, which, if she turns the words into deeds, may possibly reset the dials of British politics.</p> <p>At the heart of <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/151378268295/prime-minister-the-good-that-government-can-do\" title=\"\">Mrs May\u2019s speech</a> was the reclamation of the role of the state in ensuring fairness and security. The Conservative tradition always had a place for good government. In the 19th century <a href=\"http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/history/joseph-chamberlain-and-municipal-liberalism/\" title=\"\">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, now fashionable in Tory circles, believed that the moral purpose of his adopted city of Birmingham lay in the hands of the local council. In the 20th, Harold Macmillan, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Middle_Way_(Harold_Macmillan_book)\" title=\"\">his prewar Middle Way</a> writings and as postwar housing minister, helping to rebuild Britain, had no doubt that government was a force for good. Yet ever since the ascendancy of Margaret Thatcher, most in the Tory party, whether at the top or the grassroots, have seen government as a problem to be shrunk and moved out of the way. Many in Mrs May\u2019s own cabinet still think that way. Nevertheless her speech could be said to mark the end of that era.</p> <p>Whether that proves so will depend on something that the speech completely skated over \u2013 the policies, measures and specific actions by which Mrs May intends to make good on her claim that there is more to life than individualism and self-interest. She talked at length about protecting British working-class families, about employment rights and the importance of paying taxes. Not so long ago, these priorities were those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a> rather than the government of which Mrs May was a part. Yet now Mrs May praised the NHS and even referenced Clement Attlee as one of the great prime ministers. There is no reason to suppose that this explicit pitch for the centre ground is anything except serious. Mrs May has Labour and Ukip voters in her sights. Jeremy Corbyn and whoever emerges as Ukip\u2019s next leader in the wake of Diane James\u2019s shambolic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/ukip-leader-diane-james-resigns-after-just-18-days-in-job-reports\" title=\"\">18-day tenure</a> should be very concerned.</p> <p>Yet if parts of the speech owed something to Mr Miliband, and others to the legacy of Chamberlain and Macmillan, some parts owed something to the Daily Mail\u2019s shouty populism. The party may already be rowing back from the unsavoury proposal to make firms disclose how many foreign workers they have, but when Mrs May addressed working-class voters whose \u201cdreams have been sacrificed in the service of others\u201d, she was not talking about bankers, tax avoiders and overpaid executives (though she could have been); instead she talked only about the impact of low-skilled immigration. If she is determined to make border controls the red line of the post-Brexit settlement, she is going to have to be much more honest about the likely bad economic consequences, which will hit working-class families in particular.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s speech was an attempt to fuse several traditions, none of them liberal in any of the many senses of that word. But it was not all a lurch to the right, and Mrs May\u2019s opponents should recognise the ambition of what she is doing. British voters seem to approve of Mrs May as prime minister, not least because they dislike the alternatives (and think what kind of speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">Andrea Leadsom</a> would have made today if she had become Tory leader). Today will have reinforced that approval. Yet British voters are not in love with the Conservatives. An interesting speech provides much to discuss and debate. But words are the easy bit. Policies and actions will define whether the change which Mrs May promised is a real possibility or not.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAnd foreign students, even those studying English language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">Rudd takes aim at students in bid for lower immigration</a>, 5 October).

What is \u201cthis one-size-fits-all approach\u201d that Ms Rudd invokes? While universities are in principle autonomous and have discretion on entry criteria, the reality for foreign students, as for all others, is that recognised qualifications in English and maths are obligatory, whether through GCSE grades A-C, International English Language Testing System scores, access diplomas, or equivalences recognised by the UK\u2019s National Academic Recognition Information Centre. Should it be the case that some higher education institutions waive such English and maths conditions, Rudd might wish to look at the UK\u2019s private universities, whose growth has been encouraged by HE minister Jo Johnson and his predecessors.<br><strong>Bruce Ross-Smith</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Amber Rudd\u2019s speech was the most depressing and dispiriting speech I\u2019ve heard in many long years. She\u2019s hellbent on shrinking the UK and its stature in the world by a profoundly misconceived illusion that she\u2019s strengthening it. Instead of diminishing the old idea of \u201cforeigners\u201d in today\u2019s more closely connected world, Rudd is giving the word \u201cforeign\u201d new energy. And in doing so she\u2019s building the potential for increasing isolation that will inevitably mean a far-reaching range of both cultural and economic impoverishments. Soon our great universities will weaken in their influence and their skills, as they become undesirable and potentially hostile destinations for those from other nations. Both students and professors, as well many of our doctors and nurses, will prefer to work in more welcoming and grateful nations. By creating registers of foreigners, Rudd will be steadily instilling a climate of inhospitality and fear, both of which are out of character with the spirit of the UK and contrary to its interests.<br><strong>Michael Wolff</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022 In the 18th and 19th centuries the forebears of Theresa May and Amber Rudd swarmed with impunity into vast swaths of Africa and Asia as well as large chunks of the Americas.

  "<p>The UK has been singled out in a new report as being among the worst countries in the developed world to be a young mother seeking work.</p> <p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the UK, along with the US, Ireland and New Zealand, scored lowest out of its 35 member states for this demographic, especially when women are in a couple without access to state subsidies. It said women were on average 1.4 times more likely to be not in education, employment or training (Neet) than men.</p> <p>\u201cFor many of them, this is because they are looking after small children and the high cost of childcare is a major barrier to employment. In the United States, Ireland, United Kingdom and New Zealand, childcare costs for a lone parent can account for between one-third and a half of net income,\u201d the OECD said in its report <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/social/society-at-a-glance-19991290.htm\">Society at a Glance 2016</a><em>, </em>which checks on the wellbeing of households across member states.</p> <p>The steep rise in childcare costs in the UK means it is the worst place in the OECD to be a couple with young children, the report said. But the introduction of child tax credits means it is among the best countries to be a single parent, alongside Denmark, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria, taking into account childcare costs.<br></p> <p>However, the UK had one of the lowest rates of youth unemployment, the OECD said, and was more successful than most large economies in allowing young people to combine work and education, beating Germany, the US, Sweden, France and Japan.</p> <p>Italy joined Portugal, Spain and Greece as the worst in offering young people work or both work and education. They also had the highest numbers of Neets.</p> <p>Britain has also seen significant improvements in pupil performance at secondary schools over the last 10 years but still has one of the lowest levels of literacy and numeracy among Neets, according to the OECD report.</p> <p>Well-funded further education institutions are also important to young people who leave school with poor qualifications. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/10/tories-further-education-cuts-david-cameron\">successive governments have cut further education budgets by 14%</a>, adjusted for inflation, since 2010, prompting Labour to say they operate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/13/sixth-form-colleges-we-are-an-endangered-species\">on a shoestring</a>.</p> <p>Turkey has the highest proportion of Neets, followed by Italy, Greece, Spain and Mexico. Britain ranks 19th out of the OECD\u2019s 35 members, with Iceland and the Netherlands having the lowest rates.</p> <p>More generally, the OECD report said that young people found it harder to get a job in 2016 and warned the economic recovery across the developed world may not come to their rescue. </p> <p>The OECD said young people who leave school at 16 with low skills are facing increasing challenges in finding a job.

  "<p>In an asymmetrical neckline, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> declares her asymmetrical vision. Asymmetrical because there is no balance between so many of her pronouncements; indeed, some are quite contradictory. There is no point at which opposing views are squished together into some kind of Blairite compromise. Nor is it the economy, stupid: it\u2019s about identity. It is a rightwing power grab that hopes to scoop up those who have just about managed to vote Labour in the past.</p> <p>It is new and it is scary and, although May is the unelected head of a government with a small majority, she is acting as if she has a huge mandate to fundamentally change the nature of the UK. It is not enough that we are leaving Europe, she is attempting to nail down the Tories as the party of the workers, absorb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\">Ukip</a>, intervene in business via the state, and hit the left where it hurts them personally. She is reclaiming the notions of fairness, compassion and moral superiority. Right now, the left is in one of its death spirals of vicious piety. So here is May, the toffs tossed away, to talk of meritocracy and ordinariness. She embodies the notion that, what you don\u2019t have in charisma, you can make up for in long hours. But as she draws people into her big tent, we can already see that it is more of a gazebo and it\u2019s invite only.

But this comes at a cost and that cost is social: the dismantling of a liberal consensus. This means hatred of difference, spreading fear, inflexible uniformity, the assertion of one kind of citizenship over another, a puritanical stifling of joy.</p> <p>May\u2019s vision rewrites the relationship between the state and business, and also insists on the social over the individual. But in this radical garb, she and her ministers found the enemy within. Those who voted remain have overcompensated by offering up suspicion and exclusion of all \u201cforeigners\u201d. Those who take our jobs \u2013 even the ones who save our lives \u2013 must be listed, and instructed where to be. This is appalling. British workers do have British jobs and won\u2019t work in the fields for \u00a33.50 an hour. Meritocracy is a local policy, it turns out. It is for white English people, though it calls Englishness British, as always. Add to the enemy list of foreigners, human rights lawyers and the liberal elite. We wait in vain for health and safety gone mad. The Tories take on the culture war as the economy shrinks. This xenophobia may result in actual bloodshed.</p> <p>It is as if the message of Brexit was not mixed, as if it was simply a referendum on immigration. It was more than that. May dismays by playing only one chord. So we now have members of the elite \u2013 being PM is fairly elite \u2013 and leaders of parties such as Ukip (Farage was leader when I started writing this sentence, but may not be when I have finished) saying they don\u2019t mind being poorer if there are fewer immigrants, but they are never going to be poor, of course.</p> <p>Yet the walling-in of economies to protect us from globalisation (government is in partnership with the state, the talk of responsible capitalism) is, as the IMF says, not simply a British reaction. May\u2019s version is a closing down and a direct challenge not just to economic neoliberalism, but to liberalism as the dominant discourse. She pitches the chattering classes, the liberal elite, against ordinary people. The liberal elite sneer at patriotism, at ordinary people\u2019s views on immigration and crime. There is some truth in this, although ordinary people are not a monolith.</p> <p>I now live in a liberal elite bubble made easier for me by social media, which allows me to chat with people who mostly think more or less like me. But because identity is hybrid, a base part of me remains horrified by how narrow-minded this elite is. Those who would lead the masses disdain them. The liberal elite will lead its sheeple out of its Jeremy Kyle-induced pit of despair and into the uplands of good wine, laughing at comedians on Radio 4 and voting the correct way. May is right to say these people do not have the monopoly on compassion. Many are hypocrites. Just after the Brexit vote and the election, there was a total empathy vacuum. The liberal elite boasted it didn\u2019t know anyone who voted Tory or Brexit because these people were thick, immoral. What a lovely socialist and internationalist reaction.</p> <p>So May will strike home with this. But for all her lefty drag, where she and her ministers have been so divisive is on immigration and race. While the Scottish Tory leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ruth-davidson\">Ruth Davidson</a>, has welcomed immigrants, May cannot even countenance Scottish independence \u2013 what she calls divisive nationalism.</p> <p>This move to the centre works only if the centre is white and Scotland keeps quiet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has provided the best opposition to this nasty fear and loathing. For May is sowing all kinds of division. The centre can\u2019t hold when it cannot keep the union together.</p> <p>The dots are not joined here at all. The language of belonging matters.

  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s government is facing a growing backlash over a proposal to force companies to disclose how many foreign workers they employ, with business leaders describing it as divisive and damaging.</p> <p>The proposal was revealed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\">Amber Rudd</a>, the home secretary, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative party conference</a> on Tuesday as a key plank of a government drive to reduce net migration and encourage businesses to hire British staff.</p> <p>However, senior figures in the business world warned the plan would be a \u201ccomplete anathema\u201d to responsible employers and would damage the UK economy because foreign workers were hired to fill gaps in skills that British staff could not provide. One chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, whose workforce includes thousands of EU citizens, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d.</p> <p>The proposals, which are subject to consultation, have also been questioned from within the Conservative party. Lord Finkelstein, the Tory peer, told the BBC it was a \u201cmisstep\u201d, while Tory MP Neil Carmichael, chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, said the policy was \u201cunsettling\u201d and would \u201cdrive people, business and compassion out of British society and should not be pursued any further\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said: \u201cConservative party leaders have sunk to a new low this week as they fan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities and try to blame foreigners for their own failures.</p> <p>\u201cDrawing up lists of foreign workers won\u2019t stop unscrupulous employers undercutting wages in Britain. Shutting the door to international students won\u2019t pay young people\u2019s tuition fee debts, and ditching doctors from abroad won\u2019t cut NHS waiting lists.\u201d </p> <p>Rudd was forced to defend the proposals on Wednesday, insisting they were not xenophobic and that she had been careful about the language used. The home secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that some companies were \u201cgetting away\u201d with not training British workers and \u201cwe should be able to have a conversation about what skills we want to have in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Rudd said that forcing companies to reveal their foreign workforce was \u201cnot something we are definitely going to do\u201d and was part of a wider review of immigration and employment practices. But a Home Office source said Rudd was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">not backing away from the proposal</a> and it would be put out for consultation despite the backlash from businesses.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that having a global workforce should not be seen as a \u201cbadge of shame\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMost companies do their utmost to train their workers, engage with local schools and colleges, and look for local hires before going to the overseas market \u2013 which is often an expensive and bureaucratic step.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses shouldn\u2019t be penalised or questioned for recruiting from overseas when they have specific skills needs. Many would be very concerned if their specific circumstances were boiled down to percentages, or used to suggest that they\u2019re somehow not doing their bit here at home.\u201d<br></p> <p>Manufacturers warned that foreign workers should not be regarded as a \u201csimple statistic\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Thomas, the director of employment and skills policy at the EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe concept of businesses reporting the number of workers who are not UK nationals will be a complete anathema to all responsible employers. Ironically, at a time when the government says it wants to extend opportunity to all and promote inclusion, this proposal will be divisive and damaging to the UK\u2019s diverse and multicultural workforces.</p> <p>\u201cThe object, it seems, is to shame those employers with a proportion of non-UK workers above some hypothetic and arbitrary level. Workers, whether UK, EU or global contribute greatly to UK industry and should be welcomed and not regarded as a simple statistic.\u201d</p> <p>Small businesses could be turned into \u201cimmigration officers\u201d by the proposals, the Federation of Small Businesses said.</p> <p>Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB, said: \u201cFundamentally, the UK has been a global magnet for talent and this must be considered by ministers. The ability to hire the right people for the right job is paramount, and we will be championing this in the upcoming consultation. </p> <p>\u201cWe also do not want to see small business owners turned into immigration officers nor encumbered by new bureaucracy.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said businesses focused on the skills of workers rather than their nationality. Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the IoD, said: \u201cThis is a concerning proposal from the government. The notion that employers prefer foreign workers to UK-born is wrong. Employers don\u2019t discriminate by nationality \u2013 all that matters is the talent available.</p> <p>\u201cImmigrants are not like-for-like substitutes. They fill skills gap that cannot be filled domestically. Therefore it is hard to understand what government expects this \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 policy will achieve.\u201d</p> <p>Bosses in the technology industry warned that the plans could jeopardise the fledgling sector in Britain.</p> <p>Russ Shaw, founder of Tech London Advocates, said: \u201cThis reactionary call to restrict access to global talent goes against everything we are doing to build a global tech hub that rivals Silicon Valley. One out of every three UK tech employees was born overseas, and their hard work and commitment has played an essential role in making London the capital of European tech.\u201d</p> <p>Trade union leaders also criticised the government\u2019s \u201canti-immigrant sentiment\u201d at the party conference in Birmingham.</p> <p>Kamaljeet Jandu, GMB national equalities officer, said: \u201cThe UK government must not get swept away on a raft of anti-immigrant sentiment while looking for new scapegoats for their economic mistakes. Instead, it must focus on actually improving the lives of working people in this country after Brexit.\u201d</p>",

Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u20ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u20ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u2019s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u20ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u20ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u20ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u201cCitizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u2019s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u201d </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u2013 with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u2013 is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Now, we have Wall Street advancing, and European markets paring losses, while the FTSE 100 languishes towards the bottom end of the day\u2019s range.

US markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&amp;P 500, putting the index in a good position to challenge the all-time highs once again.

Against that backdrop, the fall in the exchange rate will help to support activity, cushioning the impact of greater uncertainty. While that was expected, the effect could be coming through faster than we\u2019d anticipated.</p> </blockquote> <p>The speech also takes a good look at the impact, and causes, of record low bond yields (a massive headache for pension funds), and the wider issue of economic uncertainty. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf\">It\u2019s online here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really good speech by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a> Ben Broadbent <a href=\"https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl\">https://t.co/5Tibyb4COl</a></p>&mdash; Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/783598802099986432\">October 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c444e4b005191a20ee93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:25:50.137Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This isn\u2019t how Theresa May would like her first conference as Tory leader to be remembered.</strong></p> <p>But it appears that the slump in the pound vs the euro this week means Britain has fallen to sixth place in the list of the world\u2019s biggest economies, behind our old friends France.</p> <p>The FT\u2019s Chris Giles has crunched the numbers, and explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>International Monetary Fund <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/10/03/AM2016-NA100416-WEO\">estimates of the size of economies in 2016</a> puts the UK at \u00a31,932bn with France weighing in at \u20ac2,228bn, putting the UK ahead so long as a pound buys more than \u20ac1.153.</p> <p>At the start of the week, the prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary all boasted that Britain would get a good deal in EU talks because Britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world.

  "<p><br>Angela Merkel has significantly stiffened her rhetoric on Brexit, telling an audience of German business leaders that any exception to the EU\u2019s single market rules would represent \u201ca systemic challenge for the entire European Union\u201d.</p> <p>The German chancellor\u2019s remarks reflect an apparent toughening of positions in European capitals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">Theresa May announced on Sunday</a> that the UK would begin formal divorce talks by the end of March and indicated it was heading for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Merkel appealed to German firms to show a united front with EU governments in negotiations over Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, urging them to support the principle of \u201cfull access to the single market only in exchange for signing up to the four freedoms\u201d. </p> <p>If any one country was allowed an exception, she said, \u201cyou can imagine how all countries will put put conditions on free movement with other countries. And that would create an extremely difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>The applause for Merkel\u2019s comments put a further question mark over the argument of British pro-Brexit politicians that German businesses will inevitably pressure their government to preserve their trade links with the UK and resist tariffs.</p> <p>Markus Kerber, the leader of Germany\u2019s largest industry group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/german-business-leader-warning-brexit-trade-uk\">said last week</a> that trade, investments and single market solidarity with the rest of the EU were more important than the volume of business German companies do with Britain.</p> <p>Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta, which will hold the EU\u2019s rotating presidency when Britain triggers article 50 of the Lisbon treaty to launch the two-year exit process, told the Guardian that May had made it plain \u201ccontrolling immigration will be her number one priority\u201d. </p> <p>That made her <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/theresa-may-moves-to-allay-hard-brexit-fears-after-pound-slump-10605390\">subsequent statement</a> that she also wanted British business to have the maximum opportunity to operate within the single market \u201cproblematic, to say the least,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The four freedoms \u2013 free movement of goods, capital, services, and people \u2013 could not be decoupled, Muscat said. \u201cThat cannot be negotiated \u2026 These principles are the basis for everything the EU does.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit was \u201cnot just an accounting exercise\u201d for the EU 27, he said, adding that Britain\u2019s deal had to be be \u201cfair, but it has to be inferior. The idea that Britain can come back with a superior deal, or even the same deal, is not acceptable. </p> <p>\u201cOf course, if your priority is controlling immigration, it may not be a worse deal. But it must be inferior in terms of the whole package. There can be no membership with caveats.\u201d</p> <p>He said his impression from contact with UK officials was that Britain aimed to negotiate \u201cby chapters \u2013 sovereignty, the single market, freedom of movement\u201d. There was resistance to that, he said. \u201cThe other members want to see these addressed together.\u201d</p> <p>The tone of Merkel\u2019s remarks in particular stands in sharp contrast to the conciliatory language coming out of Berlin in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, when leading politicians pleaded for London to be given more time to think through the consequences of the vote.</p> <p>Jens Spahn, a senior member of her Christian Democrat Union party, confirmed the tough line, including no pre-negotiations before article 50 is triggered. </p> <p>\u201cWe cannot grant any special treatment even before negotiations. Then we would have 27 special agreements tomorrow. Then there won\u2019t be a European Union any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to negotiate really hard, we have to remain tough.\u201d</p> <p>The EU 27 would take four or five weeks to confirm a common position on Brexit once Britain had triggered article 50, Muscat said, after which day-to-day talks would be handled by the European commission\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his German deputy, Sabine Weyand.</p>",
  "<p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister, will be the next UN secretary general, after the security council agreed he should replace Ban Ki-moon at the beginning of next year.<br></p> <p>In a rare show of unity, all 15 ambassadors from the security council emerged from the sixth in a series of straw polls to announce that they had agreed on Guterres, who was UN high commissioner for refugees for a decade, and that they would confirm the choice in a formal vote on Thursday. </p> <p>\u201cToday after our sixth straw poll we have a clear favourite and his name is Ant\u00f3nio Guterres,\u201d the Russian UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters with his 14 council colleagues standing behind him. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe have decided to go to a formal vote tomorrow morning at 10 o\u2019clock, and we hope it can be done by acclamation.\u201d </p> <p>The abrupt end to the UN leadership race came as a surprise. Many observers had expected the selection process to go on late into October as the major powers struggled to promote their favourite candidates. And some thought that Russia, currently holding the presidency of the security council, would block Guterres, as Moscow had said it wanted an eastern European in the top UN job. </p> <p>\u201cI think in the end, the Russians wanted the decision to come during their presidency and to have all the security council come out and stand together at a time of so much deep division on other issues,\u201d said a security council diplomat.</p> <p>Guterres\u2019s margin of victory was decisive. He won 13 votes in his support and two abstentions, with no one voting against him. The second-place candidate, the Slovak Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, had seven votes in support and six against him \u2013 two of them vetoes from permanent council members.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a straw poll where, for the first time, the permanent members were filling in ballots of different colour. The permanent members had red ballots and the non-permanent members had white ballots,\u201d said the UK ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft. </p> <p>\u201cWe filled them all in, as we normally do, just once. They all went into a box, they were then counted. We all filled in our tally sheets, and the crucial moment for me was when the fifth permanent member result for Guterres was announced which led to it being very clear that there was no discourages, either from a permanent member or a non-permanent member for Guterres.\u201d</p> <p>The security council on Thursday will decide whether to have a formal vote or, if the two abstentions change their mind, to simply pass a resolution nominating Guterres by acclamation. That nomination would go to the UN general assembly which would either vote or, more likely, confirm the candidacy by acclamation.</p> <p>As the UN\u2019s refugee chief, Guterres persistently appealed to the conscience of the international community over the worst refugee crisis since the second world war, and he vowed to carry on being a spokesman for the downtrodden if he became UN secretary general.</p> <p>\u201cI am totally committed because of what I felt as head of UNHCR for 10 years,\u201d he said during a debate between candidates chaired by the Guardian this summer. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what it is to see levels of suffering that are unimaginable.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that he was promising to be an activist on humanitarian causes also makes Guterres victory surprising, as both Russia and China in particular have been resistant to outspoken activists in top UN posts. Also there was widespread sentiment this year that it was time for a woman to run the organisation for the first time in its 71-year history and there were several strong female candidates in the contest.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an excellent choice,\u201d said Michael Doyle, a former UN assistant secretary general and now a Columbia University professor. \u201cWe have someone who has great political capability, having been prime minister of his country, he is a strong multilateralist, having a run the UNCHR at a time of tremendous challenges, and he has ways of communicating with an audience that are inspiring.\u201d </p> <p>Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the European Council on Foreign Relations said: \u201cThe big question is whether Guterres has had to offer Russia and China big concessions to let him win, such as senior political or peacekeeping posts at UN headquarters. That may not become clear for some weeks or months.\u201d<br></p> <p>In the final ballot, the highest-placed woman candidate, the head of Unesco, Irina Bokova, finished fourth. Another female candidate for the job, Costa Rican diplomat Christiana Figueres described the result as \u201cbittersweet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBitter: not a woman. Sweet: by far the best man in the race. Congrats Antonio Guterres! We are all with you,\u201d Figueres <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/783701363951804417\">tweeted</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CFigueres/status/783701363951804417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bittersweet results <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NextSG?src=hash\">#NextSG</a>.

Her candidacy only lasted a few days and eight council members voted against her, including two permanent member vetoes.</p> <p>The contest to replace Ban as secretary general began in April with public hearings in the UN general assembly, the first time candidates for the job had had to make their pitch in public. The new transparency was a result of a groundswell of pressure from civil society activists, in the <a href=\"http://www.1for7billion.org/\">1 For 7 Billion</a> movement. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a testament to the new open process,\u201d said Natalie Samarasinghe, executive director of the United Nations Association \u2013 UK and one of the founders of the 1 For 7 Billion movement. \u201cWhen we looked at the candidates likely to prevail at the start of the race, he wasn\u2019t a strong contender.

Here\u2019s the most obvious winners and losers.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>British workers</strong></p> <p>May promised her government would be on the side of British workers, ruling out a bonfire of employment rights post-Brexit, reiterating her leadership race commitment to putting employees on company boards and attacking company bosses who \u201cearn a fortune but don\u2019t look after your staff.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Rural Britain </strong></p> <p>Broadband is a priority which May mentioned in her speech, and one her spokeswoman said had been discussed in cabinet meetings and committees. It\u2019s in rural, and traditionally Tort, areas where connectivity is poorest and expect to see some concrete new policy on this in coming weeks and months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a013ebd79c4e53dcee595bdb4f18a664763dd6b/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BT Openreach engineers working on a broadband internet fibre cabinet in the street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Savers</strong></p> <p>May said it was clear current low interest rates were not working for everyone, and there were gentle hints that the government may be preparing to rethink quantitive easing, a policy that would be attractive to savers. May said though QE had been good after the financial crash, the government would \u201cacknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201d Monetary policy like this however, is really the domain of the Bank of England.</p> <h2>Losers</h2> <p><strong>Foreign workers</strong></p> <p>May has made it clear she wants to prioritise voter concerns about immigration in her Brexit negotiations. Her speech will have unnerved many overseas workers, including doctors, whom the Prime Minister suggested may only be allowed to stay in the UK for a limited period. Firms have already started a huge backlash against a proposal floated by Amber Rudd to make companies list the number of foreign workers they employ. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51fc0ddbe8ca6d5fb1c9985b69905818b873e92/231_43_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Party banners during the Refugees Welcome march.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Baggott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Energy companies </strong><br>May strongly hinted she wanted to tackle high energy bills, without a firm proposal. But her words about energy companies have been seized on as potentially a move towards Ed Miliband-style energy price caps. Her official spokeswoman did not rule out even tougher action, but said firmer policy announcements would follow.</p> <p><strong>Human rights lawyers</strong><br>One of the biggest cheers in the hall came as May attacked \u201cactivist, left-wing human rights lawyers.\u201d The focus of her anger was abuse claims against British troops, which defence secretary Michael Fallon had announced earlier would be protected against claims arising from the ECHR for future conflicts.</p> <p><strong>Tax avoiders</strong></p> <p>Nothing concrete yet, but May has seized on another Labour soundbite, it\u2019s patriotic to pay your taxes. \u201cWhoever you are you \u2013 however rich or powerful \u2013 you have a duty to pay your tax.

This is from James Sproule, the IoD\u2019s director of policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Plans to \u2018name and shame\u2019 companies who employ foreign workers, aside from adding to bureaucracy, send precisely the wrong message. The prime minister should instead listen to her own advice and remember that, in Britain, it doesn\u2019t matter where you were born. Make no mistake, Britain is at its best when it is open and offering a home to the world\u2019s brightest and best who want to study and build a better life for themselves, while contributing to the British economy.</p> <p>As a longstanding trailblazer for good corporate governance, the IoD welcomes the prime minister\u2019s focus on how corporate leadership can aid economic and social success. Business leaders are not pantomime villains, evading taxes and employing cheap labour from abroad out of some destructive desire to do Britain down, and for every Mike Ashley or Philip Green there are hundreds of thousands of hard-working entrepreneurs who are more likely to remortgage their homes than own a super yacht.

But that was the Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, whose speech introducing Theresa May was one of the best of the whole conference season. As for Theresa May\u2019s, it was rather more questionable.</p> <p>What was certainly bold was May\u2019s decision to cast herself as the leader of a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live?page=with:block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297#block-57f4daf8e4b0e2a2a25af297\">11.51am</a>). Taking the EU referendum vote as her starting point, she said it was not just a vote to leave the EU but a protest against an economic and political system rigged in the interests of the elite to the detriment of ordinary people. She is not necessarily wrong, and this analysis is not unlike Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, but May then set out to use it to make the case for her own brand of pragmatic, populist, \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism. What she had to say about tax-dodgers (and, even more pointedly, tax-dodging accountants), corporate responsibility, market failure and industrial intervention was provocative in Tory terms, and yet another indication of how far the party has come from the days of Margaret Thatcher. Edward Heath coined the term \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, and May has placed herself firmly in the Heath/Major/Blair centrist tradition. It\u2019s Christian democracy \u2013 or perhaps Anglican democracy, given that May\u2019s father was a vicar.</p> <p>Yet there was nothing in the speech to show that May is willing to match her rhetorical courage with action. If she really thinks working people are losing out under the tax system, she could abandon George Osborne\u2019s inheritance tax cut. If she is serious about intergenerational fairness, she could shelve the \u201ctriple lock\u201d. And if she accepts that housing policy needs to change so that people can get on to the ladder, she could rip up planning laws and send the bulldozers on to the green belt. But of course that wouldn\u2019t go down well in Maidenhead (her constituency), or with the Daily Telegraph, or with the Conservative party at large.</p> <p>May said at one point that government was about \u201caction \u2026 about doing something\u201d. But caution seems to be more her watchword. We\u2019re still waiting for a decision about Heathrow. </p> <p>Ultimately this speech will be judged by whether May can deliver on the heady ambitions that she set herself. It is not inconceivable; in some respects her record as home secretary was radical. But she would have been much more convincing today if she had backed her rhetoric with at least one announcement to show that change is real.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T12:58:28.033Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4e71de4b08ebe3d557064\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T11:46:20.230Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is an agenda for a Conservatism rooted in the centre ground.</p> <p>That is what this government is about, she says.

Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1. Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit), she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiteers strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <p><strong>2. The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit, but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago, because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to a <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">ConservativeHome poll</a>, 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\"> </a>and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3. City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business, but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports</a>. A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied) and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">which prompted a strong business backlash</a>. In government Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post</a>, ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>4. May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician, although so far there is little policy evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her yesterday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover</a>. </p> <p><strong>5. The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour, but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects, competitive party politics is quite simple: all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda \u2013 a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. The Tory MP Robert Halfon <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">gave an interesting speech</a> saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters, but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6. Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street say he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7. The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of \u201cDave who?\u201d. In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major, from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">had to pay the extortionate business attendee rate</a> to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.<br></p> <p><strong>8. Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9. The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS</a>. The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. Rudd said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite), and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10. An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:40:05.813Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f4c868e4b0d9ed530ef255\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T09:35:17.565Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNP, Greens and Plaid Cyrmu issue joint statement condemning Tories's stance on immigration</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SNP leader and Scottish first minister <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the Green co-leaders <strong>Caroline Lucas</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Bartley</strong> and the Plaid Cymru leader <strong>Leanne Wood</strong> have released a joint statement this morning condemning the Tories for their stance on immigration. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The countries of the United Kingdom face a spiralling political and economic crisis. At the top of the Conservative party, the narrow vote in favour of leaving the EU has now been interpreted as the pretext for a drastic cutting of ties with Europe, which would have dire economic results - and as an excuse for the most toxic rhetoric on immigration we have seen from any government in living memory.</p> <p>This is a profoundly moral question which gets to the heart of what sort of country we think we live in. We will not tolerate the contribution of people from overseas to our NHS being called into question, or a new version of the divisive rhetoric of \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019. Neither will we allow the people of these islands, no matter how they voted <a>on June 23rd</a>, to be presented as a reactionary, xenophobic mass whose only concern is somehow taking the UK back to a lost imperial age. At a time of increasing violence and tension, we will call out the actions of politicians who threaten to enflame those same things.</p> <p>This is not a time for parties to play games, or meekly respect the tired convention whereby they do not break cover during each other\u2019s conferences. It is an occasion for us to restate the importance of working together to resist the Tories\u2019 toxic politics, and make the case for a better future for our people and communities. We will do this by continuing to work and campaign with the fierce sense of urgency this political moment demands. </p> </blockquote> <p>The statement has also been signed by Steven Agnew, leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland, Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, and Alice Hooker-Stroud, leader of the Welsh Greens.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f4bf25e4b0afec6ad16f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-elgot\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:52:21.671Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Greg Clark</strong> joked last night to a meeting of liberal Tories that Theresa May had been great for progressives because Boris Johnson \u201cspends most of his time out of the country\u201d.</p> <p>At a midnight reception for the Tory Reform Group, members of the group cheered as Clark, who was a remain campaigner teased his cabinet colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the TRG and particularly a great summer as there are more TRG MPs than there are Liberal Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cDamian Green in the cabinet!

Rudd,</strong> the home secretary, was on the Today programme this morning defending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">the plans she announced yesterday to restrict the number of foreign workers coming to the UK. </a>She said some firms were not doing enough to employ local people.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The purpose of this review is to look at whether they are doing enough to train people locally when they could be able to do that. There are record levels of employment, which is great, but there are still one in 10 18- to 24-year-olds unemployed and I want businesses to think first about locally training people where possible. For instance, I went and visited a factory quite recently where they recruit almost exclusively from Romania and Poland, where they have people who have experience in factories building these sofas that they have. They didn\u2019t even consider training locally \u2013 there was a local college they could have worked with, but they choose to recruit outside the UK. We set policies to encourage businesses to make a profit and be successful, but also to have a responsibility to local employment and we\u2019re asking them to join us on this journey so they don\u2019t automatically go abroad where it\u2019s cheaper perhaps and sometimes they feel more efficient.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the Times, one of Rudd\u2019s proposals is for firms to have to publish figures showing what proportion of their workforce is foreign. Rudd told Today that this was just a proposal and that it would not definitely be implemented.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The business I mentioned to you would have shown it had 80-90% non-UK citizens working there. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re definitely going to do, it\u2019s one of the tools we\u2019re going to use as a review to see if we can use it as a way of nudging people to do better behaviour.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f160837fa9421047a8323f41dcc1efc178aeea/0_225_3216_1927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DAVID HARTLEY/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T10:30:52.817Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ead3e4b0afec6ad16cae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-05T08:16:32.588Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This morning we learn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/nigel-farage-says-he-may-technically-still-be-ukip-leader\">Nigel Farage may still be technically leader of Ukip</a>, even though the party announced a new leader last month.

I can report that there is very little \u201cdependency\u201d involved in being the partner of an international student in this country.</p> <p>Despite the fact that international students are worth an estimated \u00a38bn a year to the economy, often pay tuition fees that are triple those paid by local students and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-foreign-students-dodgy-evidence-duff-policy\">supply roughly 30% of revenue for British universities</a>, it is very difficult to get a visa to study here as an international student from outside the European Economic Area.</p> <p>To qualify for a visa you first need to prove that you\u2019ll cost the British government absolutely nothing. Applicants need to have a certain amount of money in their bank account to prove they can get by in case of an emergency without resorting to government help. The NHS isn\u2019t free for them either; non-EEA migrants now also have to pay an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/08/john-key-health-charge-for-new-zealanders-and-australians-is-uk-being-pretty-cheap\">\u201cimmigration health surcharge\u201d</a>, at the time of their visa application. This costs between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200 per year (though this was introduced after I arrived in the country, so it doesn\u2019t apply to me).</p> <p>It is also made clear to you before you apply to live in the UK that if you do, you will have no access to state assistance \u2013 no benefits at all. Indeed, this message is literally stamped onto my visa, right across the centre: \u201cNo recourse to public funds.\u201d Why on my visa, which is stuck inside my passport and which I only see while waiting in queues at airports? I don\u2019t know. In case I\u2019m tempted to ask a border official for a financial handout as I head through customs, perhaps. The rules are that I may live here and work, but can expect no government help.</p> <p>Which is fine by me. I like working. I am healthy and able and have been lucky enough to get a job I love. I pay taxes, I contribute to the economy; in short, I\u2019m abiding by the rules laid out by the Home Office. Except it seems that those rules, or at least the goalposts, have shifted.</p> <p>While announcing her proposed changes to immigration laws, Rudd observed with incredulity that \u201cwhile an international student is studying here, their family members can do any form of work\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-foreign-students-dodgy-evidence-duff-policy\">The Guardian view on foreign students: dodgy evidence, duff policy | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Putting aside her disingenuous talk of \u201cfamily members\u201d, as if international students are bringing with them three generations of relatives, rather than the family members who are actually allowed to accompany them \u2013 a partner and dependent children \u2013 when did it become an outrageous thing for people coming to a country to get jobs, earn money and support themselves \u2013 and pay taxes?</p> <p>Rudd is creating an impossible situation for migrants. Those who receive benefits are demonised, those who cannot receive benefits will now be demonised for working. What is she proposing? That only those who have enough savings to support themselves for five years can move here? That international students and their families must live in a penniless unemployed limbo, filling their bellies with sheer gratitude at being allowed into Britain? That they can work, but only in a crummy job that pays minimum wage, assigned to them as they arrive at Heathrow? It\u2019s hard to see what she is suggesting a \u201cgood migrant\u201d might look like and indeed, whether she believes they actually exist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">Amber Rudd announces crackdown on overseas students and work visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the scale of migrant privilege I\u2019m right up at the advantaged end.

She asserted that these immigration policies were not about \u201cpulling up the drawbridge\u201d, but I see no other way to interpret them.</p> <p>The message from the Conservative party is that no matter how brilliant the research of international students, how much that work advances the reputation of British universities, how high the tuition fees they pay, how hard their partners work or how much we contribute in taxes, because we are not British, this country simply doesn\u2019t want us.</p>",

  "<p>I met Aleksandra a couple of weeks ago. A few days before, her friend had been beaten up in front of her home in what police are investigating as a suspected hate crime. As we were interviewing her about what had happened, a car pulled up and a group of youngsters shouted at her: \u201cFucking Polish grass.\u201d Her reaction, one of shock and disbelief, was moving, and very personal \u2013 something that often gets lost in police and media reports of such events.</p> <p>Aleksandra spoke heartbreakingly about this new feeling of being unwelcome in Britain and about how important it had always been for her to belong to a group of people similar to her, to her community, to the country she had made her home.</p> <p>During her eight years in the UK, she has completed her education, picked up a West Yorkshire accent and joined the NHS to work in mental health care, becoming as close to a poster girl for successful integration as you can get. The sense of being rejected despite all these efforts was almost physically painful for her.</p> <p>Aleksandra\u2019s story bears stark similarities to those of others I have spoken to around the UK affected by the rise in hate crime since the EU referendum vote. Europeans of different backgrounds have been telling me about the bubble of Britain\u2019s tolerance bursting, with people turning their back on them.</p> <p>This was only too apparent at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative party conference</a> this week. On Tuesday the prime minister Theresa May said on BBC Breakfast  that NHS employees, such as Aleksandra, would be allowed to stay \u201cuntil the further number [of home-grown British doctors] are able to be trained\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, speaking at a fringe meeting, the secretary of state for trade, Liam Fox, described EU migrants in the UK as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/liam-fox-refuses-to-guarantee-right-of-eu-citizens-to-remain-in-uk\">one of the main cards</a>\u201d in Brexit negotiations.

Rather they should be thanked for choosing to place their talents, skills and experience in the UK, contributing to the country\u2019s success. Otherwise, this language of public debate only reinforces negative sentiments about migrants, artificially pitting \u201cthem\u201d, foreigners, against the British public.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">Amber Rudd announces crackdown on overseas students and work visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Britain is to make a success of Brexit, as the government promises, it genuinely needs to be a country that works for everyone.

Maybe I am naive, but I still firmly believe that Britain is better than this.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

It was a fusion of two usually opposed political outlooks into a single message \u2013 one that aimed to command, and hold, the centre ground for the Conservative party. To that end, it brazenly sought to colonise territory that used to belong to Labour - thereby shoving that party to the very margins.</p> <p>Start with the more obvious treats served up for the Mail. None was bigger, of course, than the promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">exit the European Union</a>, with no ifs or buts on ending both free movement and jurisdiction by the European court of justice. But May also deferred to several cultural touchstones cherished by the Mail: the promise to open the first new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/13/grammar-schools-gamble-young-peoples-futures-social-mobility-london\">grammar schools</a> for 50 years; an attack on \u201cleftwing human rights lawyers\u201d, castigated for harassing British soldiers; condemnation of those metropolitan types who feel more affinity for \u201cthe international elite\u201d than for the people who live down their street.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much more interesting, though, were the long passages that could have come out of the mouth of the last Labour leader. May offered a vision that was a radical break from Thatcherism. She said: \u201cThere is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d as if rebuking the notorious claim that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-quotes\">\u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d</a>. While Thatcher\u2019s ally Ronald Reagan always insisted that government was the problem, May said it could be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d.</p> <p>She made the case for an active state, intervening where the market had failed. She praised Clement Attlee, the NHS and the BBC. She made a moral argument for rich people to pay their taxes. She called the housing market \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, and promised that the government would start building houses. While she was at it, she denounced modern slavery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/uk-police-forces-still-abusing-stop-and-search-powers\">stop-and-search</a> and institutional racism.</p> <p>The political pitch was clear: to promise onetime Labour voters that they could have everything they used to value in Labour, without backing what had become \u2013 in a neat reverse of her past verdict on her own political tribe - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002\">\u201cthe nasty party\u201d</a>. For it was, she said, the Tories who were now the party of the workers, the NHS and of public servants.</p> <p>It was bold, even shameless. Thanks to Brexit, it may also prove hollow \u2013 since exiting the EU will threaten many of the things about Britain she boasted of. (How long will Britain boast three of the world\u2019s 10 best universities when foreign students are discouraged from coming here?) But it was an effective speech designed to command the territory that matters most - and where power resides.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\">Polly Toynbee</a>: The Tories are brilliant at cognitive dissonance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4c662df3828f45719bf54406f2e9268a5b63c782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c662df3828f45719bf54406f2e9268a5b63c782/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Polly Toynbee\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While Theresa May commands the political universe, the new centre ground is wherever she says it is.

Ignoring the current crisis, let\u2019s hope she knows that her boast on generous NHS funding was near as dammit a lie. Public servants? A million have been sacked, and the rest suffer the harshest pay downgrade ever.</p> <p>Yes, this powerful speech will be remembered and May will be reminded of these words every step of the way. Will she halt the disastrous \u00a313bn benefit cuts still to come, especially to tax credits of her \u201cjust-about-managing\u201d families, whose incomes will fall sharply? Will she stop the great giveaways to the \u201cprivileged few\u2019, in inheritance tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax bonanzas?

How often their faithful listen to pulpit proclamations \u2013 \u201cblessed are the poor for they shall inherit the earth\u201d \u2013 without for a moment considering what that requires of them.

Meanwhile her party faithful are revelling in the afterglow of Brexit and the thought of \u201ctaking back control\u201d. And the official opposition is reeling after a ferocious and divisive summer-long leadership challenge. So, right now, May can say what she likes and people will lap it all up \u2013 including many traditional Labour lines.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the prime minister can say she believes 100% in the free market, yet that the Conservatives are \u201cthe party of the workers, the party of public servants, the party of the NHS\u201d. She can run through a list of racial injustices and say, \u201cI want this Conservative government to fight every single one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Why May can rebrand herself as passionately pro-Brexit \u2013 \u201cour laws will be made not in Brussels but Westminster\u201d \u2013 even though she was notionally on the remain side. Why she can attack the \u201cprivileged few\u201d, and promise the tax dodgers and those who help them, \u201cWe\u2019re coming after you\u201d. Because, right now, people will give her the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>But if May really believed this, why is she in the Tory party?

The speech has shown she is ideologically difficult to place, with rightwing policies on immigration and education, a left-leaning attack on the excesses of corporatism and a populist attack on elites who do not listen to ordinary voters. However, there was very little concrete new policy to back any of this up.</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>When it comes to British living space, how small is too small? How cramped is too cramped? How poky, is, ultimately, far too poky for comfortable human habitation?</p> <p>The way things are going, we could soon see. Tory housing minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/19/a-quick-guide-to-new-housing-and-planning-minister-gavin-barwell\" title=\"\">Gavin Barwell</a> has a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/housing-crisis-gavin-barwell-flats-smaller-pocket-a7344061.html\" title=\"\">possible answer to our housing crisis</a>, and it involves relaxing the regulations on how cramped a flat or house can be, so that young people can afford to get on the property ladder. In the absence of any solid ideas as to what the government might do to solve our ticking time bomb of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/aug/05/those-who-deny-the-housing-crisis-can-no-longer-conceal-their-idiocy-resolution-foundation\" title=\"\">housing situation</a>, Barwell wants the private sector to \u201cinnovate\u201d solutions to the crisis. Such is our obsession with owning property in this country, of course, that assisting first-time buyers in scraping together enough capital to invest in a coffin-sized \u201cexistence pod\u201d of their own is far more of a priority than, say, instigating rent control, reining in buy-to-let baby boomers, penalising foreign investors and second-home owners who leave their properties empty, legalising squatting, building more houses (especially on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/dec/08/building-on-green-belt-relax-laws-starter-homes\" title=\"\">green belt</a> golf courses), and introducing legislation that makes renting out slum-like properties to poor people for extortionate rates a criminal offence.</p> <p>Of course, a governing party that is itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/14/mp-landlords-number-risen-quarter-last-parliament-housing-bill\" title=\"\">crammed full of buy-to-let landlords</a> that last year opted out of legislation stipulating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/tories-reject-move-to-ensure-rented-homes-fit-for-human-habitation\" title=\"\">rental properties should be fit for human habitation</a> is somewhat unlikely to introduce such measures.</p> <p>We have a saying, us youngish people, and it\u2019s not one especially suitable for a family newspaper. It is a metaphor pertaining to the wisdom of not defecating in close proximity to the locale in which one might also consume food. But if the Tories have their way and building regulations can be circumvented so that tiny flats can be constructed, many more of us may indeed end up in that very situation.</p> <p>Even more insulting is the insinuation from Barwell that many potential first-time buyers are not acutely aware that what we can afford is technically known by estate agents as \u201csweet sod all\u201d. Does he assume that we spend our time looking at lavish palaces on Zoopla and that all that is required of our generation is that we simply lower our unrealistic expectations?</p> <p>Perhaps he is unaware that our expectations are already so low that taking a tour of them would give a figure in a Hieronymus Bosch painting decompression sickness. If Barwell had wanted to know just how small is too small, he could have asked my friend and colleague who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/11/living-airing-cupboard-housing-crisis-rent\" title=\"\">lived in my airing cupboard</a> for several months. Or the person who ended up inhabiting the attic I viewed in north London that you couldn\u2019t stand up straight in but which, I was assured, was very warm because it was next to the boiler. He could have asked the guy I know who shares a double bed with his (straight, male) friend, or the other guy I know who, as a property guardian, is paying \u00a3500 a month to share a bath with 35 other people. I\u2019m sure whoever ended up renting that much-shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/03/shoebox-studio-flat-london-renters-hours\" title=\"\">studio flat for \u00a3737 a month</a> could tell him how small is too small, or indeed one of the many dodgy landlords renting out overcrowded houses in risible conditions to migrant workers across the country.</p> <p>In order to really get his point across, Barwell\u2019s speech waxing lyrical about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/dec/19/pocket-size-flats-young-first-time-buyer\" title=\"\">\u201cpocket housing\u201d</a> should have, to my mind, been accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation consisting of the childhood homes and property holdings of the entire Tory government, while the saccharine tones of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_2lGkEU4Xs\" title=\"\">Malvina Reynolds\u2019s 1962 classic Little Boxes</a> jingled in the background.Or, perhaps, as a chorus line of renters such as myself tap-danced across the conference stage singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q671QIDeH-U\" title=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it Be Loverly</a> in mockney accents, complete with jazz hands.</p> <p>Britain already builds the smallest homes in Europe. A one-bedroom flat averages at 500sq ft \u2013 about the size of a tube carriage \u2013 while Barwell\u2019s favoured developer, <a href=\"https://www.pocketliving.com/\" title=\"\">Pocket Living,</a> sells 400sq ft flats for a quarter of a million pounds apiece. The Royal Institute of British Architects says that more than half of new houses built are too small for families to live in (it\u2019s a bit of a mystery where all these \u201chome-grown\u201d workers our Brexit-mad government keeps going on about are actually going to, well, grow up). The average home in Denmark is twice as big as one of ours already. It\u2019s a shameful state of affairs unlikely to be remedied by one of the stupidest policy suggestions to come out of the housing crisis thus far.</p>",

We\u2019re looking at it. As an organisation you always have to look to change. Your brand or your name should not be exclusive of that. Part of it is the history, but part of it is also can we maximise in terms of leveraging a new brand and a new name.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Amsterdam, the Netherlands: \u2018When scarcity is applauded, that\u2019s very wrong\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cHere gentrification happens very quickly. Every month some \u2018nice\u2019 restaurant or shop opens. The old name of my neighbourhood (Kinkerbuurt) was changed and rebranded to \u2018Hallenkwartier\u2019. I would enjoy many of the changes if I knew others could enjoy it as well. But poor people have to leave, social housing is sold off, and rich people and tourists move in.</p> <p>There was a squatting action, a demonstration and protests against the rebranding of the neighbourhood. I have seen posters and banners on houses. But the city council is just selling off social housing. Waiting time for a house in this neighbourhood used to be eight years, now it is 18 years. The biggest ruling party has even worse plans; they want to give the social houses only to working people, saying jobless people should leave the city.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe what Amsterdam has become, it was very different 10 years ago (I\u2019ve lived here for 22 years). Generally rent is easier to control with rent caps than housing prices, so this ideal of having property should be discouraged. We have a great tradition of social housing corporations in the Netherlands \u2013 some cities had 50% social housing. Now the whole way of thinking is about extracting money, not creating communities. When prices go up, they say \u2018the market is doing well\u2019.

We should also have rent controlled apartments and a centralised office, like in Paris, that decides a price ceiling for every rental apartment in the city.</p> <p>This is a turning point. The city is becoming an entirely segregated, exclusive place. Local and national governments are doing nothing to stop this happen. The issue of gentrification has been dismissed or called collateral damage. Some activist groups have been stirring the waters, but it is very difficult to fight the power of money especially when it\u2019s supported by government.\u201d <em tabindex=\"-1\">(Catarina)</em></p> <h2>Newcastle, UK: \u2018I want to believe that cities can be both regenerated and inclusive\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cTwenty-five years ago there were riots near where I live, in the west end of Newcastle. Fifteen years ago there was talk of demolition. Now, after regeneration efforts, we\u2019ve got cleaner streets, reduced crime, and a revived local economy - due in no small part to immigration, by the way. The housing crisis is a scandal. But conflating it with regeneration, and damning cafes, cycle lanes, enterprise and opportunity as \u2018gentrification\u2019 runs the risk of undermining efforts to make places better. It also lets our policy makers, whose actions are making matters worse, off the hook.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has a slogan called \u2018Building a new Chicago\u2019; what does that mean? There is already a Chicago here. There is obviously an agenda to gentrify and attract tourists to make Chicago a \u2018global city\u2019. We should be subsidising affordable housing, instead of downtown hotels. We need rent control and eviction laws. As a lifelong resident of the north-west side of Chicago, I\u2019m afraid of there coming a day when I don\u2019t recognise my neighbourhood, when the stores, the people, the library are all gone.

The city has taken some steps to keep prices down (for instance by capping rent increases) but this has also ignited the popularity of Airbnb and similar sites, where renters can take advantage of these laws by paying low rents themselves, but making huge profits through short-term rentals. This then takes a number of apartments off the market, increasing rent prices and shortages. </p> <p>An acquaintance has rented four flats at a low rate, and rents them all out through Airbnb. It\u2019s become a very profitable full-time job for him. The city has put some restrictions on the amount of days you can rent your property, but these are apparently easy to evade and not well enforced. The city is still catching up to the use of new technologies. Rent caps and restrictions on Airbnb are a start, but they need to be more strictly enforced.\u201d <em>(Daniel)</em></p> <h2>Somerville, US: \u2018We need more community control of land\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cGentrification is out of control here in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Its negative effect such as displacement of people should be tackled by a housing plan that includes affordable apartments for rent inside more expensive buildings, sponsored by the state. Displacement of poor people out of gentrified neighbourhoods is a serious issue here: people have to move to housing projects that are located 50km away from the city centre. But land developers are not to blame, they respond to the free trade economy.

I\u2019m from a working-class background and have always worked. Affordable housing has always been an issue for my friends and family. No one wanted to live here when I first moved in, but now it is considered a highly desirable area. We have seen the mass selling-off of council flats on the estate to property developers, the private and buy-to-rent markets. This has put a lot of pressure on tenants like myself, with our homes constantly under threat as the council tries to find ways to evict or move you out of the area to free up properties to sell, creating anxiety and vulnerability.</p> <p>What gets forgotten is that we have a diverse community of people in my block who know each other and help each other out. My experience of people who have bought flats is that they don\u2019t actually want to live in a diverse community. Shop prices have gone up locally, expensive coffee shops and restaurants have opened. It has created a class and race divide that didn\u2019t exist here before. The tenants\u2019 association has been good at campaigning to stop flats from being demolished to make space for luxury apartments \u2013 but they\u2019ve been unable to stop the sell-off of flats.

But there is a district called Goutte d\u2019Or which is maybe one of the last areas in the inner city trying to resist it. Despite the loss of some of the shops and communities which create the identity of this area, there are a few initiatives that are trying to resist the present trend. In order to preserve the ethnic and social diversity in Goutte d\u2019Or, the city has been trying to slow down the process of gentrification by developing social housing. One third of the flats created were reserved for emergency housing, one third for regular social housing and one third for middle class \u201cpioneers\u201d. This policy has been criticised for dragging the middle class in to this area and increasing real estate prices.</p> <p>Gentrification is a natural trend but it has to be regulated especially in a multicultural and socially divided city such as Paris. This city is very rich in terms of diversity, but this is now being threatened, especially because private housing is deregulated and many foreigners are investing in real estate, making prices grow artificially. I think people who own flats and leave them empty should be taxed, and the city council should encourage owners to transform unused spaces such as abandoned offices into residential units to create more offers on the market.\u201d <em>(Alexia Chauliac)</em></p> <h2>Callao, Peru: \u2018The government here doesn\u2019t even know what gentrification is\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cCallao is a city full of history and traditions and is undergoing a process of gentrification, specifically in the historic centre.

  "<p>Theresa May\u2019s speech on Wednesday may turn out to be the most revealing of the party conference but after three days quite a lot has already emerged about the state of the Conservative party. Here are 10 things we\u2019ve learned.</p> <p><strong>1: Brexit will be at the harder end of the scale. </strong>This was signalled in Theresa May\u2019s speech on Sunday and \u2013 judging not least by the market reaction \u2013 it is the most important takeaway from the whole conference. Ministers still seem uncertain as to exactly what they want, but the Norway/Switzerland models (soft Brexit) are out and, although May is not planning to simply walk away and slam the door (the hardest possible Brexit) she will prioritise getting control over immigration over single market membership. Brexiters strongly object to the terms hard/soft on the grounds that they are loaded, because hard implies bad (clean/dirty is one alternative formula they prefer), but this terminology is not unreasonable. Economists believe disengaging from the single market will have negative consequences.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\">Conservative conference: Theresa May's speech - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>2: The Conservative party is largely united behind May on Brexit \u2013 but it is complacent about the risks. </strong>From what has been said in the conference hall, and on the fringe, you could easily forget that the party was split down the middle on the EU four months ago because now the Tories seem remarkably unified. According to <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/10/brexit-members-survey-todays-conservativehome-conference-newspaper-in-full.html\">a ConservativeHome poll,</a> 76% of members back the harder Brexit May is offering. But there is a considerable disconnect between Toryworld, where many members are convinced that all forecasts about Brexit being bad for the economy are just wrong, and reality, where May\u2019s speech sent the pound tumbling. Two figures who are not complacent are May herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb#block-57f373d4e4b01506cbf24feb\">who has been warning about \u201cbumps in the road\u201d</a>, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who used his speech on Monday to try to warn his party about potential bad news ahead.</p> <p><strong>3: City and business opinion does not matter to the Tory leadership as much as it used to.</strong> Traditionally the Conservative party has been quite deferential towards the City and business but now the tone is different. \u201cCity delegates stranded on Planet Tory for the duration of the party conference report the atmosphere has turned toxic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7133664a-8a29-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">the Financial Times\u2019 Lombard column reports.</a> A Bloomberg story saying <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-03/may-said-to-downgrade-city-in-brexit-shock-for-financial-sector\">the City would get no special favours in the Brexit negotiations</a> caused alarm (even though it was denied), and then Amber Rudd, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on work visas <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/79577/business-backlash-against-amber-rudds-fresh-immigration\">that prompted a strong business backlash.</a> In government, Hammond is fighting to protect business interests in the Brexit talks although, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1703845213273550\">in a perceptive Facebook post,</a> ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong> says the conference shows \u201cthe Treasury, in the May government, is less powerful than it\u2019s been for many decades\u201d.<br></p> <p><strong>4: May seems serious about defining herself as a centre-ground politician \u2013 although so far there is little evidence to show that she will be very different from her predecessor.</strong> It is commonplace for political leaders serious about power to argue that they represent the centre ground, or that the centre ground has moved towards them, but May is finding it easier to make this case than David Cameron because for most his premiership the centre ground was taken by his coalition partners, the Lib Dems. However, so far, we have yet to see a big policy shift that makes this real. When Nick Robinson challenged her on Tuesday to show her commitment to working people by axing inheritance tax cuts (which only help the wealthy), or higher public sector pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b#block-57f36c6be4b0643b5d843d5b\">May ducked for cover.</a> </p> <p><strong>5: The Tories aren\u2019t very worried about Labour \u2013 but that has not stopped them annexing some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy territory.</strong> In some respects competitive party politics is quite simple; all you have to do is attack your opponents\u2019 bad ideas, pinch their good ones, and make sure you have the sense to tell which is which. The Tories have done that this week, hijacking some of the soundest aspects of the Corbyn agenda: a slower timetable for balancing the budget, reviewing whether employment laws suit the modern workplace, and a migration impact fund. Some Labour figures think that, if the Tories are on their turf, that will help Corbyn, but that is not necessarily so because, on the economy and immigration, the Tories are more trusted than Labour. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader-tories-should-be-worried-and-not-celebrating-robert-halfon-minister-mp-a7342636.html\">The Tory MP Robert Halfon gave an interesting speech saying his party should worry about Corbyn\u2019s ability to inspire young voters,</a> but he has been a lone voice and generally the Conservatives are not taking the threat from Corbyn seriously at all. </p> <p><strong>6: Next year\u2019s most important election may well be the West Midlands mayoral one.</strong> Labour is expected to win the mayoral elections in Greater Manchester and Liverpool city region next year quite easily, but the contest in the West Midlands could turn out to be gripping. The Tories have used the conference to promote their candidate, the outgoing John Lewis boss Andy Street, and Street says that he just needs a 4% swing from the general election results to win. Given that the West Midlands is one of the regions where general elections are often decided, this will be a key test for Corbyn\u2019s Labour versus May\u2019s Conservatives.<br></p> <p><strong>7: The Tories have ditched the Cameron era quite ruthlessly. </strong>There is little gratitude in politics. Ministers have have been acknowledging David Cameron in their speeches, but their tributes have barely gone beyond the polite and, outside the conference hall, it\u2019s more a case of Dave who? In the atrium there is a display featuring pictures of Tory prime ministers from Robert Peel to John Major from which Cameron is notably absent. The people most closely associated with his administration, like George Osborne and Michael Gove, have not turned up and, in a final indignity, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/david-camerons-former-aide-charged-1500-for-conference-ticket-after-publishing-attack-book-on-a7334966.html\">Sir Craig Oliver, Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, was forced to pay the extortionate business attendee rate to get a pass to be allowed entry into the conference building.</a><br></p> <p><strong>8: Being foreign secretary has not changed Boris Johnson. </strong>Diplomacy is normally associated with a certain amount of gravitas, and before the conference it was not clear whether Johnson would adopt a serious tone, or whether we would get the usual faux-spontaneous, rambling, semi-frivolous standup routine. In the event we got the latter. It was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c#block-57f13f37e4b015be6383371c\">a very good speech</a>, probably the best anyone has delivered so far (not least for the use of the word \u201cfunkapolitan\u201d), although what the mandarins at King Charles Street and Johnson\u2019s fellow foreign ministers made of it is anyone\u2019s guess.<br></p> <p><strong>9: The Tories who backed the Vote Leave campaign are not willing to defend its key claims.</strong> One of the TV highlights of the conference has been Sky\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/783193789158481920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Darren McCaffrey trying to get the Tory Vote Leave leaders to defend their claim that Brexit would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS.</a> The Vote Leave NHS promise was disowned some months ago, but this week we\u2019ve seen further evidence that Vote Leave\u2019s Brexit forecasts were misleading. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/03/conservative-conference-philip-hammond-confirms-osbornes-austerity-timetable-has-been-dropped-politics-live?page=with:block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e#block-57f25d97e4b0ff53b531bb7e\">Rudd said she was not planning to increase immigration from the Commonwealth as EU immigration falls</a> (leavers forecast the opposite) and Brexit ministers are backing away from the claim that there will be no trade-off between controlling immigration and enjoying the full benefits of the single market. (Admittedly, some of the worst remain economic forecasts have failed to materialise too, but the person most associated with those claims, George Osborne, is out of the picture.)</p> <p><strong>10: An early election looks less and less likely. </strong>May has been saying for some time that she has no plans for an early election, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/02/conservative-conference-may-to-explain-brexit-great-repeal-bill-in-marr-interview-politics-live?page=with:block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f#block-57f04384e4b0ab0063086f3f\">in an interview on Sunday</a> she went further then before, saying an early election would generate \u201cinstability\u201d. Just as significantly, it has become clear from what has and has not been said around the conference that there is little appetite in the party for an early poll.<br></p>",

And it is this opposition \u2013 competence v charisma \u2013 rather than substantive policy disagreements, that is framing the election.</p> <p>Consider that, when it comes to policy positions, these two candidates are among the most <em>different</em> in recent memory. Yet such differences don\u2019t really seem to be at the center of attention, either for the candidates themselves, or the public at large.</p> <p>In their recent debate, Clinton said explicitly that she intends to \u201cincrease taxes\u201d for the rich and address the \u201csystemic racism\u201d of the country\u2019s criminal justice system: positions that not even Obama had dared to take so plainly four or eight years ago. Trump instead declared he intends to lower taxes for the top income brackets and dismissed the problem of racism as a question of \u201claw and order\u201d. Similarly, on international trade, they took almost diametrically opposed stances: Clinton sees it as a factor of growth and stability, whereas Trump says trade is \u201ckilling our country\u201d.</p> <p>Yet all this somehow remains in the background. The real core of what Clinton was attempting to communicate is that she is more competent than her rival, because she has greater policy expertise. This explains her reliance on the opinion of \u201cindependent experts\u201d to make the case for her economic plan, as well as the insistence on \u201cfact-checking\u201d Trump\u2019s assertions.</p> <p>Conversely, most of Trump\u2019s efforts went into depicting Clinton as a political insider, who is responsible for the \u201cmess\u201d the country is supposedly in at the moment, while presenting himself as a \u201cstrong leader\u201d who can solve the country\u2019s problems precisely by virtue of his decisive and unconventional approach.</p> <p>The roots of this populist drift in the Republican party go back several decades. Although the party\u2019s current establishment professes to be outraged by at least some of Trump\u2019s excesses, there is a direct line of continuity running from the late 1990s\u2019 bid to impeach Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, to George W Bush\u2019s self-presentation as the candidate one would \u201cmost like to have beer with\u201d, the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2012 and many features of Trump\u2019s current campaign.</p> <p>The Democrats\u2019 response has been to move progressively towards the center, assuming the mantle of \u201creason\u201d and \u201crespectability\u201d, while presenting their rivals as irresponsible mavericks. No wonder the substantive policy differences between them have fallen into the background: when politics is structured around the opposition between competent technocrats on one hand and anti-establishment populists on the other, there is little room left for substantive policy disagreement in the middle.</p> <p>Nor is America alone in this shift. The debate over Brexit in the UK was fought along the same axis of opposition. The core of the Remain campaign\u2019s argument rested on the opinion of \u201cexperts\u201d, according to which leaving the European Union would have had objectively catastrophic consequences for the country. In contrast, the Leave campaign appealed to many of the same sentiments that underscore Trump\u2019s appeal: widespread anti-establishment feeling, guttural nationalism and concerns about immigration and international trade.</p> <p>The paradox is that all this is depoliticizing public debate, precisely as campaigns become more bitter and conflictual. Democratic politics depends on the confrontation between rival political agendas and ideological visions. But in the struggle between technocrats and populists all we are left with is the choice between preserving the system as it is or burning it all to the ground. For those who want meaningful political alternatives, this doesn\u2019t bode well. <br></p>",

It\u2019s important to train more British doctors and I also really like his idea to help more people from disadvantaged backgrounds get into medicine.</p> <p>Foreign students already pay eye-watering fees to study medicine in this country. If you can afford to pay \u00a335,000 per year it isn\u2019t that much of an increase to \u00a340,000.

Also, it is not ethical to employ doctors from countries who have a great need for doctors themselves. Especially when the need for doctors in hospitals and in GP practice is increasing.</p> <p>As a nurse, I saw doctors who were far too tired to be working.

While I have complete faith in the ability and competence of foreign NHS staff of all grades, we have been draining other countries of their clinical talent for decades - this is not a newly identified issue.</p> <p>While medical schools conduct fairly robust vetting processes already, which of course include a requirement to achieve specific grades at A-level, I do believe that there is room for this process to become more nuanced.</p> <p>One risk to Mr Hunt\u2019s plan, however, is that his recent battles with junior doctors may undermine any prospective student\u2019s faith that they will receive a fair salary once they find themselves in employment as a doctor after years of studying and training - a considerable commitment.</p> <p><em>Anonymous, 32, senior NHS analyst, Hampshire</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abed8725cf3c8bf5d5027a0c4329087c837f72f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abed8725cf3c8bf5d5027a0c4329087c837f72f5/0_136_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A doctor at the accident and emergency department of Birmingham Queen Elizabeth Hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A doctor at the accident and emergency department of Birmingham Queen Elizabeth Hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Those who disagree with Hunt\u2019s proposals: </strong>\u2018The NHS needs those extra 100,000 medics\u2019</h2> <p>I believe having a diversity of doctors and nurses in the NHS is a good thing. Our patients are not exclusively UK-born or speak English as a first language, so why should our doctors?<br></p> <p>There are excellent doctors, and not-so-excellent doctors.

He is the most hated health secretary, and possibly politician, of recent times. <br></p> <p>Hunt\u2019s proposals are absolutely not workable.

Medicine as a career is finished in this country. Rather like our motor industry, we have been mismanaged to the point of rock bottom morale and people are leaving in droves.

We\u2019ve never trained enough doctors or nurses to staff the NHS. We used to have a regular supply of well-trained doctors coming here from the Indian subcontinent, as well as a steady flow of doctors from Australia and New Zealand who would come for a couple of years as our training was excellent.

With the haemorrhaging of staff to early retirement or overseas he\u2019ll be lucky to have any kind of useful workforce to maintain what services we provide now. To recruit and retain doctors is easy. You treat them with respect. You offer them reasonable conditions. You pay them fairly, and you train them well. Then they will come and they will willingly work very hard, over and above what is expected or paid for. Treat them the way Hunt is, and they\u2019ll go.</p> <p>If I were a student now, there is no way I would pursue medicine in the UK. If you treat staff properly, they won\u2019t want to leave anyway.

  "<h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSIMVnPA994\">Oxyg\u00e8ne (Part IV)</a></h2> <p>Jean-Michel Andr\u00e9 Jarre learned his trade under the giants of musical abstraction, <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2016/02/23/pierre-schaeffer-guide/\">Pierre Schaeffer</a>, Pierre Henry and Karlheinz Stockhausen, but it was when he decided to pepper his avant garde musings with strong flourishes of melody that things started to happen for him. The Lyon-born musician had played guitar in a couple of bands, and released two electronic albums under his own name to little fanfare (including the soundtrack to the 1973 film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRs4smphvaQ\">Les Granges Br\u00fbl\u00e9es</a>). It must have been a surprise then, when a third album recorded at home with an eight-track and some analogue synthesisers \u2013 Oxyg\u00e8ne \u2013 made him an huge star shortly after it was released internationally in 1977 [it came out in France in December 1976]. Oxyg\u00e8ne went on to sell 14m copies, a remarkable feat when one considers some of the tracks are impressionistic experiments, full of space noise and static. In fact, Jarre has shifted something in the region of 80m albums across his career, more than, say, Duran Duran, which is quite an achievement for a French solo artist who doesn\u2019t sing. If he has a signature tune, then it has to be Oxyg\u00e8ne (Part IV) \u2013 an instantly recognisable hook that hitches a ride on a bossa nova beat in order to explore the galaxies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPybH37HKWc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kPybH37HKWc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPybH37HKWc\">Watch Jean-Michel Jarre play Oxyg\u00e8ne (Part IV) live</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFqzfT2Q4Sk\">Equinoxe (Part V)</a></h2> <p>The neat narrative that punk had killed progressive rock rings hollow in the face of hard figures. Equinoxe didn\u2019t quite repeat the success of Oxyg\u00e8ne, but sales of 10m certainly beats a kick in the teeth. In fact, Equinoxe (Part V) does what prog does best (and, despite the track\u2019s brevity, make no mistake that prog is what it is): it takes peculiar time signatures and makes them accessible. In plain English, that means you think you can dance to it in your head, but in practice it may turn out rather differently. By now, Jarre had become the undisputed poster boy for French music, and in 1979 the mayor of Paris invited him to play a free outdoor show for Bastille Day at the Place de la Concorde. A million people showed up, taking Jarre into the Guinness Book of Records for the first time. He later said it took him a year to get over it. </p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX5oI5YYIZM\">Magnetic Fields (Part I)</a></h2> <p>Equinoxe was followed in 1981 by Les Chants Magn\u00e9tiques, another album of tracks given the same name, differentiated by numbers. Part I is split into three parts, kicking off with an exhibitionist, cocksure first movement that seems to keep reaching to the sky for yet more key changes, followed by the swishy human samples and surreality of the second, and the mechanical chuntering and sonic lack of constraint of the third. Les Chants Magn\u00e9tiques, or Magnetic Fields as it was called outside France, was one of the first records to feature the <a href=\"http://petervogelinstruments.com.au/history/\">Fairlight CMI</a>, a sampler that would have cost a pretty penny at the time. Listening to the whole track, you might assume it uses every other synthesiser known to man up to that point, too. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/jean-michel-jarre-all-people-new-album-geeks\">Jean-Michel Jarre: \u2018All the people on my new album are geeks\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzAui_gcdhM\">Arpegiateur (Live)</a></h2> <p>Jarre took his spectacular show to China in 1981, an incredible and singular occurrence at the time. \u201cThis show would have been considered futuristic in London, Paris or New York, but in China it was like an alien had landed,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2015/09/22/jean-michel-jarre-interview/\">he said later</a>. \u201cAnd then China closed the door again after that. It just opened for one year and then closed again. So it created something very special between lots of Chinese people and myself.\u201d Arpegiateur \u2013 written specifically for the live shows \u2013 is a stunning, proto-ambient techno snippet that dances repetitively around monophonic notes, as the name implies. It\u2019s scientific, but there\u2019s also a very human tension, which is probably why it was chosen as the theme music for the erotic thriller 9\u00bd Weeks. Unusually for a live track, there\u2019s barely any crowd noise at the outset and then a flutter of appreciation at the conclusion, demonstrating how respectful Chinese audiences were at that time, in stark contrast to, say, Beatlemania. \u201cWhen you think after 25 years of Mao, Chinese people had no idea about western music or even western culture, they had no idea about James Dean or the Beatles or Charlie Chaplin, modern music or modern cinema,\u201d Jarre said. \u201cSo it was like playing on the moon.\u201d </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiLzMExXHiE\">Blah Blah Cafe</a></h2> <p>Zoolook, released in 1984, is regarded as the album most influenced by Pierre Schaeffer and musique concr\u00e8te, taking in samples of everyday activity and the human voice, with 25 languages used. Blah Blah Cafe certainly has a cosmopolitan feel, evoking images of cafe culture and the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life surrounding it. The track actually began life on 1983\u2019s Music for Supermarkets, an oddity in that only one copy of the album was ever made, which Jarre had destroyed after it was played on the radio just once. That art prank was a protest at the way the then burgeoning compact disc was being marketed, and the fact music would be sold \u201clike toothpaste and yogurt\u201d. The intention was that it would only be disseminated via pirate copies, or copies of copies, from the broadcast. That proved to be ironic, as Jarre became an adversary of the free-for-all culture of the internet and of the dubious merits of the CD and particularly the MP3. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jarre\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aguardianmusic%3Aplaylist%3A31Z2j4UFDj1AWkzPHM4xCN\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cDcvhNgQfw\">Quatri\u00e8me Rendez-Vous (Live in Lyon)</a></h2> <p>The composer and the showman were becoming hard to separate by 1986, and Jarre was surely thinking about the laser shows and the millions he\u2019d perform for as much as the music when he was writing the songs on Rendez-vous. So Quatri\u00e8me Rendez-Vous is anthemic in the same way a national anthem is anthemic; it\u2019s exultant and, if we\u2019re honest, a little bit self-congratulatory, but then if you had a colossal light show and millions of people coming to see you every night, you might get a bit bigheaded, too. The live version, recorded in Jarre\u2019s hometown in 1987, is chosen over the studio track to evince the boundless enjoyment the shows generated at the time, in contrast with the performances in China. The improvised sax break towards the conclusion is an unnecessary accoutrement, but it\u2019s preferable to the guitar solo at Docklands a year later. </p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0SPpcSNNk8\">Revolution</a>, Revolutions</h2> <p>The success of Paul Simon\u2019s 1986 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/paul-simon-graceland-acclaim-outrage\">Graceland</a> opened the floodgates for experimental fusions, and Jarre was quick to capitalise on this new international inclusiveness, mixing Arab-inspired symphonics and ethnic jazz with hard industrial beats. Exciting and intrepid \u2013 with a Kraftwerk-like vocoder inciting \u201crevolution\u201d \u2013 the 1988 track Revolution sounds as if it was expressly written to soundtrack the Arab spring, more than two decades later. An adversary of musical theft Jarre may be, but he had his fingers burned when he unwittingly sampled the ney flute of Turkish musician Kudsi Erguner, which he had acquired from ethnomusicologist Xavier Bellenger; Erguner won a modest payout, and Jarre created a new opening section and renamed the track Revolution, Revolutions, when the album was remastered in 1991. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0SPpcSNNk8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t0SPpcSNNk8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0SPpcSNNk8\">Watch the promo video for Revolution.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pFp3wo146c\">Bells</a></h2> <p>JMJ as phenomenon peaked in 1997, when he brought out Oxyg\u00e8ne 7\u201313 and broke his own world record for crowd attendance a third time, playing to 3.5 million people in Moscow, a record that still stands. The self-aware musician must have seen he\u2019d erred into self-parody, and thus the 21st century ushered in a new resolve to try different things. A new album, M\u00e9tamorphoses, was something of a musical departure, relying heavily on female vocalists including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2016/may/16/laurie-anderson-heart-of-a-dog-video\">Laurie Anderson</a> and Natacha Atlas. The fan base weren\u2019t quite ready for it, and the album nosedived commercially, but it wasn\u2019t without its high points. Bells is perhaps the most successful track \u2013 and also the nearest thing on the album to an instrumental. He certainly wasn\u2019t done with collaborations just yet though \u2026</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwnmquRgYw\">Immortals (with Fuck Buttons)</a></h2> <p>In 2015, Jarre released the first of two albums, containing 34 tracks, most recorded with a different artist. The collaborators on Electronica 1&amp;2 are a Who\u2019s Who of electronic music over the years, including Vince Clarke, Gary Numan, Massive Attack, Moby, John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream, Gesaffelstein, Peaches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/julia-holter-have-you-my-wilderness-uk-tour-interview\">Julia Holter</a>. Jarre admitted that of the newer acts he wanted to work with, future trance duo Fuck Buttons came out on top. \u201cThe first time I heard their music I was amazed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wall of sound and these distorted soundscapes \u2026 It\u2019s quite amazing to come from that generation, where you have so many sounds and music all over the world, to be able to create something visible with a special touch. It\u2019s very unusual.\u201d Immortals is a ballsy and ambient showstopper and the undoubted highlight of the first record. </p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNESMafb5ZI\">Exit (with Edward Snowden)</a></h2> <p>If there were concerns that 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/jean-michel-jarre-electronica-2-the-heart-of-noise-review-dizzy-techno-edward-snowden\">Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise</a> wouldn\u2019t cause the same stir as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/jean-michel-jarre-electronica-1-the-time-machine-review\">Electronica 1: The Time Machine</a>, then Jarre had an ace up his sleeve in the guise of former CIA employee Edward Snowden. A defining objective of Electronica as a project was that Jarre would travel to meet each of the collaborators on the two albums, because as he said himself: \u201cWe all think we are connected to the world now, but we are not talking to our neighbours any more.\u201d It meant driving two hours out of Vienna for Tangerine Dream, or flying to Brooklyn to work with Hans Zimmer or Laurie Anderson. In the case of Snowden, it involved him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/15/jean-michel-jarre-records-with-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower\">contacting the Guardian\u2019s music desk, who referred him to the right people to reach Snowden</a>, followed by a trek to Moscow, where the whistleblower had been granted asylum.

  "<p>Hong Kong\u2019s best-known democracy campaigner, Joshua Wong, has accused Thailand\u2019s military junta of political \u201csuppression\u201d after he was barred from entering the country, apparently after Beijing asked for his name to be placed on a travel blacklist. <br></p> <p>Speaking after arriving back in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon, the teenage activist described how he had spent almost 12 hours inside a detention centre at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport after he was picked up by Thai police when he landed in Bangkok the previous night. <br></p> <p>Wong, 19, who became an international symbol of the fight for democracy during Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 umbrella movement street protests, said about 20 police officers had taken him into custody at about midnight on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cFor almost 12 hours I was detained alone inside a cell,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWhen I asked what the reason for them detaining me \u2026 they just said: \u2018We will not give you any explanation. You have been blacklisted already.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhen I requested to contact my lawyer in Thailand or at least notify my parents that I had already arrived in Bangkok, they still rejected my request,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is really out of my expectation to have this kind of suppression from the Thailand government. For me, I think this is illegal detention.\u201d </p> <p>Wong touched down in Hong Kong at about 3.40pm on Wednesday having spent the night being questioned at Suvarnabhumi airport.<br></p> <p>The activist had been due to speak about his quest for democracy at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok on Thursday. </p> <p>His speech was to be part of events marking the 40th anniversary of a massacre of pro-democracy students by Thai security forces and royalist militias in 1976. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89ab32205822eb1d0f1f74f60f1a8e5ab1aa5dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ab32205822eb1d0f1f74f60f1a8e5ab1aa5dcb/0_117_6504_3901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers react as protesters against the Thai government scuffle with them in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers react as protesters against the Thai government scuffle with them in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Pruthipong Prayoonsiri, the deputy commander of the Suvarnabhumi immigration office, <a href=\"http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Thai-Immigration-blacklists-Joshua-Wong-as-request-30296926.html\">told Thailand\u2019s the Nation</a> website that China had sent a request for Wong\u2019s entry to be denied. </p> <p>\u201cAs a result, the immigration bureau blacklisted him and held him for deportation.

Wong\u2019s supporters said he had been held \u201cincommunicado\u201d by Thai police. </p> <p>At just before noon on Wednesday, almost 12 hours after he was detained, Wong was put on a Hong Kong Airlines flight from Bangkok back to the former British colony. </p> <p>Speaking at the airport, Wong said he had hoped to share his political points of view with Thai students and was \u201ctotally disappointed\u201d with his treatment. </p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon the Thai junta released what appeared to be a contradictory statement saying \u201cthere had been no instruction or order given pertaining to Mr Wong\u201d but then explaining why he had been detained and deported.</p> <p>\u201cMr Wong had been active in resistance movements against other foreign governments, and that if such actions were taken within Thailand, they could eventually affect Thailand\u2019s relations with other nations,\u201d said spokesman Lt Gen Sansern Kaewkamnerd.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday supporters gathered outside the Thai consulate in Hong Kong holding placards that read \u201cShame on Thai government\u201d and \u201cStop human rights violation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WeiDuCNA/status/783545578856779776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HK pro-democracy lawmakers protesting Joshua Wong&#39;s detainment in front Thai consulate. <a href=\"https://t.co/hfs4IK54fH\">pic.twitter.com/hfs4IK54fH</a></p>&mdash; Wei Du \u675c\u552f (@WeiDuCNA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeiDuCNA/status/783545578856779776\">October 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Agnes Chow, the deputy general secretary of Wong\u2019s political party, said she believed Beijing had deliberately blocked his entry into Thailand to prevent him from \u201cspreading democratic ideas\u201d. <br></p> <p>Chow, 19, said Hong Kong campaigners would not be intimidated by China\u2019s actions. \u201cWe will not give up the fight for democracy and the fight against the Chinese government which disrespects human rights,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Jason Ng, a Hong Kong author who helped arrange Wong\u2019s trip, said Thailand\u2019s refusal to admit the activist showed \u201chow ready Beijing is to flex its diplomatic muscles and [how it] expects neighbouring governments to play ball\u201d.<br></p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s young pro-democracy activists were now \u201cat the mercy of some Chinese no-fly list,\u201d Ng added. \u201cWhy is Beijing so afraid of Joshua Wong?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2acdea0ffb6eff26a789526b80bbbf2981761ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2acdea0ffb6eff26a789526b80bbbf2981761ab5/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march to the Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong after Joshua Wong was detained.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march to the Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong after Joshua Wong was detained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lam Yik Fei/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The incident is the latest to underline how Thailand has drifted into China\u2019s orbit since a 2014 coup returned the country to military rule. </p> <p>Since the junta took power it has allowed Chinese dissidents and scores of Uighur refugees to be forcibly returned to China at Beijing\u2019s request. </p> <p>Last October the Hong Kong bookseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Gui Minhai vanished from his home</a> in the Thai town of Pattaya.

While Pence kept his cool, Kaine tried to imitate Joe Biden\u2019s interruption-heavy performance against Paul Ryan in 2012 \u2013 without half his charisma. Kaine\u2019s biggest downfall, though, may not have been about tone. </p> <p>Compared to Kaine, Pence told a compelling \u2013 if terrifyingly cynical and blatantly false \u2013 story of a country that has lost its way, and how he and Trump intend to restore it. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might be one of the best political slogans of the past decade. But Trump owes its creation to people such as Margaret Thatcher and Reagan, who worked to spread the neoliberal gospel that\u2019s now seeped into both parties. That evangelizing project has been incredibly successful, with each candidate airing concerns about government spending, personal responsibility and the limits of American coffers.</p> <p>There were glaring omissions tonight, too. Despite a series of increasingly brutal projections about the likelihood of catastrophic global warming, talk of climate change was limited to a few coded words at the debate\u2019s start, like the mythical \u201cwar on coal\u201d and \u201cclean energy jobs of tomorrow.\u201d A cringe-worthy conversation about criminal justice reform somehow managed not to breach mass incarceration. And a brief discussion of reproductive rights \u2013 one that should have been up top given Pence\u2019s deplorable record on the issue \u2013 got shunted to the very end.</p> <p>The Democratic party has spent the past several decades pivoting around terms of debate set by the right. Kaine\u2019s loss in tonight\u2019s debate showed just how much work the Democrats \u2013 and the social movements pushing them \u2013 need to do to recenter the conversation. </p> <p>More than the \u201cintelligence surge\u201d Kaine and Clinton keep pushing, the Democratic party needs a surge in imagination, to do more than play defense against attacks from across the aisle and propose transformative solutions, in line with the pain many Americans today are facing.

Two experienced politicians dispatched to further the rhetoric of their campaigns and defend the candidates at the top of the ticket. Neither disappointed. </p> <p>At the start, when asked what made him a good candidate for the vice-presidency, Kaine faltered. Looking down, he rushed a heavily scripted first answer, told through the filter of Clinton\u2019s point of view, that took too long and strained to connect back to the question. Kaine directed his entire answer off camera, which greatly reduced his engagement with the television audience. </p> <p>Pence restated Trump\u2019s conservative positions, doubling down on wealth and whiteness for the win. Pence tried to spin away from Kaine\u2019s points on policy, using plain speak \u2013 the common language of the Trump campaign. When Kaine pushed Pence on social security, all that Pence could offer was: \u201cThere they go again. We\u2019re going to meet our obligations to seniors.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd31e8805336ac7f00621b495777de931f074cd/0_48_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pence won the debate by a landslide.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was on the topics of policing, immigration and women that the difference between the men and their campaigns was made most clear.

Kaine spoke of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d and \u201cbuilding bonds of understanding\u201d while Pence seemed annoyed with the topic and impatiently attempted to dress down his opponent by saying \u201c\u2026 enough of seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs\u201d. A frightening reality check for minorities. </p> <p>On immigration, Pence offered more thinly veiled hate with \u201ctoo often with criminal aliens in the country, it\u2019s bringing heartbreak\u201d. If only Kaine had challenged him right then and there. As the debate went on, Kaine grew stronger, relying less on prepared statements and messages, and listening and responding in real time. <br></p> <p>In the words of Kaine: \u201cFrom the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks ...

Whatever the accuracy of Kaine\u2019s attacks on Trump \u2013 and make no mistake, they were often accurate \u2013 Kaine\u2019s style was excessive.

Like Kaine, Pence had his share of canned lines. Unlike Kaine, he was able to deliver them in a way that made them appear sincere and sometimes even heartfelt. Performance matters. </p> <p>Pence won the debate by a landslide, and it\u2019s hard to imagine there will be many in the media who will even attempt to claim otherwise. The only question is how his running mate\u2019s fragile ego will react when all those who panned his debate skills praise Pence\u2019s. <br></p>",
  "<p><strong> <br></strong></p> <p>The almost 17 years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/12/juliet-lyon-now-right-time-to-leave-prison-reform-trust\">Juliet Lyon</a> spent as director of the <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/\">Prison Reform Trust</a> before stepping down in July was good preparation for her new role as chair of the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody (IAP). With figures last month showing violence and death in English and Welsh prisons at an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/21/prison-violence-at-wholly-unacceptable-level-ombudsman-finds\">all-time high</a>, the need for the IAP has probably never been greater. At the PRT Lyon often came into contact with bereaved families whose loved ones had died while in the care of the state. Although some were homicides, most were self-inflicted.</p> <p>As a long-term prisoner, I was frequently on wings and landings when fellow prisoners took their own lives. My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1998/jan/14/guardiansocietysupplement\">first-ever article</a> for the Guardian in 1998 was about the impact that such deaths have. There were 1,247 prison suicides in the 20 years I served before my release in 2004, according to figures from the charity <a href=\"http://www.inquest.org.uk/\">Inquest</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/12/juliet-lyon-now-right-time-to-leave-prison-reform-trust\">Why I\u2019m leaving the Prison Reform Trust now | Juliet Lyon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days death is even more prevalent in our prisons. In the 12 months to June this year there were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/543284/safety-in-custody-bulletin.pdf\">321 prison fatalities</a>. With 74 more than during the same period the previous year, it was the highest toll ever recorded in England and Wales. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/28/suicides-and-assaults-in-prisons-in-england-and-wales-at-all-time-high\">Of these, 105 were self-inflicted</a>, 186 were recorded as death from natural causes, (although since the average age in the case of such deaths is 56 it suggests that these might not be just \u201cnatural\u201d) \u2013 and at least five were prisoner-on-prisoner killings. Twenty-five other deaths are still waiting to be classified. As well as the record deaths, last year there were on average 160 cell fires a month, more than 34,000 instances of self-harm and an almost trebling of incidents involving violence.</p> <p>So how does the IAP plan to bring about a reduction in deaths? Lyon says: \u201cA priority is to learn from bereaved families and people who have attempted suicide in custody and survived.\u201d She says that just before we met she spoke to a mother whose son had been killed in prison. \u201cIf the state deprives you of your liberty, the one thing it has an obligation to do is to keep you safe. The high rate of deaths currently indicate that something is going terribly wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The IAP, an independent arms-length body, set up in 2008 on the recommendation of the <a href=\"http://iapdeathsincustody.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The-Fulton-Report-2008.pdf\">Fulton review</a> into deaths in custody advises ministers from the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice. Its remit is to \u201cact as the primary source of independent advice to ministers and service leaders on measures to reduce the number and rate of deaths in custody\u201d.</p> <p>While deaths in police and immigration custody have <a href=\"http://iapdeathsincustody.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IAP-End-of-Term-Report-2016.pdf\">remained constant</a> and decreased in the case of those detained under the Mental Health Act the increase in prison deaths is a particular concern. \u201cWhat you can see from the figures,\u201d says Lyon, \u201cis that the work the Prison Service did from about 2007 on safer custody was pretty effective. There was an intense concentration on how to make prison safer, particularly on how to reduce suicide. Safer custody teams in all prisons, working closely with the Samaritans and Samaritans-trained \u2018prisoner listeners\u2019 led to quite a drop in self-inflicted deaths.</p> <p>\u201cFew people know that almost 2,000 prisoners, trained by local Samaritans, now work day and night in almost every prison across England, Scotland and Wales to support people in need. Nothing else does as much to show how much responsibility and care people in prison can shoulder and to save countless lives.\u201d</p> <p>The IAP, she says, will focus on clusters of deaths in particular prisons and look at how to reduce high numbers of natural deaths in custody. \u201cWe\u2019ll also be briefing ministers on evidence and solutions to the distressing rise in the deaths of women in prison, 11 in the year to June 2016 compared to one death the year before \u2013 and on the particular vulnerability of people still serving the long-abolished<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/18/strasbourg-judges-indeterminate-sentences-unlawful\"> indeterminate sentence for public protection</a> (IPP). We have to really be prepared to work across departments to find solutions, but we can set and monitor guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>The justice secretary Liz Truss has declared very publicly that she wants to make <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmjust/647/64702.htm\">prison safety</a> her priority and when she was home secretary, Theresa May gave a speech supporting the joint PRT and Women\u2019s Institute <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/care-not-custody-speech\">Care not Custody</a> campaign to stop vulnerable people ending up in police or prison cells. But prison staff cuts, the massive increase in the use of new psychoactive substances \u2013 so-called \u201clegal highs\u201d \u2013 and general overcrowding has meant that prison regimes have become more and more limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/prison-deaths-self-harm-figures-rise\">Deaths and self-harm in prison rise sharply</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does she agree with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/19/samaritans-urges-action-on-prison-staffing-after-sharp-rise-in-suicides\">Samaritans</a> that the cuts are largely responsible for the rise in prison deaths? \u201cThe causes are complex,\u201d she says, \u201cbut<strong> </strong>sucking hope out of the system has taken a terrible toll. Research and best practice show that good staff-prisoner relations, personal officer work, information-sharing with other disciplines, mental healthcare and constructive regimes with time out of cell, contact with family and friends and something to work towards all make a positive difference.\u201d</p> <p>She says she welcomes the opportunity and the responsibility to help reduce deaths in custody. \u201cWhen someone takes their own life it is hard to describe, or even imagine, the despair that has led to it or the pain of loved ones left behind. If you talk to anyone charged with the care of people who are detained, they never forget a death in custody \u2013 it\u2019s like swallowing a stone that never goes away.\u201d She says she had lots of misgivings about giving an interview so early in her new role.</p> <p>\u201cBut as long as it goes beyond a day in the papers and serves as a firm reminder of the state\u2019s duty to protect life and the pressing need to make prisons safer then it will be worth it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> North London.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married, two children.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Exeter University (English and drama degree); Institute of Education (Rights MA).</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 2000-16: director, Prison Reform Trust; 1990-2000: associate director, Trust for the Study of Adolescence; 1980-90: regional manager, Richmond Fellowship; 1976-79: head of community education, Court Fields school, Somerset; 1975-76: teacher in charge, Dryden Clinic Exe Vale; 1971-75; social services foster parent, Devon and Camden; 1971-72: research assistant, Schools Council.</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> Chair, Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody; visiting professor, Birkbeck, University of London; CBE.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Gardening, beekeeping.</p>",
  "<p>I part the curtains and enter a tiny room. It\u2019s an intimate, low-lit space, with gold streamers hanging from the walls. There is a table with two chairs facing each other.

Calm down? If only I could. When I emerge 45 minutes later, I am marginally lighter and recall having had my trousers round my ankles.</p> <p>Anyway, once I\u2019m settled, the 31-year-old Frenchwoman begins singing some words to the tune of I\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin. \u201cI say to myself,\u201d she sings, \u201cthis hair will always grow so well. Why should I try to resist when I know you so well? I\u2019ve got you under my skin.\u201d Next, she smiles sweetly, then starts to roll up her skirt, revealing a pubic wig made of gold streamers that echo the ones lining the walls. Nice touch. She removes this and places it on her face. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baedc1cf7ee02d033ccc2941251f86c18f2d1d96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baedc1cf7ee02d033ccc2941251f86c18f2d1d96/0_59_5753_3452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slight terror \u2026 Stuart Jeffries prepares for his portrait.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slight terror \u2026 Stuart Jeffries prepares for his portrait.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m giggling now, but only to cover my slight terror at how things got so weird so quickly. Magically, the pubic wig has now become a beard. If I have a dream tonight about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> as a 1970s disco diva, shaking a sparkling beard-merkin and singing I Will Survive, I\u2019ll know who to thank.</p> <p>Pastor removes the beard, sits down opposite and breaks the ice by telling me about how she used to shave her pubes. I\u2019ve been on weirder first dates. \u201cI used to shave along the labia, along the bikini line, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cYes indeed!\u201d I reply. Now she doesn\u2019t. Now she just shaves her legs below the thighs. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asks and I feel like someone in a confessional, with nothing remotely diverting to offer the waiting priest. </p> <p>Then we\u2019re off on a conversation about how pubic hair is shaped by prevailing patriarchal norms. Pastor cites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/05/politics\">Judith Butler</a>, the American gender theorist, and I mention how John Ruskin quailed on seeing his wife naked on their wedding night, presumably after spending so much time looking at art history\u2019s pube-free parade of sexually commodified nudes.</p> <p>Pastor tells me the dismal story of a friend who got off with a bloke at a party but then decided not to invite him back to her place for sex because she was embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t shaved her pubes. He wouldn\u2019t have cared, I suggest. But she did, Pastor retorts, adding that young boys \u2013 their sensibilities ravaged by porn \u2013 are now also increasingly shaving their pubic hair so they can live up to the bodies they see online. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pastor glues some of my hair on to the portrait. Ta-da! I'm now as lavishly locked as I was at the age of 20</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pastor then uses a camera lucida to project an outline of my face on to a piece of paper, tracing the image with pencil and then sketching in details. I am then invited to pass into a second curtained space containing a full-length mirror and, on a table, some water, a towel, soap, scissors and a little box. If I want, says Pastor, I can cut a few locks of my pubic hair for use in this portrait.</p> <p> It would be ungallant, or just wimpish, not to produce the goods. So I drop my trousers and boxers and look into the mirror. A note stuck to the frame asks when I last looked at my pubes. Not recently. My privacy is guaranteed, Pastor assures me, though she remains very close. As I snip, I can hear her next door, humming along to a tune she\u2019s playing on a small keyboard.</p> <p>Bearing my pube-filled box, I return to the first room. Pastor glues some of my hair on to the portrait. Ta-da! Bald Jeffries has become, thanks to this graft, as lavishly locked as he was at 20. Pastor asks me to suggest a title. I propose, being slightly hysterical now, Gorgeous Hairy Man. And then Pastor sings to me one last time, a plaintive version of Lady Gaga\u2019s Hair on her dinky keyboard. She looks deep into my eyes and sings earnestly: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough, this is my prayer / That I\u2019ll die livin\u2019 just as free as my hair.\u201d By this stage, I\u2019m beyond hysteria and applaud happily. My only regret, I think, as I return to the theatre lobby, is that we didn\u2019t duet.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Pastor joins me at the bar and I ask her what that was all about. She has a doctorate from the University of London in movement, intimacies and space in contemporary physical theatres. Clearly, she explores these issues in Pube. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how theatre can be something more than a performance of virtuosity for a paying audience,\u201d she says. When I suggest that there\u2019s a possibility that audiences will mistake Pube for a therapy session, she doesn\u2019t demur. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cc6601cd2ae1390b25458db892911b85041ce44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc6601cd2ae1390b25458db892911b85041ce44/0_0_3806_5698/668.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think it\u2019s rich terrain\u2019 \u2026 Eug\u00e9nie Pastor.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think it\u2019s rich terrain\u2019 \u2026 Eug\u00e9nie Pastor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI like the parallel. I\u2019m trying to create a time and space outside the normal world where we can think about something that\u2019s, if not quite taboo, then regarded as disgusting. I\u2019ve already had a lot of very intimate conversations, especially with women. British people have the reputation of being very secretive. But, in performing Pube, I\u2019ve found that not to be true. I think it\u2019s rich terrain. Why do we cut our pubic hair? What forces make us do these things?\u201d </p> <p>Pastor performed Pube at Folkestone\u2019s Women of the World festival earlier this year, and most of her punters were women. She hopes a higher proportion of men will attend her London shows. She says her mother thinks the idea of the show is very strange, but was mollified to learn that the arts council partly funds Pube, giving it the seal of official respectability.</p> <p>Pastor clearly isn\u2019t in this for the money: it costs \u00a36 to be her audience member for 45 minutes. Perhaps she should consider admitting more than one person at a time? \u201cI tried that. Didn\u2019t really work \u2013 friends would disappear into a conversation of their own sometimes. I\u2019d like to try it with couples though.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if the Lady Gaga song contains the moral of the show: be free, let your hair run wild, don\u2019t let your parents snip away at your dreams. Pastor smiles but says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be another voice telling people what to do. I want to empower people to make their own decisions. Pubic hair is treated as gross \u2013 when, in reality, it can be something pretty and delicate.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Pube is at <a href=\"http://cptheatre.co.uk/\">Camden People\u2019s Theatre</a>, London, 7-8 October.

Although the assessments carried out in the two surveys differed somewhat, the new data seemingly implies a rising epidemic of PTSD among young women in England today.</p> <p>The principal cause of PTSD is exposure to an extremely stressful, often life-threatening, event. Stressors that are unpredictable, uncontrollable and especially terrifying are those most likely to produce the disorder. Interpersonal violence, such as combat, rape, torture and domestic abuse, usually triggers PTSD more often than accidents, natural disasters, and events not involving deliberate intent to harm.</p> <p>PTSD is a disorder of vivid memory. Sufferers do not merely remember their trauma; they re-experience it emotionally in the form of involuntary, distressing thoughts; nightmares about the trauma; and sudden sensory \u201cflashbacks\u201d of sights, sounds and odours that produce the illusion that it is happening once again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6565d6335a613feb609f79b52e92c397b213504\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6565d6335a613feb609f79b52e92c397b213504/0_10_406_507/400.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters in Scotland\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A psychological debriefing group consisting of firefighters or employees of a recently robbed bank was typical, although it was also used for individual survivors.\u2019 Firefighters in Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the mind does not operate like a video recorder, infallibly encoding our experiences, traumatic or otherwise. And recollection is not like a replay of one\u2019s experience. Rather, autobiographical recall entails reassembly of encoded elements of the event distributed throughout the brain.</p> <p>Terror during trauma focuses one\u2019s attention, strengthening memory for the most salient features of the experience, and occasionally at the expense of less salient ones as the phenomenon of \u201cweapon focus\u201d illustrates. Victims of armed robbery often encode and thus can recall details about the weapon, but sometimes fail to encode information such as the clothing worn by the assailant. Likewise, traumatised refugees seeking asylum who provide vivid accounts of an assault sometimes misremember the precise date that it took place. The upshot is that intense emotion at the time of an experience tends to produce robust memories of it. Hence, PTSD sufferers remember their trauma all too well.</p> <p>Understandably, people with PTSD tend to steer clear of reminders of their trauma as best as they can. Activities, places, people and thoughts associated with the experience are avoided as much as possible lest intrusive memories become triggered. Sufferers are hypervigilant for potential threats, startle easily and are often irritable. Their sleep is disturbed, and their ability to concentrate in everyday life becomes difficult. They often lose interest in previously enjoyed activities, become disconnected from other people, and feel as if their capacity to experience positive emotions has disappeared. Finally, they can develop problematic beliefs, such as losing the capacity to trust other people and believing the world is an unpredictably dangerous place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/29/self-harm-ptsd-and-mental-illness-soaring-among-young-women-in-england-survey\">Mental illness soars among young women in England \u2013 survey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Acute symptoms of PTSD are common in the days following a trauma. But these must persist for at least one month before PTSD becomes diagnosable. Short-term stress reactions can be normal responses to an abnormal stressor, but the persistence of symptoms long after the stressor has passed is the hallmark of PTSD. For example, the clinical psychologist Barbara Rothbaum and her associates <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490050309/abstract\" title=\"\">assessed 95 survivors of rape or attempted rape</a>. They found that 94% of them met symptomatic criteria for PTSD within the first two weeks following the assault. The rate dropped to 65% and then to 47% approximately one and three months, post-assault, respectively. About half recovered naturally, whereas the others failed to remit.</p> <p>Although exposure to one or more traumatic events is by definition essential for PTSD to develop, most people exposed to such events never develop the disorder. One representative survey of American adults conducted by the epidemiologists Naomi Breslau and Ronald Kessler found that 89.6% of the general population had experienced at least one traumatic stressor such as a serious accident, natural disaster, rape or the unexpected death of a loved one, yet only 9.2% developed PTSD. Such findings indicate that trauma is common, but PTSD is relatively rare, hence implying that risk and resilience variables influence the psychological impact of traumatic events.</p> <p>Yet for years the study of risk factors for PTSD was de facto taboo for many working in the field of traumatic stress studies. After the diagnosis <a href=\"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/PTSD-overview/ptsd-overview.asp\" title=\"\">first appeared in 1980 </a>in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-III, some warned that research on risk factors amounts to blaming victims for their plight. But identifying statistical predictors of PTSD among trauma survivors no more blames victims than identifying predictors of other psychological or medical conditions. Indeed, progress continues as researchers pinpoint risk and resilience variables. For example, having a personal or family history of anxiety or mood disorders increases risk of PTSD, whereas above-average cognitive ability and good social support decreases it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The evidence suggests many trauma survivors may prefer to rely on family, friends and clergy rather than counsellors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The recent NHS study underscores the urgency of taking steps to prevent PTSD, and to treat it effectively when it does develop. Primary prevention entails decreasing the frequency of events likely to trigger the disorder. Secondary prevention targets people who have recently experienced trauma.</p> <p>A once-popular approach called \u201cpsychological debriefing\u201d involved trained counsellors conducting a single session with trauma-exposed individuals shortly after their horrific experience. For example, a group consisting of firefighters or employees of a recently robbed bank was typical, although it was also used for individual survivors. The purpose was to prevent the emergence of chronic, post-traumatic reactions by having survivors describe aloud their thoughts and feelings during the trauma, reliving it while processing their emotions in the session.</p> <p>Although debriefed individuals expressed gratitude for the efforts of their counsellors, dissemination of the method was premature. Indeed, most randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that debriefed and non-debriefed trauma survivors did not differ in terms of symptoms at follow-up, whereas in other RCTs debriefing actually impeded natural recovery from trauma; non-debriefed survivors were doing better psychologically at follow-up than the debriefed ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3872af5e245b1030ee9550897cfd0b93cf068e97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3872af5e245b1030ee9550897cfd0b93cf068e97/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wood decoration at the charity Gardening Leave in Ayrshire, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veterans work in the gardens and greenhouses at the charity Gardening Leave in Ayrshire, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Taken together, this evidence suggests that many trauma survivors may prefer to rely on family, friends and clergy rather than professional counsellors. Having professional counsellors available is important, but compelling survivors to undergo psychological debriefing is not.</p> <p>The story of the rise and fall of psychological debriefing makes an essential point. We must not rely on clinical intuition alone when treating survivors of trauma. They deserve better. Furthermore, the methods we devise must undergo rigorous evaluation in RCTs. This is precisely what leading clinical researchers have been doing. There are effective cognitive-behavioural therapies developed and tested by clinicians, such as Edna Foa and Patricia Resick in the US, Metin Ba\u015fo\u011flu and Anke Ehlers in the UK, and Richard Bryant in Australia, among others.</p> <p>An important element of these evidence-based therapies is the gradual, systematic exposure to traumatic memories until their capacity to trigger distress diminishes. Although most PTSD patients benefit from these treatments, others terminate treatment prematurely or fail to recover. We need to continue to explore and evaluate new interventions to help those who continue to suffer.</p>",

  "<p>On 23 February, Donald Trump stood before a rally of cheering supporters to celebrate a thumping victory in the Nevada Republican caucus \u2013 his third consecutive win, in defiance of the naysayers who had predicted that his bubble was about to burst. \u201cIf you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win too much \u2013 and now we\u2019re winning, winning, winning the country,\u201d he bragged. \u201cWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.\u201d</p> <p>That last line provoked immediate waves of mockery. It sounded at the time like another one of Trump\u2019s many gaffes \u2013 he loves that people do not get a decent education? Yet behind the mockery was a real sense of disquiet, which has not gone away: Trump loves the less educated because they appear to love him back. As the Atlantic reported in March: \u201cThe best single predictor of Trump support in the Republican primary is the absence of a college degree.\u201d Education \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 seemed to be propelling the Trump bandwagon.</p> <p>The possibility that education has become a fundamental divide in democracy \u2013 with the educated on one side and the less educated on another \u2013 is an alarming prospect. It points to a deep alienation that cuts both ways. The less educated fear they are being governed by intellectual snobs who know nothing of their lives and experiences. The educated fear their fate may be decided by know-nothings who are ignorant of how the world really works. Bringing the two sides together is going to be very hard. The current election season appears to be doing the opposite.</p> <p>Trump continues to poll far ahead of Clinton among voters who did not go to college, while Clinton still leads by a considerable margin among college graduates. This is a significant change from 2012, when the picture was far more mixed. Four years ago, the college-educated vote was almost evenly split, with graduates favouring Obama over Romney by a narrow margin, 50 to 48. Recent polling puts Trump\u2019s lead over Clinton among <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/26/poll-trump-leads-clinton-76-percent-to-17-percent-among-white-men-without-college-degrees/\">white men without a college degree</a> at a sobering 76 to 19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/29/how-the-education-gap-is-tearing-politics-apart-podcast\">How the education gap is tearing politics apart \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there are other factors at play here. Race is one; gender is the other. The overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white, regardless of their education levels. However, white men with a college degree split much more evenly between the candidates, whereas white women without a college degree still strongly favour Trump. Less educated voters who support Trump are not necessarily poor: many earn more than $50,000 (\u00a339,000) a year. Trump scores particularly well among small business owners who did not go to college. These polling numbers \u2013 which are only indicative, since no one has actually voted yet \u2013 can be unpicked a hundred different ways. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that how people vote is increasingly being shaped by how long they spent at school.</p> <p>What is happening in the United States has also been happening in the UK. The Brexit campaign had its own Trumpian moment, courtesy of Michael Gove, who told Faisal Islam in an interview on Sky News on 3 June that \u201cthe British people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote\">had enough of experts</a>\u201d. Gove was also widely mocked \u2013 if not experts, who was he proposing to get to repair his car, fix his teeth, teach his kids?</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what he said struck a deep chord, because it contained a large element of truth. The experts Gove was deriding had been telling the British public that the risks of Brexit far outweighed any potential benefits. Gove insisted that the voters should decide this for themselves, on the basis of their own experiences, rather than listening to elite voices that had a vested interest in the outcome. Those voices came trailing educational qualifications, which had put them in their positions of authority \u2013 at the IMF, the Bank of England, the Treasury. Gove was asking voters lacking anything like the same educational qualifications to feel empowered to reject what they were being told. And in the referendum on 23 June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">that is what they did</a>.</p> <p>Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of remain. Meanwhile, among those who left school without any qualifications, the vote was almost exactly reversed: 73 to 27 for leave. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/people-who-felt-marginalised-drove-brexit-vote-study-finds\">report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> last month confirmed that \u201ceducational opportunity was the strongest driver\u201d of the Brexit vote. Again, there were plenty of other factors at work \u2013 including a significant generational divide. Older voters were far more likely to vote leave, which partly helps to explain the education gap, since the rapid expansion of higher education in recent decades means older voters are also much less likely to have attended university. But the Rowntree report concludes that educational experience was the biggest single determinant of how people voted. Class still matters. Age still matters. But education appears to matter more.</p> <p>A post-Brexit electoral map of Britain starkly illustrates this new divide. Scotland voted remain for its own particular reasons. But in England and Wales, many university towns emerged from the referendum as isolated outposts of pro-EU sentiment in a sea of Brexit. Newcastle, York, Nottingham, Norwich, Cambridge, Brighton, Warwick, Exeter, Bristol, Reading, Oxford and Cardiff all voted remain. I live in Cambridge, which voted remain by a margin of 74 to 26. There was consternation here following the result. It was accompanied by a barely suppressed feeling that ignorance had won the day. I lost count of the number of times I was told that one of the top trending searches on Google in the immediate aftermath of the vote was: \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d The implication was that we had been taken out of Europe by people who did not even know what it was they were being asked to decide about.</p> <p>Few felt comfortable, at least in public, following this thought through to its logical conclusion. Yet it was hard to escape the sense that a long buried suspicion of democracy was fighting its way back to the surface. If politics has turned into a contest between ignorance and knowledge, then places like Cambridge may be starting to feel dismayed by the realisation they are now on the losing side. But that would be to fall into an old trap.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Elite anxiety about the consequences of political ignorance is nothing new. In the long history of intellectuals worrying about democracy and its failings, two basic fears keep nagging away. The first is that democracy will mean rule by the poor, who will use their power to steal from the rich. The second is that democracy will mean rule by the ignorant, who will use their power to do the dumbest things. Both these worries go back at least as far as Plato. The ancient Greeks understood full well that democracy meant letting the have-nots get their claws into the haves. For Aristotle, that\u2019s what the word meant: it was rule by the poor (the <em>demos</em>) over the wealthy. But if class conflict came with the territory, the deeper fear was what the masses might do out of sheer foolishness.</p> <p>For Plato, democracy suffered from the basic defect of putting decision-making in the hands of people who were not competent to decide. Politics was a skill \u2013 and most people were simply clueless. Worse, that made them prey for hucksters and demagogues who would promise the earth and get away with it. Democracy was fertile ground for fantasists with a taste for power. If you tell the people that up is down, and the people believe you, then who is going to let them know that they are wrong?</p> <p>These fears have never really gone away, and they reassert themselves at times of political crisis. In the 1920s, the American political commentator Walter Lippmann updated Plato for the 20th century by arguing that modern citizens simply lacked the mental capacity to process the information needed for intelligent decision-making. Lippmann had worked in American propaganda during the first world war and had seen at first hand just how easy it was to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt is no longer possible,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto believe in the original dogma of democracy: that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart.\u201d People will vote on the basis of anything that grabs their attention in a passing moment, filtered by whatever deep prejudices they harbour beneath the surface. Evidence means little to the average voter; reasoned argument means even less. Lippmann concluded that democracy could only be rescued by establishing a cadre of specially trained experts, whose job was to steer politicians away from the dubious instincts of the people and back towards what the evidence required. Otherwise, the manipulation of public opinion would become the be all and end all of democracy, which is all the encouragement demagogues ever need.</p> <p>Lippmann\u2019s fears chimed with the growing worry of some prominent mid-20th century economists that too much democratic decision-making would lead to financial ruin. A series of future Nobel prize winners, from Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman, channelled the ancient critics of democracy by arguing that putting the voters in charge meant short-term impulses would prevail over long-term prudence. Ultimately, they thought, democracy produced inflation, which was just another way of the poor getting their own back on the rich. Hayek and Friedman both put their ultimate faith in the power of markets. But first, they felt experts had to be empowered to rein in the self-destructive impulses of the voters. Hayek at one point advocated restricting the franchise to those aged 45, in order to cut out the young, who don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, and the old, who have a vested interest in the past. Hayek did not believe that anyone, however expert, could know the future. But he wanted to put self-knowledge back at the heart of democracy: the worldly wisdom of understanding what is possible, and what is just wishful thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that ignorance is being set against knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lippmann, Hayek and Friedman insisted they were trying to save democracy, not destroy it. But what they thought democracy needed saving from was itself. The voters had to be rescued from their preference for fairytales and the people peddling them. In the late 20th century, partly under the influence of such thinkers, democratic politics did carve out spaces where experts could be better insulated from the impulsive decision-making of the masses, as independent central banks and other unelected bodies were entrusted with more and more decision-making capacity, away from the glare of public opinion. Now, in the 21st century, these are the experts who find that the voters no longer want to heed their advice.</p> <p>In the year of Trump and Brexit, it is tempting to think that democracy is reverting to type and that popular ignorance is once again being set against expert knowledge. Trump is what you get when demagoguery is allowed to run unchecked, egged on by a craven media that simply enjoys the show. Brexit is what you get if you ask people a question that they lack the basic information to answer. This is the view that has been doing the rounds in the circles in which the highly educated move. But to think this is a big mistake.<strong> </strong>The educational divide that is opening up in our politics is not really between knowledge and ignorance. It is a clash between one worldview and another.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>What is the EU?<strong> </strong>Hearing educated remainers mock those who asked that question the day after the vote was an uncomfortable experience \u2013 and not just because the story about Google searches was largely apocryphal. After all, the question is not as straightforward as it seems: it is simple enough to say what the letters refer to, but far more difficult to know what they really mean for our politics and our future. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is knowledge the same as knowing which way to vote. The split between the university towns and other parts of the country did not arise because one set of people understood what was truly at stake and the others were just taking a wild guess. Both sides were guessing.</p> <p>Even now, no one truly knows what is going to happen. The better-educated cleaved to one set of predictions because these chimed with what they already believed in. Polling carried out before the referendum, which asked people what they thought was likely to happen in the aftermath of a Brexit vote, found that university graduates thought that it would produce an immediate financial crash, whereas those with fewer qualifications thought it much more likely that things would carry on as before. Prior political preferences shape what we think the evidence shows, not the other way round.</p> <p>None of this would have surprised Lippmann. When he argued that ordinary voters were incapable of judging complex policy questions on their merits, he did not exclude the educated from that judgment. He meant everybody. As he wrote: \u201cI have not happened to meet anybody, from a president of the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the ideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\u201d He thought that we needed experts who were trained in eliminating their own biases \u2013 and whatever a regular university education does, it does not do that.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone astray in their moral and political thinking as often as anyone else,\u201d write the political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels in their new book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html\">Democracy for Realists</a>, echoing Lippmann. What the educated are better at is sounding like they know what they are talking about, because they have been trained in how to make an argument. \u201cWell-informed people are likely to have more elaborate and internally consistent worldviews than inattentive people, but that just reflects the fact that their rationalisations are better rehearsed.\u201d Education gives you the ability to tailor your arguments to suit your personal preferences, which is why it is a big asset on the job market. But it does little to help tailor your personal preferences to suit the best arguments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ce22140f4c0663b48956256603613171397104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian Design</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the current political climate, a lack of education is sometimes blamed for the spread of conspiracy theories, which run like wildfire through many populist movements. Trump\u2019s campaign, with its nods and winks to \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on\u201d, and its pre-emptive warnings about the vote being stolen, has been feeding and feeding off the appetite for conspiratorial thinking. Yet to blame this on the absence of education is just another version of the old fear of the credulity of the untutored masses: they will believe anything.</p> <p>The real story is more complicated. Polling conducted earlier this year by a research project in Cambridge shows that education does sometimes make a difference when it comes to conspiracy theories: the likelihood of someone thinking the moon landing was a hoax, or that the government is hiding the existence of aliens, does decline as you go higher up the education ladder. But when the theories concern politically divisive issues, then education has far less effect.</p> <p>Possessing a university degree does not alter the probability of someone believing that global warming is a hoax \u2013 that tracks prior political commitments, not superior knowledge. Nor are conspiracy theories confined to the right. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s support among Labour party members contains a high proportion of university graduates. Yet in a YouGov poll, 55% of Corbyn supporters agreed with the statement that intelligence services such as MI5 have been working to undermine Corbyn since he became leader. That figure compares with only 19% of the wider public who give credence to the same claim. People will believe what their political loyalties incline them to believe, regardless of how much education they have received.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that our political beliefs are simply a reflection of our narrow self-interest. It is true that we all have a tendency to favour the worldview that enhances our future prospects. The preference of university graduates for remaining in the EU echoes the benefits that EU membership gives them: the free movement of labour and easy access to European networks is better for those with the qualifications to take advantage of a knowledge economy. But it is not the case that the education divide is just another version of the class divide, with the winners from globalisation lined up against the losers.</p> <p>As with Trump supporters in the US, Brexit was not simply the cause of the disadvantaged and left behind. Many Brexiteers come from the affluent middle classes, particularly in the south of England, outside of the university towns. Meanwhile, universities are producing their fair share of losers these days, as students leave burdened with debt and confronted by a bleak job market. Yet these students \u2013 rich or poor, in work or out, elite or not \u2013 overwhelmingly favoured EU membership. Education does not simply divide us on the grounds of what is in our interests. It sorts us according to where we feel we belong.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Why does education do this?<strong> </strong>Political scientists have been aware of the growing education divide for decades. A report on the 1983 general election \u2013 whose authors included a young John Curtice, the current eminence grise of the UK polling business \u2013 noted that education levels were emerging as a significant indicator of voting patterns. The report put this down to the distinctive social attitudes that were picked up at university. \u201cEducational experience,\u201d it noted, \u201cis an important source of values distinct from class experience.\u201d These values often related to issues that were not straightforwardly economic.</p> <p>Graduates, even in the 1980s, tended to be much more concerned about the environment than other sectors of the population. They were also strikingly more internationalist in outlook. In 1983, 58% of graduates expressed a positive attitude to what was then known as the European Economic Community, whereas only 35% of those who left school at 16 felt the same. Not much has changed since. But at that time, the Labour party was still overtly hostile to the European project, and withdrawal from the EEC was part of its famously radical 1983 election manifesto. Many graduates reported having leftish attitudes on a whole host of other questions \u2013 from defence spending to women\u2019s rights. But on this issue their cosmopolitanism took precedence over their party loyalties. The result was that in the 1983 election more than twice as many university graduates voted for the centrist pro-European SDP-Liberal Alliance as voted for Labour.</p> <p>One reason this was not a bigger issue back then \u2013 and the Alliance did not manage to supplant Labour as the main party of opposition \u2013 was that there were not that many university graduates. Although participation had been steadily rising, in the mid-1980s fewer than one in five people had benefited from higher education. That was enough to make a difference, but not enough to tip the balance. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/24/students-higher-education-almost-50-per-cent\">2012, university participation among 18-30 year olds was close to 50%</a>, and it has only dipped recently because of rising tuition fees. That is enough to start splitting the population into two camps.</p> <p>But it is not simply a question of demographics. The gap has been amplified by certain forms of social mobility, which have reinforced the education divide by enabling the better-educated to start congregating together: socially, geographically, romantically. In a previous generation, graduates often married non-graduates, because their choices tended to be driven by where they happened to live or work. As the clich\u00e9 has it: bosses used to marry their secretaries. Not any more, and not just because there are fewer secretaries. If you went to university, ask yourself: how many of your friends didn\u2019t go to university? And among your friends, how many of those who did are married to people who didn\u2019t? Greater freedom of movement produces greater freedom of choice. But that does not produce more social diversity, it produces more social stratification.</p> <p>Social media now enhances these patterns. Friendship groups of like-minded individuals reinforce each other\u2019s worldviews. Facebook\u2019s news feed is designed to deliver information that users are more inclined to \u201clike\u201d. Much of the shock that followed the Brexit result in educated circles came from the fact that few people had been exposed to arguments that did not match their preferences. Education does not provide any protection against these social media effects. It reinforces them.</p> <p>The growing political divide between the educated and the less educated can be seen across Europe. It is most pronounced in Scandinavian countries, where university attendance is high and levels of education are an increasing driver of voting habits. It is less visible in southern and eastern Europe \u2013 in places such as Portugal and Poland \u2013 where participation in higher education is lower, and other social factors, including family and religion, still exert a strong grip.</p> <p>But Britain and the US are different again, because of their political systems. In European countries with proportional representation, smaller parties can offer a home to particular segments of the population, including those at both ends of the education scale. The support for many European parties of the populist right is heavily drawn from less educated voters. Meanwhile, green and liberal parties, especially those that favour immigration, rely strongly on university graduates for their support. That group includes the Liberal Democrats, which is still the UK-based party that attracts the highest proportion of graduates among its voters. But as the Lib Dems have discovered to their cost, with first-past-the-post that is not enough. Under a PR system, targeting the graduate vote can generate significant representation in parliament. Here, it can get you wiped out \u2013 especially if you make a promise to students not to raise their tuition fees and then fail to keep it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The education divide derives from values often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide is never going to supplant traditional left-right politics. There is not going to be a \u201cGraduate party\u201d taking on a party of \u201cSchool Leavers\u201d. Instead the divide cuts across left and right, which is why it is proving so disruptive to our politics right now. Big-tent political parties are struggling to hold their fractured coalitions of voters together. Polling still reveals some shared attitudes between university graduates and those without educational qualifications on economic issues, such as support for trade unions and mistrust of the free market. But the education divide derives from an alternative set of values, which is often characterised as the opposition between libertarians and authoritarians.</p> <p>Authoritarians are looking for order and control, libertarians want greater freedom and tolerance. Along with education levels, the strongest indicator of likely support for Brexit was shown by attitudes to capital punishment: the more you were in favour, the more you wanted to leave the EU. These attitudes tend to track educational experience. Labour\u2019s support is now split between left-leaning libertarians (broadly pro-union and anti-banks, but also pro-immigration, and often highly educated) and left-leaning authoritarians (also pro-union and anti-banks, but far tougher on immigration and very concerned about crime and community). Each grouping might gather upwards of 20% of the electorate under its wing. Together that would be enough for a parliamentary majority. But they do not fit together any more, and increasingly they neither like nor trust each other.</p> <p>The same forces are threatening to play havoc with electoral politics in the US. Trump\u2019s army of the less educated is on the march inside the Republican party, but that leaves plenty of traditional Republicans \u2013 including many college-educated ones \u2013 wondering where to go. Some Republicans will be voting for Clinton. Some traditional Democrats<strong> </strong>will be sorely tempted by Trump\u2019s deeply authoritarian message. It is true that American democracy has proved highly resilient in the past and the party system has adapted to many demographic and cultural shifts. However, it is also possible that the gap between the educated and the less educated is going to become more entrenched over time, because it is not just a question of economic interests. It represents a gulf in mutual understanding.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>The conflict between rich and poor<strong> </strong>still matters a great deal in our politics. But the age-old fear that democracy would end up letting the poor steal from the rich has always looked overblown. Constitutions \u2013 including the one carefully crafted by the American founders to guard against just that outcome \u2013 have done their bit to safeguard the interests of the propertied classes. So, too, have the increasingly complex institutional arrangements that give power to experts in areas \u2013 defence, finance, environment, health \u2013 where technical knowledge is assumed to be required. Representative democracy has proved effective at staving off class war. It has done it by finding electoral outlets for popular dissatisfaction \u2013 as with the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, of Attlee in 1945, or of Obama in 2008 \u2013 that never quite let the people take charge. When inequality gets out of hand, the system does what it can to correct for it. But it is designed to avoid extreme solutions driven by popular anger. That still holds. The haves do not look in danger of being expropriated by the have-nots any time soon.</p> <p>The contest between the educated and the less educated is different. Many of the safeguards that have been put in place to bypass popular politics \u2013 above all, the authority that now resides in central banks \u2013 have had the effect of empowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite. These are not just the bankers, but the lawyers, the doctors, the civil servants, the technicians, the pundits, the academics. Not all of the educated are winners in this world, but almost all of the winners are educated. It gives the impression that knowledge has become a proxy for influence.</p> <p>When Gove suggested that the experts should not be trusted because they have a vested interest in what they are saying, that was his point: once knowledge becomes a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself. It appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it. At that point it ceases to be knowledge and simply becomes another mark of privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of superiority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The education divide has the potential to break apart the careful ties that hold representative democracy together. Regardless of our different interests, we elect representatives to take decisions on our behalf on the understanding that we share certain basic values, including a respect for knowledge, wherever it comes from. Once knowledge is assumed to be just another one of the perks of power, then the basis to trust others to take decisions for us becomes eroded. Asserting the facts and asserting your privilege grow increasingly difficult to distinguish.</p> <p>Educated v less educated may be even more toxic than rich v poor, because it comes laden with assumptions of moral superiority. These days the rich find it quite hard to get away with the presumption that their wealth is proof of their virtue. When they seek protection from the system, it is pretty clear what they are up to: they are looking after their interests. But when the educated look out for themselves they can dress it up as something ostensibly better than that: expertise.</p> <p>To those on the receiving end, that stinks. It stinks of hypocrisy, and it also stinks of self-interest. The fact that the educated are not always the beneficiaries of the social attitudes that they hold \u2013 Corbyn\u2019s supporters, like Bernie Sanders\u2019s, would rightly insist that many of the positions they adopt are designed for the benefit the socially excluded \u2013 does not help. It just makes them sound even more self-righteous.</p> <p>In the run-up to the EU referendum Jeremy Cliffe of the Economist \u2013 the house journal of the educated expert \u2013 suggested that although Brexit might win this time, it was possible the UK would vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum 20 years from now, by which point current levels of university education would have spread to later age groups. Twenty years is a very long time in politics. Before then, the gap between the educated and the less educated has the potential to widen, as each side digs in. The viciousness of public debate, as bad as it is now, could still get worse. Because two-party politics does not map on to this division, mainstream politicians will have to find creative ways to try to harness it. These carry the risks of making it worse.</p> <p>The EU referendum was seen by educated optimists \u2013 including some of the people around David Cameron \u2013 as just another way for democracy to let off steam: a means of giving vent to anger without letting it run out of control. That is what the optimists have been saying about Trump too. But the steam is still rising.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Once you have seen Theresa May tell a hall full of Conservative conference delegates that she will lead them out of the European Union, it is very hard to imagine how David Cameron could ever have stood before the same people to say the opposite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/tory-ukip-meeting-theresa-may-brexit-vote-immigration\">All this Tory delirium \u2013 it\u2019s like stumbling into a Ukip meeting | Ian Birrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ripples of ecstasy washed across the Birmingham Symphony Hall as the prime minister affirmed her commitment to Brexit. It doesn\u2019t matter that May backed the losing side in the referendum. It might even have helped, because she now compensates with born-again zeal. There is more rejoicing in the kingdom of Euroscepticism at one remainer who repenteth than over 99 righteous leavers who have no need of repentance.</p> <p>Nor does it matter that the measures announced by May as proof of intent \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/article-50-timescale-theresa-may-brexit\">activation of article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty by March 2017; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">\u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d</a> to disentangle European and UK laws \u2013 are less exciting than she made them sound. Both are practical requirements of the process; neither tells us anything about the outcome. The prime minister lit them up as beacons, rallying the troops for a liberation crusade.</p> <p>All that May has to offer is symbols, but symbols are a more powerful currency with true believers than is ever understood by agnostics. Likewise, the prime minister\u2019s repeated assertion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/01/no-10-brexit-means-brexit-tory-peer-lady-wheatcroft-lords-delay\">\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d</a> has attracted more ridicule than it deserves. (May has now added a second line to the mantra: \u201cIt means we are going to leave the European Union.\u201d) To the cynical ear this is vacuity dressed in tautology. But that objection presumes that slogans are meant to transmit information. Often their function is performative \u2013 a signal of belonging to the tribe. There is a liturgical quality to May\u2019s Brexit creed. You can imagine it as a call-and-response prayer, with the congregation supplying the new follow-up verse.</p> <p>It is the quasi-religious mood in Birmingham that makes Cameron\u2019s reign feel so remote. For years, the balance of Tory grassroots opinion was hostile to the power they called Europe. The demand for rupture was voiced by a small minority, but more would have joined in had they believed it was possible and available. Now they are told it is both, by a leader who \u2013 crucially \u2013 has far better credentials as an orthodox Tory than her predecessor. May, the provincial vicar\u2019s daughter, has done her time tramping the streets, stuffing envelopes, working the local Conservative association circuit. Her conversion is not mistrusted as some tactical ruse but celebrated as the completion of a journey on behalf of the whole party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/theresa-may-tory-conservative-party-direction\">Theresa May: a Tory saviour who offers no sense of hope | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is nothing less than a reformation in the Church of Conservatism, with the authority of Brussels cast as a modern-day Rome. Cameron tried to manage the old schism but the suspicion lingered that his loyalties were divided; that he read from a vernacular Tory bible at home and then jumped on the Eurostar to kiss the papal commission\u2019s ring. Now Theresa May stands before her party like Elizabeth I: a true, Protestant queen, their own Gloriana.</p> <p>By temperament, the new prime minister is not a fanatic, and the obligation to staff a government with recruits from across the Tory spectrum precludes a purge of heretics. Like Elizabeth, May comes to power with no desire to make \u201cwindows into men\u2019s souls\u201d. If ministers want to practise a bit of Europhilia at home, that is their business, but they should not go confessing it in public.</p> <p>It is striking how quickly this new regime has taken hold. Even quite ardent Tory pro-Europeans are suppressing private fears of an imminent economic blunder for the sake of party loyalty and ambition. Only a handful of backbenchers publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/hard-brexit-eu-trade-deal\">sound the alarm</a> about Downing Street\u2019s apparent willingness to abandon membership of the European single market. They are dismissed by colleagues \u2013 including former remainers \u2013 as rogue elements weirdly bent on career suicide.</p> <p>Misgivings about May\u2019s European position are transmitted mostly in code. Some moderates look to the Treasury for hope, seeing in Philip Hammond\u2019s warnings about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-pledges-economic-pragmatism-during-brexit-process\">Brexit-related \u201cturbulence\u201d</a> a discreet genuflexion to the old religion. Downing Street, meanwhile, eyes George Osborne warily as a dangerous grey cardinal, banished from court but maintaining his old network of allies and spies.</p> <p>Then there are the Brexit ultras to May\u2019s right, the caucus of hardliners who keep pulling their party towards the most austere professions of anti-Europeanism. They play the role of what the historian J E Neale dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan_choir\">the puritan choir</a>\u201d in Elizabeth\u2019s parliament, urging an extirpation of every last residue of papish corruption from the body politic.</p> <p>Finally there are the self-styled buccaneers of the free-trade seas. Boris Johnson would probably cast himself as Sir Walter Raleigh \u2013 polymath, wordsmith, adventurer. That leaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/30/globalisation-poverty-corruption-free-trade-liam-fox\">Liam Fox</a> to play Sir Francis Drake, looking for domestic glory in global circumnavigation but seen from abroad as a pirate.</p> <p>This is all myth and fantasy, of course. But parties have always been sustained by internal mythologies, and the task of exiting the EU is so complicated and fraught with danger that fantasy becomes a necessary comfort. As one former minister says of the puritan choristers: \u201cThey have spent their lives working towards this dream. Of course they don\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Tory pro-Europeans are in the impossible position of using rational argument against faith. If they counsel compromise on migration or the single market, they are accused of talking Britain down or trying to refight the referendum. They have few reinforcements across the political water. Labour is a shambles. The Lib Dems are puny in parliament. Scotland has its own distinct politics, and in Nicola Sturgeon its own remainian queen with her own independence agenda.</p> <p>The Tories do not speak for all of England, but in the absence of credible opposition they feel as if they do, and will act accordingly. To those millions who did not vote to leave the EU, the message is clear: you are free to pray for whatever you like. Your antique rites will be tolerated. But do not expect your concerns to be represented in the court of Queen Theresa. Be humble instead. Swallow your doubts and take a pew in the reformed national church of Brexit.</p> <ul> <li>You can comment on this article and others on our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/your-opinions-brexit-relish-southern-rail-chaos-and-the-decline-of-democracy\">Your Opinions thread here</a>.</li> </ul>",

He was pressed on this support in an interview with O\u2019Reilly, who himself called the operation \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-immigration-deportation-215783\">really brutal</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well, I\u2019ve heard it both ways. I\u2019ve heard good reports, I\u2019ve heard bad reports,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host. \u201cWe would do it in a very humane way.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has given mixed messages since his<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/\"> early calls</a> for mass deportation, and he has used the phrase <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/trump-vows-to-deport-11-million-people-564859459935\">\u201cdeportation force\u201d</a>. In August of this year, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/donald-trump-immigration-policy-deportation\">appeared to have doubts, </a>until finally promising<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\"> \u201cno amnesty\u201d and a \u201chumane\u201d removal </a>of migrants.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: the nuclear deal with Iran has prevented Tehran from developing weapons</strong></p> <p>The nuclear deal with Iran was finalized in July 2015, three years after the end of Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state, and it does not completely remove Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It removes a reserve of medium-enriched uranium, cuts into its low-enriched uranium, and allows access to international inspectors.</p> <p>Kaine also appears to exaggerate how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal.html\">two to three months</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html\">away from bomb capabilities</a>. The terms of the deal extend that \u201cbreakout\u201d ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Pence: the US doesn\u2019t know who Syrian refugees are and should block them</strong></p> <p>The government has a fairly clear idea about how many people are in the US without legal authorization. Using data from the Census, Department of Homeland Security, Office of Refugee Resettlement and surveys and analysis from Mexico and Latin American countries, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics-publications\">the DHS</a> and nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/\">Pew Research</a> have each been able to estimate the number, and arrived at similar figures in recent years: around 11.3 to 11.5 million people. The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most \u2013 not 20 million as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the last 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></p> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana. Pence tried to deny 174 refugees resettlement aid, and the case was taken to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor of Indiana believes, though without evidence, that some of these persons were sent to Syria by ISIS to engage in terrorism and now wish to infiltrate the United States in order to commit terrorist acts here.

On 16 June 2015, when he announced his candidacy, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is patently false, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/donald-trump-fact-check-immigration-inner-cities\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration\">fellow</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/\">fact-checkers</a> have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/\">repeatedly</a> shown, since most migrants leave their homes for work or family and the Mexican government has nothing to do with their emigration.

This group, she said, included \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic\u201d people. She later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">regretted</a> the generalization of \u201chalf\u201d.</p> <p>Polling suggests that Trump\u2019s supporters are <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21706341-political-science-refashions-itself-deal-republican-nominee-trump-and\">more likely</a> than other voters to express <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-race-idUSKCN0ZE2SW\">negative sentiments </a>about minorities. Polls also show lower but significant such sentiment among supporters of Clinton. Her generalization pointed to real racial animus, ignored it among her own supporters and showed how difficult it is to attach a number to racism, even while <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">separate polling</a> shows <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/\">racism</a> is <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">affecting millions</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/29/roughly-half-of-hispanics-have-experienced-discrimination/\">widespread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">systemic ways</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s complaint contradicts his own past remarks.

  "<h2><strong>Mike Pence: \u2018Norwood University\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In his opening statement, Pence misstated the name of the university hosting the debate. It is Longwood University, not Norwood.</p> <h2><strong>He also said that Barack Obama has raised more taxes to extraordinary levels</strong></h2> <p>This isn\u2019t quite right. There were two major changes to the tax code in Obama\u2019s two terms: the 2012 expiration of tax cuts created by George W Bush (with extensions for people making less than $400,000 a year), and levies to fund the Affordable Care Act (including a penalty for not having health insurance, a 10% tax on tanning services and a 3.8% tax on investment income for top earners).</p> <p>Obama also enacted temporary cuts meant to spur investment and help Americans in the depths of the financial crisis, but all in all tax rates for most Americans have not changed much since Bush\u2019s presidency, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">report</a> by the nonpartisan congressional budget office. Under Bush, the top tax rate was 35%; under Obama, the wealthiest Americans pay 39.5%.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Obama administration has \u2018stifled the economy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Obama took office in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, and the economy has crawled back into recovery over his two terms, with employment nearly down to pre-crisis levels. It\u2019s arguable that his policies have restricted some growth, but the economy has held to a steadily upward track.</p> <p>This summer the OECD gave its <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/United-States-2016-overview.pdf\">stamp</a> of approval to the US economy, saying in a report: \u201cthe US economy has rebounded: output has surpassed its pre-crisis peak by 10%, robust private-sector employment gains have sharply reduced unemployment, fiscal sustainability has been largely restored and corporate profits are high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections-live\">Vice-presidential debate live: Mike Pence and Tim Kaine face off</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations while she was secretary of state \u2026 She kept that pay-to-play process in\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Pence is correct that the foundation took donations from foreign governments, and that the charity did not disclose every contribution \u2013 in violation of an agreement to identify donors that it made with the Obama administration.

Since Obama took office in January 2009 the US has created <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001\">10.8m private-sector jobs</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kaine is counting back from the depths of the economic recession, in early 2010, which would erase a full year off of Obama\u2019s presidency.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: \u2018The debt explosion on the Trump side is much much bigger than anything on the Clinton side\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct, according to conservative and nonpartisan thinktanks alike. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/TaxFoundation-FF496.pdf\">according to the </a><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">Committee for a Responsible Budget</a>, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">add $1.1tn in revenue</a> in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/26/donald-trump-would-boost-debt-more-than-hillary-clinton-report-says/\">$5.3tn to the debt</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: even Richard Nixon released his taxes</strong></h2> <p>Richard Nixon did not release his tax returns while running for president in 1960 or in 1968 \u2013 he released them in 1973, after his second term began. In 1968 Nixon only gave a limited glimpse of his to a magazine writer and only released the returns under pressure from the Watergate inquiry. He released the returns despite an audit by the IRS, which Trump has repeatedly claimed is his reason for not releasing returns.</p> <p>You can look at Nixon\u2019s returns at the <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">Presidential Tax History Project</a>.

Pence, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/capital-living/meet-the-lawmaker/20999-house-conservatives-oppose-add-ons\">supported</a> a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/15/news/economy/trump-pence-social-security/\">2005 plan</a> that would have modified the program into a private system.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018He\u2019s created a business that\u2019s worth billions of dollars\u2019</strong></h2> <p>There is no direct evidence that Trump\u2019s business is worth billions of dollars \u2013 the only tax return publicly available, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">published by the New York Times</a> last weekend, shows that he reported a $916m loss in 1995. Trump could prove the worth of his business by publishing his returns.

On 26 July, when Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMK8Iv7tiE\">asked him</a> where he would set a federal minimum wage, he repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/federal-minimum-wage-trump\">a stance from May</a> that the US does not need one: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p> <p>He then immediately changed his position: \u201cWell, I would leave it, and raise it somewhat.\u201d A day later in Florida he said he wanted a $10 an hour minimum wage, up from the current level of $7.25, and confirmed to a reporter: \u201cfederal\u201d. He has most consistently said that states should decide a minimum wage.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine notes, correctly, that black people are more likely than white people to be arrested and given long sentences.</strong> </h2> <p>They are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men\">more likely to be shot by police</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: Clinton and Kaine support \u2018open borders\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Neither ticket supports \u201copen borders\u201d, which the US does not have. Pence appears to be using the word to denigrate Barack Obama\u2019s support for immigration reform and protection for some undocumented people from deportation. But Obama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/21/latino-immigrants-us-war-on-terror-study\">deported a record more than 2.5 million people since he took office</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\">a record 438,421 people in 2013</a>, and increased border patrol staff to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/publications/performance-accountability-financial\">a record 21,444 agents in 2011</a>; his policy could not reasonably be described as \u201camnesty\u201d or \u201copen borders\u201d.</p> <p>Clinton supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay backtaxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports the deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: Trump has \u2018called Mexicans rapists and criminals \u2026 He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified \u2026 He said African Americans are living in hell\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is right that Trump has broadly characterized immigrants in derogatory terms, but Trump also almost always gives himself a way out. On 16 June 2015, when he announced his candidacy, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is patently false, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/donald-trump-fact-check-immigration-inner-cities\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration\">fellow</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/\">fact-checkers</a> have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/\">repeatedly</a> shown, since most migrants leave their homes for work or family and the Mexican government has nothing to do with their emigration.

The margin of error for these figures is generally around a million people at most, not 20 million people as Trump says.</p> <p>Pew and the DHS both try to account for deaths, under-counted groups, arrivals and departures, and have adjusted their calculations based on decades\u2019 worth of research. Both have found that net migration has stabilized in recent years, and that <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">more undocumented Mexicans are leaving</a> the US than entering it. In other words, recent net migration into the US has hovered near its lowest levels of the past 20 years.</p> <h2><strong>Kaine: blocking Syrian refugees is unconstitutional</strong></h2> <p>On Monday, the seventh circuit court of appeals accused Pence of baseless \u201cnightmare speculation\u201d and compared the governor\u2019s attempt to block refugees to an attempt to exclude black people from his state, Indiana.

Russia invaded Ukraine in the wake of the country\u2019s 2014 revolution, which ousted a pro-Kremlin president who had reneged on a pledge to join an economic pact with the EU.</p> <p>There is an argument, vaguely, that a lack of American or Nato forces in eastern Europe may have encouraged Russia\u2019s actions, but this is speculative at best. Ukraine is not a member of Nato, the history of Crimea and Russia goes back centuries, and the continued war in eastern Ukraine is being fueled by both the Kremlin and local forces.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: the Associated Press found that more than half of Clinton\u2019s meetings as secretary of state were with donors to the Clinton Foundation</strong></h2> <p>The AP story on Clinton\u2019s meetings <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/09/ap-deletes-clinton-foundation-tweet-227917\">did not include her meetings with people in the US government and from foreign governments</a> \u2013 who were by a huge margin the people she met with while serving as the top diplomat of the United States.</p> <p>The news agency deleted a tweet about the story \u2013 virtually verbatim to what Pence said \u2013 for lack of context, and the Associated Press\u2019s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski wrote <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/announcements/statement-on-why-ap-deletes-clinton-tweet?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">a blog post about the decision</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Pence: \u2018Trump and I would just never support legislation that would punish a woman for making the heartbreaking decision to terminate a pregnancy\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Kaine is correct that Trump suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">women should be punished for having abortions</a> \u2013 he then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-women-abortions-punishment\">recanted the idea</a> at the end of a day of flip-flopping positions.

His request to see Wong, who is still currently in custody, has also been declined,\u201d the Demosist\u014d post said.</p> <p>\u201cDemosist\u014d strongly condemns the Thai government for unreasonably limiting Wong\u2019s freedom and right to entry, and requests the immediate release of Wong. </p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, we request the Hong Kong immigration department\u2019s assistance in assuring Wong\u2019s safety.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Wong will return to Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon local time.

The ministry was looking into why Wong had not been allowed into Thailand, adding that the decision involved \u201cvarious factors\u201d.</p> <p>Prominent members of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement accused Beijing of being behind Wong\u2019s deportation. </p> <p>Agnes Chow, the deputy secretary general of Demosist\u014d, said: \u201cWe believe that the Chinese government is using all ways to stop us spreading democratic ideas from Hong Kong to other countries. But bigger suppression makes a stronger fight. </p> <p>\u201cWe just hope that Joshua is safe,\u201d the 19-year-old activist added. \u201cWe will not give up the fight for democracy and the fight against the Chinese government which disrespects human rights.\u201d <br></p> <p>Nathan Law, Demosist\u014d\u2019s president, <a href=\"http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1288801-20161005.htm\">told Hong Kong radio</a> he believed there was \u201csome connection\u201d between Wong\u2019s detention and Beijing. <br></p> <p>Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong\u2019s justice secretary, was due to visit Thailand on Wednesday, Law said, adding that he hoped he would raise Wong\u2019s case \u201cin defence of Hong Kong citizens\u2019 basic human rights abroad\u201d. </p> <p>Wong, 19, was due to address students at Chulalongkorn University at an event to mark the 40th anniversary of a massacre of pro-democracy students by security forces and royalist militias in 1976. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1976/oct/07/fromthearchive\">The Thammasat massacre of 6 October 6 1976</a>, remains a deeply sensitive issue in Thailand\u2019s turbulent recent history, and was the prelude to a military coup.</p> <p>He was expected to talk about his experiences during the 79-day umbrella movement protests in Hong Kong in 2014.</p> <p>Jason Ng, a Hong Kong-based writer who knows Wong, said that before leaving Hong Kong the student activist had voiced concerns that he might not be allowed to enter Thailand.</p> <p> The suspected abduction of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai last year by Chinese agents had also left Wong nervous about potential risks to his well-being. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe was\u2026 most concerned about his personal safety, being abducted or attacked. Being turned back is one thing, getting hurt or disappearing is another,\u201d said Ng, the author of a book on Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement protests.</p> <p>To guard against such threats, ahead of Wong\u2019s trip to Thailand supporters set up an encrypted group on the messaging service WhatsApp through which the activist could notify Bangkok-based academics and journalists of any problems. </p> <p>Wong\u2019s detention appeared to be the latest example of the closer ties between Thailand\u2019s military regime and China\u2019s Communist rulers, who consider the student activist a subversive.</p> <p>Since the 2014 coup in Thailand, a series of incidents have underlined Beijing\u2019s influence in the south-east Asian country.</p> <p>In October last year a Hong Kong publisher who specialised in salacious books about the Communist party elite<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\"> vanished from his seafront apartment</a> in the Thai resort town Pattaya, only to reappear in custody in mainland China where he is now being held.</p> <p>At around the same time, a Chinese journalist and campaigner called Li Xin fled China, hoping to claim political asylum in Thailand. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/activist-li-xin-vanished-in-thailand--held-in-china-says-wife\">he disappeared while traveling from Thailand to Laos</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI warned him to be very careful in Thailand. It is very dangerous here,\u201d one Chinese exile living in Bangkok said at the time.</p> <p>A number of other Chinese dissidents and members of the Uighur ethnic minority from western China have also been deported back to China at the request of its government.</p> <p>Netiwit, who said he waited at the airport until 3am after Wong\u2019s Emirates Airline flight landed at 11:45pm, said his treatment amounted to \u201ccensorship\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cActually Joshua Wong was just in Taipei, Taiwan, and he was able to travel there and stayed there for two-to-three days,\u201d he told the <a href=\"http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/10/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-bkk-whereabouts-unknown/\">Khaosod news website</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThailand should stay out of the Chinese sphere of power, but we\u2019re not able to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThailand\u2019s arrest of Joshua Wong, a well-known pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, sadly suggests that Bangkok is willing to do Beijing\u2019s bidding. Wong should be freed immediately and allowed to travel and exercise his right to free expression.\u201d</p>"
