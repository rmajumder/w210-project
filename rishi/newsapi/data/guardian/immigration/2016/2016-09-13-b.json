His use of the crossed wrists \u2013 used by anti-government protesters as a sign of peaceful resistance, and meant to symbolise being handcuffed by security forces \u2013 had been planned long before the race.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up witnessing the suffering of my people and this was not new to me,\u201d explained the son of farmers raised in a rural community. \u201cBut we have not seen what we are seeing now, with young children and pregnant women and elderly people being killed. The thing has got worse in the past nine months.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as the Ethiopian athletic federation selected me to go to Rio, I decided that I needed to train hard and I knew the people were dying but no one was seeing or hearing their suffering.

Lilesa\u2019s gesture made headlines around the world and focused rare attention on human rights in Ethiopia, a US ally that hosted Barack Obama last year. But he knew there would be a heavy personal price to pay. Recalling the reaction of his compatriots in the Olympic village, he said: \u201cThe athletes cried. They sent me off with tears. I am not normally the kind of person who cries but they actually made me cry.</p> <p>\u201cThe federation officials knew they would get in trouble if they spoke with me but they gave me certain signs and gestures. They presumably had concerns for their safety.\u201d</p> <p>Lilesa stayed in a Rio hotel and expressed gratitude to the Brazilian authorities for guaranteeing his safety. He considered moving to Kenya but feared that it might deport him to Ethiopia. Instead, the US embassy in Brazil helped him secure a visa valid until January and he is likely to live in New Mexico or Arizona while he considers his options.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m an athlete. I run long distances. Running has allowed me to travel. Beyond that it has allowed me to be the voice of my people. Running is life for me. It is also how I make a living so I look forward to continuing to race and pursue my dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Lilesa insists he has no regrets, however. \u201cI would have regretted it if I did not make my stand and show my protest because, when I was in Rio, there was a prison fire in Addis Ababa. People were burned to death including my close friend, Kebede Fayissa.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/-sp-ethiopia-30-years-famine-human-rights\">Ethiopia, 30 years after the famine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ethiopia\u2019s authoritarian government has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/-sp-ethiopia-30-years-famine-human-rights\">accused of human rights abuses</a>. Oromos, the biggest ethnic group in the country, make up an estimated 40% of the population but few hold positions of power. As the government intensified the sale of Oromo land to foreign investors, protests began last November and gathered momentum. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/dozens-shot-dead-in-anti-government-protests-across-ethiopia-says-opposition\">A security crackdown has seen hundreds killed and thousands arrested.</a></p> <p>Lilesa, whose brother-in-law was arrested at demonstration nearly eight months ago, told reporters: \u201cThe Ethiopian government is killing, imprisoning and oppressing its own people. The situation in Oromia, Amhara and Gambella region is deeply concerning at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an Oromo, I grew up in Oromia, so I understand the suffering of my people very well. So far the government has opened fire on peaceful protesters who are asking for their rights and more than 1,000 people have been killed. Others have been forced into exile and been slaughtered in the deserts of Libya. Many more have become food for fish in the Mediterranean sea.\u201d</p> <p>The athlete warned: \u201cIf this situation continues as it is, I have no doubt Ethiopia is staring into the abyss. You are going to see a great tragedy unless the international community intervenes and helps bring about change in that country.</p> <p>\u201cI am personally very fearful this is going to take an ethnic dimension. You are going to see a Rwanda-like scenario where ethnic groups turn on each other. It is important the international community understands the gravity of the situation and intervenes so we don\u2019t have to go there.\u201d</p> <p>He urged Americans to lobby their government to pressure Ethiopia to respect international law. Last week, the US said it had raised \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the excessive use of force against protesters in Ethiopia and called for an independent investigation.</p> <p>Lilesa said: \u201cIf there is a regime change in Ethiopia and the people\u2019s demands are answered and there is an opening, I will be going home the next day. It is only a matter of time before the power of the gun will turn to the regime itself.\u201d</p>",

Syria is an illustration. It is intense, brutal and has been ongoing for six years. If there isn\u2019t a dramatic change then people will flee, children will flee and families will be separated as they seize any opportunity for a better life.\u201d</p> <p>World leaders are due to meet in New York on 19 September for a high-level summit on refugees and migrants.

The real tragedy is that children have been suffering because of conflicts not of their making, and that this is not new. There are children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/27/life-dadaab-three-generations-of-refugees-isolated-from-kenyan-society\">born into refugee camps in northern Kenya</a> who are second- and third-generation Somali refugees.

  "<p>Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, has said there is no reason for businesses in Britain to be uncertain as a result of the EU referendum and that they would be mad to withhold investment on the back of the vote.</p> <p>Speaking as his company, Dyson, unveiled a \u00a3250m expansion of its research and development centre in the Cotswolds, the engineer said Britain could now reach trade agreements with countries outside Europe \u201cmuch more easily and flexibly\u201d and reconsider its approach to immigration from around the world so it can attract more engineers and scientists from India, China and the far east.</p> <p>Dyson was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/11/sir-james-dyson-dismisses-brexit-trade-fears-as-cobblers\">one of the most prominent business leaders to publicly support Brexit before the referendum in June</a>. His company has developed from a firm specialising in bagless vacuum cleaners into a fast-growing multinational technology company selling bladeless fans, air purifiers, hand-dryers, hairdryers and robotic vacuum cleaners.<br></p> <p>In the past four years the company\u2019s sales have doubled. Dyson reported revenues of \u00a31.7bn in 2015, up 26% year on year, with profits of \u00a3448m. It is investing \u00a35m a week in research and development.</p> <p>Dyson said he could not understand why businesses would stop investing because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">prospect of import duties being introduced on trade between the UK and Europe.</a></p> <p>Asked whether the economic uncertainty in the UK could hold Dyson back from investing, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be arrogant about this, but I don\u2019t understand why people are uncertain. I think it is something put around. If you are a business, do you actually say, \u2018I am not going to make a decision to invest in that factory or I am not going to make a decision to set up in Europe because of this potential 3% [tax].\u2019 As a business, are you actually stopping and not investing because of that? If you were, you would be mad because currency can move 10% in a couple of days. A 3% import duty is not something to worry about. </p> <p>\u201cIt is highly unlikely it will come in anyway. The imbalance of trade is \u00a3100bn a year. Are you seriously saying that Germany wants to be putting an import duty on British goods going into Germany when we can punish them much greater on their goods?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c947e4c1e284d16b6f23d355eb11195bd70f8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c947e4c1e284d16b6f23d355eb11195bd70f8ee/0_245_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe trend is towards free trade. The failure of Europe to negotiate a free trade agreement with America, the TTIP, is really worrying. That is uncertainty. If you are waiting for Europe to negotiate free trade agreements China, North America and so on, that is a far greater uncertainty then whether or not you pay 3% to go into Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Dyson\u2019s latest investment involves the opening of a new research building at its campus in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The building, nicknamed D9, will house up to 450 engineers working on top-secret projects. These projects involve work on robotics and battery technology, two key new areas for the company. There are now 2,500 people working at the site out of 7,000 Dyson employees globally.</p> <p>Europe accounts for around 16% of Dyson sales and is still an \u201cattractive\u201d market for the company, its founder and chairman said. However, the business is growing faster in China, South Korea and Japan and Dyson said that Europe was not a single market for his company anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a single market as far as we are concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different plugs, different languages, different boxes, different instructions, different laws, different national characteristics, different psychology, different marketing and different companies.\u201d</p> <p>Dyson insisted that leaving the EU is positive for the UK despite warnings of a slow down in the economy. \u201cIt is a positive because we can now negotiate trade agreements with countries much more easily and flexibly on our own then we ever could with 29 countries in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those problems, we are on our own, we can negotiated a very rapid trade agreement with other countries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e5ff0df234618689806025be00fea4bcc85186c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e5ff0df234618689806025be00fea4bcc85186c/0_778_5576_3346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dyson\u2019s HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson\u2019s HQ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WilkinsonEyre &amp; Dyson Research Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 69-year-old also said it was opportunity for Britain to address a shortage of engineers in the country by making its immigration system global.</p> <p>Dyson said: \u201cIt has been very much a Europe-focused immigration system, not a global immigration system. A lot of people who want to be engineers come from India, China, and the far east. In Pune [India] there are 40,000 engineers that come out of Pune University every year, which is twice as many as the British [engineers] that come out of the whole of British universities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the scale. China produces something like 2 million engineers a year, we produce 20,000. We are just not going to compete globally unless we seriously ramp up the number of people.\u201d</p> <p>The entrepreneur played down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/fat-and-lazy-britain-is-ill-prepared-to-secure-future-outside-eu-says-fox\">criticism from Liam Fox, the international trade secretary</a>, that business executives would rather be playing golf on a Friday afternoon than negotiating export deals.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think many businesses survive nowadays if you spend your time playing golf,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have been saying is that to compete globally and to export now it is a technology race. If companies aren\u2019t developing technology and this country doesn\u2019t produce enough engineers to take advantage of all the wonderful universities and commercialise their technology we will lag behind economically and be outstripped by our competitors all over the world.\u201d</p> <h2>An experimental approach</h2> <p>Dyson has become the UK\u2019s nearest equivalent to Apple. It develops cutting-edge technology, is renowned for sleek design and has even opened its own shop on Oxford Street in London.</p> <p>The new \u00a3250m extension at its 56-acre campus in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, which is unveiled today, could even help Dyson take on Apple directly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/11/dysons-electric-car-development-could-become-the-next-tesla\">Government documents revealed earlier this year Dyson is working on a battery-powered electric vehicle</a>, although the company refuses to confirm the project. Apple is also rumoured to be working on an electric car.</p> <p>Founded in 1993, Dyson is a young company in more ways than one. The average age of its staff is just 26, a deliberate attempt by founder and chairman Sir James Dyson to try to keep the company on its toes. Dyson\u2019s headquarters is designed to feel like a university campus and even has a sports centre nicknamed \u201cthe hangar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to sound wrong , but we don\u2019t like experience,\u201d he explains in a rare interview at Dyson\u2019s headquarters. \u201cExperience can be inhibiting. I would rather have a naive, flexible, experimental, pioneering approach, because we want to do everything differently. It is a lot easier if people don\u2019t come along \u2013 and this is going to sound slightly nasty \u2013 with baggage, and experience with how things are done. We want to find a new and better way of doing things. Graduates are very good at doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Max Conze, the chief executive of Dyson, who joined in 2010 from Procter &amp; Gamble, said the company\u2019s growth is built on a \u201cbet on young people, young graduates\u201d and a \u201cbelief in technology and innovation as the engine for growth\u201d. He added: \u201cYou have to be willing to listen to people who have just come in and the people who have done this for many years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb94b678a13d01ef60eed655304f2475002f0f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb94b678a13d01ef60eed655304f2475002f0f23/0_0_5431_5431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sports centre at Dyson HQ\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dyson\u2019s headquarters are designed to feel like a university campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WilkinsonEyre &amp; Dyson Research Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dyson\u2019s headquarters are shrouded in mystique and secrecy.

The company has 129 laboratories for its research and development team, who are working on more than 200 projects.</p> <p>Dyson appears to be on the cusp of major expansion. Its revenues have doubled in the past four years and it wants to double its team of 3,000 engineers by 2021, wit<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/21/dyson-to-invest-1bn-in-battery-technology-thanks-to-profit-surge\">h \u00a31bn committed to developing new battery technology.</a></p> <p>The company\u2019s new robotic vacuum cleaner \u2013 the Dyson 360 Eye \u2013 is a new avenue. After initially specialising in the movement of air, Dyson has broadened its technology into robotics, electric motors and 360-degree cameras. These technologies would clearly be helpful for an electric vehicle. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could deny that,\u201d Dyson says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>The inventor still owns 100% of the company and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/sunday-times-rich-list-simon-david-reuben-lewis-hamilton-adele\">estimated to be worth \u00a35bn</a> \u2013 more than Sir Richard Branson.</p> <p>Dyson says he has no plans to sell a stake in the business and that its private ownership has been key to its success. \u201cOur CEO can think long term, he doesn\u2019t have to satisfy the newspapers or investorsevery quarter he is raising the profits. We can afford to invest more in research and development, invest in long-term stuff.\u201d</p>",

The long one is that Potter sees Tim Drake as the ideal boy wonder to make a return in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/09/joe-manganiello-is-deathstroke-in-ben-affleck-batman-movie\">Affleck\u2019s new Batman movie</a>, and also reckons it\u2019s about time an Asian American actor like himself got a plum role in the new DC expanded universe. He\u2019s certainly made a convincing case thus far.</p> <p>\u201cMarvel has done a really amazing job lately of adding a lot more diversity to their universe,\u201d Potter, who is half Japanese, half Caucasian, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robin-fight-video-ryan-potter-927966\">told the Hollywood Reporter after his video went viral</a>. \u201cOne thing I noticed about the DC universe is it\u2019s very one note at the moment in terms of age and diversity.\u201d</p> <p>The 21-year-old, who says he has been turned down for roles for not being \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d enough, added: \u201cI fall into this paradox where \u2018either you get a little too much of this or a little too much of that\u2019 \u2026 I thought it would be absolutely amazing to see an Asian American face in that cast.\u201d</p> <p>Potter seized upon Drake because he believes he bears some resemblance to the third Robin, who debuted in 1989 in the comics and held the mantle 20 years before rebranding himself as Red Robin seven years ago. But is the world really ready for Batman\u2019s oft-reviled sidekick to return to the big screen? And is Affleck at all likely to bring him back in his debut solo outing as Gotham\u2019s furrow-browed, steely-eyed defender?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/30/deathstroke-batman-villain-dc-vision-of-violence\">Deathstroke: the perfect Batman villain for DC's vision of violence?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To answer the first question, it\u2019s clear that attitudes towards comic book movies have been transformed since Robin became persona non grata in Gotham almost two decades ago. Marvel has shown that superheroes don\u2019t have to be toned down, Nolan-style, to be successful. In fact, the Disney-owned studio is ploughing ahead with big-screen debuts for some of the most far-out comic book creations in history, namely Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/13/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-trailer-marvel-scott-derrickson\">Doctor Strange </a>and the African hero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/lupita-nyongo-in-black-panther-marvel-superhero-movie\">Black Panther</a>. So why not Robin? And why not Tim Drake?</p> <p>If director Zack Snyder was following comic book canon, it seems likely the version of the boy wonder who died in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, most likely at the hands of the Joker, was the much-hated Todd iteration. According to the timeline seen in the comics, Drake should be next to inherit the moniker, though DC might easily throw us a curveball by reintroducing Dick Grayson, or even the female Robin, Carrie Kelley, from the famous 1986 Frank Miller graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. </p> <p>Nolan\u2019s decision to shelve Robin for 2005\u2019s Batman Begins was entirely sensible as he retooled Batman for the 21st century, jettisoning the superhero\u2019s fantasy trappings and returning him to his hardboiled late 1930s origins. But Warner Bros\u2019 upcoming slate includes DC Comics movies based on superheroes as whimsical and fanciful as Aquaman, Shazam and Green Lantern. With such an eccentric cavalcade of costumed titans set to debut in multiplexes, it surely no longer makes any sense to keep the caped crusader\u2019s long-term sidekick on ice. </p> <p>Must Robin really remain firmly locked away in the deepest vault of the Batcave, his name never to be mentioned in polite company again? Or is it finally time for comic book fans to forgive and forget? </p> <ul> <li>This piece was amended on 14 September 2016; Frank Miller, not Alan Moore, wrote The Dark Knight Returns. </li> </ul>",
  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull is marking his first year as prime minister. We take a look back at the major moments of the past 12 months.</p> <h2><strong>Advocacy: not slogans. Catharsis of the leadership change</strong></h2> <p>On September 14 2015, Malcolm Turnbull strode into a parliamentary courtyard and declared he was moving against Tony Abbott. The Coalition had been behind Labor in 30 consecutive Newspolls, a fact Turnbull noted in his rationale for the leadership change.</p> <p>His pitch was simple. Abbott had proved himself incapable of providing economic leadership. \u201cIt is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e89b5bc89d8238082ec315765d775db71606975/0_0_4900_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The morning newspapers in Sydney on 15 September 2015, the day after he ousted Tony Abbott in a snap party vote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there was a promise of grown-up government. \u201cWe need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\u201d</p> <p>The effect was immediate. Turnbull\u2019s oft-repeated optimistic declaration that there had never been a more exciting time saw the Coalition recover in the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/globetrotting-turnbull-stretches-his-wings-but-will-the-diehards-clip-them\">Turnbull changed the national tone instantly on issues like national security</a>, moved quickly to produce a science and innovation package as well as reopening a tax reform debate that had stalled under Abbott and Joe Hockey.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018If something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>One month after taking the leadership, Turnbull did his first round of sit-down media interviews. He was keen to project a sense of pragmatism and compromise, to draw a contrast with the unrelenting conflict atmosphere promulgated by his predecessor. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t working as well as you want, chuck it out,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/23/the-malcolm-turnbull-interview-if-something-isnt-working-chuck-it-out\">Turnbull said during a conversation with Guardian Australia</a> on 23 October. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of people saying, it\u2019s a backdown, or a backflip.

Fairer is what is it all about</p> <footer> <cite>Malcolm Turnbull in October 2015</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Turnbull during his opening gambit also acknowledged that the political conversation around budget repair needed to address equity \u2013 again an explicit point of contrast with the 2014 budget, which was a political disaster for Abbott. \u201cWe should never cease trying to make changes in the social welfare area fairer,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cFairer is what is it all about. Fairness has got to be the key priority.\u201d He gave his first signal about where the government would ultimately land with the controversial superannuation reforms it would unveil in the May 2016 budget. He suggested tax concessions for the wealthy had to be pared back as well as government spending programs primarily benefiting the lower paid.</p> <h2><strong>The first summit season</strong></h2> <p>Two months after the leadership change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/20/presidents-planes-and-paris-inside-the-whirlwind-of-malcolm-turnbulls-first-world-tour\">Malcolm embarked on his first summit season</a>. His first stop was Jakarta \u2013 an investment in improving the bilateral relationship with president Joko Widodo. The relationship with Jakarta had been battered and bruised over asylum boat turnbacks and also the revelation that Australia\u2019s spy agencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/australia-tried-to-monitor-indonesian-presidents-phone\">had attempted to listen-in on the calls</a> of the previous Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and his inner circle. Much was made of the attempted rapprochement and rebalancing in the relationship early in the new Turnbull term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3de32d86021dab7efa9e2ab8cb564917123826/0_93_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the US president, Barack Obama, after their bilateral meeting alongside the Apec summit in Manila, Philippines, in November 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turnbull went on to Berlin and was in the German capital when the Paris terror attacks unfolded on November 14. He flew on to Turkey for the G20 gathering, which was dominated by the worsening security situation in Syria. Turnbull met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Antalya gathering \u2013 the first substantial contact between Canberra and Moscow since Tony Abbott had famously threatened to \u201cshirtfront\u201d the Russian president. Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/apec-summit-malcolm-turnbull-says-syria-solution-hinges-on-power-sharing\">noted a political solution in Syria would require the inclusion of Sunni groups</a> that had felt disenfranchised by the Assad regime and had consequently been left vulnerable to overtures from Islamic State. In Turkey he met the leaders of Japan, Singapore, the EU, India and China.</p> <p>Turnbull then winged his way to Manila and the Apec summit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/17/malcolm-turnbull-and-barack-obama-hold-first-meeting-and-promise-to-ramp-up-fight-against-isis\">where he had his first substantial bilateral with the US president, Barack Obama</a>. Obama invited Turnbull to visit Washington and courted Australia\u2019s support in the hotly disputed region of the South China Sea, where Australia had resolved to walk a middle course diplomatically, carefully balancing the relationship between most important strategic ally and largest trading partner.</p> <h2><strong>Early concessions to conservative enemies</strong></h2> <p> Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 for two reasons \u2013 he was seen by colleagues as dragging the Coalition in too progressive a direction and his leadership style was regarded as high-handed.</p> <p>Turnbull entered the leadership in 2015 determined to be more consultative and he vowed to restore good cabinet processes, which was partly an explicit apologia about his own mistakes in the past and a more contemporary acknowledgement that one of the things that had undone Abbott as prime minister was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d leadership style out of the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec2d0491efd887f50ba2c653c297e9e017a36f7/0_108_5154_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull with the education minister, Simon Birmingham.

He also made it clear that there would be no change to the Coalition\u2019s climate change policy before a planned review in 2017, despite broad criticism about the effectiveness of the Direct Action scheme.</p> <p>After a brief backbench storm over the Safe Schools anti-bullying program in March, Turnbull and fellow moderate, the education minister Simon Birmingham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/turnbull-government-unveils-dramatic-changes-to-safe-schools-program\">offered up a number of concessions</a>, such as requiring parental consent for student participation and requiring the agreement of parental bodies to decide whether, and how, a school will participate in the program.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and they corroded his personal standing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the chief critics of the program, the LNP backbencher George Christensen, later declared victory. \u201cIt\u2019s all going,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBoys in girls\u2019 school uniforms, girls and boys using the same toilets, classroom role plays where kids imagine they have no genitalia or they\u2019re gay ... I doubt the Safe Schools Coalition \u2013 who came up with with the weird and wonderful elements of this, attempting to instil queer theory, sexual liberation and Marxism into classrooms \u2013 will accept this. And if they don\u2019t, the funding will be cut.\u201d</p> <p>The concessions to the conservative right set a definitive trend for Turnbull and, progressively, they corroded his personal standing with voters. Voters had welcomed the leadership change, believing that Turnbull would be less ideological than his predecessor, would move the Coalition back to the political centre and was a politician prepared to sacrifice ambition for principle.</p> <h2><strong>Tax reform debate: the brief life of a GST hike, and competitive federalism</strong></h2> <p>Reopening the government\u2019s stalled tax reform debate was an early marker that the prime minister intended to prosecute a broad-ranging economic policy discussion. A possible rise in the GST had been, as Turnbull liked to say, \u201ckicked off into the long grass\u201d under Abbott. The new prime minister elected to put the GST back on the political agenda.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/24/gst-debate-scott-morrison-backs-need-for-option-to-raise-tax-as-part-of-reforms\">opened the political new year in 2016 by softening Australians up for an increase in the GST,</a> arguing that reform needed to be on the table if voters want personal income tax relief and a cut to corporate tax to boost economic growth. Two state premiers, Mike Baird in New South Wales, and Jay Weatherill, the Labor man in South Australia, were resolved to give Turnbull political cover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d431cb281fb7ed1c3d0b69db237798625d2414/0_87_2758_1655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turnbull and the treasurer, Scott Morrison, during question time at Parliament House in Canberra early in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Labor had spent the summer working up a marginal seats campaign for the election year predicated around opposing the GST and that rattled the government backbench. While Morrison continued to roll forward, Turnbull began to roll back. It was the first sign that the relationship between prime minister and treasurer wasn\u2019t entirely harmonious.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/turnbull-rules-out-gst-change-election-policy/7172294\">A GST increase was dumped formally in February.</a> \u201cAfter you take into account all of the compensation that you would need to ensure the change was equitable, it simply is not justified in economic terms,\u201d the prime minister told reporters.</p> <p>A second phase of tax reform played out somewhat chaotically in the lead-up to a Council of Australian Governments meeting in late March 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/states-offered-5bn-hospitals-funding-income-tax-raising-powers\">Turnbull floated the idea that state governments would be able to levy a portion of income tax</a> and service delivery would be devolved back to the states. The premiers shot the concept down in flames. Turnbull put the defeat more delicately. \u201cThere was not a consensus among the states and territories to support further consideration of the proposal that would enable states to levy income tax on their own behalf,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>A budget, Senate reform and a sprint to a double dissolution</strong></h2> <p>Having turned into an election year, and with political momentum clearly on the wane, Turnbull set about putting together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/19/senate-voting-reform-stirs-up-hornets-nest-between-likely-winners-and-losers\">reforms to the Senate voting system</a> that were designed to reduce the chances of micro-party candidates being elected on small percentages of the vote.

The budget was styled not merely as a budget but pitched rather more grandly as an \u201ceconomic plan\u201d for the nation, where cuts to business taxes would generate more economic growth and jobs (although the fine print on the tax cut made it clear the growth dividend was small and would take many years to arrive). Somewhat bravely for an election budget, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/budget-2016-jobs-and-growth-pitch-costs-wealthy-retirees-smokers-and-multinationals\">no goodies for people on average incomes</a> between $37,000 and $80,000.</p> <h2><strong>The winter of Malcolm\u2019s discontent</strong></h2> <p>By the conclusion of budget week, Malcolm Turnbull resolved Australians would go to the polls for a double-dissolution election on 2 July. Looking over the heads of colleagues to the voters, Turnbull told people watching on Mother\u2019s Day he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/17/election-2016-malcolm-turnbull-liberal-party-coalition-profile\">seeking a personal mandate</a>. He was \u201cseeking the mandate of the Australian people to continue and complete [the government\u2019s] national economic plan, because that is the key to us achieving and realising the great opportunities of these exciting times\u201d. The pitch went to the crux of what Turnbull required to steady his political fortunes \u2013 an affirmation from the voters that they wanted him to be prime minister.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4nhqz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2591592\"            data-video-name=\"Malcolm Turnbull: \u2018I\u2019m confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC News 24\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5777e1b9e4b0c5b1280f315f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/02/160702TurnbullSpeech.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jul/02/malcolm-turnbull-im-confident-that-we-can-form-a-majority-government-video\">Malcolm Turnbull speaks on the night of the federal election, saying he is \u2018confident that we can form a majority government\u2019 \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was an unusual election campaign at a number of levels.

She would go on to secure a coveted job at Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and, at only 27, climb the ranks to vice-president, earning more than $340,000 a year. Despite working furious 80-hour weeks she was, she says, living the dream. Yet the young master of the universe was also harbouring a secret that could destroy her life at any moment. She was an undocumented immigrant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5a04a78ef8e61832673415dee4caa72bdcc2b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5a04a78ef8e61832673415dee4caa72bdcc2b47/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs sign is seen above floor of the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldman Sachs sign is seen above floor of the New York stock exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hiding in plain sight, the constant dread of being unmasked, fired and deported to Mexico took its toll. Arce begins her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Underground-American-Dream-Undocumented-Immigrant/dp/1455540242\">My (Underground) American Dream</a>, published on Tuesday, describing a panic attack that felt like a heart attack that could kill her. There were migraines and debilitating back pains. An ex-boyfriend threatened to report her to the authorities and she felt powerless to fly home to see her dying father. The book is a vivid reminder that beyond monolithic terms and sweeping categories such as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d there are inner lives as richly textured as any other.</p> <p>Finally, in 2009, Arce married a US citizen and secured a green card, and went on to become a naturalised US citizen. She quit Wall Street and is now an author, speaker and social justice advocate based in Los Angeles, the centre of the undocumented immigrant population. She has watched the ascent of Donald Trump, who has made anti-Mexican rhetoric a centrepiece of his presidential campaign, with horror. Yet in March last year, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/how-an-undocumented-immigrant-from-mexico-became-a-star-at-goldman-sachs\">when Arce went public with her story</a>, Trump\u2019s daughter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/574698652939255809\">Ivanka tweeted</a>: \u201cWe love this story about an undocumented immigrant who worked her way up on Wall Street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrump is a racist and a bigot and a sexist.

Her parents travelled frequently to sell jewelry in Texas and eventually settled in San Antonio. Arce joined them on a tourist visa when she was 11, learning English from scratch. The visa expired when she was 14, rendering her undocumented.</p> <p>When she graduated high school in 2001, a new law made it possible for undocumented Texas students to attend public universities and she was accepted at the University of Texas at Austin.</p> <p>Arce\u2019s parents moved back to Mexico in 2001. She took over their food cart business, which meant that every Friday she took a Greyhound bus 80 miles to San Antonio to sell funnel cakes with strawberries, whipped cream and cinnamon. But when the cart lost its place in a market square, Arce needed a new job to make ends meet. At 19, she bought a fake green card and social security number in \u201ca mundane transaction\u201d in a stranger\u2019s apartment for a few hundred dollars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 19, she bought a fake green card and social security number in a stranger\u2019s apartment for a few hundred dollars</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She says: \u201cI was really nervous about it because you never know those papers are going to work. That literally was the only choice I had. I didn\u2019t give up on myself and I didn\u2019t give up on my aspirations and I didn\u2019t give up on the sacrifice my parents had already made and the sacrifice I had made. So to me, as difficult as the choice was, the choice was clear. I had to take the next step.\u201d</p> <p>With the help of Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which recruits and trains outstanding minority students for summer internships, Arce got her foot in the door at Goldman Sachs. She impressed and was soon offered a full-time job as an analyst. But when the euphoria subsided, she realised she would have to show forms of government-issued ID to start on payroll. She writes: \u201cIn less than two weeks there was more than a good chance my secret would finally be exposed \u2013 that secret that could ruin my life, that could send me to jail, that could end my career before it ever began. The secret I\u2019d been forced to keep since I was 14 years old.\u201d<br></p> <p>One night in the summer of 2005 she felt a sharp pain in her chest, unable to breathe and a tingling that crept down her left arm. She recalls: \u201cYou literally feel like you\u2019re going to die \u2026like your next breath is going to be your last.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dedb17039a1a4c4246fbc584cd5f7a29ad49d9db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dedb17039a1a4c4246fbc584cd5f7a29ad49d9db/0_0_1969_2461/800.jpg\" alt=\"Julissa Arce in 2001 with her mother and sister in front of their funnel cake cart in San Antonio\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julissa Arce in 2001 with her mother and sister in front of their funnel cake cart in San Antonio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Julissa Arce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was taken to hospital and told she had suffered a major panic or anxiety attack. And yet, when the moment came, she submitted her fake documents to Goldman Sachs and the alarm never sounded. Facing one of the most wealthy and ruthless companies in the world, she had got away with it. She believes that, perversely, her background worked to her advantage.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest reasons I learned I slipped through the cracks at Goldman Sachs and why I never got caught or deported is because we have this very narrow-minded view of who an undocumented immigrant is and what they do, and I didn\u2019t fit that stereotype, so when people were looking at my papers they were never questioning are these papers real or not?[\u2026]\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut the truth is there are millions of us who do not fit that stereotype and we\u2019re breaking down that stereotype all the time. So we do those jobs because we have to, those are the jobs that are available, we take them, we do them well, we work really hard at them because we want the next generation to do better and we aspire to bigger things than that.\u201d</p> <p>With a workaholic boss who was on the treadmill at 5.30am and at his desk by 7am, there was little respite. Just as Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street declared, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WsOzrnBTHA\">\u201cLunch is for wimps,\u201d</a> so meals were usually eaten at desks, with sandwiches delivered by cart so no one had to get up. Even the toilet was for wimps. \u201cIf you had to go pee, you literally were like running to the bathroom to pee and come back to your desk,\u201d Arce recalls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have this very narrow-minded view of who an undocumented immigrant is and what they do</p> <footer> <cite>Julissa Arce</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet she did not want to be anywhere else. Arce had the wide-eyed wonder that often eludes jaded locals. \u201cI used to walk around New York City and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is my life. I can\u2019t believe I live here.\u2019 People dream of one day seeing New York City \u2026 This is a place out of movies and here I am, I live here. I lived at 45 Wall Street, I lived on one of the most famous streets in the world, and I couldn\u2019t believe that sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, corroding from within was the knowledge that it could all be shattered in a moment by some misstep. \u201cThere were periods of time when I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind. There were like two or three weeks where every single day I was in a panic about it, but in some ways having the kind of job that I had almost shielded me from it being consciously in my mind. I had to worry about my next promotion, my next trade, my next job assignment, my next raise. But it never really left me.\u201d</p> <p>Arce blames this stress for severe back pains that left her lying on the floor for hours as well as terrible migraines and stomach problems, all at the age of 24. The book also details a series of heart-in-the-mouth near misses. Arce had to find excuses not to travel to London for Goldman Sachs because she knew leaving the country would expose her immigration status. She confided in a boyfriend but then discovered he was cheating on her and vowed to phone the woman concerned; he threatened: \u201cIf you call her, I\u2019ll call INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99a3f69f224d7125bfc6de749ad598a58160ccff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a3f69f224d7125bfc6de749ad598a58160ccff/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julissa Arce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julissa Arce: \u2018We do those jobs because we have to, those are the jobs that are available.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s a very painful moment because here was this person that I trusted with my life, that I thought had my back, that I thought loved me. The thing about that day that hurt me even more than him saying what he said is that I felt like I didn\u2019t have the ability to express full human emotion.</p> <p>\u201cThe way a normal human being reacts in a situation like that, rightfully so, when you\u2019re brokenhearted more than you ever thought you\u2019d be in your life, you scream and you yell and you act out. I didn\u2019t have that privilege. I had to swallow it all and just say OK, you win.\u201d</p> <p>In 2007, word came that Arce\u2019s father was dying. Her instinct was to fly straight home, but she realised that as soon as she crossed the border into Mexico, she would be giving herself a 10-year penalty. Her mother begged her not to come. She spoke to her father by phone two hours before he died. \u201cYou just feel so helpless because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do and there\u2019s no way you can ever change what happened. You can never go back in time.\u201d</p> <p>Something had changed, however. Arce grew tired of Goldman Sachs and longed to return to Mexico to see her family, permanently ending her gilded cage existence in America. By now she had a much healthier relationship with a different boyfriend. He proposed marriage and she accepted. This enabled her to finally get a green card in 2009. The years of hiding were finally over, but not in the way she wanted.</p> <p>Arce muses: \u201cThe irony of my situation was so upsetting. The fact that my mum wanted to come to this country because she wanted to make sure her daughters never had to depend on a man. She would always tell me you\u2019ve got to be independent, you\u2019ve got to make your own money, be able to take care of yourself..\u201d</p> <p>And the marriage, buried in bureaucratic paperwork with no honeymoon, did not last, though the couple remain on friendly terms. \u201cWe were young and we never asked ourselves what does it really mean to be married. We had a problem and being married provided a solution to that problem. I read some of the reviews [of my book] that people have written on Goodreads and some people allude to me having got married only for the purpose of getting a green card. And that\u2019s not how it was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was the first time since I was 14 years old I was really able to ask myself: what is it I want to do with my life?</p> <footer> <cite>Julissa Arce</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although Arce now has US citizenship, her mother\u2019s visa was revoked and she is banned for 10 years, while her sister is living undocumented in San Antonio with four American-born children. Her mother and sister have not seen each other for more than a decade. \u201cFinally I can have a passport that says I\u2019m American and I can vote and when people tell me I\u2019m a criminal, I can say no, I\u2019m an American citizen actually. It\u2019s a great feeling. But my family is still separated and we\u2019re not able to be all together.\u201d</p> <p>Paradoxically, the green card that would once have conferred the legitimacy she craved at Goldman Sachs now liberated her to walk away. \u201cIt was the first time since I was 14 years old I was really able to ask myself: what is it I want to do with my life? I never had that choice before. And so when I asked myself that question, I wasn\u2019t sure that Wall Street was the answer for that. There were so many other things I wanted to explore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffb194900d5ae127e80e6818bb841fd534376d5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffb194900d5ae127e80e6818bb841fd534376d5d/0_166_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julissa Arce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julissa Arce: \u2018There were so many other things I wanted to explore.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for INGENUITY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arce became the co-founder and chairperson of the Ascend Educational Fund, a scholarship programme that assists immigrant students, a board member for the National Immigration Law Center. She is \u201cvery critical\u201d of Barack Obama for deporting more immigrants than any US president in history but nothing prepared her for the day in June last year when a brash businessman descended an escalator at Trump Tower and said of Mexicans: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs.

He\u2019ll be one of the first people to drop out before even the first Republican debate. He won\u2019t be on stage.

If he said that about black people, about gay people, about Jewish people, about anybody else, he would not have ever been on that stage.\u201d</p> <p>Win or lose, Trump has torn the social fabric. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what he said that angers me, it\u2019s the reaction of our country that angers me even more, and scares me frankly because the reason he is where he is is because the sentiment he\u2019s expressing already exists in our country. He\u2019s just said it loud and made it OK for everyone else to say it out loud. He has made it OK to be a racist. He has given people a platform to stand on and be bigots and be racists and be sexists and be xenophobic. He has set us back so many years in terms of civil rights.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is using immigrants as a scapegoat for everything from unemployment to terrorism, she adds. Arce rails against the cliche that Mexicans do the jobs that other people won\u2019t. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to clean houses and to pick strawberries and to mow lawns for the rest of our lives and because we want our children to do that. That\u2019s not why we come here. We come here and we do those jobs in the hope that the next generation can get an education and go to college, and the next generation after that can run companies and become president of this country.

So they mock us and tell us we\u2019re stealing their jobs. What jobs are we stealing if those aren\u2019t jobs you want to fill? And by the way, that\u2019s not all we aspire to, and also people who do those jobs deserve the same amount of dignity as anybody else because those are honest jobs and they\u2019re earning an honest living.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Two brothers who acted as illegal gangmasters in Wisbech have been given two-year prison sentences suspended for two years at Cambridge crown court.</p> <p>Stanislovas Dambrauskas, 38, and Andrius Dambrauskas, 34, pleaded guilty to operating as gangmasters to the food and agriculture sector without a licence. The pair, originally from Lithuania, were supplying up to 100 eastern European migrant workers at a time to other leading labour agencies, which in turn sent them to work on big farms and factories across East Anglia.</p> <p>Their main source of profit was rent collected from the workers for overcrowded accommodation they illegally sublet in Wisbech, often placing nine workers in three-bedroomed houses. In some cases workers\u2019 wages were paid direct into the brothers\u2019 bank accounts and they deducted rent and fees for transport to work from them before passing what was left on to workers. </p> <p>Sentencing, Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told the pair: \u201cYou ran a racket for 30 months [which] exploited your own countrymen \u2026 by stuffing them into properties.\u201d He said the two men had abused the hopes of other migrants travelling from Lithuania by promising pay far in excess of what they could expect to earn in the UK. </p> <p> The prosecution follows on from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/gangsters-on-our-doorstep\">conviction</a> earlier this year of a Latvian organised crime group based in Wisbech that was found to be exploiting eastern European workers in another illegal gangmaster operation providing workers to the supply chains of major supermarkets. The group was also laundering money and arranging sham marriages between Asians and eastern Europeans to facilitate illegal immigration.</p> <p> The prosecution in the Dambrauskas brothers\u2019 case on Tuesday told the court that workers were recruited via agents in Lithuania who charged fees for work, which is illegal in the UK. Those signing up were warned not to tell anyone what they were doing or they would be fined, the court heard. When they arrived in London, in some cases 40 at a time, they were collected and taken by minibus to Wisbech where they were placed in cramped houses and charged \u00a360 a week to share a room. </p> <p>They were sent to work, often at only a few hours\u2019 notice in potato and carrot packing factories, and in the fields harvesting flowers, cabbages and sugar beet. Pay was often below the national minimum wage and was given without mandatory payslips, the court heard. Workers were charged for transport even if there was no work for them when they reached the farms or factories. </p> <p>The Dambrauskas brothers provided vehicles to transport them to the sites but did not have public service licences to do so. They came to police notice in part as a result of complaints from neighbours. </p> <p> Hawkesworth said he was taking into account the fact that requests for workers were initiated by other licensed agencies, and that although some workers said they had been threatened there had been no violence or money laundering. The language barrier also made it harder for the Dambrauskas brothers to understand the legal arguments, he said.</p> <p> Andrius Dambrauskas was of previous good character. Stanislavos Dambrauskas had two previous UK convictions for shoplifting and handling stolen goods and five prison sentences from Lithuania relating to theft and possession of an offensive weapon.</p>",
  "<p>On 6 June 2013, the Guardian broke the news National Security Agency (NSA) had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">ordered Verizon</a> to provide it with the phone records of its customers.

He knew he was putting his life at risk and exposing himself to decades of incarceration. \u201cMy sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,\u201d he explained. Snowden hoped to trigger a debate \u201cabout the kind of world we want to live in\u201d. The US government began an immediate campaign to track, harass and silence him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/edward-snowden-why-barack-obama-should-grant-me-a-pardon\">Edward Snowden makes 'moral' case for presidential pardon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More revelations followed that exposed a massive national security complex that spies on virtually everyone, everywhere. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA), which is a secret court that was supposed to protect our privacy rights, was rubber-stamping every NSA request for the authority to spy without any real oversight. The US government was spying on foreign leaders, working with British spies to collect massive amounts of global data across the planet, and collecting over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/nsa-collects-millions-text-messages-daily-untargeted-global-sweep\">200 million text messages</a> daily. And the NSA was working to stop encryption (a technology developed to protect the privacy of both private individuals and businesses).</p> <p>NSA director James Clapper was forced to acknowledge that he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\">given false testimony</a> to Congress about NSA spying on Americans, and that Snowden\u2019s leaks had created a healthy public debate about the balance between privacy and national security. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some of the conversations this has generated, some of the debate, actually needed to happen,\u201d he said. Even Barack Obama admitted that the revelations required the US to re-think how we uphold \u201cthe civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals \u2013 and our Constitution \u2013 require.\u201d</p> <p>Federal judges ruled that such massive collection of citizens\u2019 metadata without any connection to a particular investigation was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html\">patently illegal</a>, essentially vindicating Snowden. His goal was to tell the truth about the government spying on all of us, and to create public and judicial pressure on the government to create real changes in the way things are done and to stop the trajectory towards a surveillance state.</p> <p>Snowden\u2019s whistleblowing was among the most important in US history. It showed us that the relationship between the people of the United States and the government has gone off track and needs a major course correction.</p> <p>The fourth amendment of the constitution provides that a court must find probable cause that an individual has committed a crime before issuing a warrant, and forbids systematic spying on the American people. The requirement of individualized suspicion should prohibit this type of dragnet surveillance. Spying on whole populations is not necessary, and is actually counterproductive. </p> <p>If elected president I will immediately pardon Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and John Kiriakou for their important work in exposing the massive, systematic violation of our constitutional rights. I would invite them to the White House to publicly acknowledge their heroism, and create a role for them in the Stein-Baraka Green party administration to help us create a modern framework that protects personal privacy while still conducting effective investigations where warranted.</p> <p>The American people have a right to privacy. My hope is that Obama uses his power to pardon Snowden now. The debate he began must be continued so we find a resolution that protects the freedom of press, association, religion and speech as well as the privacy of people in the United States and around the world.</p>",

  "<p>Nonhuman primates have long played a key role in life-changing medical advances. A recent white paper by nine scientific societies in the US produced a list of 50 medical advances from the last 50 years made possible through studies on nonhuman primates. These included: treatments for leprosy, HIV and Parkinson\u2019s; the MMR and hepatitis B vaccines; and earlier diagnosis and better treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome and breast cancer.</p> <p>The biological similarities between humans and other primates mean that they are sometimes the only effective model for complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s. More than 10 million people suffer from Parkinson\u2019s worldwide, and a recent study estimated that one in three people born in 2015 will develop dementia in their lifetime. Primate research offers treatments, and hope for future treatments, to patients and their families. Already over 200,000 Parkinson\u2019s patients have had their life dramatically improved thanks to deep brain stimulation surgery, which reduces the tremors of sufferers. This treatment was developed from research carried out in a few hundred monkeys in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>Given that primates are intelligent and sensitive animals, such research requires a higher level of ethical justification. The scientific community continues to work together to minimise the suffering of primates wherever possible. We welcome the worldwide effort to replace, refine and reduce the use of primates in research.</p> <p>We, the undersigned, believe that if we are to effectively combat the scourge of neurodegenerative and other crippling diseases, we will require the careful and considered use of nonhuman primates. Stringent regulations across the developed world exist to ensure that primates are only used where there is no other available model \u2013 be that the use of a mouse or a non-animal alternative \u2013 and to protect the wellbeing of those animals still required. The use of primates is not undertaken lightly. However, while not all primate research results in a new treatment, it nonetheless plays a role in developing both the basic and applied knowledge that is crucial for medical advances.</p> <p><strong>Professor Sir John Gurdon</strong><em> Winner of Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012 and Lasker Award in 2009</em></p> <p><strong>Professor Sir John Walker</strong><em> Winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1997</em></p> <p><strong>Sir Colin Blakemore</strong> <em>Former Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council</em></p> <p><strong>Alim Benabid, MD, PhD</strong><em> Professor Emeritus of Biophysics at Joseph Fourier University, Joint Winner of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award</em></p> <p><strong>Mahlon DeLong, MD</strong><em> Professor of Neurology at Emory University School of Medicine, Joint Winner of the 2014 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award</em><br></p> <p><strong>Michael Arthur</strong> <em>Professor, President &amp; Provost of University College London</em></p> <p><strong>Giacomo Rizzolatti</strong><em> Professor, Universita Delgli Studi Di Parma, Italy</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Miguel Nicolelis, PhD</strong><em> Professor of Neurobiology at Duke University, Director of Neuroengineering</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><em>Signing on behalf of the listed organisations:</em></p> <p><strong>Jane F Reckelhoff, PhD</strong><em> President of the American Physiological Society</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Cindy Buckmaster, PhD</strong><em> President of Americans for Medical Progress</em><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>John Aggleton, PhD, FRS, FMedSci</strong><em> Professor, President of the British Neuroscience Association</em></p> <p><strong>Leonard Howell, PhD</strong><em> President, The College on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc</em></p> <p><strong>Gregg Stanwood, PhD</strong><em> President of Developmental Neurotoxicology Society</em></p> <p><strong>Kirk Leech</strong><em> Executive Director of the European Animal Research Association</em></p> <p><strong>Hudson H Freeze, PhD</strong><em> President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</em></p> <p><strong>Barry Everitt, FRS, Fmedsci</strong><em> President of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies</em></p> <p><strong>Matthew Bailey</strong><em> Executive Vice President, Foundation for Biomedical Research</em></p> <p><strong>John Hogan, PhD</strong><em> Registrar at Newcastle University</em></p> <p><strong>David Eisner, DPhil</strong><em> President of The Physiological Society</em></p> <p><strong>Kenneth Sher, PhD</strong><em> President of the Research Society on Alcoholism</em></p> <p><strong>Hollis Cline, PhD</strong><em> Professor, President of Society for Neuroscience</em></p> <p><strong>Wendy Jarrett</strong><em> Chief Executive of Understanding Animal Research</em></p> <p><em>Signing in a personal capacity:</em></p> <p><strong>Christian Abee</strong><em> DVM, DACLAM, Professor and Chair, Department of Veterinary Sciences, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, University of Texas, USA</em></p> <p><strong>Moshe Abeles, PhD</strong><em> Professor of Neurophysiology, Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Centre, Bar-Ilan University, Israel</em></p> <p><strong>Alaa Ahmed, PhD</strong><em> Associate Professor of Integrative Physiology, University of Colorado Boulder, USA</em></p> <p><strong>Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Ar\u00e9valo</strong><strong><em> </em>PhD</strong><em> Neuroscientist, Instituto Cajal, CSIC, Madrid, Spain</em></p> <p><strong>Yaneri A Ayala</strong><em> Postdoctoral Fellow.

  "<p>Fifteen years ago I made the fateful decision to travel from my home in New York to Berlin to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\">Radiohead</a> perform. At the time, I worked as a radio producer at the BBC\u2019s New York bureau, and the date on my ticket had yet to acquire its tragic significance: 11 September 2001. Like many other people, that day is seared into my brain: a day of horror, disbelief, anger and sadness, and all of it \u2013 for me \u2013 forever associated with the sublime music of Radiohead.<br></p> <p> Last Sunday, Radiohead were back in Berlin, performing as the headlining act of the <a href=\"http://www.lollapaloozade.com/\">Lollapalooza Berlin</a> festival, the date of their show falling on the 15th anniversary of 9/11. I made the trip back to see a band that had provided a significant soundtrack to my life so far, believing this moment would be among other things a point of reflection on that dark day. It seemed unlikely that the band\u2019s famously taciturn lead singer, Thom Yorke, would say anything about that historic anniversary, and yet there always seems to be a heartbreaking line in his elliptical lyrics that says it all. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too late / The damage is done,\u201d Yorke sings in the recent song Daydreaming. That feels about right to me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TTAU7lLDZYU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> On that late summer\u2019s evening at Treptower Park, the events of 15 years ago perhaps seemed far away, even as the world commemorated. Certainly the mood among the estimated 60,000 people who attended this concert was mellow and positive \u2013 a far cry from the heightened, edgy state of alert that defined the 9/11 concert, which took place in an outdoor amphitheatre in Wuhlheide Park. The coincidence of the dates wasn\u2019t missed by the German newspapers, which recalled the 2001 event as a \u201cspooky and rainy night\u201d.</p> <p> If anyone needed reminding that the repercussions of 9/11 were still being felt, the very location of Lollapalooza Berlin was testimony to that. The festival was supposed to take place on the grounds of the now-defunct Tempelhof airport, where its debut was held in 2015. But in the year since, Germany has welcomed more than a million refugees and, as of two weeks ago, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/fluechtlinge-im-berliner-flughafen-tempelhof-notunterkunft-bedeutet-das-aus-fuer-event-ort/12882334.html\">is currently housing nearly 1,500 refugees at Tempelhof, according to several German newspapers</a>. It\u2019s not difficult to make the connection between the legacy of 9/11 and the present refugee crisis resulting from war in Syria and violence in the Middle East.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">Radiohead: A Moon Shaped Pool review \u2013 something they've never achieved before</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Radiohead started their set on Sunday with the first five tracks from their newest album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a>. The stage was drenched in red light as the band opened up with Burn the Witch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/johnny-greenwood-radiohead-burn-the-witch-strings\">Jonny Greenwood using a bow on his electric guitar to approximate the nervy <em>col legno </em>strings that open the track</a>. Yorke sings, \u201cThis is a low-flying panic attack.\u201d That urgency gave way to the drifting beauty of Daydreaming, and soon we were inside that melancholy ambience \u2013 the mystery of music able to change the nature of the air \u2013 that is specific to Radiohead.</p> <p> The atmosphere on 11 September 2001 was of a different order, an extraordinary sensory event in my life. I remember a series of impressions: the walk from the S-Bahn through the dark forest of the park; the rain starting to pour; my awareness of being deep within the former East Berlin, a novelty for me that seemed to add historical darkness to my sense of place; the banks of fluorescent white lights on the stage (my friend commenting that this was a homage to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAj2iX9xqCo\">David Bowie\u2019s 1976 White Light Tour</a>); a state of vulnerability and anxiety and, perhaps, guilt over going to a musical event after the horror of the day. If apocalypse was upon us \u2013 as many felt \u2013 then all we needed was a soundtrack, and who better to supply it than Radiohead, a band whose music charted fear, alienation and paranoia, but also made it OK to feel those things. And here we were, the band kicking off with sampled German talk radio before the raspy fuzz of the bass loop that defines The National Anthem: \u201cEveryone is so near / Everyone has got the fear.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/51713268\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/51713268\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Thirty-eight minutes passed before Yorke said: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to say anything. Well, what the fuck are you going to say after today? You know. There\u2019s absolutely nothing <em>to</em> say.\u201d After that, the band launched into a ferocious version of Airbag, from OK Computer, Greenwood ripping the opening/closing guitar riff with a vengeance. Was there a sense that the band was out of sorts? Why wouldn\u2019t they be? Then, after the disorienting affect of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_Gg1xAHE4\">Pyramid Song</a>, something happened. Yorke said: \u201cSo who here doesn\u2019t know about it? Everybody knows what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Clearly some people did not. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? You don\u2019t know about the aeroplanes in America?</p> <p>\u201cSomebody tell them,\u201d said Yorke. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Yorke explained what had happened in New York and Washington DC. There was still a degree of uncertainty about the facts (and in 2001, it wasn\u2019t as if people had iPhones to give them updates). I was already aware of the news, having been glued to BBC World television all day long in a friend\u2019s flat, watching the pictures from New York with disbelief \u2013 and here was Yorke talking about it. It was surreal and unsettling. \u201cSo \u2026 that\u2019s why, you know, things are a little mute tonight,\u201d Yorke says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. This is called Paranoid Android.\u201d</p> <p>If the crowd was looking for some kind of communion in its fear and anxiety, in its grief and empathy, Paranoid Android was the song that opened the floodgates. By the time the song broke into its hymn-like invocation, with Yorke singing, \u201cRain down / Come on rain down on me / From a great height,\u201d it was both a lament and a glorious catharsis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3498d534efe8f38cf8bf7eb1d118380daa0dfec7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3498d534efe8f38cf8bf7eb1d118380daa0dfec7/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood (back) perform at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, 16 August 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood (back) perform at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, 16 August 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Toward the climax of the concert, Yorke returned to the news, dedicating the song You and Whose Army (albeit in a hesitant manner) to the Bush administration. The playground posturing of the lyrics with their \u201cCome on if you think / You can take us on\u201d line is undercut by the defeated air of the music. There\u2019s nothing triumphant here, but it was a song that perfectly captured the mood of weary defiance. And so to the final encore, Street Spirit, with Yorke\u2019s introduction articulating an unspoken fear: \u201cThis is hoping \u2026 George W Bush doesn\u2019t declare world war three.\u201d</p> <p> And fade out again. Fifteen years later, I still recall all the coiled anxiety of that moment. We didn\u2019t know there would be wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the September 11 attacks. But we knew there would be something. Of course we couldn\u2019t go home after the adrenaline surge of this epic concert. We walked to a bar, not quite knowing what to make of this strange mixture of uplift and dread, a combination that Radiohead have mastered. As my friend and I walked through the streets of Berlin, it was still raining, but we had already submitted to this. It felt only appropriate after such an invocation. And it afforded us one advantage: the concert posters advertising the Radiohead concert plastered on billboards and walls around the city were soaked through. The glue was wet. This allowed us to peel them off cleanly and roll them up like treasure maps. The black posters bore the image of a weeping devil, with the date \u2013 in European format \u2013 printed beneath, in bold white lettering: \u201c11.09.2001 BERLIN\u201d. Eventually I framed the poster, which now adorns my living room wall in New York \u2013 a prized possession.</p> <p> Of course Yorke didn\u2019t mention the 9/11 show at the Lollapalooza Berlin concert on Sunday. He was never going to. But it was all there in the songs, which, despite the balmy weather this time around, took me right back to the scene of the most important, emotionally charged gig I\u2019ve ever experienced.

  "<p>Shocking. That\u2019s how one tabloid has described the news that the resettlement of 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next four years may cost the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/lack-uk-homes-schools-threatens-syrian-refugee-resettlement-2020\">as much as \u00a31.7bn</a>.</p> <p>More sympathetic voices might use another word: surprising.</p> <p>It\u2019s surprising that this resettlement programme should cost 325% more than the roughly <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/syrian-refugees-by-the-numbers-1.3469080\">\u00a3400m the Canadian government spent on the resettlement of more people</a> \u2013 25,000 \u2013 within a much shorter timeframe (six months). What accounts for this difference in cost?</p> <p>The main thing is the method, says Stephen Hale, the head of Refugee Action, one of the main charities involved in the UK\u2019s resettlement scheme. Of the 25,000 people resettled in Canada last winter, <a href=\"https://niskanencenter.org/blog/canada-reaches-its-goal-resettles-25000-syrian-refugees-in-just-four-months/\">43% of them were welcomed by private individuals, groups or churches</a>. This meant that, although the Canadian government still covers the cost of the refugees\u2019 education, welfare and healthcare, private individuals pay for their accommodation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/my-syrian-refugee-lodger-helen-pidd\">\u2018Would he disapprove of my single heathen lifestyle?\u2019: me and my Syrian refugee lodger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whereas, says Hale, everyone resettled in the UK is being housed by the government. Well, almost everyone: two families are being hosted by private sponsors, one of them the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/archbishop-of-canterbury-syrian-family-refugee-sponsorship-scheme\">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.</p> <p>But is this the whole story? Canada is still covering all the costs of 14,000 refugees. For those people, Canada is getting better value for money than Britain, who will pay roughly \u00a31.2bn for welcoming the same number of people. That\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/30/heres-how-much-the-united-states-spends-on-refugees/\">the same amount as the US paid to resettle 70,000 people</a> last year. Germany, meanwhile, is <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/20160908/germany-to-spend-20-billion-on-refugees-in-2016-report-asylum-cost\">likely to spend around \u00a317bn</a> on the 800,000 asylum seekers who arrived last year.</p> <p>No two countries\u2019 circumstances are the same, and comparing them is not always fair or useful. But if we examine the cost of an individual refugee for each of these countries, we find that a refugee in Germany costs the state about \u00a321,000, while in the US the figure is \u00a317,000 and in Canada it\u2019s \u00a316,000. In Britain, it is expected to be \u00a385,000.</p> <p>However, as Hale argues, this is also the wrong way of discussing the resettlement of human beings. \u201cThere\u2019s two ways to approach it \u2013 you either look at it as a burden and try to minimise costs, or you look at it as an investment, and the more you invest, the more they can contribute to the country.\u201d</p> <p>Research by dozens of academics appears to bear this out: in the short term, resettled refugees cost the state money. But in the long term, they create jobs, pay taxes and generally contribute to the economy of their new homes. In the clearest summary of this research, Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to the president of the European commission, found that refugees who arrived in Europe last year could repay spending on them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/refugees-will-repay-eu-spending-almost-twice-over-in-five-years-report\">almost twice over within just five years</a>. While the absorption of so many refugees may increase public debt by almost \u20ac69bn (\u00a358bn) by 2020, during the same period refugees will help GDP grow by \u20ac126.6bn.</p> <p>\u2022This article was amended on 15 September 2016.

  "<p>Sitcoms, in the UK at least, are rarely written by renowned standups \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/19/jo-brand-going-forward-preview\">Jo Brand</a> is an exception, as are self-penned star vehicles Miranda and Count Arthur Strong. Plays by comedians are thinner still on the ground. But last week I saw both a sitcom pilot by James Acaster (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07v6hnc\">We the Jury</a>) and a play by Liam Williams (<a href=\"http://www.fightinthedog.co.uk/travesty/\">Travesty</a>). I was eager to see whether those standups\u2019 unmistakeable voices are as funny, or as striking, in others\u2019 mouths.</p> <p>We the Jury is derived from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/14/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-a-mindbending-comedy-cracker\">Acaster\u2019s 2015 show Represent</a>, which ostensibly recounted his experience of jury service. I say ostensibly because Acaster is a slippery customer. His standup isn\u2019t recognisably autobiographical: his jury service routine felt like a loopy metaphor and was probably fiction. But he clearly felt it had legs, because now we have a TV half-hour on the same subject, starring Ed Easton (of sketch troupe Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop) as dorky cinema worker William, whose dream comes true when he\u2019s summoned to sit on the jury at a croupier\u2019s murder trial. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/10/diane-morgan-comedy-genius-on-playing-philomena-cunk\">Diane (Philomena Cunk) Morgan</a> and Vivienne Acheampong \u2013 seen lately in Rainbow Class on the Edinburgh fringe \u2013 co-star as fellow jurors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/09/james-acaster-at-edinburgh-festival-review-gags-pleasance-courtyard\">James Acaster at Edinburgh festival review \u2013 blissful gags about modern life's minutiae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re a fan of Acaster\u2019s standup, as I am, you can\u2019t watch We the Jury without playing back at least a few of its lines in his own fastidious Kettering tones. I can easily imagine an Acaster routine about the phrase (which crops up here) \u201cYou\u2019re a poet and you don\u2019t know it\u201d \u2013 he\u2019d get 10 good minutes out of that. As for the trial of an auctioneer that was open and shut double-quick because the witnesses were all auctioneers, and they speak really fast? Well, that crack bears its maker\u2019s mark very visibly indeed.</p> <p>The show\u2019s brand of heightened reality, too, is analogous to the not-quite-real world Acaster occupies in his standup. But it\u2019s less successful. Onstage, Acaster is totally in control of his askew reality, and of the vast importance assumed there by trivial things. In his pilot, the tone feels less certain: it\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re meant to find William this much of a berk, given that everyone else seems pretty juvenile too.</p> <p>That may come, if We the Jury ever sees the light of a series. No such possibility for Travesty, a self-contained two-hander stage play from Williams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/liam-williams-review-edinburgh-festival-2014-capitalism\">whose 2014 show Capitalism</a> so blazingly and black-comically articulated anti-capitalist impotence and generational despair. Travesty traces a relationship from genesis to death throes and beyond. It\u2019s not a comedy \u2013 and yet Williams\u2019 voice is more recognisable here than Acaster\u2019s in We the Jury. The romantic-depressive outlook is recognisably his; so too the existential cri de coeur underpinning a play about a man only briefly rescued by love from life\u2019s meaninglessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7fdffc947f8027d4a87e399dab1fc3f44fa473/0_353_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travesty by Liam Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential cri de coeur ... Pierro Niel-Mee and Lydia Larson in Travesty by Liam Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Haigh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike in Acaster\u2019s pilot, there\u2019s a character here who feels like a proxy for Williams. OK, so Ben is played by a woman (Lydia Larson; the play is cross-cast, although it\u2019s not clear why). But he speaks like Williams; you\u2019d swear Larson has adopted some of Williams\u2019 diffident mannerisms, and at one point the character even punches a wall, recalling Williams walloping the ceiling until his fist bled in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/08/liam-williams-edinburgh-festival-review-comedy-laughing-horse-free-sisters\">2015 show Bonfire Night</a>. There are countless jaundiced-philosophical turns of phrase that sound like the authorial voice (\u201cLove shouldn\u2019t be mediated through consumption\u201d, and so on). The problem is that the second character, Anna, has far less personality. And also that, unlike in Williams\u2019 standup, there\u2019s too little countervailing humour.</p> <p>What makes Williams exciting as a comedian is the unresolved tensions between depression and still-flickering faith, between finding himself tragic and finding himself ridiculous. In a sense, his standup voice is made up of several competing voices, those waging the arguments in his head. In Travesty, only one of those voices is loudly heard, and for the want of the others, a more conventional bland of bleakness wins out.</p> <p>Watching the two \u2013 the sitcom and the play \u2013 reminded me of how difficult and delicate it is to hone a strong comic voice, and how we can\u2019t assume it\u2019s easily transferable. Acaster has spoken about the evolution of his own stage persona; he didn\u2019t emerge fully formed, as those of us who saw his early work can attest. It\u2019s just as difficult to develop the skills required of a playwright or sitcom writer \u2013 notwithstanding that Acaster and Williams\u2019 achievements as writer-performers give them a pretty good head-start. At their best, We the Jury and Travesty offer glimpses of two inimitable comic voices. In neither case is it enough to (yet) produce work anywhere near as accomplished as their standup.<br></p> <h2>Three to see</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cde2c30339d5728b58fecd1a5b28fbe36c962bf/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shape-shifters \u2026 The Pajama Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Pajama Men</strong><br></p> <p>A UK tour kicks off for one of the great double-acts in world comedy: the shape-shifting, darkly comic impro-sketch originals Mark Chavez and Shenoah Allen.

Yet there are two questions you get asked every single time, over and over again (by journalists, but also by normal people).<br></p> <p> The first question is always: \u201cHow did you come up with this idea?\u201d My most honest answer would be to admit that I don\u2019t know, or that I can\u2019t remember, or that I do remember but I don\u2019t want to say. But because this (totally reasonable) question is asked so persistently, I inevitably manufacture a semi-cogent response that feels halfway plausible, and I repeat that response until it feels like the true answer. I suppose it\u2019s possible that this rote reply is the true answer, and that I simply needed to work through the inquiry 25 times before realising this was the case. For example: whenever people ask me how I came up with the idea behind But What If We\u2019re Wrong? I almost always mention watching a specific TV series (Cosmos) while simultaneously reading about the life of a specific author (Herman Melville).</p> <p>Now, those two synchronised events did occur, and they seem like a plausible genesis for a workable idea. But part of me suspects I\u2019d actually been thinking about the concept of collective wrongness unconsciously for 30 years, and that this serendipitous moment was just the first time I decided to write a book about it. Maybe what I classify as the inception of the idea is actually the conclusion to that idea. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think most people who pose this question are particularly interested in the answer. It just seems like the proper thing to ask someone who\u2019s written a book.</p> <p> The second question is (to me) more fascinating, even though it seems far simpler: \u201cHow long did it take you to write this?\u201d It\u2019s a query that raises a lot of ancillary questions about the entire process. Am I writing if I\u2019m just thinking about writing, or is writing only the mechanical typing? Does stoically staring at a blank computer screen for two hours while drinking Mountain Dew count as creativity? If I come up with the vague idea for a novel in 1996 but don\u2019t write a word until autumn 2016, did the novel take 20 years or six months?</p> <p> I never know when the writing starts.</p> <p> This is further complicated by the fact that it often feels like my books are still being written even after they\u2019ve been released into the public and can no longer be altered. I recognise this makes no sense. When a book is physically assembled and made available in bookstores, it should be finished. The text is trapped under ice. Everything should be over. But in my experience, that is never the case. Once I\u2019ve published a book, I\u2019m asked an avalanche of questions about what certain passages suggest, or what my motives were, or if my work is autobiographical or metaphorical or was composed while on drugs. This is amplified by other people who write about my books and assert what they believe to be true about what I\u2019ve published, and then I\u2019m asked to respond to those arbitrary assertions. Obviously, these post-publication thoughts don\u2019t change what is typeset on the page. But to people who read these auxiliary sentiments before they read the book itself \u2013 and even to those readers who don\u2019t encounter these sentiments until after they\u2019ve finished \u2013 the book is contextually changed. Not a lot, but a little. Even if they disagree with what\u2019s being alleged, they can\u2019t un-know that this intellectual position exists. So it always feel like I\u2019m writing all my books in perpetuity, every time someone asks me a question about anything I\u2019ve written in the past. If I were smarter, I\u2019d live as a recluse. But I can\u2019t do it. </p> <p> I once saw a Black Sabbath promotional poster from the 1970s that declared: \u201cMore good reviews than most. More bad reviews than all.\u201d I relate to this. I\u2019m shocked by how often my books are reviewed, which (I know) I\u2019m supposed to be happy about, regardless of what the reviewers claim. But it will never stop seeming weird, despite the fact that I\u2019ve spent most of my life reviewing the works of others. It\u2019s a zero-sum game. Unless you\u2019re totally unknown, the content of a review has almost no influence on book sales; a great high-profile review will cause sales to negligibly spike upward for a week or two, but a really bad high-profile review paradoxically generates an almost identical commercial impact. My best-reviewed books have sold the fewest copies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/06/lisa-ls-hilton-maestra-erotic-bestseller-fiction-film\">LS Hilton: 'Everyone hated my erotic thriller'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, there\u2019s always an intangible sense that the response to a book somehow shapes what it actually is, and the more attention a book gets, the more it seems to drift away from whatever you originally imagined. This is disappointing. Of course, the goal of any good publisher is to get as much attention for a book as possible, which means a book only becomes successful when the author completely loses control over what that book means and what it signifies. The central contradiction between writing and publishing is that the former is a way to construct a reality, and the latter is a process of losing control over reality. But you can\u2019t complain about this, because this is how it goes: the disappointment is what they pay you for.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Melville publishes Moby-Dick in 1851, basing his narrative on the real-life 1839 account of a murderous sperm whale nicknamed \u201cMocha Dick\u201d. The initial British edition is around 900 pages. Melville, a moderately successful author at the time of the novel\u2019s release, assumes this book will immediately be seen as his masterwork. But the reviews are mixed, and some are contemptuous (\u201cIt repels the reader\u201d is the key takeaway from one of the very first reviews in the London Spectator). It sells poorly \u2013 at the time of Melville\u2019s death, total sales hover below 5,000 copies. The failure ruins Melville\u2019s life: he becomes an alcoholic and a poet and eventually a customs inspector. When he dies destitute in 1891, one has to assume his perspective on Moby-Dick is something along the lines of: \u2018Well I guess that didn\u2019t work. Maybe I should have spent fewer pages explaining how to tie complicated knots.\u2019 For the next 30 years, nothing about the reception of this book changes. But then [the first world war] happens and \u2013 somehow and for reasons that can\u2019t be totally explained \u2013 modernists living in postwar America start to view literature through a different lens. There is a Melville revival. The concept of what a novel is suppose to accomplish shifts in his direction and amplifies with each passing generation, eventually prompting people (like the 2005 director of Columbia University\u2019s American studies programme) to classify Moby-Dick as \u2018the most ambitious book ever conceived by an American writer\u2019. Pundits and cranks can disagree with that assertion, but no one cares if they do.</p> <p>Now, there\u2019s certainly a difference between collective, objective wrongness (eg: misunderstanding gravity for centuries) and collective, subjective wrongness (eg: not caring about Moby-Dick for 75 years). The machinations of the transitions are completely different. Yet both scenarios hint at a practical reality and a modern problem. The practical reality is that any present-tense version of the world is unstable. What we currently consider to be true \u2013 both objectively and subjectively \u2013 is habitually provisional. But the modern problem is that re-evaluating what we consider \u2018true\u2019 is becoming increasingly difficult.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>But What If We\u2019re Wrong? by Chuck Klosterman is published by Amberley Books at \u00a314.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/but-what-if-we-re-wrong.html\">It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a312.29</a>.</p>",
  "<h2>\u2018He will be remembered as the austerity prime minister\u2019<br></h2> <p>He came to office with the narrow-minded belief that everything must rotate around reducing the deficit. This has led to terrible consequences for the poor, for working families and for the public sector and public spending. His inability and unwillingness to deviate, even when his deficit-reducing policies and austerity measures were failing makes him one of the worst Prime Ministers this country has ever seen. </p> <p>Above all he will be remembered as the leader who who, through his own weakness and inability to unite his own MPs, led Britain out of the European Union. <br></p> <p>For short-term relief from the critics in his own party and to protect his own position he has placed the future of millions of Brits in peril.<strong><br>Stephen Nulty, Liverpool</strong><br></p> <h2>\u2018A smart operator but lightweight thinker\u2019</h2> <p>Cameron occasionally looked the part when at the dispatch box, if you count doing well as scoring smart one liners against the leader of the opposition \u2013 which he often did.

And all of this without a party\u2019s forceful desire for positive change that supported Blair as party leader and prime minister. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52df66b9056ebeb2da43f07a9fb38616a2b5edd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52df66b9056ebeb2da43f07a9fb38616a2b5edd1/0_54_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair and David Cameron during The State Opening of Parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair and David Cameron during The State Opening of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a real opportunist who thought, like Blair, that politics was about electoral success and the grinding of his enemies into the political dust.

My more tenacious Nigerian friends refuse to let their green passports stop them. To secure permission to travel in Europe, they queue, they print out their bank statements, they take the day off work to make their visa appointment, they take a second day off work because they forgot to bring a signed letter from their office, and they pay the visa fee. And all for a two-week pass into Europe.</p> <p>To Britons contemplating a life of more restricted travel, I reassure you that it\u2019s not all doom and bureaucracy. There are some perks. Say you\u2019re invited to an event in Europe, a family holiday or wedding for example, and you can\u2019t afford it, or you really just don\u2019t want to go. You can always say: \u201cCouldn\u2019t get my travel documents sorted out fast enough,\u201d and the matter magically ends there.</p> <p>Yet, perhaps my gloating is misplaced. We all know that freedom of movement is not equally applied to UK citizens. All British passports are equal, but some are more equal than others. The Olympic legend Mo Farah was one of the most recent British victims of travelling while black. Flying back from the Rio games <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/37331870\">he was sent to the back of the queue by an airline official</a> who, according to his wife, refused to believe he had a business class ticket.</p> <p>Also this year, my friend Laolu Opebiyi was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/03/man-removed-easyjet-flight-luton-prayer-message-phone\"> kicked off a flight</a> at Luton airport when a Christian prayer message on his phone sparked a terror alert. My sister, a mechanical engineering student at the time, with a valid ticket and ample proof of her identity, was kept in a detention area for hours in Miami, almost missing her flight. She was let go without any explanation for why she had been held. British Muslim women wearing headscarves have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/racist-profiling-bigotry-headscarf-flight\">similar experiences</a>.</p> <p>. If you\u2019re black, whatever the colour of your passport, you have your travel stories. The friend with dreadlocks who is always pulled aside for \u201crandom\u201d body searches; the relative with grandchildren in England who was told by immigration not to visit so often. We trade our stories, and then we laugh. You can slow us down, but you can\u2019t stop us moving.</p> <p>So, British people, welcome to the world of restricted travel. Fear not. You\u2019re in good company. Billions of people around the globe also have their movement across borders restricted. Yes, the forms can be a hassle. However, if you have all your paperwork in order, and evidence that you\u2019re a law-abiding sort, you\u2019ll get accustomed to the process. But woe betide those who go to Europe only to pick fights at foreign football stadiums. Your days of punching rival fans in France may be numbered.</p> <p>And who knows? Maybe filling out forms will make Britain more sympathetic to immigrants. I bet Nigel Farage didn\u2019t think of that.</p>",
  "<p>Edward Snowden has set out the case for Barack Obama granting him a pardon before the US president leaves office in January, arguing that the disclosure of the scale of surveillance by US and British intelligence agencies was not only morally right but had left citizens better off.</p> <p>The US whistleblower\u2019s comments, made in an interview with the Guardian, came as supporters, including his US lawyer, stepped up a campaign for a presidential pardon. Snowden is wanted in the US, where he is accused of violating the Espionage Act and faces at least 30 years in jail. </p> <p>Speaking on Monday via a video link from Moscow, where he is in exile, Snowden said any evaluation of the consequences of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">leak of tens of thousands of National Security Agency and GCHQ documents in 2013</a> would show clearly that people had benefited.</p> <p>\u201cYes, there are laws on the books that say one thing, but that is perhaps why the pardon power exists \u2013 for the exceptions, for the things that may seem unlawful in letters on a page but when we look at them morally, when we look at them ethically, when we look at the results, it seems these were necessary things, these were vital things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think when people look at the calculations of benefit, it is clear that in the wake of 2013 the laws of our nation changed. The [US] Congress, the courts and the president all changed their policies as a result of these disclosures. At the same time there has never been any public evidence that any individual came to harm as a result.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27362037c77da492e88d39e06c3f4cccaf08daa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27362037c77da492e88d39e06c3f4cccaf08daa8/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold placards supporting Snowden during a 2013 protest against government surveillance in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold placards supporting Snowden during a 2013 protest against government surveillance in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although US presidents have granted some surprising pardons when leaving office, the chances of Obama doing so seem remote, even though before he entered the White House he was a constitutional lawyer who often made the case for privacy and had warned about the dangers of mass surveillance.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s former attorney general Eric Holder, however, gave an unexpected boost to the campaign for a pardon in May when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/30/eric-holder-edward-snowden-nsa-leak-public-service\">said Snowden had performed a public service</a>. </p> <p>The campaign could receive a further lift from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/snowden\">Oliver Stone\u2019s film, Snowden</a>, scheduled for release in the US on Friday.

On Monday he said that at that time he expected a \u201cdark end\u201d in which he was either killed or jailed in the US.</p> <p>More than three years on, he appears cheerful and relaxed. He has avoided the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-judge-verdict\">fate of fellow whistleblower Chelsea Manning</a>, who is in solitary confinement in the US. Snowden is free to communicate with supporters and chats online late into the night. </p> <p>His 2.3 million followers on Twitter give him a huge platform to express his views. He works on tools to try to help journalists. He is not restricted to Moscow and has travelled around Russia, and his family in the US have been to visit him.</p> <p>But Snowden still wants to return to the US and seems confident, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, that it will happen. \u201cIn the fullness of time, I think I will end up back home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the officials, who felt like they had to protect the programmes, their positions, their careers, have left government and we start looking at things from a more historical perspective, it will be pretty clear that this war on whistleblowers does not serve the interests of the United States; rather it harms them.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden attracts lots of conspiracy theories. Early on, he was accused of being a spy for China and then a Russian spy. In August a cryptic tweet followed by an unusual absence prompted speculation that he was dead. He said he had simply gone on holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZgIkapmcOC\">pic.twitter.com/ZgIkapmcOC</a></p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765136486417231872\">August 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There had also been rumours that his partner, Lindsay Mills, had left him, which would have been embarrassing as their romance occupies a large part of the Stone film. Snowden said \u201cshe is with me and we are very happy\u201d.</p> <p>His revelations resulted in a global debate and modest legislative changes. More significant, perhaps, is that surveillance and the impact of technological change has seeped into popular culture, in films such as the latest Jason Bourne and television series, such as the Good Wife.</p> <p>Snowden also welcomed \u201ca renaissance of scepticism\u201d on the part of at least some journalists when confronted by anonymous briefings by officials not backed by evidence.<br></p> <p>He warned three years ago of the danger that one day there might be a president who abused the system. The warning failed to gain much traction, given that Obama\u2019s presidency seemed relatively benign. But it resonates more today, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s response to <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12298664/trump-dnc-hacking-power\">the Russian hacking of the Democratic party</a>: that he wished he had the power to hack into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.</p> <p>If Obama, as seems likely, declines to pardon Snowden, his chances under either Clinton or Trump would seem to be even slimmer. He described the 2016 presidential race as unprecedented \u201cin terms of the sort of authoritarian policies that are being put forward\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, many candidates in the political mainstream today, even pundits and commentators who aren\u2019t running for office, believe we have to be able to do anything, no matter what, as long as there is some benefit to be had in doing so.

It is a potentially risky move, given his application for an extension of asylum is up for renewal next year, so why do it?</p> <p>\u201cWell, it would not be the first time I have taken a risk for something I believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a complex situation. Russia is not my area of focus. It is not my area of expertise. I don\u2019t speak Russian in a fluent manner that I could really participate in and influence policy. But when something happens that I believe is clearly a violation of the right thing, I believe we should stand up and say something about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy priority always has to be my own country rather than Russia. I would like to help reform the human rights situation in Russia but I will never be well placed to do so relative to actual Russian activists themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Might he end up as part of a US-Russian prisoner exchange, with Putin possibly more amenable to the idea if Trump was in power? \u201cThere has always been the possibility that any government could say, \u2018Well, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of human rights, it does not really matter whether it is a violation of law, it will be beneficial to use this individual as a bargaining chip\u2019. This is not exclusive to me. This happens to activists around the world every day.\u201d</p> <p>He said he saw the Stone film as a mechanism for getting people to talk about surveillance, though he felt uncomfortable with other people telling his story.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4ty9f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2495625\"            data-video-name=\"Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Open Road Films\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5721dac1e4b02c55b6401323\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/28/160428snowden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11443130&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/28/160428snowden_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/28/160428snowden_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/28/160428snowden.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/28/edward-snowden-nsa-trailer-oliver-stone-thriller-video\">Snowden: the trailer for Oliver Stone\u2019s thriller</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Snowden has toyed with writing his memoirs but has not made much progress.

Then, four years later, I lost my job because my work permit had expired. It wouldn\u2019t take long before I lost my right to stay here, too. Now, I live here without papers.</p> <p>As a result of my unemployment, I couldn\u2019t renew my work permit. And I can\u2019t find a job without one. You get the picture. My petition for a green card has been unanswered for seven years. The last time I spoke to my immigration lawyer he advised me to get married, or leave.</p> <p>When the job went, my apartment soon followed. I moved in with a friend in a small town in the state of New York. We live in an old house and my two rescue dogs. They have certainly rescued me more than me them. </p> <p>I depend on my friend for everything. I moved in after his wife died. We spent much of the first year just trying to get along and find some kind of happy place to keep us floating. I take care of household work, cooking and cleaning, gardening, growing vegetables and other things. I recently started apprenticing with a shepherd at a farm nearby. I have also taken evening classes in upholstery, and, on occasion, I reupholster antiques and replicas. Some of my work has been featured in World of Interiors. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/dick-cheney-encouraged-father-defect-now-we-are-americans\">Dick Cheney encouraged my father to defect.

I have also worked as a \u201clive in\u201d construction manager at a friend\u2019s house in another state, spending my paycheck on train tickets to go home on weekends and pay rent.</p> <p>When I still had a valid work permit, I applied for hundreds of jobs, a lot of them hundreds of miles away from where I was, but I had no takers. To keep myself from going insane, I volunteered full time at an animal shelter for almost two years. I found the cure for my vulnerability was to help someone in worse trouble than I was. </p> <p>This life has been incredibly hard \u2013 and humbling. For the first time, I took comfort in the wisdom and advice of older people around me. I lost my world of privilege, and also my arrogance. I no longer consider myself unemployed.

  "<p>Coventry has been one of the lead cities in welcoming Syrian refugees. At first, the city planned to accept 50 of the most vulnerable, but is now home to around 250 refugees \u2013 living in around 60 properties. </p> <p>Coventry is an International City of Peace and Reconciliation, with the ruins of the bombed cathedral a constant reminder of the horrors of war. So when the city was asked to provide shelter for refugees from one of the most savage conflicts of our times the response was how do we do this well? not should we do this?<br></p> <p>But resettling Syrian refugees is not without its challenges. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/lack-uk-homes-schools-threatens-syrian-refugee-resettlement-2020\">Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has warned</a> that the future of the programme to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in Britain could be put at risk by a lack of 10,600 school places and nearly 5,000 suitable homes by 2020.</p> <h2>The greatest challenges</h2> <p>The availability of sustainable housing is our greatest challenge. We generally place refugees in private rented accommodation, but it is a constant struggle to find properties within local housing allowance; which is a calculation of how much housing benefit you can get to help pay the rent if you have a private landlord, and has different rules and restrictions to renting from a council or housing association. Furthermore, the benefits system applies to refugees just as it does other residents and the benefits cap will make life very difficult for some tenants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/13/refugees-coventry-welcome-councils-syrians\">The refugees being sent to Coventry are welcome | Lizzie Presser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We have had only one complaint to the council about refugees coming to the city and this related primarily to access to NHS services. We have also had one incident of anti-social behaviour (graffiti), and the issue has attracted some negative comments online when the local media has reported on refugee resettlement. But these incidents have been massively outnumbered by the large numbers of local people who have gone out of their way to make their new neighbours feel welcome.</p> <p>This week we are talking to landlords and faith organisations about how we can work together to support new arrivals and increase the level of available housing now funding from the Home Office is more assured and sustained.<br></p> <h2>Helping refugee children integrate</h2> <p>Many refugee children have had long breaks in their schooling or none at all. Coventry schools have been the quiet success of our resettlement programme; they are used to admitting children who have little or no English. After a full term, primary aged pupils are usually integrating well and picking up English, after a full year the change is remarkable. </p> <p>Older children are more of a challenge. Colleges generally only admit refugee young people to study English and they have to be a certain standard to get accepted. We have placed approximately 70 children in school up to the end of the last school year and we are now working with the Positive Youth Foundation to provide more secondary spaces so more can be accepted into further education.</p> <p>Refugees have been through experiences which are hard for us to imagine, with some having been shot or involved in explosions and many having suffered imprisonment or torture. Almost all of our families have been forced to flee at short notice often with only the possessions they could carry. </p> <p>And most families are mums with children where the father is dead or missing and many have medical problems that need specialist care or routine treatment. Another frustration for many refugees is trying to be reunited with loved ones, such as older siblings who have been left behind.</p> <h2>Access to language skills and employment</h2> <p>The whole programme relies on interpreters provided by social enterprise Lingo Links. Very few of the adult Syrians in Coventry speak English on arrival and we have increased the amount of tuition available to help them become independent.</p> <p>Many Syrian people want to work as soon as possible and support their families and we are also working hard to help this. We are very pleased that some of our early arrivals are now in work. </p> <p>The overwhelming sense we have in the city is about how we have pulled together \u2013 voluntary sector agencies, schools, the police and NHS. Our faith communities have also been incredibly generous and supportive with the Bishop of Coventry and the Muslim community in particular making sure there is a warm welcome for refugees.</p> <p><em>Councillor Abdul Khan is deputy leader of Coventry city council.</em><br></p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

  "<p>Canada\u2019s early exit from 2018 World Cup qualifying should spark many questions in any rigorous postmortem. The glaringly obvious are rarely asked: why do Canadian teams play in Major League Soccer, and how exactly does Canadian soccer benefit?</p> <p>It\u2019s a question the most powerful man in Canadian soccer \u2013 who now also happens to be the most powerful man at Concacaf \u2013 is thinking about. And Victor Montagliani, Soccer Canada\u2019s president and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/concacaf-president-vincent-montagliani-interview-fifa-corruption\">recently elected head of Concacaf</a>, is not happy with the answers.</p> <p>Montagliani warns that unless a critical issue is addressed \u2013 that Canadian players are treated as equal to Americans under MLS rules \u2013 Soccer Canada may take sweeping and dramatic action to block Toronto FC, Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps from continuing to play in the league.</p> <p>\u201cIt is always going to create a glass ceiling when a Canadian passport makes you a second-class citizen in a league where three of your teams play,\u201d says Montagliani. \u201cWe have been trying to address the issue but it has been frustratingly slow. Until that is dealt with, it is always going to be a challenge to put the Canadian flag equal to the American flag in MLS. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/05/concacaf-president-vincent-montagliani-interview-fifa-corruption\">Concacaf president Victor Montagliani: 'There has been a shitstorm here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big issue for Canadian soccer is an MLS rule that declares American players as \u201cdomestic\u201d regardless of whether they play for teams north or south of the border, while Canadian players are designated \u201cinternational\u201d if they play for an MLS team on American soil.</p> <p>This is great for American players \u2013 more teams equals more opportunities \u2013 but terrible for Canadians. They face unlimited challenges from Americans for roster places in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver and are considered equal to a midfielder from Ghana or Belize when a coach of an American team is balancing his roster. MLS rules designate eight spots per club for international players although those slots may be traded between teams in exchange for other roster benefits. </p> <p>The numbers tell the story: according to MLS, of the possible 560 roster places available on MLS teams, just 24 are taken by Canadian players. Just five of those play for non-Canadian teams. The balance is so skewed, the math is worth checking again and again. But it\u2019s true. Canadian teams make up 15% of the league but only just over four percent of the league\u2019s players are Canadian. </p> <p>League executives pitch the positives of Canada\u2019s presence in MLS. Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal contribute stability, MLS market growth, league expansion, more opportunities for players, and excellent local stadiums such as TFC\u2019s purpose-built BMO Field. There\u2019s a good argument that MLS in Canada benefits everyone. Unless, you are Canadian.</p> <p>In New York, the MLS president Mark Abbott sees only sunshine: \u201cWe have created lots of opportunities for Canadian players that did not exist before those teams were there. The investment that each of our teams are making in player development, if not exclusively focussed on Canadian players, is also a benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott says \u201cimmigration laws in the United States don\u2019t allow us to treat Canadian players as domestic in the US.\u201d However, Bob Foos, executive director of the MLS players union, says the issue is MLS not wanting to challenge US discrimination laws and expose the league to a potential lawsuit.</p> <p>\u201cIn essence, [if MLS claimed Canadian players as domestic] you would be discriminating against non-Canadian people in the US in favor of Canadians,\u201d says Foos. \u201cIt is one thing to say you need to be a US citizen or a green card holder to be considered domestic. It is another thing to say if you\u2019re Canadian you have these rights and if you\u2019re not Canadian you have different rights.\u201d</p> <p>But the disparity cuts deep into Canadian soccer, especially for youth development at a time Canadian soccer is desperate to improve its national team. Tim Bezbatchenko, the general manager at Toronto FC, is an American whose previous roles at MLS head office included acting as a liaison between MLS and Canada Soccer. He believes under current regulations Canadian MLS teams are running expensive youth academies for players that have nowhere to go.</p> <p>\u201cOur players are less desirable for US teams,\u201d Bezbatchenko says. \u201cWe put a lot of money into our academy system but the players we are developing have limited roster spots. If there is an additional restriction, that is an impediment for those Canadian players to move to the US That impacts our team and our budget and the way that we operate our roster.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, MLS announced expansion into Canada by announcing the arrival of Toronto FC. The new team would be run by Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment \u2013 an organization that also owns Toronto\u2019s professional hockey and basketball teams, the Maple Leafs and Raptors.</p> <p>Cross-border teams are not unusual in North America. The NHL has Canadian teams as do, to a lesser extent, the NBA and MLB. In soccer, crossed borders are unusual. Australia\u2019s A-League includes New Zealand\u2019s Wellington Phoenix while England\u2019s football competitions include teams from Wales. We could argue whether Monaco, with a team in Ligue 1, is actually part of France.</p> <p>\u201cThe league benefits from having strong markets with strong owners and great stadiums,\u201d Mark Abbott says and, while Toronto\u2019s Bezbatchenko has issues with the player status rules, he echoes MLS\u2019s enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at attendance, [Canadian teams] have some of the most passionate fans in MLS,\u201d he says. \u201cAdd the money we are investing in our academies and ownership that believes soccer will be the biggest sport in North America. The league wants to grow and it sees new markets where it can grow. It is important for MLS to be in the biggest markets in North America.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Foos, from the players union, agrees: \u201cIt is very logical from an economic perspective as to why it would be good to have teams from Canada in the league. I think that has borne itself out. They have all been good markets.\u201d<br></p> <p>Canada has been great for MLS on many levels, many of them financial. Just not so great for Canada\u2019s MLS players. It\u2019s not just young academy players or mid-level midfielders who struggle. Even the country\u2019s top players \u2013 those MLS should want to attract to its teams \u2013 feel shut out. <br></p> <p>Kuala Terengganu, population 400,000, is a city on the east coast of Malaysia. In good traffic, it\u2019s about a six-hour bus ride to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital. Thirty-two-year-old Issey Nakajima-Farran, born in Calgary, is one of just two foreigners who play for Terengganu FA, the local professional team that competes in the Malaysian Super League.</p> <p>Nakajima-Farran has played 37 times for Canada during a club career that has taken him from Singapore\u2019s S League to Denmark\u2019s Superliga, and a season with Brisbane Roar under current Australia coach Ange Postecoglou in the A-League. He can also add stints with both Toronto FC and Montreal Impact in MLS. </p> <p>Nakajima-Farran knows the ropes of the sub-superstar professional soccer circuit. However, his time in Canada during the 2014 season was a confusing disaster. He played just five times for Toronto, scoring three goals, before being surprised on his birthday with an overnight trade to Montreal Impact. </p> <p>\u201cI was like, hell, no,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me to go to Montreal. I don\u2019t want to go there. I love it here!\u201d</p> <p>Nakajima-Farran said, approaching 30, he quit Europe \u2013 he was playing in Cyprus at the time \u2013 for Toronto to play out his career at home. He liked the idea where, as a national team player, he might be regarded the way he\u2019d seen local players treated in leagues he\u2019d played in abroad. National team players, he observed, are used as role models and \u201chave a reputation and get respect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I experienced it, it wasn\u2019t about the Canadian players,\u201d Nakajima-Farran says. \u201cIt was about the American league exploiting the Canadian cities. I would understand it if the Canadian teams were bringing in young players and promoting them but Toronto was bringing these American guys back. Even Montreal was trying to replace me with an American guy.\u201d </p> <p>Montreal Impact proved no different and, after one season, Nakajima-Farran left for Malaysia. He is cautious to criticize, claiming he doesn\u2019t want important issues for Canadian soccer to be clouded by sounding like a disgruntled former player whose deal didn\u2019t work out. But he says he\u2019s not alone. During his time with the Canadian national team, players talked about MLS. Team-mates, many who played abroad, were envious he had a MLS deal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a19af6db0eb26c6d2ce46f9f45564713baa214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a19af6db0eb26c6d2ce46f9f45564713baa214/0_0_3538_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando City\u2019s Cyle Larin is one of few Canadian players to play for American MLS clubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orlando City\u2019s Cyle Larin is one of few Canadian players to play for American MLS clubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jae C. Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Canadian boys had been together for a long time,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you play with guys who have gone through the same system, you have respect for each other. We had always wanted to play together in a domestic league. We thought that would be Toronto, Vancouver, or Montreal. It would make sense. But there is no respect for Canadian players in MLS.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Abbott says that at its conception, MLS wanted to create interdependence between the US national team and the same concept applies to Canada: \u201cThe league would work hard to provide opportunities for American players and, by the same token, the league would benefit from the national team\u2019s success. I think we have seen that play out over the last 20 or so years. </p> <p>\u201cThere is an opportunity to contribute to the growth of Canadian soccer in a variety of different ways: providing playing opportunities and investing in player development programs focussed on players that live in Canada. As you elevate the opportunity for Canadian players, we believe the Canadian national team will benefit from that.\u201d</p> <p>The actual benefits are debatable. Canada\u2019s starting lineup for its last World Cup qualifier against El Salvador featured just two players from Canadian MLS teams - Marcel de Jong (Vancouver Whitecaps) and Tosaint Ricketts (Toronto FC). Striker Cyle Larin plays for Orlando City. By contrast, the United States team against Trinidad &amp; Tobago included six starters from MLS. It\u2019s worth noting that skipper Michael Bradley and striker Jozy Altidore play for Toronto FC.</p> <p>Montagliani says that when Canada Soccer signed off on MLS operating clubs within its jurisdiction (a national federation, as well as the regional confederation, and FIFA must approve cross-border participation in leagues) the intention was for many Canadian players to be on the teams. </p> <p>\u201cThat never came to fruition,\u201d he says. \u201cMLS still hasn\u2019t dealt with the issue of treating Canadian players equal to American players. The truth is that if there was no protection for the American player like there is I bet there would be less American players in MLS. That protectionist attitude has helped the American player. Good on them but it definitely hasn\u2019t helped the Canadian player. MLS has a duty to clubs in both countries. I think they are sincere but I don\u2019t think they wake up in the morning and the first thing they think about is how they can help the Canadian players.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, MLS in Canada might be moot if a pro soccer league existed in the country. There is the the semi-pro Canadian Soccer League made up of teams from Ontario. That competition <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/11932437/Revealed-Entire-rogue-league-corrupted-by-match-fixing.html\">was embroiled in a 2009 match-fixing controversy</a> and decertified by Canada Soccer in 2013. An investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is ongoing.</p> <p>Soccer officials highlight several challenges facing any professional Canadian league including geography, population size, and travel expenses. Australia, however, with comparable obstacles, has carved out a professional league that is both a talent pipeline for its national team and a legitimate attraction for (ageing) international stars like Alessandro Del Piero, Robbie Fowler, and Dwight Yorke.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible but where are you going to get the players?\u201d asks union boss Bob Foose. \u201cIt is going to be of a substantially lower quality. If you are going to put together 10 or 12 teams I don\u2019t think you are going to find the volume of guys.\u201d </p> <p>Montagliani believes a Canadian professional league will be launched within five years. Canada Soccer is currently evaluating how such a competition will operate in conjunction with the five Canadian teams that play in MLS and NASL. While he is bullish about withdrawing approval for MLS to operate in Canada, he hopes to announce \u201cby the end of the year\u201d a solution about player status rules that will see more Canadian players in MLS teams south of the border.</p> <p>\u201cThere is some movement with MLS where a Canadian player has an opportunity other than just with three teams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is an opportunity where players who come through the system are going to be considered domestics on both side of the ledger. With a pro league, a lot of the challenges can always be overcome by money.\u201d</p> <p>It is unlikely Canada\u2019s MLS teams will participate in a national league, however.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is no reason to foresee any change,\u201d says Toronto\u2019s Tim Bezbatchenko, adding he can see a place for Toronto FC\u2019s reserve side in a future Canadian league. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think the more players that can be playing professionally and earning a living in Canada is going to help the national team more,\u201d Bezbatchenko says. \u201cIf you have more coaches, more administrators, more strength and conditioning coaches and more people staying in the game, then you have a wider net that is going to help the game grow.\u201d<br></p> <p>Canada last appeared at a World Cup in 1986 in Mexico. They are currently <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/\">No100 in Fifa\u2019s rankings</a>, just one place above Haiti (Canada\u2019s women are ranked fourth in the world but that is another story). Many reasons are given for the national team\u2019s mediocrity: a dysfunctional youth system, a lack of qualified coaches failure to attract talented dual citizens over the country of their parents or grandparents, the team\u2019s lack of national identity; and, believe it or not, the weather.</p> <p>But if World Cup qualifying results are any evidence, MLS has not helped Canada\u2019s national team to any degree. In fact, in a results-based business like professional soccer, if MLS is supposed to boost Canada\u2019s national team, the league should be fired. The issues run deep and affect the current generation of players and fans - as well as the next.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was so disappointed after all those years in Europe and Australia to come back and see Toronto was not a Canadian team,\u201d says Nakajima-Farran. \u201cIt is an American team in a Canadian city.

  "<p>After lab-grown meat, get ready for animal-free cow\u2019s milk. A San-Francisco startup believes it has found a solution for the guilty conscience of consumers who love eating dairy ice-cream, cheese and yoghurt, but oppose factory-style farming and its environmental footprint.</p> <p>Through a combination of yeast, cow DNA and plant nutrients, Perfect Day claims to have created a product identical in taste and nutritional value to cow\u2019s milk, but without any udders involved.<br></p> <p>Sales of milk alternatives such as soy, coconut, almond and more recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/25/pea-milk-non-dairy-ripple-france-environment\">pea milk</a> are expected to be worth more than <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-markets-for-milk-alternatives-300293746.html\">$10bn</a> by 2019. But until now they have not cut traditional milk and dairy production.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe alternatives for yoghurt, cheese and ice-cream are so bad that people don\u2019t even want to try them,\u201d says Perfect Day co-founder Ryan Pandya. \u201cMany have been switching to more plant-based diets but when you have to give up cheese you think \u2018oh my god my life sucks I love pizza\u2019. If you try to make cheese out of pea milk you will be sorely disappointed.\u201d<br></p> <p>The missing ingredient in plant-based alternatives is milk protein. To make the animal-free cow\u2019s milk, Perfect Day insert cow DNA \u2013 which is readily available thanks to decades of research by the dairy industry \u2013 into yeast and add sugar to create milk proteins through fermentation. These milk proteins are then combined with sugar, fats and nutrients to create the final product.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking plant nutrients and transforming them into animals proteins the same way that cows do, using the same milk proteins as found in cow\u2019s milk, but much more efficiently, because we\u2019re using a yeast cell not a 2,000lb animal,\u201d said Pandya.<br></p> <p>Although comparisons have been made with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/05/world-first-synthetic-hamburger-mouth-feel\">lab-grown meat</a>, Pandya said they are not using novel technology. \u201cMany people initially go \u2018oh is this like lab or test-tube milk\u2019, but that\u2019s wrong. There are no test tubes in our fermentation process it\u2019s just like brewing craft beer. The meat folks are trying to invent technology that doesn\u2019t exist today, but our milk is made through techniques in use for more than three decades.\u201d<br></p> <p>While there is no sign yet of a commercial lab-grown meat product, Perfect Day said it plans to launch a cheese, yoghurt or ice-cream product by the end of 2017, with milk following later. It will be priced similar to organic dairy, but the company expects to quickly have a lower cost of production than milk.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The startup has already raised $4m from investors and been in talks, perhaps surprisingly, with a number of traditional dairy companies. \u201cThe assumption was that we\u2019d be hated by the dairy industry but it\u2019s actually the opposite. They see us as the long-term solution to problems they didn\u2019t even know were solvable,\u201d said Pandya.<br></p> <p>Those problems include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\">water pollution</a> and climate change. The world\u2019s quarter of a billion dairy cows are responsible for <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e.pdf\">just under 3%</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.animalfreemilk.com/files/PD-LCA.pdf\">study commissioned</a> by Perfect Day found its animal-free milk uses approximately 24\u00ad-84% lower energy use, 98% lower water use, 77-\u00ad91% lower land use, and 35\u00ad-65% lower emissions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Rather than bringing to an end traditional dairy farming, Pandya expects their milk product to help negate the need for ever more intensive dairy farm systems. \u201cWe\u2019re here to create another option for people. There is more and more demand for dairy and that is causing increasing factory farming. Everyone agrees we should do less of that and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll actually be able to do.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, it seems unlikely they will be able to call their new product cow or dairy milk. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration said a product labelled as dairy milk needed to involve the \u201ccomplete milking of one or more healthy cows\u201d. If a food does not meet these standards then it must be labelled \u201cwith a common or usual name or an appropriately descriptive term, and the labelling must be truthful and not misleading\u201d.<br></p>",

  "<p>Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister has called for Hungary to be thrown out of the European Union over its increasingly hostile approach to refugees, as campaigners accuse Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hardline government of whipping up xenophobia to block a European plan to relocate asylum seekers. </p> <p>Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be temporarily or even permanently expelled from the EU for treating asylum seekers \u201cworse than wild animals\u201d.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article158094135/Asselborn-fordert-Ausschluss-Ungarns-aus-der-EU.html\">interview with German daily Die Welt</a>, he said: \u201cAnyone who, like Hungary, builds fences against refugees from war or who violates press freedom and judicial independence should be excluded temporarily, or if necessary for ever, from the EU.\u201d </p> <p>Asselborn called for EU rules to be changed to make it easier to expel Hungary as this was \u201cthe only way of preserving the cohesion and values of the European Union\u201d. </p> <p>Hungary\u2019s foreign affairs and trade minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 dismissed Asselborn as \u201can intellectual lightweight\u201d and his comments as \u201csermonising, pompous and frustrated\u201d.</p> <p>He said only Hungarians have the right to decide who they wish to live with, adding that no Brussels bureaucrat can deprive them of this right.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/only-hungarians-themselves-have-the-right-to-decide-who-they-wish-to-live-with\">In a statement issued by the Hungarian government</a>, Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 added: \u201cIt is somewhat curious that Jean Asselborn and Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 who both come from the country of tax optimisation \u2013 speak about jointly sharing burdens.

It links migration to increased terrorism and refers to non-existent \u2018no-go\u2019 areas in European cities with large migrant populations, including London, Paris and Berlin, where authorities have allegedly lost control and where law and order is absent.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cSixty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Hungarians obtained sanctuary from persecution in other parts of Europe and North America. If the Hungarian government reminded itself and Hungarians about that history, it might help create a more positive and welcoming attitude towards those from Syria and elsewhere seeking safety in Hungary today.\u201d</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s hardline rhetoric on refugees left it isolated during the peak of the refugee crisis in September 2015, but in the year since, Orb\u00e1n has become an increasingly pivotal figure in European policy. Austria, which initially followed Germany by responding compassionately to refugees, now stands with Hungary in calling for an Australian-style solution to the refugee crisis. </p> <p>\u201cIn September, Orb\u00e1n was the bad guy,\u201d Gerald Knaus, head of the Berlin-based thinktank the European Stability Initiative, told the Guardian earlier this month. \u201cYet by the end of the year he was the leader of a coalition of states. And with Austria now taking the lead on arguing for an Australian-style system, it\u2019s now Germany that is isolated.\u201d</p> <p>But Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision goes far beyond simply repelling immigrants. In a speech made last year, Orb\u00e1n hailed what he saw as the demise of liberal Europe. \u201cWe are experiencing now the end of an era: a conceptual-ideological era,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told supporters last autumn. \u201cPutting pretension aside, we can simply call this the era of liberal babble. This era is now at an end.\u201d</p> <p>A week ago, Orb\u00e1n continued this argument at a press conference with the rightwing Polish politician Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, in which he called for Europe and its institutions to be reworked in favour of a rightwing vision. \u201cWe are at a historic cultural moment,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n. \u201cThere is a possibility of a cultural counter-revolution right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>NWA\u2019s first EP was called Panic Zone. Released in 1987, it features Dope Man, a song written by a teenage Ice Cube that foreshadowed the group\u2019s sound and image to come. It alternately glamorizes and condemns the drug pusher and his lifestyle, ending with a stern warning voiced by Mexican-American rapper Krazy Dee: \u201cYou sold crack to my sister and now she\u2019s sick / But if she happens to die because of your drug / I\u2019m putting in your culo a .38 slug.\u201d<br></p> <p>For Dr Dre, the group\u2019s main producer, it was his first use of the \u201cfunky worm\u201d, the high-pitched, irresistible Moog synthesizer sound whose name was coined from a song by the 70s funk group Ohio Players. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/17/george-clinton-listen-conversation-with-alexis-petridis\">George Clinton: funk legend talks to Alexis Petridis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sound was next heard on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/09/nwa-admitted-to-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-at-ceremony-mired-by-bad-blood\">NWA\u2019s second full-length album</a>, 1991\u2019s Efil4zaggin (Niggaz 4 Life spelled backward), the first gangsta rap album to hit No1. Efil4zaggin marks a great leap forward in Dr Dre\u2019s production skills. Whereas their previous album Straight Outta Compton was all over the place sonically, Efil is mostly unified in its doomsday grooves. Always into Something is a slow-building sonic masterpiece, kicking off with a spoken word MC Ren introduction and a quick Dre verse before unveiling the alien-sounding, high-pitched synthesizer sound, similar to the \u201cfunky worm\u201d. In the studio, Dre was hoping to capture the magic of Parliament-Funkadelic member Bernie Worrell\u2019s eerie, melodic keyboard sounds, and so he had engineer Colin Wolfe go out and buy a Moog.</p> <p>Following the album Dre left NWA and its label Ruthless Records, owing to a money dispute with Eazy-E, who owned the label, and NWA\u2019s manager, Jerry Heller. Dre recorded the first half of his solo debut The Chronic (which came out near the end of 1992) at his Calabasas house, in a bedroom he\u2019d converted into a studio. After a fire there, the rest was made at Solar\u2019s Galaxy studios, where he made use of a state-of-the-art SSL console, a huge, futuristic mixing board with pre-programmable \u201cflying faders\u201d capable of automatically adjusting itself to your preferred settings. \u201cIt was like the Starship Enterprise,\u201d producer Rhythm D, who worked with Death Row for a time, told me. </p> <p>Yet it was still the pre-digital era, and so they edited on analog tapes, literally cutting them by hand. \u201cYou would mark the tape with a grease pencil and then use a razor blade,\u201d remembered Chris \u201cThe Glove\u201d Taylor, an engineer and musician on the album.</p> <p>More than ever, Dre was finding inspiration in Parliament-Funkadelic. He again used the Moog to create both a chunky bass effect using different settings and the \u201cfunky worm\u201d squeal. It\u2019s that enchanting, high-pitched whine that is the signature sound of The Chronic. It\u2019s melodic, it\u2019s somewhat terrifying, it instantly makes your ears prick up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1c7c285e20aea5569e0e79c478cd83db213b060/0_76_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone Pictures USA / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was also the perfect, terrifying sound for Chronic diss track Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody\u2019s Celebratin\u2019). The song\u2019s venom was directed at Eazy\u2011E, starting with a skit preceding the video, in which Eazy is portrayed by comedian AJ Johnson as a locs-clad, Jheri-curled Uncle Tom being sold a load of BS from Heller, played by portly Interscope executive Steve Berman. Over the bass-rattling, slow funk track, Dre took direct aim at Eazy: \u201cUsed to be my homie, used to be my ace / Now I want to slap the taste out your mouth / Make you bow down to the Row / Fuckin\u2019 me, now I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you, little ho. Eazy was no longer respected by his own people, he went on, and should watch his back because he might get smoked.\u201d</p> <p>Backed by emerging rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, the album featured Dre sampling or interpolating a half dozen songs from either Parliament or Funkadelic, sister groups that were both led by George Clinton. Dre\u2019s genius was realizing how well they\u2019d combine with rap lyrics. Part of the connection was emotional. P-Funk\u2019s psychedelic rock was cutting edge, but to those who grew up in the 70s it was also warm and nostalgic, the soundtrack to back-yard parties and civil rights rallies. Combining it with the rough-and-tumble lyrics of gangsta rap merged the hard and the soft, the light and the dark. The sound was called G-funk \u2013 gangsta funk \u2013 and it would come to dominate hip-hop for years.</p> <p>What made G-funk so effective? An LA musician named D\u00e2m-Funk \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/03/dam-funk-snoop-dogg-stones-throw-hudson-mohawke-ariel-pink\">a keytar-toting funk revivalist who collaborated with Snoop on the 2013 album 7 Days of Funk</a> \u2013 put it well. He told me that, for many who grew up on Parliament-Funkadelic, the sound came to symbolize a halcyon time before crack cocaine came along in the early 80s and decimated the inner city. D\u00e2m-Funk cites Funkadelic\u2019s 1979 song Not Just (Knee Deep), which Dre would later sample for a Tupac track, as \u201calmost like the end credits rolling on a certain era.</p> <p>\u201cBecause, before that, there wasn\u2019t crack,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd then that era came, and a lot of people got lost after that. You can almost feel it in the music that something was on the horizon ... It symbolizes happiness and sadness. That\u2019s what the funk is.\u201d</p> <h2>Who invented G-funk?</h2> <p>Who invented G-funk? Though Dr Dre is its most famous purveyor, the question is controversial.</p> <p>DJ Quik, who emerged in the early 90s, has long been injecting serious funk into his hip-hop, and was undoubtedly influential on Dre\u2019s sound. But it was the Ruthless gangsta rap group Above the Law that would directly claim credit for the G-funk sound, offering as evidence their early 1993 sophomore album Black Mafia Life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7a24dafa6f7cd6d0aef809ae768c92da581a7f/0_164_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"D\u00e2m-Funk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">D\u00e2m-Funk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That work wasn\u2019t a massive hit like The Chronic, but the albums bear some clear similarities: Nuthin\u2019 But a G Thang echoes Above the Law\u2019s Never Missin\u2019 a Beat, for example, while their Pimp Clinic and Dre\u2019s Let Me Ride both borrow from Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s take on the spiritual Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and, let me ride.</p> <p>Black Mafia Life was released in early 1993, about two months after The Chronic, but, according to many accounts, was finished beforehand. \u201cG-funk was our style of music,\u201d said Above the Law collaborator Kokane, adding that group producers Cold 187um and KMG the Illustrator forged the sound.</p> <p>During Dre\u2019s final months at Ruthless, he worked on NWA\u2019s Efil4zaggin while Cold 187um was simultaneously working on Black Mafia Life, and the pair often sounded each other out. It was during this period that he fashioned the G-funk sound, said Cold 187um. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that G-funk was my theory,\u201d he said. Dre \u201cutilized it and made lots of money and commercialized it, and I never got credit for it. All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All I wanted was my credit. I don\u2019t think he was being malicious. I think he heard a hot sound and then he used it</p> <footer> <cite>Cold 187um</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many agree with this version of events, including Eazy-E. \u201cDre stole that style,\u201d he told writer Phyllis Pollack. \u201cDre stole stuff from Above the Law, Black Mafia Life\u2019s Never Missing a Beat.\u201d NWA promoter Doug Young agreed that Above the Law had the sound first. But Dre, he added, deserves credit for turning G-funk into the powerhouse it became. \u201cWhen you listen to that stuff to this day, it still holds up because of the sonics of the production,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The dispute caused tension between Ruthless and Death Row to nearly boil over. In February 1993, at an industry event called the Urban Network Power Jam held at the Marriott Hotel near LAX, Cold 187um angrily approached Warren G, Dr Dre\u2019s stepbrother. Warren G would later become famous for his song with Nate Dogg, Regulate, and had worked closely on The Chronic. Warren had also previously stayed, for a time, at Cold 187um\u2019s crash pad in Colton, California, along with members of Above the Law. Warren and Cold187um had previously been friendly, but now there was tension in the air. According to Cold187um, a dispute erupted:</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up how motherfuckers just integrated our style into they shit and created The Chronic,\u201d Cold 187um said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, that\u2019s between you and Dre,\u201d Warren responded.</p> <p>\u201cWait a minute man, I let you stay at my house, I let you be a part of my family, and you treat me like this?\u201d said Cold 187um. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with that, you ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me no more.\u201d</p> <p>Warren was accompanied by fellow Death Row affiliates Snoop Dogg, Lil\u2019 \u00bd Dead, and others. Cold 187um was backed by artists including Eazy-E and an artist Eazy was recruiting at the time \u2013 Tupac Shakur, about two years before he signed with Death Row. </p> <p>The camps got to barking at each other, and before long everyone reached for their guns. \u201cThere were 15 of them, and about 25 to 30 of us,\u201d remembered Charis Henry, Eazy-E\u2019s assistant. \u201cIt was a standoff. It was the most nerve-racking thing imaginable.\u201d No one pulled the trigger. A bodyguard named Hollywood \u2013 who had worked with both camps \u2013 interceded. \u201cI need you, Death Row, to turn around, drop your guns, and walk out the door,\u201d he said, in Henry\u2019s recollection. \u201c[Eazy], I need you to wait for 15 minutes, and then take yourself home.\u201d Both sides complied, and the situation resolved peacefully.</p> <p>The G-funk drama was far from over, however. </p> <h2>\u2018You rollin\u2019 with Ruthless\u2019</h2> <p>Producer Rhythm D smelled the stench of defeat when he walked into Eazy\u2011E\u2019s Norwalk home around this time. Morale was low. Bodyguards were lying around on couches, while Ruthless affiliates watched LaserDiscs from Eazy\u2019s library or were out driving his luxury cars. The house boasted a top-of-the-line studio, armed with equipment like a brand new E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler. But nobody was using it.</p> <p>Rhythm D had come over to play Eazy his beats. It was something of an audition for the tall, light-skinned South Central producer, whose career was on the rise thanks to his hit track for Los Angeles rapper Paperboy, Ditty. During his brief dalliance with Death Row, Rhythm D also made a song for the Deep Cover soundtrack called Down with My Nigga, featuring rapper Paradise. But he was broke and anxious for his next payday. To Eazy\u2019s house he brought with him a green tackle box. Rather than fishing lures, it held a floppy disk of his beats.</p> <p>While Rhythm cued up his songs, Eazy ducked into the shower. He seemed to have only half his mind on the proceedings. Undaunted, Rhythm plugged in his speakers and played a beat. It featured him and producer Battlecat going back and forth, trying to outdo each other with samples. The track had a wild energy about it, which Eazy felt immediately. He jumped out of the shower, hair all crazy, throwing on a towel and running into the room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0c2d68f918c5aa2941a1d6e48fd6b3e7054ef4/5_0_595_744/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerry Heller with Eazy-E of NWA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruthless Record</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou rollin\u2019 with Ruthless,\u201d he exclaimed, signing Rhythm to a deal on the spot. Rhythm immediately moved into the house and got to work. Now that Dre was gone, his job description was Ruthless\u2019s newest in-house producer.</p> <p>Rhythm quickly realized he would have to do more than just make songs \u2013 he was going to have to shake Eazy out of his creative coma. He wasn\u2019t himself lately. The conflicts with Dre and Death Row leader Suge Knight had taken a toll.</p> <p>Eazy\u2019s first instinct was to craft a diss record scathing enough to send Dre scurrying under a rock. But his timing was bad. In this pre-YouTube era, rap beef moved at the speed of molasses. Eazy\u2019s last EP, 5150: Home 4 tha Sick, came out just a few days before The Chronic dropped, and didn\u2019t address Dre by name. It sold only a bit more than 500,000 copies, a flop considering Eazy\u2019s previous platinum sales history. </p> <p>Rhythm D had sat in on The Chronic recording sessions and had a strong feeling that G-funk was about to take over. After much arguing, he convinced Eazy that their Fuck wit Dre Day response should include the haunting new gangsta sound. But what about the song\u2019s message? How could they hit Dre back where it hurt?</p> <p>Rhythm lit up a fat one and got to thinking. Sure, Dre was practically untouchable right now, from a musical perspective. But there was a big difference between sounding like a gangsta and being a gangsta. To the guys in the streets, this was not incidental.</p> <p>They needed to convince these guys that Dre was phony, an opportunist. After all, not long ago, while Eazy was out selling crack and getting into trouble, Dre was dancing on stage and wearing makeup and fitted suits in his first group, called World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru. Eazy was authentic. He was real. It was time to drive that point home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a7b57957fde28c547070896c5db8721580b250/166_595_2085_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rhythm stayed up all night one night in 1993, fashioning the template for the song that would become Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s, or, on the radio, Real Compton City G\u2019s.</p> <p>Mirroring the tempo of Dre Day, the track also features a high-pitched Moog squeal. But it sounds even more intimidating, owing largely to Eazy\u2019s performance. The pace of Real Muthaphuckkin G\u2019s suited him, and his own eerie instrument-a \u201cdemonic, gnome type of voice\u201d, Rhythm D called it \u2013 fit the track\u2019s tone. And so, in the studio, Eazy launched into a series of disses and rebuttals. (\u201cAll of the sudden Dr Dre is the G thang / But on his old album covers he was a she-thang\u201d).</p> <p>The song also took aim at Snoop Dogg (Tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper) and featured Eazy-E\u2019s newest, toughest recruits: Dresta, who had recently emerged from prison for assault, and who wrote the hook and Eazy\u2019s verses, and Dresta\u2019s younger brother BG Knocc Out. Both of them were Nutty Blocc Crips whom Eazy met through a connection from Watts\u2019s Jordan Downs projects. </p> <p>The song\u2019s accompanying EP It\u2019s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa contained a photo of Dre in his snug\u2011fitting doctor\u2019s outfit from his World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru photo shoot, with arrows pointing out his eye shadow\u201d, \u201ceyeliner\u201d, \u201clipstick\u201d, and \u201csequins\u201d. In an era before Google, the mere existence of this photo probably came as a surprise to many Dre fans.</p> <p>The disses were disingenuous at times. The stuff about Dre\u2019s glam days overstated, and besides Eazy knew about all of that when he signed on with Dre for NWA, and it didn\u2019t bother him back then.</p> <p>The particulars aside, one thing was clear: Eazy was back on message, and had his swagger back. It\u2019s On reinvigorated Eazy, selling more than 2m copies.</p> <p>So, who won this G-funk showdown, Eazy or Dre? You could say they both did, as it reignited both of their careers. But one could argue that hip-hop ultimately lost, as their dispute had far-reaching consequences, foreshadowing the murders of Tupac and Biggie. </p> <p>Previously, rap confrontations had been about who was superior on the microphone. The Eazy v Dre battle, however, was about who was the toughest in real life.

The current contract, for garrison support and welfare services at both Manus and Nauru until February 2017, is worth almost $2.2bn.</p> <p>The report said the department failed to demonstrate value for money in either of the initial limited tender processes or in the subsequent open tender process, which began in 2015 and was abandoned on 29 July 2016, after the department failed to assure a steering committee its renegotiated agreement with Transfield represented value for money.</p> <p>\u201cProcurement is core business for commonwealth entities and the deficiencies have resulted in higher than necessary expense for taxpayers and significant reputational risks for the Australian government and [the department],\u201d it said.</p> <p>The audit said the failures in the open tender process, conducted under the Abbott-Turnbull government, were of \u201cmost concern,\u201d finding the department allowed Transfield to negotiate a $1.1bn increase in the value of the contract without checking whether it had the authority to agree to that increase or whether other tenderers could best that price.</p> <p>It said that was of particular concern because the department had been explicitly ordered to reduce the cost per head of running the centres.</p> <p>According to figures provided by the department, the average cost per head declined from $698,000 in 2012-13 to $529,000 in 2015-2016 but, when you exclude capital expenditure from that calculation, the cost had actually gone up from $427,000 to $464,000.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/79a3be7b-0b3c-4aab-9e3a-a5c6aecf15fe\">a statement on Tuesday</a>, the department said its conduct \u201cmust be considered in the context of the unique operational environment [it] faced at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe department met the requirement of the government of the day in an environment that was high-tempo and complicated by logistics and procurement activities in foreign countries,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cDelegates were required to make decisions on complex matters within very short timeframes.

There were long nights, I\u2019m told, weighing up the approach to an election against Turnbull, who was basking in political sunshine and flowers. The immediate decision was whether to go with Labor\u2019s electorally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/11/the-10-big-issues-of-election-2016-how-coalition-labor-and-greens-policies-compare\">risky negative gearing policy</a>. But it seemed to reflect a larger decision as to whether to die on his feet or live on his knees, as <strong>Peter Garrett</strong> would sing. Obviously, with nothing to lose, Shorten declared \u201cduck it\u201d and started <em>behaving</em> as though he had nothing to lose. </p> <p>History records that from December last year, Turnbull\u2019s stocks began to fall and Shorten\u2019s began to rise.</p> <p>Segue to the Newspoll this morning, released in the Oz. Here is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/newspoll/newspoll-turnbull-trails-shorten-with-coalition-and-alp-in-tie/news-story/30cf1b393b8511a89152e71a718235f9\">Phil Hudson</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Malcolm Turnbull reaches his \u00adone-year anniversary as prime minister with a worse approval rating than Bill Shorten and his government tied at 50-50 with the \u00adopposition.<br></p> <p>Despite Labor\u2019s calamity last week with the forced resignation of prominent senator <strong>Sam Dastyari</strong> from its frontbench, there has been no gain for the Coalition according to the latest Newspoll, taken exclusively for the Australian<em>.</em> </p> </blockquote> <p>And this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Analysis by the Australian<em> </em>shows the Coalition\u2019s average 50.7 per cent result in two-party terms under Mr Turnbull\u2019s leadership is the second best performance for a prime minister since 2002. Yet while Mr Turnbull remains the preferred prime minister by 43 per cent to Mr Shorten\u2019s 31 per cent, after spending a week overseas attending summits with world leaders, satisfaction with his performance is at its lowest level since he took power. Only 34 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Turnbull\u2019s performance as prime minister, \u00adalmost half the 60 per cent satisfaction peak he reached late last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, obviously, there is a whole lot more at play for Turnbull. But for the outside observer, Turnbull continues to looked like a trapped man, trapped by his party\u2019s right and racked by indecision. If he were free, would he have a different agenda? We may never know. </p> <p>As of last night, the conservatives have just insisted on funding for the yes and no cases for the same-sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 a figure I am told is $7.5m for each side. The date of the vote will be 11 February, if the party room agrees. Given the guy did not want a plebiscite and supports marriage equality, it is a long way down off that horse. </p> <p>Next, the news. Strap yourself in. Party-room meetings coming up. Australian Marriage Equality is speaking to the National party room. At last, the transport minister, <strong>Darren Chester</strong>, has some cavalry. </p> <p>I\u2019m on the Twits @gabriellechan and he is Mike of the Bowers @mpbowers.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-12T22:54:59.869Z\">at 11.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Every Thursday evening, Tel Aviv\u2019s city hall is transformed. The windows light up, each becoming a \u201cpixel\u201d on a giant screen measuring 3,000 square metres. A pair of 1.5 metre joysticks is installed outside in Rabin Square; whoever gets there first can play what is probably the world\u2019s biggest game of Tetris.</p> <p>The stunt is designed to draw attention to the upcoming DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which starts later this month. While admittedly fun, and a good advertisement for the innovation festival, the giant game \u2013 which also becomes Snake or Pong at different times \u2013 is (somewhat ironically) not particularly innovative. Back in 2001, <a href=\"http://blinkenlights.net/\">Project Blinkenlights</a> lit up Haus des Lehrers in Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, allowing people to use their Nokia handsets to play Pong. Since them, students at <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/718009.stm\">Brown</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/17846363\">MIT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfzXcrvQU7Q\">Kiel</a> have pulled similar stunts. You can even play <a href=\"https://www.kingscross.co.uk/granary-squirt\">Snake on the fountains</a> in London\u2019s Granary Square.<br></p> <p>Nor, it must be said, does Tel Aviv\u2019s Tetris intervention do much for the city. Turning city hall into a video game probably isn\u2019t an effective way to get people interested in what happens within. And with room for only two players at a time, it hardly encourages broader interaction. Even 2004\u2019s Pac-Manhattan (which was surely an inevitability, given the strength of that wordplay), which saw five players in a control room guide five players dressed as Pac-Man characters through the New York City streets, got more people and places involved.<br></p> <p>So is there more to these stunts than PR?<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztIUlOUsaA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ztIUlOUsaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Despite what this year\u2019s Pokemania might suggest, games have long been central to public spaces. A few years after the first world war, the Italian town of Marostica hosted the first of what would become a biennial game of <a href=\"http://www.marosticascacchi.it/en/#1\">chess played with human pieces</a>, reenacting the (potentially fictional) story of a medieval lord who ordered his daughter\u2019s two suitors to play for her hand.

Two teams of children faced off across the river Thames in a game of <a href=\"http://muftigames.com/games-compendium/massive-battleships/\">Massive Battleships</a>, making their moves by holding up signs at which their opponents, on the other side of the river, peered through binoculars.

Now that GameCity has opened the fun-filled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2016/apr/29/uk-culture-games-policy-continue-conference\">National Videogame Arcade</a>, Nottingham is a city of games all year round.</p> <p>As well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/10/art-data-digital-city\">encouraging people to pay more attention to the challenges facing their city</a>, Gramazio thinks that games can get us to pay more attention to each other. Citizens of Hildesheim and Oberhausen, Germany, can play games with strangers on the opposite side of a pedestrian crossing via prototypes of a new kind of traffic-light button called <a href=\"http://urban-invention.com/\">ActiWait</a> (though the promise to \u201cconvert boring waiting times into positive experiences\u201d smacks of dystopian science fiction). </p> <p>Big events like the yearly <a href=\"https://improveverywhere.com/missions/the-mp3-experiments/\">MP3 Experiments</a>, for which thousands of people download an MP3 of instructions and gather for synchronised play, and 2012\u2019s <a href=\"http://hideandseek.net/projects/the-new-year-games/\">New Year Games</a>, in which two teams competed in challenges such as throwing paper aeroplanes at invisible musicians and stealing ribbons from a man dressed as a minotaur, bring thousands of people together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38e4ea6dc28b86c588ab56675e50474c8fdee10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38e4ea6dc28b86c588ab56675e50474c8fdee10/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children dressed as Pikachu play Pokemon Go in Mexico City on 21 August 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play Pokemon Go in Mexico City on 21 August 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One morning in July 2010, outside the National Theatre, Londoners played a game called <a href=\"http://www.815agency.com/indexhibit/index.php?/projects/pass-the-impossibly-large-parcel-ii/\">Pass the Impossibly Large Parcel</a>. Each layer of the parcel, when unwrapped, revealed \u201cprizes\u201d in the form of costume items. Players wore them before they went about their day \u2013 a kind of tribal identification, marking you on the tube or the office as a member of a secret club. Those who took part in the early days of Pokemon Go phenomenon will recognise that feeling of camaraderie. The game\u2019s sense of community has manifested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/pokemon-go-gathering-san-francisco\">9,000-strong gatherings</a>, and charitable play such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tylerkonersman/status/753809499933204481\">dropping lures outside hospitals</a> so that sick kids can catch Pokemon from their beds. </p> <p>One of the most common complaints about cities is that the crowds can leave one feeling lost and lonely. Games counter that by connecting us to each other and the spaces in which we play. Tetris in Tel Aviv might be a bit of a damp squib, but only because it had a deeper potential. \u201cPlaying is a thing that we usually do in places that feel like they\u2019re ours \u2013 like we\u2019re safe there,\u201d says Gramazio. \u201cHaving that happen in a city, where people are wandering through, can make me as a player feel more at home.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> to join the discussion</em></p>",

From September 10 to 11, the capital hosted tournaments for a range of the latest fighting games such as Mortal Kombat XL, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/08/chibi-robo-zip-lash-corpse-party-blood-drive\">BlazBlue Chronophantasma Extend</a>, and Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator. But the Philippines is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/15/street-fighter-v-review-capcom\">Street Fighter V</a> country, with almost 200 people signed up for that tournament alone. The Manila Cup is part of the global Capcom Pro Tour; winners get points that determine placement, and may lead to an appearance at the Capcom Cup in December. That\u2019s why the heavy hitters of the FGC are here \u2013 Ricki Ortiz, Justin Wong, and Kenneth \u201cK-Brad\u201d Bradley from Evil Geniuses, PandaTV\u2019s Xijie \u201cDark Jiewa\u201d Zeng, and Red Bull\u2019s Masato \u201cBonchan\u201d Takahashi, to name but a few.</p> <p>Unlike in other eSports, there are no invitation-only events or qualifiers. You sign up for the games you want, get divided into pools, and, like your gaming avatars, fight your way to the top. The tournament follows a double elimination format; lose your first game and you get sent to the losers bracket. Lose again and you\u2019re out. Given the format, there is a good possibility of slaying some giants, but a bigger one of getting slain yourself. Not that many mind; my friend Boni tells me, \u201cIt would be an honour to get bodied by Justin Wong.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m here as my friends Tzi and Billy have signed up for the Street Fighter V tournament, which has a P150,000 (\u00a32,400) grand prize. A paltry sum compared to tournaments like EVO, where prize money goes up to $100,000 (\u00a375,000), but still big money in a country where the minimum wage is barely $10 per day. I\u2019m a lowly button masher, a class of people for whom I understand there is a special circle of hell. This is my first fighting game tournament, and I\u2019m here solely for moral support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc5e47a8c9beed42b8ea3789647356f5f739a888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5e47a8c9beed42b8ea3789647356f5f739a888/3_111_1277_766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From the left: Manila Cup competitors Justin Wong and Ricki Ortiz, Patricia Wong, and Youtube personality Mike Ross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From the left: Manila Cup competitors Justin Wong and Ricki Ortiz, Tala Wong, and YouTube personality Mike Ross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emile Garcia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s arena is the clubhouse of a posh neighbourhood \u2013 a gated community where everyone needs a gate pass to enter.</p> <p>Next to us in the registration queue are some of the members of Evil Geniuses (EG), one of the original and most popular pro-gaming teams. Ortiz and Wong are legends, along with YouTube personality Mike Ross. A friend eggs me on to ask for a photo with the pros while they\u2019re not busy. I relent. While English is my first language, it disintegrates in the presence of these greats. There are so many things I want to say to them \u2013 you\u2019re amazing, I love your show, you\u2019re my favorite Chun-Li player \u2013 but I settle for a photo.</p> <p>A kid, no more than 18 or 19 comes over to EG, fight stick, notebook and a scouring pad in hand. The latter he hands to Ross, who looks confused. The kid explains, using hand gestures, that it\u2019s a scrubber \u2013 \u201cscrub\u201d being gamer parlance for a bad player. It\u2019s a gag gift, a product of the Filipino fondness for wordplay. Ross laughs.</p> <p>Giddy with excitement, the kid asks Wong and Ortiz to sign his fight stick and notebook. It\u2019s probably one of the best days of his life, and it\u2019s doubtful he would be alone in feeling that. We\u2019re a small country in Southeast Asia; we don\u2019t expect the giants of the fighting game world to descend onto the Philippines en masse. Yet, here they are today, within picture-taking, autograph-signing reach. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"733d057a0a6ab73a5af92a9c4757bef64d022ace\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/733d057a0a6ab73a5af92a9c4757bef64d022ace/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manila Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emile Garcia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The event starts an hour late, as most events do in the Philippines. Everything here runs on \u201cFilipino time\u201d, a reflection of the laid-back, easygoing nature of the people. But there is a frenetic energy in the air as the pools for the different games begin, with two rows of monitors and PS4s on either side of the room. Select Street Fighter V games, usually ones where the foreign pros are playing, take place on the modest stage, streamed worldwide on Team Spooky\u2019s Twitch channel. </p> <p>Tzi\u2019s pool starts first. His Ryu gets demolished by a Cammy player, sending him to the loser\u2019s bracket, which he doesn\u2019t recover from. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he admits afterwards. \u201cToo much Overwatch\u201d. Billy fares a bit better, losing his first two matches with Nash, but scraping out of the loser\u2019s bracket with Ken. He gets one more match before he\u2019s eliminated. \u201cAt least someone went home because of me,\u201d he says with pride. </p> <p>My friends have no illusions that they\u2019re going to beat beasts like Ryota \u201cKazunoko\u201d Inoue or K-Brad. While Billy, like many other local players, joined to test his skill level against the best local and global players, Tzi wanted to reawaken the long dormant competitive gamer in him. Losing is a humbling experience, but neither are despondent \u2013 they\u2019re only more determined to prepare for next year. Their parts over, we settle among the throng to watch the Top 32 in action.</p> <p>Chants are integral to the Filipino crowd experience, and there is pride in getting a chant going. When Wong\u2019s Karin uses her super, the whole crowd does her distinctive heiress laugh along with her, amusing the commentators. \u201cIt [Manila] doesn\u2019t get hype, it stays hype!\u201d commentator Ryan \u201cGootecks\u201d Gutierrez says on the Twitch stream. The crowd, as if to prove Gutierrez\u2019s point, does a round of the \u201cOle\u201d chant for local player Ron \u201cLimfiltration\u201d Lim. </p> <p>The local geek community is notorious for their in-jokes \u2013 a mix of 90s pop culture references, internet memes and current events. The infamous \u201cTapusin!\u201d [Finish him] chant from \u201cGost Payter\u201d, a parody of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime so central to many a Filipino childhood, starts up for Don \u201cDon\u201d Gim, the only Filipino to make it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup. The chant reverberates throughout the venue, so loud that Gutierrez removes his noise-cancelling headset to try and figure out what we\u2019re all shouting. In a nutshell, this is the Filipino FGC \u2013 snarky, irreverent, raucous and undeniably passionate.</p> <p>The fact that a Filipino player has made it to the Top eight of the Manila Cup is big. Filipinos are known for beauty pageants, music and a foul-mouthed president; fighting game players, not so much. There are so few of us competing globally that Filipino-American pro players like Ryan \u201cFilipinoChamp\u201d Ramirez and Gerald \u201cFilipinoman\u201d Herrera have made being Filipino part of their gamer identities. </p> <p>On the Twitch stream, Gutierrez, half of the eponymous \u201cExcellent Adventures of Gootecks and Mike Ross\u201d, mentions that someone asked him what Filipino players needed to do to compete with the Justin Wongs of the world. Play more and travel, Gutierrez responds.</p> <p>His answer reveals a fundamental problem when it comes to developing world class pro-gaming teams in the Philippines \u2013 a lack of funding and sponsorship. The Philippines is a developing country, and carries all the baggage of being classified as one. Corporate sponsorship isn\u2019t feasible; the goal of sponsoring professional gamers is global recognition, ie making sure that Twitch viewers in different continents can see your brand. Very few Filipino brands have global reach, and even then, they\u2019re not tech or energy drink brands, the typical sponsors for pro-gamers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aac2ea6e9374fd0d885ae42fa99c1197ac721307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac2ea6e9374fd0d885ae42fa99c1197ac721307/77_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street Fighter V is the key draw in the Manila Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street Fighter V is the key draw in the Manila Cup</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without steady financial backing, it\u2019s nearly impossible for a Filipino pro-gamer to pay for travel expenses to and from major tournaments in the United States and Japan. On top of that, Filipinos, unlike many of their Western counterparts, have to worry about visas. Getting a visa, especially to the United States, is no mean feat for the average Filipino, as embassy officials worry that we\u2019ll become illegal aliens, adding another barrier to the Philippines\u2019 pro-gaming dreams. We can\u2019t compete with the pros if we don\u2019t have the luxury to practice like the pros, and we can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re not getting backed like the pros.</p> <p>One by one, the big names bow out on Day Two. The journey ends for Bonchan and K-Brad at the Top 16; Li Wei \u201cOil King\u201d Lin with his memorable floral shorts, Ortiz, and Eita make it to the Top eight before they\u2019re eliminated. In the end, it\u2019s USA v Taiwan, Wong versus Bruce \u201cGamerbee\u201d Hsiang. When Wong, the most popular foreign player in the Philippines, hits Hsiang\u2019s Necalli with the EX version of Karin\u2019s Ressenha special attack, it\u2019s over. The crowd erupts into deafening cries of \u201cJustin Wong!\u201d and \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d </p> <p>Typically stony-faced during his matches, Wong stands up and pops a fist in the air before shaking Hsiang\u2019s hand. The childhood hero of so many, one of the men responsible for creating the pro-gamer dream and living it, raises his gold trophy above his head. It\u2019s raw, electric, utter chaos, and he\u2019s immediately swarmed by fans begging him to sign their fight sticks or pose with them for selfies. Everyone wants selfies with the pros.</p> <p>It\u2019s close to 9 pm when I finally get home. It\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s been a long and exhausting couple of days. Before I collapse for the night, I go on YouTube to look for tutorial videos. This tournament has helped me make up my mind about who I want to main: Dhalsim. I saw two players at Manila Cup using this classic SF2 character and on finding that his move-set is close to Seth\u2019s (very slippery), he appealed greatly to me. He also reminds me of Zenyatta, my main character in Overwatch. But after 48 hours of continual Street Fighter, that\u2019s a story \u2013 and a game \u2013 for another day.</p>",

  "<p>I hate to disappoint you folks, but unless we stretch the topic to breaking point this address will not be about \u201ccommunity and belonging.\u201d In fact, you have to hand it to this festival\u2019s organisers: inviting a renowned iconoclast to speak about \u201ccommunity and belonging\u201d is like expecting a great white shark to balance a beach ball on its nose.<br></p> <p>The topic I had submitted instead was \u201cfiction and identity politics,\u201d which may sound on its face equally dreary. </p> <p>But I\u2019m afraid the bramble of thorny issues that cluster around \u201cidentity politics\u201d has got all too interesting, particularly for people pursuing the occupation I share with many gathered in this hall: fiction writing.

Earlier this year, two students, both members of student government, threw a tequila-themed birthday party for a friend.

Administrators sent multiple emails to the \u201cculprits\u201d threatening an investigation into an \u201cact of ethnic stereotyping.\u201d Partygoers were placed on \u201csocial probation,\u201d while the two hosts were ejected from their dorm and later impeached. Bowdoin\u2019s student newspaper decried the attendees\u2019 lack of \u201cbasic empathy.\u201d </p> <p>The student government issued a \u201cstatement of solidarity\u201d with \u201call the students who were injured and affected by the incident,\u201d and demanded that administrators \u201ccreate a safe space for those students who have been or feel specifically targeted.\u201d The tequila party, the statement specified, was just the sort of occasion that \u201ccreates an environment where students of colour, particularly Latino, and especially Mexican, feel unsafe.\u201d In sum, the party-favour hats constituted \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d</p> <p>Curiously, across my country Mexican restaurants, often owned and run by Mexicans, are festooned with sombreros \u2013 if perhaps not for long. At the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, the student union has banned a Mexican restaurant from giving out sombreros, deemed once more an act of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d that was also racist.</p> <p>Now, I am a little at a loss to explain what\u2019s so insulting about a sombrero \u2013 a practical piece of headgear for a hot climate that keeps out the sun with a wide brim. My parents went to Mexico when I was small, and brought a sombrero back from their travels, the better for my brothers and I to unashamedly <em>appropriate </em>the souvenir to play dress-up. For my part, as a German-American on both sides, I\u2019m more than happy for anyone who doesn\u2019t share my genetic pedigree to don a Tyrolean hat, pull on some leiderhosen, pour themselves a <em>weisbier, </em>and belt out the Hoffbrauhaus Song.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience that doesn\u2019t belong to us is that there is no fiction.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what does this have to do with writing fiction?

However are we fiction writers to seek \u201cpermission\u201d to use a character from another race or culture, or to employ the vernacular of a group to which we don\u2019t belong? Do we set up a stand on the corner and approach passers-by with a clipboard, getting signatures that grant limited rights to employ an Indonesian character in Chapter Twelve, the way political volunteers get a candidate on the ballot?</p> <p>I am hopeful that the concept of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is a passing fad: people with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life. </p> <p>But this latest and little absurd no-no is part of a larger climate of super-sensitivity, giving rise to proliferating prohibitions supposedly in the interest of social justice that constrain fiction writers and prospectively makes our work impossible. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seriously, we have people questioning whether it\u2019s appropriate for white people to eat pad Thai.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, the majority of these farcical cases of \u201cappropriation\u201d have concentrated on fashion, dance, and music: At the American Music Awards 2013, Katy Perry got it in the neck for dressing like a geisha. According to the Arab-American writer Randa Jarrar, for someone like me to practice belly dancing is \u201cwhite appropriation of Eastern dance,\u201d while according to the Daily Beast<em> </em>Iggy Azalea committed \u201ccultural crimes\u201d by imitating African rap and speaking in a \u201cblaccent.\u201d </p> <p>The felony of cultural sticky fingers even extends to exercise: at the University of Ottawa in Canada, a yoga teacher was shamed into suspending her class, \u201cbecause yoga originally comes from India.\u201d She offered to re-title the course, \u201cMindful Stretching.\u201d And get this: the purism has also reached the world of food. Supported by no less than Lena Dunham, students at Oberlin College in Ohio have protested \u201cculturally appropriated food\u201d like sushi in their dining hall (lucky cusses\u2014 in my day, we never had sushi in our dining hall), whose inauthenticity is \u201cinsensitive\u201d to the Japanese. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"979a93c7516da88e5e66c36372867db0e012bf27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/979a93c7516da88e5e66c36372867db0e012bf27/0_0_2912_3904/746.jpg\" alt=\"author Lionel Shriver\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Shriver is the author of We Need to Talk About Kevin, the winner of the 2005 Orange Prize.

Turnabout, then: I guess that means that as a native of North Carolina, I can ban the Thais from eating barbecue. (I bet they\u2019d swap.)</p> <p>This same sensibility is coming to a bookstore near you. Because who is the appropriator par excellence, really? Who assumes other people\u2019s voices, accents, patois, and distinctive idioms? Who literally puts words into the mouths of people different from themselves? Who dares to get inside the very heads of strangers, who has the chutzpah to project thoughts and feelings into the minds of others, who steals their very souls? Who is a professional kidnapper? Who swipes every sight, smell, sensation, or overheard conversation like a kid in a candy store, and sometimes <em>take notes </em>the better to purloin whole worlds? Who is the premier pickpocket of the arts? </p> <p>The fiction writer, that\u2019s who.</p> <p>This is a disrespectful vocation by its nature \u2013 prying, voyeuristic, kleptomaniacal, and presumptuous. And that is fiction writing at its best. When Truman Capote wrote from the perspective of condemned murderers from a lower economic class than his own, he had some gall. But writing fiction takes gall.</p> <p>As for the culture police\u2019s obsession with \u201cauthenticity,\u201d fiction is inherently inauthentic. It\u2019s fake. It\u2019s self-confessedly fake; that is the nature of the form, which is about people who don\u2019t exist and events that didn\u2019t happen. The name of the game is not whether your novel honours reality; it\u2019s all about what you can get away with.</p> <p>In his 2009 novel Little Bee, Chris Cleave, who as it happens is participating in this festival, dared to write from the point of view of a 14-year-old Nigerian girl, though he is male, white, and British. I\u2019ll remain neutral on whether he \u201cgot away with it\u201d in literary terms, because I haven\u2019t read the book yet. </p> <p>But in principle, I admire his courage \u2013 if only because he invited this kind of ethical forensics in a review out of San Francisco: \u201cWhen a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?\u201d the reviewer asked. \u201cWhen an author pretends to be someone he is not, he does it to tell a story outside of his own experiential range. But he has to in turn be careful that he is representing his characters, not using them for his plot.\u201d</p> <p>Hold it. OK, he\u2019s necessarily \u201crepresenting\u201d his characters, by portraying them on the page. But of course he\u2019s using them for his plot! How could he not? They are his characters, to be manipulated at his whim, to fulfill whatever purpose he cares to put them to.</p> <p>This same reviewer recapitulated Cleave\u2019s obligation \u201cto show that he\u2019s representing [the girl], rather than exploiting her.\u201d Again, a false dichotomy. </p> <p>Of course he\u2019s exploiting her. It\u2019s his book, and he made her up. The character is his creature, to be exploited up a storm. Yet the reviewer chides that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell\u201d and worries that \u201cCleave pushes his own boundaries maybe further than they were meant to go.\u201d</p> <p>What stories are \u201cimplicitly ours to tell,\u201d and what boundaries around our own lives are we mandated to remain within? I would argue that any story you can <em>make </em>yours is yours to tell, and trying to push the boundaries of the author\u2019s personal experience is part of a fiction writer\u2019s job. </p> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder. Me, I\u2019ve depicted a high school killing spree, and I hate to break it to you: I\u2019ve never shot fatal arrows through seven kids, a teacher, and a cafeteria worker, either. We make things up, we chance our arms, sometimes we do a little research, but in the end it\u2019s still about what we can get away with \u2013 what we can put over on our readers. </p> <p>Because the ultimate endpoint of keeping out mitts off experience <em>that doesn\u2019t belong to us </em>is that there is no fiction. Someone like me only permits herself to write from the perspective of a straight white female born in North Carolina, closing on sixty, able-bodied but with bad knees, skint for years but finally able to buy the odd new shirt. All that\u2019s left is memoir.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the bugbear, here\u2019s where we really can\u2019t win. At the same time that we\u2019re to write about only the few toys that landed in our playpen, we\u2019re also upbraided for failing to portray in our fiction a population that is sufficiently various. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m hoping that crime writers, for example, don\u2019t all have personal experience of committing murder.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My most recent novel The Mandibles<em> </em>was taken to task by one reviewer for addressing an America that is \u201cstraight and white\u201d. It happens that this is a multigenerational family saga \u2013 about a white family. I wasn\u2019t instinctively inclined to insert a transvestite or bisexual, with issues that might distract from my central subject matter of apocalyptic economics. Yet the implication of this criticism is that we novelists need to plug in representatives of a variety of groups in our cast of characters, as if filling out the entering class of freshmen at a university with strict diversity requirements.</p> <p>You do indeed see just this brand of tokenism in television. There was a point in the latter 1990s at which suddenly every sitcom and drama in sight had to have a gay or lesbian character or couple. That was good news as a voucher of the success of the gay rights movement, but it still grew a bit tiresome: <em>look at us, our show is so hip, one of the characters is homosexual! </em></p> <p>We\u2019re now going through the same fashionable exercise in relation to the transgender characters in series like Transparent and Orange is the New Black.</p> <p>Fine. But I still would like to reserve the right as a novelist to use only the characters that pertain to my story.</p> <p>Besides: which is it to be? We have to tend our own gardens, and only write about ourselves or people just like us because we mustn\u2019t pilfer others\u2019 experience, <em>or </em>we have to people our cast like an <em>I\u2019d like to teach the world to sing </em>Coca-Cola advert?</p> <p>For it can be dangerous these days to go the diversity route. Especially since there seems to be a consensus on the notion that San Francisco reviewer put forward that \u201cspecial care should be taken with a story that\u2019s not implicitly yours to tell.\u201d</p> <p>In The Mandibles, I have one secondary character, Luella, who\u2019s black. She\u2019s married to a more central character, Douglas, the Mandible family\u2019s 97-year-old patriarch. I reasoned that Douglas, a liberal New Yorker, would credibly have left his wife for a beautiful, stately African American because arm candy of color would reflect well on him in his circle, and keep his progressive kids\u2019 objections to a minimum. But in the end the joke is on Douglas, because Luella suffers from early onset dementia, while his ex-wife, staunchly of sound mind, ends up running a charity for dementia research. As the novel reaches its climax and the family is reduced to the street, they\u2019re obliged to put the addled, disoriented Luella on a leash, to keep her from wandering off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Behold, the reviewer in the Washington Post, who groundlessly accused this book of being \u201cracist\u201d because it doesn\u2019t toe a strict Democratic Party line in its political outlook, described the scene thus: \u201cThe Mandibles are white. Luella, the single African American in the family, arrives in Brooklyn incontinent and demented. She needs to be physically restrained. As their fortunes become ever more dire and the family assembles for a perilous trek through the streets of lawless New York, she\u2019s held at the end of a leash. If The Mandibles is ever made into a film, my suggestion is that this image not be employed for the movie poster.\u201d </p> <p>Your author, by implication, yearns to bring back slavery.</p> <p>Thus in the world of identity politics, fiction writers better be careful. If we do choose to import representatives of protected groups, special rules apply. If a character happens to be black, they have to be treated with kid gloves, and never be placed in scenes that, taken out of context, might seem disrespectful. But that\u2019s no way to write. The burden is too great, the self-examination paralysing. The natural result of that kind of criticism in the Post<em> </em>is that next time I don\u2019t use <em>any </em>black characters, lest they do or say anything that is short of perfectly admirable and lovely.</p> <p>In fact, I\u2019m reminded of a letter I received in relation to my seventh novel from an Armenian-American who objected \u2013 why did I have to make the narrator of We Need to Talk About Kevin<em> </em>Armenian? He didn\u2019t like my narrator, and felt that her ethnicity disparaged his community. I took pains to explain that I knew something about Armenian heritage, because my best friend in the States was Armenian, and I also thought there was something dark and aggrieved in the culture of the Armenian diaspora that was atmospherically germane to that book. Besides, I despaired, everyone in the US has an ethnic background of some sort, and she had to be something!</p> <p>Especially for writers from traditionally privileged demographics, the message seems to be that it\u2019s a whole lot safer just to make all your characters from that same demographic, so you can be as hard on them as you care to be, and do with them what you like. Availing yourself of a diverse cast, you are not free; you have inadvertently invited a host of regulations upon your head, as if just having joined the EU. Use different races, ethnicities, and minority gender identities, and you are being watched.</p> <p>I confess that this climate of scrutiny has got under my skin. When I was first starting out as a novelist, I didn\u2019t hesitate to write black characters, for example, or to avail myself of black dialects, for which, having grown up in the American South, I had a pretty good ear. I am now much more anxious about depicting characters of different races, and accents make me nervous. </p> <p>In describing a second-generation Mexican American who\u2019s married to one of my main characters in The Mandibles, I took care to write his dialogue in standard American English, to specify that he spoke without an accent, and to explain that he only dropped Spanish expressions tongue-in-cheek. I would certainly think twice \u2013 more than twice \u2013 about ever writing a whole novel, or even a goodly chunk of one, from the perspective of a character whose race is different from my own \u2013 because I may sell myself as an iconoclast, but I\u2019m as anxious as the next person about attracting vitriol. But I think that\u2019s a loss. I think that indicates a contraction of my fictional universe that is not good for the books, and not good for my soul.</p> <p>Writing under the pseudonym Edward Schlosser on Vox, the author of the essay \u201cI\u2019m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Scare Me\u201d describes higher education\u2019s \u201ccurrent climate of fear\u201d and its \u201cheavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity\u201d \u2013 and I am concerned that this touchy ethos, in which offendedness is used as a weapon, has spread far beyond academia, in part thanks to social media. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The left\u2019s embrace of gotcha hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why, it\u2019s largely in order to keep from losing my fictional mojo that I stay off Facebook and Twitter, which could surely install an instinctive self-censorship out of fear of attack. Ten years ago, I gave the opening address of this same festival, in which I maintained that fiction writers have a vested interest in protecting everyone\u2019s <em>right </em>to offend others \u2013 because if hurting someone else\u2019s feelings even inadvertently is sufficient justification for muzzling, there will always be someone out there who is miffed by what you say, and freedom of speech is dead. With the rise of identity politics, which privileges a subjective sense of injury as actionable basis for prosecution, that is a battle that in the decade since I last spoke in Brisbane we\u2019ve been losing.</p> <p>Worse: the left\u2019s embrace of <em>gotcha </em>hypersensitivity inevitably invites backlash. Donald Trump appeals to people who have had it up to their eyeballs with being told what they can and cannot say. Pushing back against a mainstream culture of speak-no-evil suppression, they lash out in defiance, and then what they say is pretty appalling.</p> <p>Regarding identity politics, what\u2019s especially saddened me in my recent career is a trend toward rejecting the advocacy of anyone who does not belong to the group. In 2013, I published Big Brother, a novel that grew out of my loss of my own older brother, who in 2009 died from the complications of morbid obesity. I was moved to write the book not only from grief, but also sympathy: in the years before his death, as my brother grew heavier, I saw how dreadfully other people treated him \u2013 how he would be seated off in a corner of a restaurant, how the staff would roll their eyes at each other after he\u2019d ordered, though he hadn\u2019t requested more food than anyone else. </p> <p>I was wildly impatient with the way we assess people\u2019s characters these days in accordance with their weight, and tried to get on the page my dismay at how much energy people waste on this matter, sometimes anguishing for years over a few excess pounds. Both author and book were on the side of the angels, or so you would think.</p> <p>But in my events to promote Big Brother, I started to notice a pattern. Most of the people buying the book in the signing queue were thin. Especially in the US, fat is now one of those issues where you either have to be <em>one of us</em>, or you\u2019re the enemy. I verified this when I had a long email correspondence with a \u201cHealthy at Any Size\u201d activist, who was incensed by the novel, which she hadn\u2019t even read. Which she refused to read. No amount of explaining that the novel was on her side, that it was a book that was terribly pained by the way heavy people are treated and how unfairly they are judged, could overcome the scrawny author\u2019s photo on the flap.</p> <p>She and her colleagues in the fat rights movement did not want my advocacy. I could not <em>weigh in </em>on this material because I did not belong to the club. I found this an artistic, political, and even commercial disappointment \u2013 because in the US and the UK, if only skinny-minnies will buy your book, you\u2019ve evaporated the pool of prospective consumers to a puddle.</p> <p>I worry that the clamorous world of identity politics is also undermining the very causes its activists claim to back. As a fiction writer, yeah, I do sometimes deem my narrator an Armenian. But that\u2019s only by way of a start. Merely being Armenian is not to have a character as I understand the word. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Membership of a larger group is not an identity. Being Asian is not an identity. Being gay is not an identity. Being deaf, blind, or wheelchair-bound is not an identity, nor is being economically deprived. I reviewed a novel recently that I had regretfully to give a thumbs-down, though it was terribly well intended; its heart was in the right place. But in relating the Chinese immigrant experience in America, the author put forward characters that were mostly Chinese. That is, that\u2019s sort of all they were: Chinese. Which isn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>I made this same point in relation to gender in Melbourne last week: both as writers and as people, we should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth. If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us. We pigeonhole ourselves. We limit our own notion of who we are, and in presenting ourselves as one of a membership, a representative of our <em>type</em>, an ambassador of an amalgam, we ask not to be seen.</p> <p>The reading and writing of fiction is obviously driven in part by a desire to look inward, to be self-examining, reflective. But the form is also born of a desperation to break free of the claustrophobia of our own experience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/white-woman-black-hairstyle-cultural-appropriation\">Why the fuss over a white woman having a black hairstyle? | Sede Alonge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spirit of good fiction is one of exploration, generosity, curiosity, audacity, and compassion.

My only excuse is that I do it well.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to my final point. We do not all do it well. So it\u2019s more than possible that we write from the perspective of a one-legged lesbian from Afghanistan and fall flat on our arses. We don\u2019t get the dialogue right, and for insertions of expressions in Pashto we depend on Google Translate.</p> <p>Halfway through the novel, suddenly the protagonist has lost the right leg instead of the left one. Our idea of lesbian sex is drawn from wooden internet porn. Efforts to persuasively enter the lives of others very different from us may fail: that\u2019s a given. But maybe rather than having our heads taken off, we should get a few points for trying. After all, most fiction sucks. Most writing sucks. Most things that people make of any sort suck. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t make anything. </p> <p>The answer is that modern clich\u00e9: to keep trying to fail better.

Thank you.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>So now we know (even if we\u2019d long suspected it): we\u2019re going to be kept in the dark. For the time being at least, the government is not going to be saying anything much about what its Brexit strategy will be, or how it is progressing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/theresa-may-questions-uk-eu-single-market-pmqs\">Pressed repeatedly in parliament last week</a> on the question of whether its preferred Brexit deal would include full membership of the EU\u2019s single market, prime minister Theresa May could not have been much clearer (or more non-committal): </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new relationship will include control of the movement of people from the EU into the UK, and it will include the right deal for the trade in goods and services ... It would not be right for me or this government to give a running commentary on negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>In case there should be any doubt, she then said it again: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is about developing our own British model. So we will not take decisions until we are ready. We will not reveal our hand prematurely. And we will not provide a running commentary.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brexit minister David Davis went further, telling the House of Lords EU select committee that because the government did not want to give away its negotiating position he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/brexit-talks-may-be-most-complicated-negotiation-ever-says-minister\">\u201cmay not be able to tell [parliament] everything\u201d</a> \u2013 even in private hearings: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can entirely see accountability after the event, that\u2019s very clear. [But] in advance, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for parliamentarians to micro-manage the process and wouldn\u2019t give us an optimum outcome for the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the meantime, tantalising glimpses of what Brexit might imply in practice continue to emerge. Like the possibility that British citizens may have to apply for permission \u2013 and pay \u2013 to visit the continent.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/09/britons-may-have-to-apply-to-visit-europe-under-eu-visa-scheme\">The Guardian reported on Saturday</a> that a planned EU visa waiver scheme based on the US ESTA system \u2013 which requires travellers to request advance authorisation to travel in exchange for a fee \u2013 could apply to British holidaymakers and business travellers after Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570646b36c59a418ec18ba36e083662152b4b5ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570646b36c59a418ec18ba36e083662152b4b5ef/0_95_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The home secretary, Amber Rudd, on The Andrew Marr Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked by Andrew Marr on his Sunday morning TV show whether this could indeed be the case, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/amber-rudd-britons-might-need-to-pay-for-permission-to-visit-eu\">home secretary Amber Rudd, said that yes, it could</a>: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly desirable, but we don\u2019t rule it out because we have to be allowed a free hand to get the best negotiations. It\u2019s a reminder that this is a two-way negotiation. The EU ... will be considering their negotiations with us, just as we are with them. </p> </blockquote> <p>Rudd also said the government was considering work permits for EU nationals in Britain as a possible way to control immigration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it seems one or two members \u2013 specifically, the hardcore Brexiters \u2013 of the cabinet are not yet fully on-board with the prime minister\u2019s instructions to keep schtum, refrain from provide running commentaries and avoid revealing the government\u2019s hand.</p> <p>They also have a clear idea of the Brexit they want: hard, and fast. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">Davis needed putting in his place</a> last week after he told MPs it was unlikely that Britain would stay in the single market. Downing Street said he was \u201cexpressing his personal opinion\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, the international trade minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/business-leaders-politicians-attack-fox-over-lazy-accusations\">Liam Fox, drew fire</a> when he said British business had grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and company executives would rather play golf than get out and clinch the new export deals the country will need. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">Downing Street also pointedly declined to endorse his opinion</a>. </p> <p>Boris Johnson, finally, took the fairly remarkable step for a foreign minister of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/boris-johnson-backs-brexit-pressure-campaign-change-britain\">endorsing Change Britain, a new cross-party campaign of prominent pro-Brexit politicians</a> (think Gisela Stuart and Michael Gove) aimed at pressuring the government into delivering on leaving the EU in the way they would like \u2013 namely gaining full control over \u201claws, borders, money and trade\u201d.</p> <p>(Change Britain, incidentally, ran into early difficulties after it quietly dropped one of the key pre-referendum pledges of its predecessor organisation Vote Leave: that Brexit could see an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/brexit-camp-abandons-350-million-pound-nhs-pledge\">extra \u00a3350m a week spent on the NHS</a>. Labour MPs instantly demanded the group \u201ceither admit it was a lie and apologise, or justify it and explain when it is coming\u201d.)</p> <p>Further increasing the pressure on May, the former culture secretary, John Whittingdale, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/10/theresa-may-should-invoke-article-50-within-weeks-says-john-whit/\">said in an interview with the Telegraph </a>that the prime minister should invoke article 50 \u2013 setting in motion the formal two-year leaving process \u2013 within weeks, rather than waiting until next year.</p> <h2>The view from Europe</h2> <p>And the pressure isn\u2019t just coming from diehard Brexiters: May met the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, to discuss the UK\u2019s future relationship with the remaining EU-27. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/donald-tusk-theresa-may-article-50-brexit-negotiations-eu\">Hinting at rising impatience on the continent, he told her Britain should get on with leaving as soon as possible</a>: \u201cThe ball is in your court.\u201d </p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, the former banker and economy minister who is having a tilt at the French presidency, also said Britain should get out soon. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/uk-financial-firms-cant-sell-to-eurozone-after-brexit-says-emmanuel-macron\">he told the Guardian</a> that the City\u2019s crucial passporting rights \u2013 which allow UK-based financial institutions to sell across the eurozone \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be preserved unless the Britain contributes to the EU budget and that no concessions could be made on freedom of movement to boot.</p> <p>The (in theory) pro-British Danish prime minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told Bloomberg he was urging his EU colleagues to make sure Britain doesn\u2019t end up with a good deal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be extremely careful that the side that leaves doesn\u2019t get particular competitive advantages on its way out. We all want a peaceful divorce, but when you agree to part ways \u2013 and in this situation, only one side wants to part ways \u2013 we need to protect our own interests first.</p> </blockquote>

Commission.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what Verhofstadt had to say in July on the possibility of the UK retaining free market access while restricting freedom of movement: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European parliament will never agree to a deal that de facto ends the free movement of people, while giving away an extra rebate in exchange for all the advantages of the internal market. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Meanwhile, back in Westminster</h2> <p>The shock (perhaps) of the week was obviously <a

Cameron\u2019s decision to resign as an MP</a>, after stepping down as the prime minister who called the Brexit referendum the day after he lost it. </p> <p>Looking forward, away even from the direct squabbling over the balance of immigration versus trade and whether UK businesses are doing their bit, Brexit is arguably shaping the direction of British politics in other ways.</p> <p>For example, the decision of Theresa May to announce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">a return to new grammar schools</a>, picking a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/10/grammar-schools-theresa-may-school-gates-parents-stroud\">potentially tricky political fight</a> over what some see as a marginal issue, has been rationalised by some as the prime minister seeking to assuage the right of her party, which might be about to see some disappointments over what Brexit actually ends up meaning.</p> <p>There are also repercussions for Labour, with Owen Smith going further even than his previous promise to seek a referendum on the specific Brexit deal by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/11/owen-smith-labour-should-seek-british-return-to-eu-if-brexit-means-tory-austerity\">suggesting a Labour government</a> under him could one day reapply to join the EU.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, widely expected to beat Smith in the ongoing Labour leadership battle, has dismissed the idea of a new referendum, while his aides have gleefully pointed out that not even Smith\u2019s main trade union supporter, the GMB, supports this.</p> <p>That said, Corbyn\u2019s own ideas on Brexit have caused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/jeremy-corbyn-says-uk-should-reject-key-aspects-of-single-market-after-brexit\">some anguish in Labour</a>, with disquiet among some MPs after

Conservatives kid themselves as their ancestors did in the 1930s. Listen to Conservative ministers and read the rightwing press and delusion is on display everywhere ... They don\u2019t have a shred of evidence that the EU will appease us. Just a forlorn hope and an echo of voices from the time of the British appeasers. </p> </blockquote> <p>Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, has been analysing the implications of Brexit for trade with Peter Sutherland, the former founding director-general of the World Trade Organisation. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae0dc02c-75db-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a\">In the Financial Times, he writes</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit will make a deep mark on British life. Most importantly, it will upend our trading relationships with Europe and the rest of the world. Only 15% of UK total trade is with countries that are neither members of the EU, nor covered by an EU trade agreement that is in force or under negotiation ... And where is the government on all of this? Not even at first base. Ministers must make their plans for Britain\u2019s trading relationships clear as soon as possible. We are in the calm before the storm. Whatever form Brexit takes, it is going to be a rough ride.</p> </blockquote> <p>Raphael Behr in the Guardian tackles the thorny issue of immigration, arguing the Brexiters haven\u2019t a clue what to do:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The \u201cpoints-based system\u201d was always a phoney offer. It was clever shorthand for \u201cnon-racist yet rigorous-sounding alternative to the status quo\u201d chosen because it seemed meritocratic (points are earned) and culturally digestible (Australia is a friendly, Anglophone cousin country) ... Thus are we confronted with the Conservative Eurosceptics, tongue-tied but blinking smugly in the glare of referendum victory, holding a blank piece of paper where they should have answers on immigration.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/david-davis-european-union-brexit-statement-commons\">Prospect magazine, Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform</a> demonstrates that in his remarks about Britain not needing to be a member of it, David Davis shows he really does not understand the nature and importance of the EU\u2019s single market to Britain\u2019s economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is plain wrong to contend that Single Market membership has no impact on UK trade with the rest of the EU. All the evidence suggests that the UK exports far more to the EU than can be explained by geographic proximity and income levels: the CER estimates that Britain\u2019s membership of the Single Market has boosted British trade with the EU by 55%. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Tweet of the week</h2> <p>A pleasingly continental cracker, in my humble opinion, from the LRB bookshop:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LRBbookshop/status/771391358598873089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">brecht sit means brecht sit <a href=\"https://t.co/61bYFDkbTI\">pic.twitter.com/61bYFDkbTI</a></p>&mdash; LRB Bookshop (@LRBbookshop) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LRBbookshop/status/771391358598873089\">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

  "<p>We eat to live, of course. But we eat for other reasons, too. For comfort, for excitement, for indulgence, for prestige. <a href=\"https://www.playwrightshorizons.org/shows/plays/aubergine/\">Julia Cho\u2019s Aubergine</a> \u2013 a tender play both incisive and contrived \u2013 explores the social and emotional uses of food. <br></p> <p> A man in his 60s, Jung-Sok (Stephen Park), is dying of cirrhosis of the liver. His son, Ray (Tim Kang), has set up his father\u2019s hospital bed in the dining room, one of the play\u2019s somewhat blunt ironies, as Jung-Sok now refuses to eat. Another of these ironies: Ray is a chef, a m\u00e9tier his father has never endorsed. </p> <p>\u201cThe man hates my cooking,\u201d Ray explains. \u201cHe hates it. The fact of it. It\u2019s women\u2019s work, it\u2019s low class, it\u2019s uneducated.\u201d But when an uncle (Joseph Steven Yang) arrives from Korea, Ray is charged with making a soup that might soothe his father. (In this, the play has links to Cho\u2019s earlier work, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/theater/reviews/18language.html?_r=0\">The Language Archive</a>, in which a character achieved serenity through baking.)</p> <p>Cho is a precise writer and a lyrical one. And yet, in plays like The Piano Teacher, Durango and The Language Archive she evinces a particular interest in what can\u2019t or won\u2019t be said \u2013 what oft was thought, but never expressed. Here there\u2019s real poignancy in Ray\u2019s attempts to gain approval from his father, no longer capable of speech, and to communicate with his uncle, who does not speak English. Ray conscripts his ex-girlfriend, Cornelia (a splendid Sue Jean Kim), as a translator, even as he\u2019s unable to articulate his love for her. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a14dbe5ecdcf0ac5ff619cfe54a6dab0e8fb0766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a14dbe5ecdcf0ac5ff619cfe54a6dab0e8fb0766/0_240_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bite befor dying: Sue Jean Kim, Stephen Park and Joseph Steven Yang in Aubergine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bite befor dying: Sue Jean Kim, Stephen Park and Joseph Steven Yang in Aubergine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus/2016 Joan Marcus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under Kate Whoriskey\u2019s direction, these scenes are skillful and affecting, cruel and kind. There are wordless pleasures here, too, like the way Yang\u2019s uncle kneels at his brother\u2019s bedside or how Kang\u2019s Ray handles a turtle perhaps destined for the soup pot.</p> <p>But Cho interleaves these insightful scenes with somewhat forced monologues in which each character describes the best meal that he or she has ever eaten \u2013 a pastrami sandwich, a pod of okra, a bucket of fried chicken. Each of these speeches is elegantly written, but these seem like rather blatant demonstrations of Cho\u2019s skills and concerns rather than vital components of the piece. </p> <p>And within the scenes, she indulges her fondness for philosophical maxims, which sometimes seem quietly profound and at other times cloying. Too many of them are put into the mouth of Lucien (Michael Potts), a hospice nurse who was once a refugee. He presents Ray with the vegetable of the title and inducts him into the mysteries of dying with aphorisms like, \u201cKnowing where a loved one will die, knowing how \u2026 this is a gift.\u201d Is it?</p> <p> Yet beyond Lucien\u2019s somewhat maudlin words lie one of the welcome surprises of Cho\u2019s drama. What had seemed a play about food and appetite is ultimately a play about death and loss and the compensations that help us to bear it \u2013 love, care, a brick of instant ramen. </p>",

  "<p>A Donald Trump campaign rally was marred by violence yet again on Monday as the Republican nominee attacked Hillary Clinton for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump\">calling his supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d</a>.</p> <p>A Trump supporter apparently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/775467362195738624\">punched a protester</a> at a rally held at the US Cellular Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The scuffle was the first violent incident at a Trump rally in months. Although throughout the primary season, Trump campaign events had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/11/donald-trump-campaign-claims-violence-rallies\">marked by violence</a> by both Trump supporters and protesters, culminating in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos\">near riots in Chicago</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/02/donald-trump-protests-san-jose-rally-violence-sanders-clinton\">San Jose</a>, California, they had been comparatively peaceful in recent months. Prior to being punched, the protester reportedly directed an obscene gesture in Trump\u2019s direction.</p> <p>The incident happened as Trump attempted to attack Clinton for her statement that half of his supporters belong in \u201ca basket of deplorables\u201d.

The Republican nominee went on to repeat of Clinton: \u201cShe talks about people like they are objects, not human beings.\u201d</p> <p>The attacks come as Clinton has been forced off the campaign trail for health reasons. The Democratic nominee <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-campaign-regret-911-trump\">was forced to cancel</a> a campaign trip to California after being filmed losing her footing while abruptly leaving a ceremony to commemorate the 9/11 attacks on Sunday. Eventually, after initially claiming that she was \u201coverheated\u201d, the Clinton campaign admitted that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. </p> <p>In a phone interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Clinton said she was feeling better and insisted that she did not faint on Sunday. The Democratic nominee said \u201cwe know the least about Donald Trump than any candidate in recent American history\u201d and that he should be held to \u201cthe same standard\u201d as any other candidate. </p> <p>She noted the only medical information released by Trump was a letter addressed \u201cto whom my concern\u201d that proclaimed, if elected, Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d. Clinton said \u201cthat\u2019s not even serious\u201d and went on to hammer Trump for refusing to release his tax returns.</p> <p>Trump, who has long made jibes about Clinton\u2019s \u201cstamina\u201d, did not address his rival\u2019s illness on Monday night. Earlier in the day he had said he hoped she got better soon but added that her illness was \u201can issue\u201d. </p> <p>Instead, he continued his offensive against his opponent by claiming that she was running a pessimistic campaign of scare tactics. \u201cOur vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent\u2019s campaign of hate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign, with no policy, no solutions and no ideas. By contrast, I\u2019ve been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s statement was curious considering that his campaign has long focused on concerns about immigration and crime. He announced his campaign by saying Mexico was deliberately sending rapists to United States, accepted the Republican nomination by saying Americans were living in a \u201cmore dangerous environment than I have ever seen or anyone has ever seen\u201d, and has repeatedly suggested that if Clinton is elected, we will \u201cno longer have a country\u201d. Trump amplified this rhetoric on Monday by telling the crowd: \u201cYou can go to Afghanistan, you can go to war-torn countries and you will find that it is safer than some of our inner cities.\u201d</p> <p>Further, on most issues, Trump has been relatively light on policy. <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4b32e354f90741f5bbe01cc605b73d0c/trumps-deportation-waffle-highlights-campaign-weaknesses\">According to an Associated Press report</a> in late August, the Republican nominee has only posted seven policy proposals totaling 9,000 words on his website. In contrast, Clinton had released 112,735 words of proposals in 65 different issue fact sheets at the time. </p> <p>The rally took place in North Carolina, a state won by Mitt Romney in 2012 where Clinton and Trump are <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">neck and neck in polls.</a> The increasingly diverse Tarheel State is considered Clinton\u2019s best opportunity to turn a red state blue. In contrast, Trump is hoping to play the offensive in blue-collar industrial states in the midwest. </p>"
