Uzbekistan\u2019s Ikhtiyor Navruzov appeared to have lost to Mandakhnaran Ganzorig 7-6 at 65 kilograms on Sunday. Uzbekistan challenged the scoring, likely because the Mongolian began running around in celebration with less than 10 seconds left rather than engaging with Navruzov. </p> <p>Navruzov won his challenge and the match on criteria as the last wrestler to score. Ganzorig, who had already started celebrating, fell to his knees in disappointment. The Mongolian coaches went much further than that. Byambarenchin Bayoraa took his shoes and shirt off and threw them to the mat in disgust in front of the officials. Tsenrenbataar Tsostbayar stripped all the way down to his blue briefs.

France have been coached by Claude Onesta since 2001, and have been utterly dominant in a way that is rare to see in a team sport. Both coaches are among the best that handball has ever seen. If nothing else it should be an interesting tactical battle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks Kari.

This is because the USA uses a \u201cmedal count\u201d table and not, as is the case for the majority of the rest of the world a \u201cmedal table\u201d. The difference? In the \u201ccount\u201d table all medals are treated equally with a gold valued exactly the same as a bronze. Tell that to Usain Bolt and many others please! In contrast, the medals table counts golds first followed by silver and then bronze. This is fine for GB and China \u2013 as clearly GB has many more medals of a higher color than China but does a disservice to countries with many silvers and bronzes who are placed behind countries \u2013 such as Singapore and Fiji \u2013 with exactly one gold. My suggestion is to use a simple points system with gold = 5, silver = 3 and bronze = 1. USA would be on top with 364 points, GB narrowly pips China 218 to 210 but Mexico, with 3 silvers and 2 bronzes gets placed above the \u201cone gold\u201d countries with 11 points to 5.

They suffer horrible injuries, and genuinely risk their lives for their sport. They compete in a huge number of events, hundreds of races a year. And they manage to do all this, despite being obliged to starve themselves half to death for most of their adult lives.</p> <p>Trust me. Jockeys are ridiculous athletes, bordering on superhuman. And if they can control a charging horse while risking great injury a few times every day, you definitely wouldn\u2019t want to pick a fight with one.

Any way you do this is wildly insulting to incredibly focused and dedicated athletes while I ponder how many spare not he\u2019s I have on my belt, but anyway. Arguably would it be a Bolt or perhaps even a Neymar? Ignoring the financial elements, and assuming everyone has to train, diet etc, those appear to me to be the ones who can rely most on some innate skill and/or physical advantage. Maybe actually it\u2019ll be the keen eye and steady hand of one of the [ahem] less athletic disciplines like shooting or archery, but I still feel that needs a ludicrous focus that simple inbuilt skill wot be enough for.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t get to where Bolt and Neymar are without putting yourself through it. Lots of gipping at training for Bolt, for sure. I\u2019d say the innate talent, allied to his laidback character, manifests more in how he handles pressure. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b9827ae4b0377cf1118b33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:30:33.329Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cMuch as I thoroughly enjoyed Bolt doing what Bolt does like he rest of the world,\u201d emails Michael Hunt, \u201cmy vote would go for pretty much any other gold medalist, almost all bronze medalist and a good number of the silvers at the point of realisation. One thing that occasionally steers me back to football is when you see someone genuinely joyful at scoring a goal for instance, rather than striking a pose and expecting everyone to come praise them. Just before Bolt\u2019s triple for instance the pole vault saw at least 2 of the 3 medalists shrieking uncontrollably at what could be the high point of their careers. For all the training and hype, Farah doesn\u2019t cross the line with the demeanor of someone who believes the gold is his by right. Coddled and overcompensated though many may be, seeing genuine happiness still has a habit of getting to me.\u201d</p> <p>Disagree with what you say about Bolt, who isn\u2019t faking it - he is how you see him - but yes, genuine happiness is amazing. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b9814fe4b047b85f602281\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:24:18.440Z\">11.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh, and I\u2019d be keen for some jockey exposition. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b98003e4b047b85f602276\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-21T10:19:59.673Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cI have the greatest respect for the incredible stamina of the modern professional tennis player,\u201d says Rob Marriott. \u201cBut how many of them would keep going with a broken pelvis, like Geraint Thomas did in the 2013 Tour de France?

  "<p>Watch enough men\u2019s tennis and eventually you will be able to identify a top player simply from their grunts. Roger Federer is excluded from this discussion, of course, as he is far too refined to make any noise during a rally. But the rest of the Big Four are always at it. Rafa Nadal has his relentless droning urghs, Novak Djokovic clearly took inspiration from Street Fighter for his chilling two-part raa-urgh bellow, which really should be accompanied by him pulling nunchucks out of his shorts, while Andy Murray mixes it up by punctuating his imitation of Mini-Me in a vent with the startled wail of a man whose best mate has bantered him off by sliding an ice cube down his back.</p> <p>They all have their merits. Yet none of those efforts can match the bloodcurdling, guttural snort from Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro whenever he unleashes one of the trademark bone-crunching forehands that almost knocked Murray off his feet in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/andy-murray-beats-juan-martin-del-potro-rio-2016\" title=\"\">last Sunday\u2019s Olympic final</a>, a snort so dismissive that it could earn him the role of most terrifyingly muscle-bound henchman in the next James Bond film. With his mighty 6ft 6in frame, the hulking Argentinian would look and sound the part.</p> <p>He might be a gentle giant off court, a character who loves to engage the crowd by wincing in mock agony after draining rallies, but that wrecking ball of a forehand is the main reason his emphatic return has been greeted with such warmth. Tennis has not been short of historic moments this year. Djokovic completed the career slam when he finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/05/french-open-2016-final-novak-djokovic-beats-andy-murray\" title=\"\">won the French Open</a> in May, Murray became a double Olympic champion a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/10/andy-murray-wins-wimbledon-2016-milos-raonic\" title=\"\">winning his second Wimbledon</a> and Serena Williams equalled Steffi Graf\u2019s record of 22 grand slam titles when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/09/serena-williams-angelique-kerber-wimbledon-womens-final-report\" title=\"\">she triumphed in SW19</a>.</p> <p>Trophies are not the only way to measure success, however, and a player who dredges up the necessary resolve to make it back on court after losing almost two seasons to injury deserves the utmost respect. That wretched injury to Del Potro\u2019s left wrist almost robbed us of one of sport\u2019s most ominous sounds. The visceral thrill of his forehand, one of the most potent shots in the game when it is struck at full power, would not be quite the same without those complementary no-nonsense macho barks. Close your eyes and he could be wielding a giant hammer instead of a tennis racket or punching slabs of meat in a freezer. It is the sound of a man rowing a Viking boat through a sea of custard on his own. A growl that could crack open a walnut or turn a lion\u2019s mane white.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it great to have Del Potro back? There were times when he almost gave up during his rehabilitation from wrist surgery. There were false starts, regular setbacks, a nagging fear that he would have to accept the inevitable and call it quits. Having played four matches in 2015, collecting a paltry $23,475 in prize money and falling to 1,045th in the rankings, he made a tentative return on the clay earlier this year but decided not to appear in the French Open.</p> <p>His appearance at Wimbledon was his first at a grand slam in two and a half years but few people expected him to win his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/01/juan-martin-del-potro-stan-wawrinka-wimbledon\" title=\"\">second-round match against Stan Wawrinka</a>, the world No4. Wawrinka had stepped into the void created by Del Potro\u2019s injury, challenging the dominance of the Big Four by winning the Australian Open in 2014 and the French Open last year, and the Swiss was dominant in the first set.</p> <p>Yet Del Potro fought back to win in four sets and, although he ran out of steam against Lucas Pouille in the third round, here was a reminder why he was seen as the fifth Beatle of tennis before injury struck him down. After all, Wawrinka was 28 when he made his breakthrough in Australia. Del Potro was 20 when he became the first player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same grand slam, beating the latter in an unforgettable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/juan-martin-del-potro-us-open\" title=\"\">US Open final in 2009</a>.</p> <p>Seven years on from that scintillating five-set win, a revitalised Del Potro heads to New York as a strong contender to win his second grand slam title, for all that his conditioning will be tested by two weeks of five-setters in the US Open, which starts on Monday 29 August. Djokovic is floundering, Federer is injured and Nadal is no longer the remorseless force of old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/21/andy-murray-milos-raonic-cincinnati-masters\">Andy Murray beats Milos Raonic to power into Cincinnati Masters final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Del Potro did not fully trust his wrist when he faced Wawrinka, struggling to hit through his two-handed backhand, often relying on tame slices. In Rio, however, he looked more confident on that side \u2013 one two-handed backhand down the line against Murray was exceptional \u2013 and victories against Djokovic in the first round and Nadal in the semi-final were proof of his rising level. Beating Murray over five sets in the final was too much of a physical challenge, especially on a hard court that was so slow it was likened to clay, but Del Potro\u2019s threat cannot be overlooked on the faster surfaces at Flushing Meadows.</p> <p>There were no ranking points on offer in Rio, only national pride and sporting greatness, so Del Potro\u2019s silver medal did nothing for his ranking, meaning that the world No141 needed a wild card to gain entry to the US Open. Someone is going to be in for a nasty shock in the first round. The rest of us will be listening intently. Get ready for Delpo to make some noise.</p>",

Some will continue to condemn the staging of the games in a country where the public failed to fill the arenas. The consensus seems to be that this is a shameful state of affairs. But shameful for whom? Ticket prices are high relative to incomes. It was the political class, not a plebiscite the people that lobbied for these Olympics. The simple fact is the average Brazilian isn\u2019t really interested in Olympic sports, lacking not just in exposure and facilities but in that ready identification with the old European gentleman-amateur tradition. Empty seats were above all a failure of marketing by Brazil\u2019s organising committee, who bid for the games with wild abandon and then simply failed to market it, failed to pull the people into the spectacle.</p> <p>The games will roll on now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/tokyo-olympic-games-2020-ioc-international-olympic-committee-corruption-bid-scandal\">towards Tokyo 2020</a>.

  "<p>When I asked Sadiq Khan during a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/16/sadiq-khan-london-labour-winning-elections-video-interview\">video interview</a> to mark his first 100 days as London mayor if he could imagine Labour forming a government while Jeremy Corbyn is its leader, he provided what was then his stock sidestep: \u201cI think what\u2019s important is that we get back into the habit of winning elections.\u201d Only last Wednesday, LBC Radio\u2019s James O\u2019Brien had <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/700921/sadiq-khan-jeremy-corbyn-labour\">no more luck</a> than me. </p> <p>But finally, as he\u2019d promised, Khan has set out his position on the Labour leadership contest. Unsurprisingly, he prefers Owen Smith, a fellow occupant of the \u201csoft left\u201d part of the Labour spectrum. \u201cBy every available measure, if Jeremy remains as leader, Labour is extremely unlikely to win the next general election,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/labour-cannot-win-jeremy-corbyn-im-voting-for-owen-smith-says-sadiq-khan\">writes</a> in the Observer.</p> <p>Winning matters to Khan, and his record shows he\u2019s pretty good at it. Last May, he wasn\u2019t favourite to even become Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate and many doubted he would defeat his Conservative chief rival Zac Goldsmith to take command of City Hall. In the end, he won a dirty fight handsomely. </p> <p>Part of that was down to sheer know-how and steely self-discipline on the campaign trail. These habits seem quite ingrained. Back in July, after the challenge to Corbyn\u2019s leadership began, I found myself walking behind Khan and his entourage as they approached Russell Square Underground station. Joining them, I teasingly inquired: \u201cMr Khan! Mr Khan! Would you like to become Labour leader?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in that,\u201d came the instant reply. \u201cI\u2019ve already got the best job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>To which I might have said: \u201cSadiq, the election\u2019s over. And can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m just winding you up?\u201d</p> <p>I mention this by way of introduction to some parts of my 17-minute video interview that didn\u2019t make the final, four-minute cut (the Guardian keeps these things snappy). Asked about the possibility of pro-EU London securing its own Visa system to enable London employers to continue recruiting and retaining workers from EU member states with relative ease after Brexit, Khan said that such a \u201cwork permit scheme\u201d was being \u201clooked into\u201d and that arrangements of that type restricted to people living or working in the capital could also \u201cameliorate some of the concerns people outside London have about immigration\u201d whilst enabling London - and, indirectly, the rest of the country - to continue deriving the benefits.</p> <p>Here was an example of how Brexit has helped Khan develop his wider case for greater autonomy for London within the UK. I then asked him if he looked forward to next year, when mayors in other large English city regions will be elected - very probably fellow Labour ones. Did he see himself working productively with those counterparts elsewhere in the country? He replied: </p> <blockquote> <p>The direction of travel in those countries that are doing well is devolution of power to cities. There\u2019s a great saying- I think a former mayor of Detroit said this - that if the 19<sup>th</sup> century was the century for empires, the 20<sup>th</sup> for nation states, the 21<sup>st</sup> will be known as a century for cities. </p> <p>The government deserves credit, both the current government and the previous one led by David Cameron and George Osborne, about devolving power out of the civil service in Whitehall to the regions and cities. And I look forward to working with mayors in other parts of the country and, by the way, working also with Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, with Carwyn Jones in Wales and with Northern Ireland [Assembly] as well.</p> <p>The genie is out of the bottle in Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham and other regions of England. It\u2019s really important for the government to enable us to represent our communities, as we know them best. Given the choice of civil servants in Whitehall making those decisions, or democratically elected mayors with big mandates, I know which I\u2019d choose.</p> </blockquote> <p>Khan\u2019s intervention in the Labour contest has, inevitably, triggering theorising about his long-term ambitions. Was he positioning himself for a future Labour leadership bid? It has also unleashed predictable crank abuse from the more extreme Corbyn admirers and the familiar assertions that Khan owes his victory in London to Corbyn - a highly debatable point, not least given that Khan almost daily distanced himself from Corbyn during the campaign while Goldsmith strenuously and wholly falsely strove to portray him as the Labour leader\u2019s poodle.</p> <p>Whatever thoughts Khan may have about one day leading his party, and despite the boost his Observer article has given Owen Smith, Corbyn still looks set to lead Labour to defeat in 2020. By contrast, Khan\u2019s outline sketch of fruitful collaborations between fellow Labour mayors and like-minded leaders of other devolved UK administrations looks like a piece of a nearer tomorrow in formation - not only for Khan, but for Labour nationally too. </p> <p><em>Dave Hill is the author of <a href=\"https://www.politicos.co.uk/books/zac-versus-sadiq\">Zac versus Sadiq: the fight to become London Mayor</a>.</em> <br></p>",

The subject was the rejection of conventional society with its racism, warfare and repression; and the construction of alternative realities. All this was duly transmitted by an astounded mass media to living rooms around the world, while records such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a>\u2019 1967 album <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band\">Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a> formed a clarion call for the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic.

It\u2019s also a salutary reminder of the peace, love and understanding that underpinned the hippie ideals \u2013 qualities that seem in short supply in 2016.</p> <p>To create the exhibition, the V&amp;A has gathered objects ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jan/18/features11.g25\">Airplane singer Grace Slick</a>\u2019s kaftan to the first computer mouse, and spoken to a host of surviving members of the counterculture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"277e843e8571651bdd64a732377c7215dd27ad00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/277e843e8571651bdd64a732377c7215dd27ad00/0_0_2840_4112/691.jpg\" alt=\"Civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael.\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael (1941-1998).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bentley Archive/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the course of a few days in San Francisco, guided by Broackes, I also meet some of these paradigm-shifting former hippies, and visit the sites of the greatest upheaval.</p> <p>We go to the steps of the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Sproul Hall, where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Savio\">Mario Savio</a>, spokesman for the free speech movement, made his astoundingly passionate speech inspiring his fellow students to stage a sit-in and stop \u201cthe operation of the machine\u201d. The free speech protests marked a direct link from the civil rights movement, in which Savio had participated, to the anti-war protests that would convulse Berkeley at the end of the 60s; just as the Beatniks of the previous decade, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg\">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Cassady\">Neal Cassady</a>, had profoundly influenced the hippies.</p> <p>We meet Rick Moss, curator at the <a href=\"http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/locations/african-american-museum-library-oakland\">African American Museum in Oakland</a>, who was 12 when the Black Panthers started galvanising his San Francisco community. \u201cIt was very empowering because at no point in your upbringing were you ever given examples of where black people were standing up for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when you see guys swaggering to the state capitol and they\u2019re having their weapons, it\u2019s like The Lone Ranger. We were like: \u2018This is great! This is what you do, you stand up to injustice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Then there are the artists who defined the aesthetics of psychedelia. One, Joe McHugh, created a Jefferson Airplane-inspired poster called <a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/538883911641195435/\">White Rabbit</a>, which depicted a rabbit standing on a chessboard, the words \u201ckeep your head\u201d dematerialising in the background. The other, Stanley Miller, known as Mouse, made the <a href=\"http://www.rrauction.com/Stanley-Mouse-Grateful-Dead-Painting.html\">skull and roses artwork for the Grateful Dead</a>, although he much preferred hanging out with Janis Joplin. \u201cShe was wild,\u201d he remembers, with a glint in his eye. \u201cThe first time she came to my studio she chased me around \u2013 I was kind of scared of her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People drew pictures of the psych experience with lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, on acid everything got clear</p> <footer> <cite>Stanley 'Mouse' Miller</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Music had drawn him from Detroit to California: \u201cIt was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/16/how-we-made-eight-miles-high-the-byrds\">the Byrds</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas\">the Mama and the Papas</a> \u2013 that ringing sound, like a siren calling me,\u201d he says, still dreamy at the memory. Like most of the cultural productions of the time, his posters were drug-induced, but he never employed the bulbous lettering and eye-searing hues popular at the time. \u201cA lot of people, how they drew pictures of the psych experience was a lot of colours and mandalas, but to me, [on acid] everything got super-clear.\u201d</p> <p>Miller later moved to London, where he spent a year working for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(UK_magazine)\">Nova magazine</a> and hanging out at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps\">Beatles\u2019 Apple headquarters</a> on Savile Row (now a branch of Abercrombie and Fitch). He saw their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert\">final concert take place on the building\u2019s roof</a>, without realising that he was witnessing history. He also stopped taking acid that year. \u201cIt fell out of fashion.

With the aid of some genetic engineers, Brand is also trying to bring back 12 extinct species, and says that he is making real progress on the woolly mammoth: \u201cWe use the Asian elephant as a scaffold to assemble the geonome.\u201d</p> <p>Brand had an intense but limited period of drug experimentation; at 80, Kahn still uses marijuana, although he vapes rather than smokes it. The first time Kahn took acid, he says, \u201cI saw a flower breathing and it wasn\u2019t a hallucination. Flowers do breathe, but you don\u2019t really see it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The show delineates how the world transformed in those seismic years of the 1960s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a biology student at Stanford, Brand first took mescaline when in the army, then became a participant in one of the famous government-sponsored scientific studies of the effects of LSD at Menlo Park, which helped to ignite the 60s drug culture. \u201cThe hippie phenomenon was to go and discover how the world works, so all the kids went out with backpacks doing the same thing. And we learned a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Soon he was travelling to Native American reservations where he engaged in all-night <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyote\">peyote</a> rituals, joining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/06/lsd-ken-kesey-pranksters-film\">author Ken Kesey</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters\">the Merry Pranksters</a> to stage the acid tests \u2013 parties fuelled by LSD that featured light shows, film projections and bands such as <a href=\"http://ultimateclassicrock.com/warlocks-grateful-dead/\">the Warlocks (who would later rename themselves the Grateful Dead</a>). \u201cWeird shit would be tried,\u201d notes Brand.

While \u201cfull of acid\u201d in 1966, the lifelong conservationist (hence the mammoths) pondered how to get more people caring about the Earth. The architect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller\">Buckminster Fuller</a> \u2013 whose <a href=\"https://bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/geodesic-domes\">geodesic dome</a> was displayed in the USA pavilion at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Biosph%C3%A8re\">1967 World Expo in Montreal</a> \u2013 had made the point \u201cthat people think it\u2019s a flat Earth, which makes them think its resources are infinite, and if they just understood it is a sphere, and therefore finite, they would treat everything differently.\u201d</p> <p>Brand got badges printed that asked: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\u201d and the following year an image taken by satellite was released by Nasa. It gave the cover image and title to Brand\u2019s next project, the Whole Earth Catalog, published in the autumn of 1968, biannually until 1972, then sporadically afterwards.</p> <p>Like many of the originators of San Francisco\u2019s counterculture, Brand had become fed up with the enormous influx of rubberneckers into Haight-Ashbury and, in 1968, headed out to New Mexico and Colorado to participate in the movement to live on communes in America\u2019s vast countryside. Before long, he realised that the communards would need tools, books and ideas, which he decided to collate into a mail-order catalogue. \u201cWhim is the best source,\u201d he says. \u201cThe catalogue enables the ability to have a whim and then act upon it, and that\u2019s pretty much my life.\u201d</p> <p>Brand hands me his copy of the first Whole Earth Catalog, dog-eared and with the dimensions of an oversized magazine (a copy will be in the show).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb/0_234_3710_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Psychedelic rock concert at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purely on a media level, the Whole Earth Catalog has been hugely influential; when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/behind-the-relaunch-of-the-new-york-times-magazine-by-jake-silverstein.html?_r=0\">the New York Times relaunched its Sunday magazine</a> in February last year, it also had a globe on the cover. The pages inside the catalogue are wonderfully designed, stuffed with information, but never messy or confusing. It wasn\u2019t this, however, that made the catalogue truly groundbreaking. First of all, it was crowdsourced \u2013 40 years before the term became commonplace. Brand appealed for readers to send in suggestions for items that those in communes would find useful (\u201cthe customers know best,\u201d he said), paid $10 per item used, and printed the most helpful, making up about a quarter of the overall content. This underlined the fact that the catalogue wasn\u2019t a book so much as a network, where likeminded people could find and share the information they needed to enter and improve alternative worlds. Symbolising this \u2013 alongside boots and teepees \u2013 the first issue featured Hewlett-Packard\u2019s desktop computer, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_9100A\">9100A Calculator</a>, then retailing at $4,900.</p> <p>Brand straddled the worlds of the communes and computers, having become interested in the latter while studying at Stanford, where he filmed the first public demonstration of a computer mouse in 1968. \u201cI was just endlessly impatient for all these things to come into the world, because I\u2019d already seen it \u2013 the mouse and online typing, being able to mutually massage something on screen with another person, which even now is kind of difficult \u2026 [it was] apparatus to augment the human intellect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3d88c11a01e7a4e988b8e9f79d97a292a262528/0_0_3937_3087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swingeing London 67 (a) 1968 69, Richard Hamilton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hamilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This reconceptualising of the world as an information network made the catalogue hugely inspiring to a significant handful of local computer scientists. To the most forward-thinking and idealistic, the possibilities of technology hinted at a new world in which information could be shared among likeminded people, leaping over barriers of geography, race or class.</p> <p>One of them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs\">Steve Jobs</a>, who was brought up in Palo Alto and who, in 2005, told a group of graduating students at Stanford <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/\">in a famous speech</a>: \u201cThe Whole Earth Catalog \u2026 was one of the bibles of my generation \u2026 it was a sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs concluded his address with: \u201cStay hungry, stay foolish\u201d \u2013 Brand\u2019s motto from a mid-70s issue, intended as the final one, which Jobs claimed as his ethos and which has now become ubiquitous as a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Stay+hungry,+stay+foolish+t+shirt&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjutJD1rs3OAhWBWxoKHRiSAeEQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170\">T-shirt slogan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;biw=2222&amp;bih=1170&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;oq=Stay+hungry%2C+stay+foolish+meme&amp;gs_l=img.3...12704.12859.0.12974.2.2.0.0.0.0.54.80.2.2.0.cprnk%2Ctoken%3Doa...0...1.1j2.64.img..0.1.54...0.c2jp1Q61ywE\">meme</a>.

  "<p>The war on terror has inordinately affected Latino immigrants for the last 15 years, according to two sociologists who say Donald Trump has simply made explicit fears that long linked linked terrorism with anxieties about migrants and Muslims.<br></p> \n<p>In a research paper presented on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Seattle, Lu\u00eds Romero and Amina Zarrugh, sociologists at the University of Texas at Austin, argued that since the attacks of September 11 2001, the US has increasingly merged terrorism and immigration in official policy and the daily work of its government agencies.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump is articulating, in its most explicit terms, a connection that\u2019s been insinuated and elaborated perhaps less colorfully and less explicitly, but that\u2019s been going on for quite some time,\u201d Zarrugh said. \u201cThe American public has been primed for these connections for at least a decade.\u201d</p> \n<p>She and Romero pored over 15 years\u2019 worth of speeches and government documents to chart the merger and its effect on Latinos. Months after the attack, congressmen started warning of \u201cporous borders\u201d, and years of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/17/trent-franks/isis-mexico-and-planning-cross-border/\">false</a> <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/11/21/exclusive-rep-john-culberson.html\">claims </a>and <a href=\"http://dev.factcheck.org/2006/08/democrats-ask-do-you-feel-safer/\">alarming ads</a> about terrorist activity at or near the border followed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey started framing almost any migrant at the US-Mexico border as a potential terrorist threat,\u201d Zarrugh said. \u201cIn the past, the border was a place to stop drug trafficking and undocumented migration, but there became a surveillance-driven, militarized perspective of migrants as potential terrorists.\u201d</p> \n<p>That rhetoric became policy, she said, and \u201cpolicy began to shape this \u2018us-versus-them\u2019 sentiment in new ways\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lawmakers used national security proposals as vehicles for immigration laws, Romero added. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to use the term Trojan horse,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause a lot of the rhetoric used against immigrants is about Trojan horses, of terrorist threats using immigrants to enter the US.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both researchers were quick to note that Muslims and south-west Asian people were unfairly targeted by much of the rhetoric and measures, though their paper studied the way \u201cirrational fear of Muslims has mapped on to immigration\u201d, in Romero\u2019s words. \u201cIncreased surveillance and security were an easy sell.\u201d</p> \n<p>None of the 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks on September 11 entered the country illegally, though three had overstayed their visas or violated their rules of stay.

Ailes told colleagues while Sherman was writing the book: \u201cI know where he lives, and I\u2019m gonna send people to beat the shit out of him,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/media/tipsheets/morning-media/2016/08/another-ailes-spectacularsecond-amendment-sagaerstwhile-ap-power-duo-reunites-001084\">according to Politico</a>.</p> <p>In conversation, Sherman is laudably detached, even clinical about the vigor with which Ailes tried to shake him off, the same tone he strikes in the unusual note appended to the end of his book about the 614 sources he interviewed.</p> <p>\u201c[H]e had amassed power by harnessing television to control the images of politicians and media personalities,\u201d Sherman writes of Ailes. \u201cAnd so it made sense that he would seek the same degree of influence over the story he cared about most: his own.\u201d</p> <p>Sherman says that the campaign against him gave him one of his few reporting advantages over the course of composing Loudest Voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it personally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant to have your reputation maligned on various websites \u2013 and reading about threats he made against me, that wasn\u2019t fun. But as a journalist I just used it as a wealth of material, because he was showing me who he was just by the extreme lengths he went to just to suppress my book.\u201d</p> <p>With his reputation and his legacy in tatters, it looks certain that Ailes will spend years fighting allegations of harassment of the many women at the network, even if Carlson, who has begun legal action personally, settles. But Sherman says the Murdoch family may pay far greater sums in lost revenue than the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/fmr-fox-booker-harassed-by-ailes-for-20-years.html\">millions</a> Ailes is alleged to have spent to silence his accusers.</p> <p> \u201cA lot of people have drawn parallels to the UK phone hacking scandal but I think in terms of the potential impact on 21st Century Fox, this could be far greater,\u201d Sherman says of Ailes\u2019s demise. Fox News is a wildly profitable fiefdom within the Murdoch empire, with revenue of about $2.3bn last year and much lower expenses than either of its less lucrative competitors, CNN and MSNBC. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/28/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes\">Gretchen Carlson angry it took so long for Fox News to fire Roger Ailes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe News of the World [Murdoch\u2019s most profitable UK tabloid before he closed it following the hacking scandal] was not a major profit engine,\u201d says Sherman, who has covered the media since his early days at the Observer.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time the scandal hit, newspapers had fallen on hard times,\u201d Sherman observes. \u201cThe News of the World used to be the Fox News of the Murdoch empire years ago, but it was a dwindling asset \u2013 Fox News is still in its prime. So to have a scandal that rocks it to the core poses a great risk to the corporate parent.\u201d </p> <p>The scandal is so damaging because supporters and detractors of the network all agree on one thing: Fox News <em>i</em><em>s</em> Roger Ailes. Or was.</p> <p>The man at the centre of that maelstrom is as mercurial and interesting as any in the media world, Sherman says. Ailes is \u201ca world-historical figure\u201d whose harsh perspective came to define American conservatism in his 20 years running the most-viewed cable news network in America. \u201cI think he\u2019s kind of a historical icon, very much on the level of a J Edgar Hoover; someone who will define their age,\u201d Sherman says. \u201cHe transcends the medium of television.\u201d</p> <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, Sherman believes Ailes accomplished that transcendence by using Fox News not as a means to advance a particular established brand of conservatism, but as his personal megaphone. \u201cHe has sort of contradictory positions that are not necessarily completely in sync with the [rightwing thinktanks] Cato Institute or the Heritage Foundation; classically conservative institutions in America. He\u2019s very populist, he\u2019s nationalist, he\u2019s not for open borders. I reported in my book that one of his immigration plans was to dispatch Navy Seals to the Mexico border with orders to shoot to kill anyone crossing. That\u2019s not a very nuanced immigration position. At least Donald Trump only wants to build a wall; Roger Ailes wants to kill people.\u201d</p> <p>That minor point of difference aside, in many ways Trump himself is the avatar of Ailes\u2019s philosophy, and now Ailes is his advisor. Trump swept the US Republican primaries not by virtue of his political acumen or even basic competence, but on a wave of populist rage beloved of Fox News viewers but anathema to moneyed conservatives. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump has really repelled a lot of mainstream and conservative Republicans,\u201d Sherman observes. \u201cSo that\u2019s really one of Roger Ailes\u2019s legacies: reshaping the Republican party as a populist, blue-collar, white nativist party. The Washington elites and the conservative intellectuals, because of Ailes\u2019s power, had to kind of hold their noses and graft themselves onto it. Without question, I don\u2019t think Roger Ailes is a conservative in the mould of a Bill Buckley. He\u2019s unique to Roger Ailes.\u201d</p> <p>Sherman has the New York media world at home as well as at work. His wife Jennifer Stahl has worked at ProPublica and the New Yorker, and his father, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, has written the occasional op-ed. His career is a stark contrast to Ailes\u2019s own: the Fox News executive worked nearly every job in television during his ascendancy; Sherman has stretched his professional legs occasionally, but he\u2019s written about media since 2003.</p> <p>The writer has interviewed 20 women alleging sexual harassment by Ailes; he says their stories are disturbingly similar. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I found these stories so credible,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are women who live all over the country and the time period spans from the 1960s to the mid-2000s and what\u2019s remarkable over that 40- to 50-year period is that the pattern is exactly the same.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/22/roger-ailes-fox-news-sexual-assault-allegations\">How one lawsuit unleashed a cascade of allegations against Roger Ailes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was surprised, however, by how cavalier Ailes appeared to be during those encounters. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable to me is that for a man as paranoid as he is, that Roger Ailes would be so reckless in his personal behaviour,\u201d Sherman says. \u201cBecause while I knew that he had sexually harassed women in the past, I just couldn\u2019t imagine that so many women had experienced it and he\u2019d be able to keep it a secret for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Now Ailes has lost his perch in television \u2013 Sherman says he understands that the former executive\u2019s non-compete clause bars him from re-entering the media world until he\u2019s 80 years old. The consequences of his absence from TV will be major, Sherman predicts.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see conservative media splintered across the ideological spectrum,\u201d Sherman says, and already sees attention shifting to outlets such as Breitbart, the Conservative site that is also avowedly pro-Trump. \u201cThat\u2019ll be really interesting because Fox was this amazing unifier of all the strands of conservatism together. Ailes used his ruthlessness to kind of keep everyone in line. Now that he\u2019s out of the picture, one of my Fox sources joked that inside Fox News it\u2019s kind of a Lord of the Flies situation where everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe could see that transposed to the conservative media landscape as a whole.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDTNFhiQ8ig\">Jesse Owens </a>in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEt_Xgg8dzc\">Bob Beamon </a>in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWX2LdlxsQ\">Jeff Henderson</a>, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record.</p> <p>More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up.</p> <p>The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing.</p> <p>It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal</a>: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/16/why-are-uk-workers-so-unproductive\">Why are UK workers so unproductive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental.</p> <p>Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d</p> <p>The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US.<br></p> <p>But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows.</p> <p>Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve. It is more than a century since the first cars appeared on the streets, yet the auto industry is still looking for ways to make better cars more efficiently. <br></p> <p>Economies can grow even when productivity is exceptionally weak, as it has been in the years since the global recession. That\u2019s possible if the labour force expands or if people work longer hours. The problem seems to be the weakness of investment. Companies are tending to employ more labour to work with ageing capital equipment, leading to weaker productivity.<br></p> <p>Central banks have become like the dodgy coaches administering drugs to their athletes. They have found ways of making performance look better than it would otherwise be. Instead of artificial stimulants they have used ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing.</p> <p>In theory, individual countries are not supposed to use these unconventional measures to the detriment of their rivals. Loose monetary policy is deemed to be fine if it is for domestic purposes \u2013 raising the growth rate or steering clear of deflation \u2013 but not if it is to secure a competitive advantage by driving down the currency.</p> <p>But everybody suspects everybody else of cheating. The Americans are convinced that the Chinese are deliberately holding down the level of the yuan in order to boost exports. The reluctance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">US Federal Reserve </a>to raise interest rates is deemed, in part, to be the result of concerns about an over-strong dollar. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/bank-of-japan-blames-brexit-as-it-unleashes-more-monetary-stimulus\">Japanese have openly admitted that they would like to see the yen lower.</a> Concerns about the strength of the euro help explain why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank </a>is mulling the possibility of fresh stimulus measures this autumn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England </a>is in a different position. A cheaper pound would have been necessary at some point if the UK was ever to start closing its colossal balance of payments deficit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>has delivered that depreciation without it looking like an act of beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Threadneedle Street is taking full advantage of the situation: dropping strong hints of further interest rate cuts to come is designed to ensure that the unlooked for competitive boost provided by the referendum is not dissipated.</p> <p>If this were the Olympics, the closest comparison would be the Devil Take the Hindmost race in the cycling omnium. There, the rider at the back of the field drops out every couple of laps, and each contestant pedals furiously to ensure it is not them.</p> <p>Eventually, central banks hope to create the conditions for an acceleration in productivity growth. The idea is that boosting demand will lead to better supply-side performance. That, though, is taking some time. The past few years have been a slow-bicycle race led by China, with the US the best of the developed countries. </p> <p>Eventually, innovation and more skilled workforces will result in higher productivity. For now, though, central banks are expending a lot of effort for less growth than in previous decades. None is close to a PB.<br></p>",

And that is the single biggest problem with him running a presidential campaign like an online flame war.

Any engagement is really adding fuel to their fire,\u201d says Jan Reischek, senior vice-president of ICUC Americas. This means that Clinton and her supporters should never resort to trolling behavior themselves, no matter what Trump says. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz fell for this, reacting to Trump\u2019s name calling with sneers that only emboldened Trump. \u201cI worry about Elizabeth Warren,\u201d says Powazek, referring to the Democratic Massachusetts senator that Trump has insultingly called \u201cPochahontas\u201d, and who consistently fights with him<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/754327065810210816?ref_src=twsrc%25255Etfw\"> on Twitter</a>. \u201cShe\u2019s out there fighting fire with fire, but tactically it\u2019s a mistake, because it allows him to set the tone of the debate, and the debate is in the mud.

Bog him down in specifics, and hold his feet to the fire on statements he makes on complicated issues like defense and fiscal policy, where his trolling tactics are of no use. Bill Eddy says this is the most effective way for dealing with high-conflict personalities. \u201cRespond with information as assertively as the other side is responding aggressively. Aggressive tries to destroy the other party, but assertive stands up for yourself. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Defuse the anger</strong></p> <p>Trolls live to stoke rage. That is all they can do. Friendliness is their kryptonite. Clinton should muster every diplomatic skill she picked up at the state department and keep every public interaction friendly, no matter how much she despises Trump. \u201cYou have to ignore the living hell out of it,\u201d says West.</p> <p>This is obviously easier said than done, especially for the media, which may take issue with Trump\u2019s message and tactics, but is nonetheless compelled to cover the presidential nominee.</p> <h2>\u2022\u2022\u2022</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy may be unprecedented, but he is unlikely to be the last candidate to employ a troll\u2019s tactics in the pursuit of power. If there is one thing the experts in online communities agree on, it\u2019s that trolling is a persistent problem with no simple solution. Like crime, terrorism or pandemic diseases, once introduced into a community, trolls will always return. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have the antibodies we\u2019ve developed online to deal with trolls,\u201d says Powazek. Perhaps a resounding Trump defeat in November can inoculate us against a bigger surge of troll candidates in the future, but many worry it will be too late.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe time frame is a little short for the kind of learning we all need,\u201d says Gail Ann Williams, who worked for many years fighting trolls at the website the Well. \u201cThe stakes are so high. It\u2019s interesting to take these things and see them as a drama or sociological phenomenon, but the stakes are so much higher.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>Heston Blumenthal: leg of lamb, L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re, Provence</h2> <p><strong><em>Chef owner, the Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire</em></strong></p> <p>Memories are important to Heston Blumenthal. They are the raw material of his wildly imaginative creations at the Fat Duck, and the experience of eating there is designed to stir up powerful feelings of nostalgia, right down to the name of each dish. Current examples include, \u201c<a href=\"https://genuiness.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/the-fat-duck-bray-magical-heston/can-i-have-some-money-for-the-ice-cream-van/\">Can I have some money for the ice cream van?</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://genuiness.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/the-fat-duck-bray-magical-heston/then-we-went-rockpooling-4/\">Then we went rockpooling</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The pivotal memory for Blumenthal himself, the one that made him want to become a chef, is of a meal in Provence in 1982, at the two-Michelin-starred restaurant L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re. His family usually holidayed in Cornwall, where Blumenthal remembers eating crayfish off Formica tables by the seaside. But that summer his dad, who ran an office equipment company, decided to mark a good year at work by taking the family to France.</p> <p>Blumenthal was 16 at the time but not yet a food lover. His mother was a good cook and he can remember getting excited about fish and chips at Micky\u2019s in Paddington and drinking jasmine tea at Lee Ho Fook in Chinatown, but he had \u201cnever eaten a lobster and certainly never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/the-fat-duck-flies-again-heston-blumenthal\">Heston Blumenthal interview: the Fat Duck flies again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His recollection of that dinner in Provence is remarkably clear, as if it happened yesterday. \u201cThey park your car for you,\u201d he begins, \u201cand you walk up some steps and there\u2019s a farmhouse at the foot of bauxite cliffs. You know that warmth as the sun is setting, and you can hear the crickets starting and you get the smell of lavender? At the time I can\u2019t remember if I recognised it as lavender or not, but the smell was overwhelming. We sat out on the terrace. It was dark but all lit up \u2013 like an enchanted wood. I remember the chink of glasses and I have a very strong memory of the soft crunch of the waiting staff\u2019s feet on the gravel.\u201d</p> <p>Leg of lamb is the dish that is most imprinted on his memory. \u201cIt was wrapped in puff pastry and carved at the table. It came with some dauphinoise and green beans. We had a mullet dish with basil and tomato. Dessert was a cr\u00eape Baumani\u00e8re, baked with a souffl\u00e9 filling.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary food was just one element in a dizzying rush of sensory information. \u201cEverything seemed massive \u2013 because I was small, but also because certain details are magnified in your memory. The wine list seemed as big as a billboard, the cheese trolley was the size of a chariot.\u201d He sums up the experience in terms that anyone who\u2019s eaten at the Fat Duck or watched one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/20/sundays-best-tv-hestons-dinners-in-space-tribes-predators-me-the-night-manager\">Blumenthal\u2019s TV shows</a> will recognise: \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d fallen down this rabbit hole into a wonderland.\u201d</p> <p>The impact was immediate. \u201cBack home, I became absolutely obsessed with the great chefs of France and I would hoover up their cookbooks \u2013 I remember translating the Troisgros brothers\u2019 <em>Nouvelle Cuisine </em>into English word for word with a French-English dictionary.\u201d He cooked obsessively at home and when he started working odd jobs \u2013 photocopier salesman, debt collector \u2013 he would save up for six months and then blow all his money on eating out.</p> <p>When I ask how things might have panned out had he not eaten at L\u2019Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re, Blumenthal acknowledges that his life could have gone in a completely different direction. But he insists that even with that meal in Provence under his belt, the path towards the Fat Duck was a meandering one. He needed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2014/nov/03/chemistry-food-and-drink\">discover Harold McGee</a> and start questioning everything about cooking; he needed to stumble upon the recipe for parmesan ice-cream which inspired him to toy with preconceptions of food; he needed to take up kick-boxing, which gave him the discipline to see him through years of experimentation.</p> <p>Even the week-long stage at Raymond Blanc\u2019s Le Manoir which dissuaded him from working in other people\u2019s kitchens \u2013 \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want the creativity beaten out of me\u201d \u2013 was a factor.</p> <p>The size of the rundown pub in Bray that he converted into the Fat Duck in 1995 was important too. \u201cBecause the kitchen was so tiny and the kit was second-hand and rubbish, I had to find ways of getting my food to a level of precision.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal\u2019s interest in multi-sensory dining \u2013 using scented dry ice to intensify flavours, creating an audio soundtrack to add extra dimensions to a seafood dish \u2013 could also be explained in terms of the small size of the first Fat Duck and the scale of the memories he was trying to recreate. \u201cMy memory of L\u2019Oustau was growing but I had a pub with one door on the side of the road. I didn\u2019t have a mountain or a water fountain in the background or the crunching gravel or the lavender, I didn\u2019t have the valley of olive trees in Provence.

All quite aromatic flavours, but balanced perfectly. I\u2019d never tasted anything like it. I knew right then that I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/03/clare-smyth-woman-kitchen-men-behave\">wanted to cook at that level</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take her long.

It was totally inappropriate, but that was the only reaction I could have, it was that good.\u201d</p> <p>Harris, whose north Kent pub the Sportsman won best restaurant at the National Restaurant Awards in June, was dining at Nico at Ninety on Park Lane. He was a financial adviser at the time but, despite a keen interest in cooking, admits: \u201cI don\u2019t think I really knew what a Michelin-starred restaurant was.\u201d</p> <p>It had been a good month in the office so Harris and two colleagues decided a celebratory lunch was in order.

The main course was a braised knuckle of veal with a mustard sauce and carrots cut into squares.\u201d But it was the dessert that tipped him over the edge. \u201cIt had a powerful lemon flavour, sweetened just enough to balance it. It came with a little tulip-shaped biscuit with a scoop of ice-cream in it and a pool of raspberry sauce. It was mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>If the lemon tart made Harris want to become a chef, the overall experience at Nico at Ninety triggered an idea that he would eventually realise at the Sportsman. \u201cI remember saying afterwards, \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame only rich people eat like this. Why can\u2019t you get food this good without all the folderol?\u2019 Then I thought, hang on, if you take away the fancy location, the army of waiters, the expensive napery and crockery, and it\u2019s just a plate, a knife and a fork, I could serve food as good as this in a place where you wouldn\u2019t have to go through the whole drama. A lemon tart in itself isn\u2019t an expensive thing. It\u2019s labour-intensive and technically difficult, but if you crack the technique, that doesn\u2019t cost anything. That\u2019s just being smart, working out how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jun/28/grotty-pub-uk-best-restaurant-sportsman-kent-menu\">How a \u2018grotty rundown pub\u2019 became the UK\u2019s best restaurant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He didn\u2019t waste any time.

Rather than serve the groom\u2019s family first, as is the custom, the cooks at her grandfather\u2019s house in Kolkata made the mistake of sending out the dish to their employers. Horrified at the offence this might cause, Asma\u2019s mother sent her daughter into the kitchen to sort out the problem.</p> <p>Khan was 18 and had never so much as boiled an egg. \u201cI come from a royal family \u2013 Rajput on my father\u2019s side, Bengali on my mother\u2019s \u2013 where none of the women knew how to cook,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The troublesome dish was a Kolkata dum biryani: layers of rice, mutton, potatoes, saffron and spices covered with a dough seal and heated over a wood fire for 12 hours. When Khan \u2013 \u201cin all my finery, dressed head to toe in jewellery\u201d \u2013 rushed into the kitchen to help, the cooks were breaking the seal. \u201cI had never smelled it this close before,\u201d she says. \u201cBy the time it comes to the table, it has already lost a lot of the fragrance.\u201d She describes the moment in almost spiritual terms. \u201cThe aroma hit my soul. I was mesmerised. The chef put a grain of rice in my hand. I tasted it and thought, I\u2019m going to cook like this one day.\u201d</p> <p>It took a long time to realise that ambition. Khan married a few years later and in 1991 moved to Cambridge with her husband, an economics professor. \u201cHe told my family he knew how to cook,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cHe could only cook one chicken curry and, man, I never want to eat that again. After two miserable years I started to learn.\u201d The first recipe she picked up was the dum biryani from Haji, the chef who made it at the wedding.</p> <p>What she really wanted to do was cook professionally, but instead she completed a law degree in London, followed by a PhD, though she had no intention of practising. \u201cI just wanted to cook. My husband was horrified, but nothing made me happier. So on the day I did my viva [an oral exam], I started my food business.\u201d She was 43 and she felt liberated. \u201cIndian women spend their lives doing things to please other people. I was born with those chains, now I\u2019m not in chains.\u201d</p> <p>The first public dinner Khan hosted, at the German Institute in South Kensington in 2012, sold twice as many tickets as she hoped, inspiring her to start a supper club at her home. Word spread about her cooking, which she describes as \u201cold-fashioned food that you don\u2019t get unless you know an Indian family\u201d, and she ran a successful nine-month residency at The Sun &amp; 13 Cantons pub in Soho, awarded four stars by <em>Evening Standard</em> restaurant critic Fay Maschler. Now she\u2019s gathering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/01/cool-cuisine-heatwave-what-to-eat\">her most popular recipes</a> into a book while continuing to cook at venues around London. (A restaurant isn\u2019t on the cards right now because she has two sons, 11 and 16, to look after.)</p> <p>Khan says she has no regrets that her cooking ambitions took so long to realise: \u201cWhen it is my time, that\u2019s when it happens.\u201d About the biryani, which she still makes on special occasions, she is similarly philosophical. \u201cEvery time I make it, I feel nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is something emotional about it, because once the rice is sealed, your fate is sealed. With other dishes, you can tweak them, taste them. Here you can do nothing. You only know what\u2019s happened to it when you open it.\u201d<br><a href=\"http://www.darjeeling-express.com/supper-clubs\"><em>darjeeling-express.com/supper-clubs</em></a></p> <h2>Uyen Luu: Mum\u2019s caramelised sardines<br></h2> <p><strong><em>Cook and author</em></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1d287f3b2d2f352ce542a4ba9ff8ef5681fb55b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d287f3b2d2f352ce542a4ba9ff8ef5681fb55b/1067_591_5194_6490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Uyen Luu\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uyen Luu: \u2018I was like, \u201cReally?

This is what happened to the food writer Uyen Luu, who runs a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/16/uyen-luu-vietnamese-food-refugee-author\">popular Vietnamese supper club</a> in Hackney. Her mother wouldn\u2019t allow her to help in the kitchen at home, and when she went abroad aged 20 and started pining for home-cooked food, she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how to make it.</p> <p>Luu had left her film and video course at Central St Martin\u2019s in the middle of term, travelling to New York with three friends to seek work experience on movie sets. They were on a tight budget and, she says, \u201cthere was only so many bagels with cream cheese I could eat. I missed Mum\u2019s cooking so much \u2013 until then I\u2019d taken it for granted.\u201d Unable to produce caramelised sardines or tomato soup with sea bass in their tiny East Village apartment, Luu phoned home.</p> <p>That longing for familiar food was something Luu\u2019s mother, Nga Le, felt when she arrived in London in 1982 with two young children. A refugee from Saigon, where her family were suffering under the communist regime, Nga found herself in a place \u2013 Highbury \u2013 which offered little to remind her of Vietnam. Nga had never learned how to cook until, craving the flavours she\u2019d left behind, she met other members of London\u2019s Vietnamese community and started absorbing their knowledge.</p> <p>Fifteen years later, Luu was amazed to discover that her mother\u2019s cooking wasn\u2019t as complicated as she\u2019d imagined. \u201cI called her for the caramelised sardines recipe. She told me to get a pot, fry the onions or shallots with a bit of sugar, brown off the fish, and then add coconut water and let it reduce. I was like, \u2018Really? Is that all?\u2019 It was so easy.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2012/oct/15/vietnamese-cooking-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3b2gg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1812742\"            data-video-name=\"Vietnamese cooking: Uyen Luu's home restaurant - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Crane tv\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/10/1349862612955/Vietnamese-cook---video-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397487632\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/10/1349862612955/Vietnamese-cook---video-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/10/121009VietCrane_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121009VietCrane/121009VietCrane.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2012/oct/15/vietnamese-cooking-video\">Vietnamese cooking: Uyen Luu\u2019s home restaurant</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And how did it turn out?</p> <p>\u201cPretty good,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t have my mum\u2019s touch.\u201d</p> <p>Inspired, Luu began cooking in earnest. \u201cThere were great supermarkets nearby that opened late, and after a night of partying I\u2019d go out and buy things to cook at 2am \u2013 it was so exciting.\u201d Her interest continued to develop back in London but it didn\u2019t become professional until she was 32. \u201cWhen I moved into my current house in Hackney, I had lots of dinner parties.

  "<p>To most of the world, the place where James Foley spent his childhood must look about as good as it gets: a clapboard house with a large garden in a small town next to a beautiful lake. Visualise the American dream and this is it, pretty much. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where Foley grew up in a close-knit family of five siblings, is an affluent corner of a well-off state in the world\u2019s most advanced industrial economy. The worst thing you can say about the place is that it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/for-wolfeboro-nh-its-not-just-another-romney-summer.html\" title=\"\">where Mitt Romney goes on&#xa0;holiday</a>.</p> <p>This was where James Foley started his life. And on 19 August 2014, the world found out where and how it ended via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/19/james-wright-foley-beheaded-isis-video\" title=\"\">a video posted on YouTube</a> entitled \u201cA Message to America\u201d. Foley, a 40-year-old freelance photojournalist who had been kidnapped in Syria two years earlier, was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling on the ground. With his hands tied behind his back, he&#xa0;recited what was obviously a prepared script that listed America\u2019s crimes. And then, we all know what happened next: a masked man with a distinctive British accent put a knife to his throat and decapitated him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw his image being used as propaganda, for political agendas, and for me as a friend, that was uncomfortable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At home in New Hampshire, Diane Foley, his mother, found out when she got a call from a journalist she didn\u2019t know who asked her for her \u201creaction\u201d.</p> <p>If you wanted to eviscerate the American dream, to disembowel it, and string it up from a lamp-post for all the world to see how vulnerable it really is, how easily vanquished, then murdering James Wright Foley on the internet in front of a global audience is not a bad place to start.</p> <p>Foley could have been the poster boy for the all-American way of life: a handsome, square-jawed idealist from a well-off family \u2013 his father, John, a doctor, his mother a pillar of the local Catholic church \u2013 who\u2019d had all the advantages that western life can confer: a loving environment, a good education, a childhood unmarked by war or famine or disaster. That he had elected to leave all that and go and cover the ongoing insurgency in Syria for a few hundred dollars a pop from whichever outlet he could get to take his footage was neither here nor there to his captors.</p> <p>His murder was the first of a series of videos of western hostages being executed and it presaged an new form of terror. It was the video that introduced the world to \u201cJihadi John\u201d, or Mohammed Emwazi as we now know he was called. We know quite a lot about him now \u2013 how he grew up in upmarket parts of London \u2013 Maida Vale and St John\u2019s Wood, how Foley\u2019s fellow prisoners named him and two fellow British jihadis \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, and how, in November 2015, he was killed by a US drone strike. But his victims have remained pale and shadowy in comparison. They\u2019ve been stranded, for ever, in orange jumpsuits, destined to end their days reading someone else\u2019s words.</p> <p>And this is what <em> Jim: The James Foley Story</em>, a new documentary about the life and last days of James Foley, seeks to rectify. It\u2019s an intimate, moving portrait \u2013 nominated this month for an Emmy \u2013 made through interviews with his family, friends and fellow hostages, though it\u2019s not until the very end of the film, when his brother, Michael, addresses the nameless person behind the camera, that you realise just how intimate it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d6b176a22e3df60b29fbb2d45777030b7ac76a/0_0_4000_2722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foley (left) in 1982 with his childhood friend Brian Oakes, director of Jim: The James Foley Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Brian Oakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know him as well as I do,\u201d Michael Foley says to the camera, talking about the video of his brother\u2019s death. \u201cHe would never have done those things if there wasn\u2019t someone else who would be harmed. He never cared for himself.\u201d Because the film-maker, Brian Oakes, did know him well, had known him, in fact, since he was seven years old, and grew up with him in the same small town of Wolfeboro. And the impetus for the film, he tells me from his home in New York, came from the desire to rescue his friend Jim, the boy he\u2019d grown up with, from the media creation and propaganda tool that he\u2019d become.</p> <p>\u201cThat was the original catalyst for me wanting to make this film \u2013 that image of Jim, of his death, his execution, which was seen throughout the world. I saw this image being used for a lot of different purposes. It was used as propaganda. It was used in politics, for political agendas and for me\u2026 as a friend and someone who knew him, that was really\u2026 made me uncomfortable. I just wanted to take on the responsibility to tell Jim\u2019s story.\u201d</p> <p>And he does. People have a habit of saying nice things about the dead but it\u2019s clear that Foley was a particularly special case. When I speak to Diane Foley on the phone at her home in New Hampshire, she calls the film \u201ca gift\u201d. She\u2019s known Oakes pretty much all his life, but hadn\u2019t wanted the family to take part initially. \u201cIt was very soon after Jim\u2019s death that he came and asked us and I was truly not ready for it. I loved Brian. He was a childhood best friend but I was reluctant, initially. It was his siblings who wanted to do it. They knew Brian best and they wanted people to know who Jim really was and why he put his life on the line.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all there, his life from childhood on, warts and all. His idealism and easy manner comes across but also a certain waywardness, a lack of desire to be pinned down by convention or loan repayment plans. But it\u2019s the interviews with his fellow hostages that are at the heart of the film. For two years, when his family didn\u2019t know whether he was alive or dead, he was sharing a tiny cell with a changing roster of other western hostages, not all of whom were murdered by Isis.</p> <p>\u201cThose interviews were the most intense of the entire film-making process,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cHere were men who were with Jim over the course of months, sometimes years, when we didn\u2019t know where he was. We didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive or dead or where he was, who had him. This was a huge black hole and for me to be able to sit down and talk to those who were with him and to unravel that mystery was very cathartic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7UTdyP2fmk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O7UTdyP2fmk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Jim: The James Foley Story trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cMichael and Katie, James\u2019s siblings came too and it was very emotional and difficult but also quite amazing.\u201d</p> <p>One of the former hostages he talked to was Nicolas H\u00e9nin, a French freelance journalist who had spent a long time in the Middle East and who recounts how much he disliked, initially, James\u2019s habit of calling everyone \u201cbro\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just do not use this kind of working-class colloquial language,\u201d H\u00e9nin tells me over the phone from France. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my style. I\u2019m like, \u2018I am not your brother!\u2019\u201d But Foley did become like a brother to him. \u201cWe invented a life during these months in captivity,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cAnd when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone, at some stage, fell out with everyone else, he tells me. \u201cThere were sometimes a few dozen people in a tiny room. In such circumstances, it\u2019s normal that every single one of us struggled with every single other. Apart from Jim. He had these incredible social skills. It really stands out. He was the only one who didn\u2019t have any big dispute with anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>H\u00e9nin and Foley became close, not least because for one 10-day period, they were handcuffed to each another. And it was shattering to H\u00e9nin when he, like everyone else, learned via the internet of his friend\u2019s death. \u201cMy first reaction when I watched this film [the Islamic State video] was horror, but my second reaction was pride. I was just proud of my friend. I was truly impressed by his behaviour where so many others would just scream like babies. Even though I had been through a lot of things in common with him, I\u2019m not at all sure I would have found the courage to behave like that. His comportment, his language\u2026 he speaks strongly, he looks straight, he stands straight. He just acts like a man. His condition was like an animal but Jim was a man. And somehow, he just behaved as a free man.</p> <p>\u201cI shared his fate for months. We were comrades, for 10 months we shared everything except our passports. And that\u2019s what saved my life. And took his.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We invented a life during those months in captivity. And when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because the fact that Nicolas H\u00e9nin is around to tell the tale is due to his nationality. The French and other Europeans negotiated to get their hostages free. The British and Americans did not. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/british-photographer-john-cantlie-appears-in-new-isis-video\" title=\"\">John Cantlie</a>, a British journalist who was captured with Foley, is still being held. And Foley and his fellow Americans and Brits are all dead. It\u2019s still a bitter pill for the Foleys to swallow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI was appalled at the way we were treated. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. We just felt so alone. For nearly two years, we didn\u2019t know if Jim was alive, and we had very few people who were with us on it.\u201d As a family, they were told by the government that the best chance of securing their son\u2019s release was to maintain a news blackout, a stipulation they eventually broke, and that they now feel didn\u2019t help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8f2c5e3a4943df18dceb6d365b6e461099bf757/0_0_900_666/500.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley (standing at back) with his four younger siblings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of the Foley family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had no idea how to find James and how to get him home once he was found. We just went to everyone we could, begging for help. But at that time, there was nothing in place. I was appalled to find that there was nobody in our own government whose mission it was to help us. It\u2019s not like in Britain or France, which have a structure in place. People were sympathetic. They listened. I think individually they cared but it was just at the bottom of their list.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just appalling to us. It was really up to private individuals who were the most helpful to me \u2013 like David Bradley, the publisher of the <em>Atlantic</em> and Phil Balboni, [for whom Foley was working] of the GlobalPost<em> </em>in Boston.\u201d</p> <p>It was also, Nicolas H\u00e9nin, believes, a terrible miscalculation. He has gone on to write a book about the causes of the insurgency in Syria and Iraq \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/350500/\" title=\"\"><em>Jihad Academy: the rise of the Islamic State</em> </a>\u2013 and believes that the Americans underestimated the crisis from the beginning. \u201cThey thought we had been taken by dangerous amateurs. They didn\u2019t realise what was at stake. I don\u2019t actually know what was exchanged for myself, if it was money or something else. But even if a ransom had been paid for Jim, it would have been worth it, beyond any moral consideration. It would have been worth it from a security perspective because the propaganda impact was so very high.\u201d</p> <p>It was. The film does not contain footage from the video and states that fact, explicitly, at the start. \u201cI didn\u2019t include it for a number of reasons but one was because I believe that people have a choice whether to watch it or not,\u201d Brian Oakes tells me. He himself hadn\u2019t watched it until he came to make the film. \u201cAnd in fact, I still haven\u2019t to this day, not the unedited version. It was not something I choose to do. I don\u2019t want to see that kind of war pornography. To me, that video is just a piece of propaganda, a recruitment tool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ffddad82c63e4e0223e68efa5dd6f2138ceb68/0_451_3000_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicolas H\u00e9nin (left), former French hostage and journalist, is greeted by his family following his release in April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That image \u2013 of Foley in an orange jumpsuit on his knees in the Syrian desert \u2013 marked a new chapter in the use of terror; it became a symbol of the strength and ingenuity of Isis and evidence of the weakness of the west in confronting a whole new type of enemy. Clare Morgana Gillis, fellow freelance journalist and friend of Foley\u2019s, states in the film that 94% of Americans are aware of Foley\u2019s death, making it the news event with the second highest recognition after 9/11. Nobody would have hated that more than him, she says. He went to Syria to try and tell the world about the atrocities that were going on there. \u201cAnd that was the takeaway?\u201d she asks. The death of a single American reaped more publicity than any other report on the country,&#xa0;ever.</p> <p>It was another freelance, Nicole Tung, who rang Diane Foley at home in New Hampshire when, in November 2012, Foley and John Cantlie failed to show up at an arranged meeting place at the Turkish border. Later, the family discovered that the two men had been spotted when they broke their journey to file their copy from an internet cafe; shortly afterwards, armed gunmen forced their car to stop just a few miles from the border.</p> <p>\u201cI was just incredulous that it had happened, to be honest,\u201d says Diane Foley. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s how much denial I was in. I was so ill&#xa0;prepared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c61ff8f4298362706d48c37c5e92c89421b9d00d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c61ff8f4298362706d48c37c5e92c89421b9d00d/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"The teenage Foley with two of his younger siblings on his back.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teenage Foley with two of his younger siblings on his back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Brian Oakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denial because this wasn\u2019t the first time that James Foley had been kidnapped. He\u2019d hopped around in his 20s and early 30s, studying creative writing, becoming a teacher in an inner-city school in Arizona, and then he seemed to find the thing he\u2019d been looking for: journalism. \u201cSomething seemed to click,\u201d says Diane. It gave him a purpose, a mission. And when the revolution kicked off in Libya, he went.</p> <p>Libya was where Morgana Gillis met Foley for the first time, and the main attraction for them both was that it was exciting and it was cheap. \u201cIt was a Mad Max type war,\u201d said Foley when he returned in 2011. Photojournalist Nicole Tung, another friend of Foley\u2019s interviewed in the film, says, \u201cMany of us aren\u2019t old enough to remember journalism in its heyday. What we do is journalism on a shoestring budget.\u201d And with it came a blurring of boundaries. The easiest and cheapest way of getting to the frontline was to hitch a lift with the&#xa0;insurgents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I made it too easy for him. I wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \"Jim, you put us through hell\"</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foley was with Morgana Gillis and a South African freelance, Anton Hammerl, when they got caught up in crossfire. Hammerl was shot and killed. Morgana Gillis and Foley were captured. For Diane Foley, it was the darkest time of her life: her son missing, the family not knowing if he was alive or dead. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific at the time,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s a measure of everything that the family has been through subsequently that she now adds: \u201cIn retrospect, it was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>After six terrible weeks, they had the Hollywood denouement. He was released, unharmed, and when he returned to his old school of journalism to tell them about his experience, he revealed how much he had learned. \u201cWe did a lot of mistakes that day. Conflict zones can be covered safely. But you have to be very experienced. You have to be very, very careful. We didn\u2019t follow a lot of those practices so it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>The Q&amp;A session was videoed and Oakes includes a lot of it in his film and, in the light of what happened next, there\u2019s a terrible poignancy to the words that Foley spoke, and yet didn\u2019t seem to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2916576c958f8078c9b47f4eab2c962b0dd68493/0_0_3000_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley\u2019s mother, Diane, at home in New Hampshire shortly after the execution was posted on YouTube, August 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pure luck that you didn\u2019t get killed there,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cPure luck. And you need to either change your behaviour right there or you shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Because it\u2019s not worth your life. It\u2019s not worth seeing your mother, father, brother, and sister bawling. You\u2019re worrying about your grandmother dying because you\u2019re in prison. It\u2019s not worth these things. It\u2019s not worth your life, no matter what romantic ideal you have, no matter what ethic you think you have. It\u2019s never worth that. I\u2019m 37 years old, I should have known that a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes delves into the very human reactions that Foley\u2019s family had when he was kidnapped a second time. His younger brother, John Jr, who has served in the military, is at times bewildered and angry and ultimately, grudgingly respectful of James\u2019s decision to return to a conflict zone. But mostly, angry. \u201cYou just wanted to punch him in the face in a loving, brotherly way,\u201d he tells Oakes in the film. His father, John, still shakes his head in disbelief at the memory of it. And Diane tells me that she thinks she \u201cmade it too easy for him\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean? \u201cI wanted to be supportive. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, Jim, you put us through hell.\u2019 I was saying, \u2018I respect your decision to do this. And people need to know what is going on in Syria.\u2019 But, to be honest, I put it behind me much too easily. I felt, what are the chances of it happening again? I was really very clueless. Journalists who do this dangerous work need to have those difficult conversations with their families. They need to be prepared and we were not. I was in denial about it. We didn\u2019t have Jim\u2019s will or passwords or bank accounts or emails or things we really needed as a family.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to do now since James\u2019s death. The family set up the <a href=\"https://www.jamesfoleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">James Foley Foundation </a>and one of their missions has been to try to better prepare freelance journalists for the potential dangers out there. Shortly after James\u2019s death, President Obama called her to offer his condolences. \u201cHe thought you were coming to get him,\u201d she told him. A rescue attempt had been made, she found out, but it was too late. The hostages had already been moved to another location. Since then, though, she has worked with the government to get them to create a cross-department \u201cfusion cell\u201d, equipped to deal with another family during another hostage crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c0d9db38d98ebfb2a3a44531cec412f6b01e1d/0_76_2000_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Foley with students at the Christa McAuliffe Regional Charter Public School in Framingham, Mass, who had worked for his release, June 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McGagh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foundation is also lobbying news organisations to take responsibility for the freelances they employ. \u201cWe have a responsibility for the people willing to do this work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe must protect them. Otherwise, it becomes, as it was at the time Jim was there, very abusive. News organisations are just using these young independent journalists for whatever and giving them nothing back. They did not have their back.\u201d</p> <p>One of Oakes\u2019s explicit intentions for the film, he says, was to explore the issues around the use of freelance journalists in conflict zones. And what draws them back. Foley, according to Oakes, was \u201calways a kid who loved adventure. He would always take that extra step. When we were teenagers, he was always the one to do something just a little bit more crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Oakes speculates that Foley was suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder after his experience in Libya. He took a job in Boston but couldn\u2019t settle. He was lured back by what he calls in the film \u201cthe siren song\u201d of the frontline. Though it\u2019s not as straightforward as hero-journalists-tell-world-what-it-needs-to-hear, not least because most of the time the world wasn\u2019t listening. And they were taking huge personal risks to file news stories into a void.</p> <p>But what Foley wanted \u2013 for the world to pay attention to what was happening in Syria \u2013 did happen because of his death, I point out to Diane. \u201cYes. Thanks be to God. But whether Jim knew that, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought interviewing the former hostages would be so bad. Then to find out that the group had created this family\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t over. That\u2019s what Nicolas H\u00e9nin impresses on me when I speak to him. He doesn\u2019t talk about the torture he endured, that Foley endured. They were, variously, beaten, starved, suspended upside down from the ceiling, waterboarded. But that wasn\u2019t what they talked about.</p> <p>\u201cWe were all optimists. It was a decision we all made. Some of us were more realistic but it was harder. You had no control whatsoever over your fate. You are not the one who decides anything. The only thing you can have control of is your morale.\u201d He tells me how during the time he was chained to Foley, he talked late into the night with one of their captors, who was later identified as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/brussels-bomber-najim-laachraoui-identified-isis-jailer-foreign-hostages\" title=\"\">one of the Brussels bombers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe was obsessed with the movie <em>The Matrix.</em> He was telling us: \u2018You have left the matrix now. You are living in another matrix. You have left that world. We are creating another world.\u201d It was, he says, a \u201cpostmodern&#xa0;experience\u201d.</p> <p>What do you mean?</p> <p>\u201cI learned that Syria was just a background. It had nothing to do with Syria. We were western hostages held by western captors.\u201d And it\u2019s not over. John Cantlie is still a prisoner. \u201cI am still careful what I say because they are still holding a friend of mine. The story is not yet over. And normally, when you are a hostage in Nigeria, Afghanistan, you leave the country and you leave it behind. But my captors came back to my home town and they committed crimes here. In November at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks\" title=\"\">Bataclan</a>, they were less than a kilometre from my home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a5d47f35e0ecd901e06b7d1e0e13da7abb50e9/0_0_3200_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign seen in James Foley\u2019s hometown in Rochester, New Hampshire the day after his killing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His captors, he believes, follow him on Twitter. And the media reporting of every terrorist atrocity further inflames the situation. \u201cYou British taught us resilience during the second world war and that is what we need now. That motto \u2013 Keep Calm and Carry On \u2013 is the one we should adopt here now. The media panic, and the politicians panic and overreact. We should think about what our attackers would love us to do. And then do the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Diane Foley and the Foley family have decided to find meaning and purpose in James Foley\u2019s death. For them, it wasn\u2019t a senseless bloodthirsty revenge killing. It has become a mission for them to help others. It proves, Diane tells me, that people aren\u2019t fundamentally bad. They\u2019re the opposite. \u201cPeople have been so good to us. So many people from all around the world have sent us buckets of mail, donations, prayers. To have good overcome, we need to stand together. That\u2019s why we set up the foundation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/feb/15/sign-up-to-the-media-briefing\">Sign up to the new-look Media Briefing: bigger, better, brighter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Brian Oakes makes the same point. \u201cI went into those interviews with the former hostages thinking this is going to be horrible, it\u2019s going to be so bad. Every day was probably torture and beatings. And then to find out that this group of men had created this family and all worked together to survive and had made these games and given each other lectures, it was fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Jim was always like that. He was always this beacon of positivity. And to hear that he was like that even in those super-dark times was amazing. It helps to give him meaning, I hope.\u201d</p> <p>The film is certainly much less bleak than you\u2019d ever think possible. Oakes says that he deliberately set up the juxtaposition of the idyllic nature of the small town American childhood they shared with the horror that was to follow. \u201cI think those of us who live in a world where everything is peaceful end up taking that for granted. And, that\u2019s why Jim went to Syria, after all.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfeboro, New Hampshire is not Raqqa, Syria. It is the opposite of Raqqa. But still, even there, it seemed there was some small corner of the Islamic State that was forever Wolfeboro. Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish hostage who had also grown close to Foley, tells in the film how for Christmas, sitting in the dark, they gave each other compliments in place of gifts. And his present to Jim? \u201cI told him, \u2018You are the most honest person. You are pure good.\u2019 That was our Christmas night. And I really felt that I\u2019d had the best Christmas night in my&#xa0;life.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jim: The James Foley Story is in cinemas from 2 September. </em><a href=\"http://dogwoof.com/jimthejamesfoleystory\" title=\"\"><em>Preview Q&amp;A screenings</em></a><em> with Diane Foley and director Brian Oakes are being held on 31 August and 1 September </em></p>",

Rebuilding public trust, in an immigration system that is competent, effective and fair, must be part of this process. Engaging the public in the decisions we make, through a national conversation on immigration, would help to start rebuilding that trust.</p> <p>\u201cIt will also cut through an overheated, polarised debate to reveal the moderate core of public opinion on immigration. Most people have more nuanced views than those found in our public discourse. Given the choice, voters would be content with much immigration staying the same and some of it increasing, if they had faith in the system and could see reductions in other areas.\u201d</p> <p>The poll reveals that the public is split roughly down the middle on refugees. Just over half (53%) think the number of refugees offered protection should be reduced while 33% think the country should offer sanctuary to about the same number of refugees as it does currently and 14% would like it to take more.</p> <p>The poll also suggests the public makes clear distinctions between different immigrant worker groups.</p> <p>Only a quarter of people want fewer migrant care-workers, with 27% saying they would like more and 48% saying the number should stay the same.</p> <p>Four in 10 welcome more migrant engineers, compared to only 17% who want fewer. More people said they would like to see more migrant IT professionals, doctors, nurses and scientists than would prefer a cut in numbers.</p> <p>It also confirms that even Leave voters are keen on some forms of migration.Only 15% of Leave voters want a reduction in the numbers of highly skilled workers migrating to Britain, while 45% want an increase and 40% want numbers to remain the same.</p> <p>When asked about migrant IT specialists, engineers, scientists, care workers, doctors and nurses, the majority of Leave voters wanted an increase or the numbers to remain the same. Only when asked about unskilled workers, construction workers and hospitality staff did they prefer to cut numbers.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s immigration statistics are expected to show a rise in EU nationals applying for British citizenship.

But slowly, realisation settles on the family. Grant, then a medical student, has the painful task of naming what has hitherto only been a fear. His mother reacts with biblical grief: \u201cAnybody see my cross? Anybody see my cross? \u2026 Yes, Lord!\u201d</p> <p>Today the possibility of gene therapy has come closer, surgeons are more conservative and more knowledgeable, and there are drugs like Epilim that effectively suppress seizures. One per cent of the world\u2019s population has epilepsy, and Grant says there is likely to be at least one person with the condition in every carriage of a morning commuter train.</p> <p>For some, however, the drugs come at a cost: a feeling that the self has been changed, a loss of acuteness to the sensations that make life worth living. This explains why so many people with epilepsy remain \u201cnon-compliant\u201d. M, a writer in his 60s free from seizures for 20 years thanks to drugs, \u201cstill occasionally mourns his brighter self\u201d. Musician Neil Young has eschewed them for 20 years, and Christopher \u201cwas on the drugs: off the drugs; on; off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d96ddc990337677ae950c0d5079a2f13debd5bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d96ddc990337677ae950c0d5079a2f13debd5bc/1538_544_2396_2768/866.jpg\" alt=\"Brain scan for children with epilepsy.\" width=\"866\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brain scan for children with epilepsy, launched by Great Ormond Street hospital, London, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his thoughtful, global tour of epilepsy through the ages, it\u2019s the blunt instrument of human attempts to cure the disease that Grant illuminates. The Spartans who tested infants for epilepsy by washing them in wine were no more deluded than the zealots of the middle ages who thought that those with the disorder were possessed by demons, or the 19th-century doctors who institutionalised or over-sedated them.</p> <p>The part of the brain most active in a seizure is thought to be the insula, where higher sensations such as empathy are also located. But theories about the causes of epilepsy have veered wildly. Once marriage was deemed a good prophylactic, and \u201cearly sexual intercourse\u201d was prescribed; later it was argued that sexual excitement led to seizures, so abstinence was counselled.</p> <p>When the Catholic writer Graham Greene, as a young man, was believed to have epilepsy, he was told he should not marry, and came close to suicide. Astonishingly, right up to 1970, at the point in the Church of England marriage service when the congregation is asked whether they know of any impediment, the answer \u201cEpilepsy\u201d was enough to stop the wedding; worse, in India a partner\u2019s \u201cepileptic insanity\u201d is still a reason for&#xa0;divorce.</p> <p>Among the historical confusions that have clouded research on epilepsy are, first, its incorrect association with mental illness, and, second, its obfuscatory entanglement in moral meanings, even when they are good. Grant questions the \u201cticket to heaven\u201d school of thought, in which epilepsy and its preceding aura, not always the smell of burning of the title, lead the sufferer to a higher plane of consciousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/18/brainstorm-epilepsy-creativity-neuroscience-comedy\">Brainstorm in a teacup: can epilepsy fuel creativity? | Dan Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet sometimes Christopher knows bliss, and the author confesses how tempted he is to dignify epilepsy with transcendent meaning, as Dostoevsky, in <em>The Idiot</em>, does in his character, Prince Myshkin. Though he looks honestly at the destructive effects the condition can have on ordinary lives, Grant also describes a number of high-achieving individuals who have either definitely or plausibly suffered from epilepsy \u2013 Julius Caesar, Saul of Tarsus, Joan of Arc, Dostoevsky, Lenin (who died after a long convulsion), Vincent van Gogh, the abolitionist Harriet Tubman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>, George Gershwin, Ian&#xa0;Curtis.</p> <p>But it\u2019s always the enigma of Christopher that Grant returns to, with puzzlement, sorrow and, often, humour. As a teenager, Christopher\u2019s passion was buying and renovating old cars. His high point, aged 18, is the acquisition of a shiny Alfa Romeo.</p> <p>Alas, as Grant laconically remarks, \u201closs of consciousness is not compatible with driving\u201d. When Christopher passes his driving test (\u201cGod failed my mother\u201d), it is Grant who reluctantly obeys her wordless entreaty and \u2013 after failing to reason with his brother \u2013 accompanies him on a road trip. As they drive along the motorway, Grant\u2019s pleas grow \u201cincreasingly desperate, like a jilted lover\u201d. It is almost a relief to the reader when Christopher\u2019s eyes start to go blank, the seizure unfolds and the car \u201cslides across the motorway as if on&#xa0;ice\u201d.</p> <p>Neither of the brothers dies in the crash. When, as an adult, Christopher comes to live with Colin, the phone calls in the early hours, producing dread, or the knocks on the door from the police, always mean that Christopher has had a seizure.</p> <p>Christopher\u2019s attitude to his condition and to the medical profession is oblique and creative, the initial anger and frustration masking itself increasingly in deadpan humour, mystification or turning inward. He says he is making a film about epilepsy, but shows Colin a blank, blinking screen: \u201cThis is not a joke, joke t\u2019ing.\u201d</p> <p>The author tries to mirror this obliqueness. \u201cYou had a visitor,\u201d he tells Christopher as he lies in the&#xa0;liminal, dreamy state that follows an attack.</p> <p>\u201cAny message?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d come again.\u201d</p> <p>And he does come again, until the terrible night with which this book ends, when Grant has to ask the despairing paramedics to let him try to massage his brother\u2019s heart back to life. His subsequent sense of having failed Christopher will not be shared by the reader.</p> <p>This book is an extraordinary work of love and art, which left me choked with tears. It manages that most difficult task for a memoirist, to bring a real human being unforgettably to life while leaving his essential mystery and individuality intact. It\u2019s as if somewhere, outside the unforgiving single line of time where statements about what happened must be made, Colin Grant allows an aura of all the unlived possibilities of Christopher\u2019s radiant childhood to linger.</p> <p><em>A Smell of Burning is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/smell-of-burning.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.93</em></a></p>",

Adults play children, with Katy Owen marvellously tough and frisky as the schoolgirl heroine. Genders switch. The lovely singer Nandi Bhebhe becomes a GI.

On empty seats, he admitted \u201cthere have been some sessions where we would have loved to have seen more people in the stadium\u201d but that federations needed to do more to help market their sports and sell tickets. The remote Olympic Stadium, away from the main Olympic Park, has been a factor, but Coe said it was important not to leave white elephants (which followers of London\u2019s Olympic Stadium saga might find a mite ironic). He also insisted it had been a good week for his beleaguered sport despite the doping controversies and patchy crowds: \u201cWe\u2019ve learned our sport is alive and incredibly strong with a great appetite for public consumption.\u201d</p> <p>He also promised to take action on suspicious qualifying times, amid concerns that some countries were gaming the system, and look again at \u201ctransfer of allegiance\u201d after revealing that there were recently 24 transfers to new countries in a single day.</p> <p>Finally, he said he wanted to offer Usain Bolt a job when he retires. I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be the only one.</p> <p>\u201cWith all the things he will go on to do, I am very keen for him to carve out some space to help us develop the sport, and not only in an ambassadorial role. He has a broader role he can play. When the time does come, we really want him to stay in the sport,\u201d Coe said. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b8e947e4b0377cf11189b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T23:35:54.830Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Barney Ronay was at the Maracana for that dramatic shootout</strong>.

The team\u2019s appeal was rejected because Matthew Hudson-Smith was judged to have part of his foot outside the takeover zone when he began running for the takeover. A British Athletics spokeswoman said: \u201cAs part of the appeal we reviewed video footage in the stadium, and as provided by the BBC. The process of appeal (146.8) states if such evidence including any available video evidence is not conclusive, the decision of the referee shall be upheld. Unfortunately the video evidence was inconclusive and the appeal was rejected. We are hugely disappointed on behalf of our 4x400m team who we are confident would have won a medal in the final, however we are now completely focussed on supporting the women\u2019s 4x400m team in their preparations for tonight\u2019s final.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b86830e4b047b85f601f8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T14:27:44.691Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s a touching moment in the taekwondo as Pita Taufatofua, of Tonga, is beaten 16-1 by Sajjad Mardani of Iran.

Three experts on the BBC couldn\u2019t come up with an answer and UK Athletics seem content to limit themselves to a tweet about the failed appeal. It sounds a lot like the athletics establishment might even be a little embarrassed - I mean, why else would no-one make a clear statement?

What did GB do that broke the rules to their advantage (or someone else\u2019s disadvantage)? I recommend the lottery that is the Modern Pentathlon Show Jumping this afternoon (10pm finish).

He explains why <a href=\"http://athletics.ca/statement-evan-dunfee-todays-50km-race-walk/#sthash.QmdI0GaY.UM1hZR4P.dpbs\">here</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was \u2026 left for me to decide whether to pursue this further with an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Following my return to the village and my viewing of the incident I made the decision not to appeal, as I believe the right decision stood.</p> <p>Not many people can understand the pain athletes are in three and a half hours into such a grueling race. I believe that both the Japanese athlete and myself got tangled up but what broke me was that I let it put me off mentally and once I lost that focus, my legs went to jello. Contact is part of our event, whether written or unwritten and is quite common, and I don\u2019t believe that this was malicious or done with intent. Even if an appeal to CAS were successful I would not have been able to receive that medal with a clear conscience and it isn\u2019t something I would have been proud of.</p> <p>I will sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of my life, knowing I made the right decision. I will never allow myself to be defined by the accolades I receive, rather the integrity I carry through life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b831d3e4b0b7e649001693\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T10:37:47.752Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cI am working through the relay disappointment with some \u2018limerick therapy\u2019, chimes Lucy Briggs. \u201cNot podium quality, rustled up on the morning run.<br><br>After a late night of relay frustration<br>Can we have a clear explanation<br>Of why quite near the end<br>Maybe on the last bend<br>There\u2019s a random disqualification?\u201d</p> <p>Out on the golf course, the players who\u2019ve gone out early might benefit from the relatively calm conditions early on, but the wind is now picking up, so who knows what will happen?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b82dc2e4b0377cf11186e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T10:23:52.728Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>She\u2019s back in the field, but Lexi Thompson of the USA has just produced a stunning second shot on the par-five 10th, driving 250 yards from mid-fairway to the green and inches from the pin to give herself a tap-in for eagle, which she duly sinks to go back to even par.

  "<p>Almost two months after the Brexit vote, Britain\u2019s economy remains in rude health. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\" title=\"\">Unemployment is at its lowest for 10 years</a>, inflation remains low and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\" title=\"\">consumer spending in July was strong</a>.</p> <p>The doom-mongers who predicted a panic in the aftermath of the referendum were wrong. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/16/uk-house-price-average-rose-17000-year-june-ons-figures-show\" title=\"\">house prices have continued to rise</a>, unaffected by the prospect of the UK being outside the EU in a couple of years\u2019 time.</p> <p>This is one way of looking at the recent economic data. Another is to point out that had Mark Carney and the Bank of England not recognised the danger signs, Britain would have been in dire trouble.</p> <p>Bank officials read the economic tea leaves and agreed that a shot of adrenaline was needed. Without extra monetary stimulus, redundancies were inevitable, the pound would tumble to parity with the dollar, sending inflation spiralling upwards, and investment was likely to plunge. House prices might have dropped by 20%, as the Treasury famously predicted, with wages slumping instead of rising sightly.</p> <p>Carney, a safe pair of hands as goalkeeper in his student ice hockey days, has become the ultimate economic backstop.</p> <p>Brexiters brush aside the counter-factual arguments, saying that the Bank\u2019s stimulus plan, which included a cut in interest rates and pumping and extra \u00a370bn into the economy, played second fiddle to the wisdom of the UK household, which has turned out to be more self-confident and far-sighted than City economists had assumed. Consumer confidence surveys were another plank of support for this view, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\" title=\"\">recording a rise this month</a> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/uk-sees-biggest-fall-in-consumer-confidence-for-26-years-after-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">plummeting earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>But what is more likely is that consumers were in a genuine panic until they heard that their central bank was priming its big guns. Soon after, though, they noticed the letter from their mortgage company highlighting the effect of the Carney interest rate cut on their monthly bills and felt much better about the world. Almost all economic activity these days seems to be predicated on zero interest rates, easy access to cheap credit and the Bank\u2019s promise that it will do anything to maintain growth.</p> <p>But next year could bring further trouble. Once Article 50 is triggered and the debate about our relationship with the EU begins in earnest, concerns about trading outside the free market will resurface.</p> <p>City economists have predicted a 350,000 increase in unemployment over the next four years and a growth rate consistently below 2% over the same period. We know this because the Treasury published its review of economic forecasts by the City\u2019s major banks. Investment, the lifeblood for improvements to productivity and higher wages, is expected to leach away, and not just to the EU.</p> <p>Why, finance companies will ask themselves, should they stay in a post-Brexit London when they could be in Singapore or Hong Kong? Likewise, Ford and other manufacturers will accelerate the process \u2013 under way for years now \u2013 of taking their factories to the more compliant, low-cost destinations such as Turkey.</p> <p>Unable to attract investment on the basis of being connected umbilically to the EU in key areas such as carmaking, pharmaceuticals and creative digital industries, the government will turn to tax cuts and other incentives that will undermine its ability to fund welfare, healthcare and education.</p> <p>Donald Trump is considered by many to be the biggest threat to the global economy. This threat remains theoretical and, if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-campaign-terrible-week-paul-ryan-khan\" title=\"\">latest polls</a> are to be believed, unlikely. Brexit is just around the corner and involves the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy leaving the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. Such a seismic event cannot avoid creating a shock and some painful after-effects.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope Theresa May is as good as her word and provides a clear plan of industrial support to mitigate the worst effects of leaving the EU. Without that, Carney may be called upon to give an ailing economy another stimulus shot.</p> <h2>At last, a real tax evasion crackdown</h2> <p>\u2018\u2018We need to talk about tax,\u201d said Theresa May when making her pitch for Conservative leader. She promised a crackdown on both avoidance and evasion. Empty words? It seems not. Last week the Treasury published an eye-catching proposal to fine the enablers of tax avoidance. Accountants, solicitors, banks and financial advisers whose tax schemes are successfully challenged by HMRC could find themselves paying the equivalent of 100% of the tax owed.</p> <p>Pressure groups have been arguing for such a measure for years, as a deterrent to those who dream up schemes and collect the fees, while their clients pick up the tab from the tax office.</p> <p>The big four accountancy firms will have little incentive to remain in the game of advising on avoidance. Smaller outfits may move offshore. Which brings us to another key piece of legislation, proposed but not yet passed.</p> <p>Last March, following revelations of HSBC helping clients hide money in Switzerland, George Osborne suggested a corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion \u2013 designed to tackle the difficulty in holding companies liable for the acts of their employees.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t really aimed at banks, though. After crackdowns by US and German regulators, attention has shifted to a lesser-known but growing sector \u2013 trust companies. They help set up the structures,and provide nominees who act as directors, shareholders or trustees, so the real owners can remain out of sight. As we learned from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, these services are popular \u2013 and lucrative. In 2012, private equity group Blackstone bought one such operator, Intertrust, for \u20ac675m. It floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange for \u20ac1.3bn last year.</p> <p>The mere threat of corporate liability is already having the desired effect. Reports suggest trust companies, many of which have UK offices, are combing their books for likely evaders. The government should pass both pieces of enabler legislation without delay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d45c290e733a43c8d184facf1a191110398fc40/0_10_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rail ticket prices in Britain are just going to keep rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the up and up: rail fares<br></h2> <p>Last week saw the annual rail fares revolt, as news that season ticket prices will rise by 1.9% was met with outrage from commuters, green campaigners and trade unions. Passengers, in particular, have a point. They provide the bulk of the industry\u2019s income now \u2013 \u00a38.8bn, compared with \u00a33.5bn from the state \u2013 but the railways cannot afford a fairer deal.</p> <p>Last year, the industry\u2019s costs rose 7% to \u00a3900m, outstripping the latest fare increase. The government, which sets the caps on fares, is thus unlikely to come to passengers\u2019 aid. The answer is not nationalisation of rail franchises, because the most expensive bit, tracks and stations, is already state-owned through Network Rail. The answer is lower costs. And that means building better relations with trade unions and reducing profligacy at Network Rail. In the meantime, there is no light at the end of the tunnel for commuters.</p> <h2>Sugar tax policy leaves a bad taste</h2> <p>The government\u2019s sugar tax and childhood obesity strategy has received a mixed reaction. Health experts believe it does not go far enough, while soft-drink makers believe the tax will simply hurt consumers and businesses rather than lower obesity levels.</p> <p>Targeting soft drinks when fruit juice, smoothies and coffees are all loaded with sugar is a mistake, they say.</p> <p>The most important reaction, however, was from supermarkets. They criticised the government\u2019s watered-down obesity strategy, saying that mandatory cuts to sugar levels in food were needed to ensure a level playing field and ensure genuine change.</p> <p>The supermarkets are often criticised for two-for-one promotions and selling snacks at the till, but they are correct here.</p> <p>The only way to make change happen quickly and effectively is for the government to step in. When it has done so previously, such as by pushing brands, shops and restaurants to publish nutritional information on their packaging, companies have stepped up to the mark.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the government has left its childhood obesity strategy vulnerable to the vagaries of capitalism and the free market. Even if responsible companies do take action, others may not, and so responsible companies will pay the price.</p>",
  "<p>Becoming a world authority on sea ice has taken Peter Wadhams to the polar zones more than 50 times, travelling on foot and by plane, ship, snowmobile and several nuclear-powered submarines of the Royal Navy.</p> <p>Nonscientists who read his astonishing and hair-raising <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> will agree that the interludes of autobiography it contains are engrossing, entertaining and, when one submarine suffers an onboard explosion and fire while under the ice, harrowing.</p> <p>Any reader should find the science of sea-ice creation and the implications for us all of its loss \u2013 explored and explained here with clarity and style \u2013 beautiful, compelling and terrifying.</p> <p>Wadhams thanks Ernest Hemingway for his title. Climate change, a cause and an effect of ice loss, brings conflict that would have interested the great author. Persecuted by trolls and climate-change deniers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/arctic-sea-ice-expert-complains-to-press-watchdog-over-times-story\">Wadhams made news last year</a> when three of his peers met premature deaths. One fell down stairs. One died in wilderness, possibly struck by lightning. A third, out cycling, was crushed by a lorry. Claiming that he had been targeted by a lorry while cycling, Wadhams speculated that oil companies or governments had it in for him and his ilk because of the conclusions to which their work has led them. But his book is more extraordinary than any conspiracy.</p> <p><em>A Farewell to Ice </em>proceeds methodically. Ice cores, tubes of compacted polar snow, record the last million years of atmospheric change, during which the Earth has oscillated between ice ages and warm periods. Now the pattern is breaking.</p> <p>\u201cOur planet has changed colour. Today, from space, the top of the world in the northern summer looks blue instead of white. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is Man\u2019s first major achievement in reshaping the face of his planet,\u201d Wadhams writes.</p> <p>Polar ice is thinning and retreating with unprecedented speed. All our ingenuity cannot, at present, change that. Because ice only grows in winter but can melt year-round, its growth rate is limited, while melt rate is unlimited.</p> <p>Ice is extraordinary stuff. A \u201cpuckered honeycomb\u201d of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, it is highly mutable in different states because the length of the hydrogen bonds in its molecules varies. Ice exists near absolute zero, the lowest temperature theoretically possible. Recent research suggests it may have entirely covered the Earth three times, making \u201csnowball Earths\u201d. Ice coats space dust, giving stars their twinkle. Life may have originated in that shining dust, according to the astronomer Fred Hoyle. Polar ice functions as Earth\u2019s air- and water-conditioning system, and our thermostat.</p> <p>Wadhams outlines how CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are smashing the system, spinning the thermostat to hot. Without the albedo effect of ice \u2013 by which it reflects solar radiation up to 10 times more effectively than open water \u2013 we have entered a <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/abrupt/story2.html\">positive feedback loop</a>.</p> <p>Wadhams puts this plainly. \u201cThere is no period in Earth\u2019s history where the rate of rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is as great as it is today.\u201d The asteroid that finished the dinosaurs blasted 4.5 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, \u201cyet the CO<sub>2</sub> rate rise [in the aftermath] was still an order of magnitude lower than the current rate\u201d.</p> <p>The ice he worries about most covers Arctic seabeds \u2013 permafrost from the last ice age. Losing this will release huge methane plumes. Methane is 23 times more effective in raising global temperature than is CO<sub>2</sub>. Wadhams and colleagues have modelled the consequences using different dates for methane release.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We act, decisively and immediately, or our grandchildren pay full price, with our children impotent to help them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A business-as-usual approach by humanity makes 2035 a plausible moment for the permafrost to melt and methane to escape. The worst floods, fires, droughts and storms we have seen will be as nothing to what Africa, Asia and the Americas experience in this scenario. Millions die. Low-lying areas are inundated. Survivors live in a patchy post-apocalypse. Europe\u2019s current refugee crisis would be dwarfed.</p> <p>We still have time, <em>A Farewell to Ice </em>concludes, for drastic action, despite long procrastination. The fall of Margaret Thatcher was bad for the ice: she was a fan of Wadhams\u2019s work, quoting him extensively in her efforts to set up a body to understand and mitigate the loss of sea ice. Subsequent prime ministers did little or worse than nothing, suppressing facts that lobbyists in business and industry (some of them former Thatcherite ministers like Lord Lawson and Peter Lilley) did not like.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement</a>, when global leaders resolved to prevent a temperature rise of 2C (with an aspiration of 1.5C), gives Wadhams hope. He believes there is now a common will across the world to confront and avert the nightmare. Solutions include wind, wave, solar, tidal and nuclear energy (not the perilous water-cooled reactor type David Cameron wanted for Hinkley Point, which have a terrible record, but the \u201cpebble bed\u201d type, apparently) and, above all, direct air capture (DAC), which has yet to be invented.</p> <p>You pump air through a system that removes the CO<sub>2</sub> and \u201ceither liquefies it or turns it chemically into something useful\u201d, Wadhams says. Salvation requires \u201ca [DAC] research programme on the scale of the Manhattan Project\u201d and voluntary change by all: home insulation, no more SUVs or budget flights. We act, decisively and immediately, or our grandchildren pay full price, with our children impotent to help them, if you believe this book. I am afraid I do.</p> <p><em>A Farewell to Ice is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/farewell-to-ice.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.40</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice. He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink. He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001. His book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/farewell-to-ice.html\" title=\"\"><em>A Farewell to Ice</em></a>, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current&#xa0;rate.</p> <p><strong>You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade. It hasn\u2019t. Are you being alarmist?</strong><br>No. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter\" title=\"\">a clear trend down to zero</a> for summer cover. However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away. The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however. Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic\u2019s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.</p> <p><strong>Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer?</strong><br>People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change. Things happen, they say. In fact, the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population. One key effect will be albedo feedback. Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space. By contrast, water reflects less than 10%. So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present.</p> <p>Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system. Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further. These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures?</strong><br>The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt. It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year. Antarctica is adding to the melt as well. Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result. The most recent prediction of the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely. Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for.</p> <p>That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious. It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world. We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned.</p> <p><strong>Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But is that the only climate problem we face?</strong><br>No it is not. We also have the issue of methane. Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed. The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic&#xa0;icecaps.</p> <p>Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast. Then it started to disappear, so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age. It has started to melt with dangerous consequences. Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution.</p> <p><strong>Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide?</strong><br>Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites. These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating, often with little outliers on the graph. There is a scientist called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jun/12/greenland-darkening-ice-climate-science\" title=\"\">Jason Box</a> who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon\u2019s breath. They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments. They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d9df49ffc3458b65c76347f968f4bb315813745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d9df49ffc3458b65c76347f968f4bb315813745/78_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska.

However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide. It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years. By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100&#xa0;years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed. At least that is what scientists thought. Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere.</p> <p>So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away. But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect. All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere. We are having to live with last century\u2019s carbon dioxide. What that says is simple: there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide. That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions.</p> <p><strong>If we cannot halt the emissions of carbon dioxide, what can we do?</strong><br>In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air. The trouble is that they don\u2019t just how we can do that. The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\" title=\"\">carbon capture and storage</a>. Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground. These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process. Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/20/june-2016-14th-consecutive-month-of-record-breaking-heat-says-us-agencies\">Hottest ever June marks 14th month of record-breaking temperatures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>It sounds straightforward. Will it work?</strong><br>I am a bit suspicious of this technology. BECCS will need so much land to be effective. Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants. Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up. They won\u2019t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly.</p> <p>As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end. It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device. However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere. We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed. That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us. I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology.</p> <p><em>Farewell to Ice is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320) on 1&#xa0;September.</em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/farewell-to-ice.html\" title=\"\"><em> Click here to order a copy for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The western financial crisis of 2007-8 was the worst since 1931, yet its immediate repercussions were surprisingly modest. The crisis challenged the foundation stones of the long-dominant neoliberal ideology but it seemed to emerge largely unscathed. The banks were bailed out; hardly any bankers on either side of the Atlantic were prosecuted for their crimes; and the price of their behaviour was duly paid by the taxpayer. Subsequent economic policy, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world, has relied overwhelmingly on monetary policy, especially quantitative easing. It has failed. The western economy has stagnated and is now approaching its lost decade, with no end in sight.</p> <p>After almost nine years, we are finally beginning to reap the political whirlwind of the financial crisis. But how did neoliberalism manage to survive virtually unscathed for so long? Although it failed the test of the real world, bequeathing the worst economic disaster for seven decades, politically and intellectually it remained the only show in town. Parties of the right, centre and left had all bought into its philosophy, New Labour a classic in point. They knew no other way of thinking or doing: it had become the common sense. It was, as Antonio Gramsci put it, hegemonic. But that hegemony cannot and will not survive the test of the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/21/political-third-parties-spoilers-abolitionists-movement\">Third parties aren't 'spoilers'. They're at the cutting edge of democracy | Kevin Zeese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first inkling of the wider political consequences was evident in the turn in public opinion against the banks, bankers and business leaders. For decades, they could do no wrong: they were feted as the role models of our age, the default troubleshooters of choice in education, health and seemingly everything else. Now, though, their star was in steep descent, along with that of the political class. The effect of the financial crisis was to undermine faith and trust in the competence of the governing elites. It marked the beginnings of a wider political crisis.</p> <p>But the causes of this political crisis, glaringly evident on both sides of the Atlantic, are much deeper than simply the financial crisis and the virtually stillborn recovery of the last decade. They go to the heart of the neoliberal project that dates from the late 70s and the political rise of Reagan and Thatcher, and embraced at its core the idea of a global free market in goods, services and capital. The depression-era system of bank regulation was dismantled, in the US in the 1990s and in Britain in 1986, thereby creating the conditions for the 2008 crisis. Equality was scorned, the idea of trickle-down economics lauded, government condemned as a fetter on the market and duly downsized, immigration encouraged, regulation cut to a minimum, taxes reduced and a blind eye turned to corporate evasion.</p> <p>It should be noted that, by historical standards, the neoliberal era has not had a particularly good track record. The most dynamic period of postwar western growth was that between the end of the war and the early 70s, the era of welfare capitalism and Keynesianism, when the growth rate was double that of the neoliberal period from 1980 to the present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9743d47492b73cc81f1f51d2d57e7f43c6dc0dc3/0_38_3546_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1984, ushered in the era of neoliberalism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by far the most disastrous feature of the neoliberal period has been the huge growth in inequality. Until very recently, this had been virtually ignored. With extraordinary speed, however, it has emerged as one of, if not the most important political issue on both sides of the Atlantic, most dramatically in the US. It is, bar none, the issue that is driving the political discontent that is now engulfing the west. Given the statistical evidence, it is puzzling, shocking even, that it has been disregarded for so long; the explanation can only lie in the sheer extent of the hegemony of neoliberalism and its values.</p> <p>But now reality has upset the doctrinal apple cart. In the period 1948-1972, every section of the American population experienced very similar and sizable increases in their standard of living; between 1972-2013, the bottom 10% experienced falling real income while the top 10% did far better than everyone else. In the US, the median real income for full-time male workers is now lower than it was four decades ago: the income of the bottom 90% of the population has <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/globalization-new-discontents-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-08\">stagnated for over 30 years</a>.</p> <p>A not so dissimilar picture is true of the UK. And the problem has grown more serious since the financial crisis. On average, between <a href=\"http://\">65-70% of households in 25 high-income economies</a> experienced stagnant or falling real incomes between 2005 and 2014.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reasons are not difficult to explain. The hyper-globalisation era has been systematically stacked in favour of capital against labour: international trading agreements, drawn up in great secrecy, with business on the inside and the unions and citizens excluded, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32498715\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/what-is-ttip-controversial-trade-deal-explained\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) being but the latest examples; the politico-legal attack on the unions; <a href=\"http://\">the encouragement of large-scale immigration in both the US and Europe</a> that helped to undermine the bargaining power of the domestic workforce; and the failure to retrain displaced workers in any meaningful way.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/thomas-piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a> has shown, in the absence of countervailing pressures, capitalism naturally gravitates towards increasing inequality. In the period between 1945 and the late 70s, Cold War competition was arguably the biggest such constraint. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been none. As the popular backlash grows increasingly irresistible, however, such a winner-takes-all regime becomes politically unsustainable.</p> <p>Large sections of the population in both the US and the UK are now in revolt against their lot, as graphically illustrated by the support for Trump and Sanders in the US and the Brexit vote in the UK. This popular revolt is often described, in a somewhat denigratory and dismissive fashion, as populism. Or, as Francis Fukuyama writes in a recent excellent <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/american-political-decay-or-renewal\">essay in <em>Foreign Affairs</em></a>: \u201c\u2018Populism\u2019 is the label that political elites attach to policies supported by ordinary citizens that they don\u2019t like.\u201d Populism is a movement against the status quo. It represents the beginnings of something new, though it is generally much clearer about what it is against than what it is for. It can be progressive or reactionary, but more usually both.</p> <p>Brexit is a classic example of such populism. It has overturned a fundamental cornerstone of UK policy since the early 1970s. Though ostensibly about Europe, it was in fact about much more: a cri de coeur from those who feel they have lost out and been left behind, whose living standards have stagnated or worse since the 1980s, who feel dislocated by large-scale immigration over which they have no control and who face an increasingly insecure and casualised labour market. Their revolt has paralysed the governing elite, already claimed one prime minister, and left the latest one fumbling around in the dark looking for divine inspiration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b944b4b7daee014e9b8b352621988f74c6980c1/0_149_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit was the marker of a working-class revolt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wave of populism marks the return of class as a central agency in politics, both in the UK and the US. This is particularly remarkable in the US. For many decades, the idea of the \u201cworking class\u201d was marginal to American political discourse. Most Americans described themselves as middle class, a reflection of the aspirational pulse at the heart of American society. According to a Gallup poll, in 2000 only 33% of Americans called themselves working class; by 2015 the figure was 48%, almost half the population.</p> <p>Brexit, too, was primarily a working-class revolt. Hitherto, on both sides of the Atlantic, the agency of class has been in retreat in the face of the emergence of a new range of identities and issues from gender and race to sexual orientation and the environment. The return of class, because of its sheer reach, has the potential, like no other issue, to redefine the political landscape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, is a function of politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The re-emergence of class should not be confused with the labour movement. They are not synonymous: this is obvious in the US and increasingly the case in the UK. Indeed, over the last half-century, there has been a growing separation between the two in Britain. The re-emergence of the working class as a political voice in Britain, most notably in the Brexit vote, can best be described as an inchoate expression of resentment and protest, with only a very weak sense of belonging to the labour movement.</p> <p>Indeed, Ukip has been as important \u2013 in the form of immigration and Europe \u2013 in shaping its current attitudes as the Labour party. In the United States, both Trump and Sanders have given expression to the working-class revolt, the latter almost as much as the former. The working class belongs to no one: its orientation, far from predetermined, as the left liked to think, is a function of politics.</p> <p>The neoliberal era is being undermined from two directions. First, if its record of economic growth has never been particularly strong, it is now dismal. Europe is barely larger than it was on the eve of the financial crisis in 2007; the United States has done better but even its growth has been anaemic. Economists such as Larry Summers believe that the prospect for the future is most likely one of <a href=\"http://larrysummers.com/category/secular-stagnation/\">secular stagnation</a>.</p> <p>Worse, because the recovery has been so weak and fragile, there is a widespread belief that another financial crisis may well beckon. In other words, the neoliberal era has delivered the west back into the kind of crisis-ridden world that we last experienced in the 1930s. With this background, it is hardly surprising that a majority in the west now believe their children will be worse off than they were. Second, those who have lost out in the neoliberal era are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their fate \u2013 they are increasingly in open revolt. We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era. It is not dead, but it is in its early death throes, just as the social-democratic era was during the 1970s.</p> <p>A sure sign of the declining influence of neoliberalism is the rising chorus of intellectual voices raised against it. From the mid-70s through the 80s, the economic debate was increasingly dominated by monetarists and free marketeers. But since the western financial crisis, the centre of gravity of the intellectual debate has shifted profoundly. This is most obvious in the United States, with economists such as Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik and Jeffrey Sachs becoming increasingly influential. Thomas Piketty\u2019s <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> has been a massive seller. His work and that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/nobel-prize-for-economics-runners-riders\">Tony Atkinson and Angus Deaton</a> have pushed the question of the inequality to the top of the political agenda. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hajoonchang\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, for long isolated within the economics profession, has gained a following far greater than those who think economics is a branch of mathematics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8de8c75d289f1f1c95c1e82e49c98672aff35e7/0_4_4267_2561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at a rally in north London last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019, pictured at rally in north London last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, some of those who were previously strong advocates of a neoliberal approach, such as Larry Summers and the <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s Martin Wolf, have become extremely critical. The wind is in the sails of the critics of neoliberalism; the neoliberals and monetarists are in retreat. In the UK, the media and political worlds are well behind the curve. Few recognise that we are at the end of an era. Old attitudes and assumptions still predominate, whether on the BBC\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, in the rightwing press or the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>Following Ed Miliband\u2019s resignation as Labour leader, virtually no one foresaw the triumph of Jeremy Corbyn in the subsequent leadership election. The assumption had been more of the same, a Blairite or a halfway house like Miliband, certainly not anyone like Corbyn. But the zeitgeist had changed. The membership, especially the young who had joined the party on an unprecedented scale, wanted a complete break with New Labour. One of the reasons why the left has failed to emerge as the leader of the new mood of working-class disillusionment is that most social democratic parties became, in varying degrees, disciples of neoliberalism and uber-globalisation. The most extreme forms of this phenomenon were New Labour and the Democrats, who in the late 90s and 00s became its advance guard, personified by Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, triangulation and the third way.</p> <p>But as David Marquand observed in a review for the <em>New Statesman</em>, what is the point of a social democratic party if it doesn\u2019t represent the less fortunate, the underprivileged and the losers? New Labour deserted those who needed them, who historically they were supposed to represent. Is it surprising that large sections have now deserted the party who deserted them? Blair, in his reincarnation as a money-obsessed consultant to a shady bunch of presidents and dictators, is a fitting testament to the demise of New Labour.</p> <p>The rival contenders \u2013 Burnham, Cooper and Kendall \u2013 represented continuity. They were swept away by Corbyn, who won nearly 60% of the votes. New Labour was over, as dead as Monty Python\u2019s parrot. Few grasped the meaning of what had happened. A <em>Guardian</em> leader welcomed the surge in membership and then, lo and behold, urged support for Yvette Cooper, the very antithesis of the reason for the enthusiasm. The PLP refused to accept the result and ever since has tried with might and main to remove Corbyn.</p> <p>Just as the Labour party took far too long to come to terms with the rise of Thatcherism and the birth of a new era at the end of the 70s, now it could not grasp that the Thatcherite paradigm, which they eventually came to embrace in the form of New Labour, had finally run its course. Labour, like everyone else, is obliged to think anew. The membership in their antipathy to New Labour turned to someone who had never accepted the latter, who was the polar opposite in almost every respect of Blair, and embodying an authenticity and decency which Blair patently did not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Corbyn is not a product of the new times, he is a throwback to the late 70s and early 80s. That is both his strength and also his weakness. He is uncontaminated by the New Labour legacy because he has never accepted it. But nor, it would seem, does he understand the nature of the new era. The danger is that he is possessed of feet of clay in what is a highly fluid and unpredictable political environment, devoid of any certainties of almost any kind, in which Labour finds itself dangerously divided and weakened.</p> <p>Labour may be in intensive care, but the condition of the Conservatives is not a great deal better. David Cameron was guilty of a huge and irresponsible miscalculation over Brexit. He was forced to resign in the most ignominious of circumstances. The party is hopelessly divided. It has no idea in which direction to move after Brexit. The Brexiters painted an optimistic picture of turning away from the declining European market and embracing the expanding markets of the world, albeit barely mentioning by name which countries it had in mind. It looks as if the new prime minister may have an anachronistic hostility towards China and a willingness to undo the good work of George Osborne. If the government turns its back on China, by far the fastest growing market in the world, where are they going to turn?</p> <p>Brexit has left the country fragmented and deeply divided, with the very real prospect that Scotland might choose independence. Meanwhile, the Conservatives seem to have little understanding that the neoliberal era is in its death throes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a66e9b7acb68ce994770540486f274728d20d3/0_140_4658_2796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Put America first\u2019: Donald Trump in Cleveland last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dramatic as events have been in the UK, they cannot compare with those in the United States. Almost from nowhere, Donald Trump rose to capture the Republican nomination and confound virtually all the pundits and not least his own party. His message was straightforwardly anti-globalisation. He believes that the interests of the working class have been sacrificed in favour of the big corporations that have been encouraged to invest around the world and thereby deprive American workers of their jobs. Further, he argues that large-scale immigration has weakened the bargaining power of American workers and served to lower their wages.</p> <p>He proposes that US corporations should be required to invest their cash reserves in the US. He believes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) has had the effect of exporting American jobs to Mexico. On similar grounds, he is opposed to the TPP and the TTIP. And he also accuses China of stealing American jobs, threatening to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.</p> <p>To globalisation Trump counterposes economic nationalism: \u201cPut America first\u201d. His appeal, above all, is to the white working class who, until Trump\u2019s (and Bernie Sander\u2019s) arrival on the political scene, had been ignored and largely unrepresented since the 1980s. Given that their wages have been falling for most of the last 40 years, it is extraordinary how their interests have been neglected by the political class. Increasingly, they have voted Republican, but the Republicans have long been captured by the super-rich and Wall Street, whose interests, as hyper-globalisers, have run directly counter to those of the white working class. With the arrival of Trump they finally found a representative: they won Trump the Republican nomination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The economic nationalist argument has also been vigorously pursued by Bernie Sanders, who ran Hillary Clinton extremely close for the Democratic nomination and would probably have won but for more than 700 so-called super-delegates, who were effectively chosen by the Democratic machine and overwhelmingly supported Clinton. As in the case of the Republicans, the Democrats have long supported a neoliberal, pro-globalisation strategy, notwithstanding the concerns of its trade union base. Both the Republicans and the Democrats now find themselves deeply polarised between the pro- and anti-globalisers, an entirely new development not witnessed since the shift towards neoliberalism under Reagan almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>Another plank of Trump\u2019s nationalist appeal \u2013 \u201cMake America great again\u201d \u2013 is his position on foreign policy. He believes that America\u2019s pursuit of great power status has squandered the nation\u2019s resources. He argues that the country\u2019s alliance system is unfair, with America bearing most of the cost and its allies contributing far too little. He points to Japan and South Korea, and Nato\u2019s European members as prime examples.He seeks to rebalance these relationships and, failing that, to exit from them.</p> <p>As a country in decline, he argues that America can no longer afford to carry this kind of financial burden. Rather than putting the world to rights, he believes the money should be invested at home, pointing to the dilapidated state of America\u2019s infrastructure. <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech\">Trump\u2019s position</a> represents a major critique of America as the world\u2019s hegemon. His arguments mark a radical break with the neoliberal, hyper-globalisation ideology that has reigned since the early 1980s and with the foreign policy orthodoxy of most of the postwar period. These arguments must be taken seriously. They should not be lightly dismissed just because of their authorship. But Trump is no man of the left. He is a populist of the right. He has launched a racist and xenophobic attack on Muslims and on Mexicans. Trump\u2019s appeal is to a white working class that feels it has been cheated by the big corporations, undermined by Hispanic immigration, and often resentful towards African-Americans who for long too many have viewed as their inferior.</p> <p>A Trump America would mark a descent into authoritarianism characterised by abuse, scapegoating, discrimination, racism, arbitrariness and violence; America would become a deeply polarised and divided society. His threat to impose <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-navarro-trump-trade-china-tariffs-20160721-snap-story.html\">45% tariffs on China</a>, if implemented, would certainly provoke retaliation by the Chinese and herald the beginnings of a new era of protectionism.</p> <p>Trump may well lose the presidential election just as Sanders failed in his bid for the Democrat nomination. But this does not mean that the forces opposed to hyper-globalisation \u2013 unrestricted immigration, TPP and TTIP, the free movement of capital and much else \u2013 will have lost the argument and are set to decline. In little more than 12 months, Trump and Sanders have transformed the nature and terms of the argument. Far from being on the wane, the arguments of the critics of hyper-globalisation are steadily gaining ground. Roughly two-thirds of Americans agree that \u201cwe should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems\u201d. And, above all else, what will continue to drive opposition to the hyper-globalisers is inequality.</p>",

  "<p>In the run-up to the referendum on 23 June, the European Union was divided between optimists and pessimists. The pessimists \u2013 the majority \u2013 saw Brexit as a huge threat. A British vote to leave would strengthen \u201ccentrifugal forces\u201d and could even be the beginning of the end of the EU. The optimists \u2013 the minority \u2013 saw it as an opportunity. The shock of Brexit could galvanise the EU to move ahead with further integration, especially in areas that the UK had blocked. But both optimists and pessimists agreed that, if the UK did actually vote to leave, the EU would need to respond.</p> <p>Two months on from the referendum, however, little has happened beyond declarations of commitment to the future of the European project. The reason for this odd period of apparent inactivity is not just the lull caused by the summer break or even the shock of the British vote to leave the EU. It is also that, although everybody in Europe seems to agree that something must be done to respond to the Brexit vote, no one can seem to agree on what.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>German politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Europeans have watched the chaos that has been British politics over the last two months and waited for the new government to decide what it wanted, there have been plenty of exhortations to see Brexit as a wake-up call. But what Europeans are supposed to do if and when they wake up is less clear. Many among Europe\u2019s great and good have urged a new focus on the \u201cessentials\u201d, what is being called the \u201cEurope of necessity\u201d. The EU must deliver for citizens,but how?</p> <p>Far from lurching towards the superstate that British Eurosceptics always feared, the reality is that the EU is paralysed by the multiple intersecting fault lines that already existed within it \u2013 between creditor and debtor countries, between old and new member states and between left and right. This matters for the UK because its negotiation about a new relationship with the EU will be linked to the parallel deals between Europeans on the other areas that matter most to them, in particular economic policy and refugee policy.</p> <p>At the centre of all this, geographically and politically, is Germany. The Brexit vote has thrust Berlin into an even more pivotal position \u2013 the future of the EU will now revolve even more tightly around Germany. German politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power. German politicians talk about \u201cleading from the centre\u201d, in other words, to drive policy but to do so by seeking to find a European consensus.</p> <p>What this means in practice is a kind of hub-and-spoke Europe in which diplomacy, bilaterally and in groups, centres on Berlin. It began, disastrously, when the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/eu-emergency-talks-brexit-berlin\" title=\"\">invited the foreign ministers of the six founding member states of the EU</a> to Berlin the weekend after the referendum. The meeting was meant to be a show of European unity but inevitably alienated other member states.</p> <p>Since then, Angela Merkel and Steinmeier have met other European leaders to prepare for the post-Brexit summit that will take place in Bratislava on 16 September. Tomorrow, the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, will host Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Ventotene, an island off Naples where, in 1941, two interned anti-fascist activists wrote a famous manifesto calling for a federation of European states.</p> <p>However, despite all this diplomatic activity centred on Berlin, there is unlikely to be much progress by the time of the summit on the two biggest challenges for the EU: the eurozone and the refugee crisis. In both cases, the differences, roughly, between north and south in the eurozone and east and west on the refugee crisis, remain as wide as ever. If any initiatives are announced in Bratislava, they are likely to be in other less divisive areas such as better co-operation on counter-terrorism and perhaps some small steps in integrating European security and defence policy.</p> <p>The problem is that this is unlikely to do much to stop the rise of Euroscepticism, which most recognise is not an exclusively British phenomenon, even if it is more extreme here. \u201cWe must acknowledge that support and passion for our common project has faded over the last decade in parts of our societies,\u201d wrote Steinmeier and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in a <a href=\"http://www.voltairenet.org/article192564.html\" title=\"\">joint paper</a> published shortly after the referendum.</p> <p>What some see as a necessary response to Euroscepticism, others see as a capitulation to it. For Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and president of the Liberal group in the European parliament, the lesson of David Cameron\u2019s failure to persuade the British population to remain in the EU was that \u201cone cannot defeat nationalism by pandering to nationalists\u201d. The solution is \u201cmore Europe\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\">Frauke Petry: the acceptable face of Germany\u2019s new right?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others see calls to transfer more sovereignty to Brussels as part of the problem rather than the solution. \u201cNeither a simple call for more Europe nor a phase of mere reflection can be an adequate answer,\u201d Ayrault and Steinmeier wrote in their paper. Some, including the Dutch and Polish government, are more interested in devolving power back to the member states.</p> <p>It is also almost universally recognised that ways must be found to better legitimate European integration. But this is another mere aspiration. While some want a tighter EU centred on the eurozone, with its own parliament, others want a looser EU based on the idea of \u201cvariable geometry\u201d in which national parliaments would play a greater role.</p> <p>For the first time in the history of European integration, Germany is putting the brakes on. The shift is exemplified by the transformation in the attitude of the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, since his tough treatment of Greece last summer, the most popular politician in Germany. Sch\u00e4uble is generally seen as the most \u201cpro-European\u201d member of Merkel\u2019s cabinet. But even before the referendum, he said in an interview with <em>Der</em> <em>Spiegel</em> that the EU couldn\u2019t simply react to a British vote to leave the EU with a call for more integration.</p> <p>German officials increasingly justify positions such as this on the basis of the need for a European consensus \u2013 it must occupy a middle ground between different member states. But this is typically disingenuous. In reality, there is national politics behind Germany\u2019s opposition to further integration. Euroscepticism is rising in Germany too, not just among voters who are drifting to the Eurosceptic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/frauke-petry-acceptable-face-of-germany-new-right-interview\" title=\"\">Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> party but also in bastions of the establishment such as the Bundesbank and the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em>.</p> <p>The reality is that while an overwhelming majority of Germans remain committed to the EU, many no longer see further integration as being in the national interest. When France and Italy talk about more \u201crisk sharing\u201d in the eurozone, Germans see this as a stealth attempt to the \u201ctransfer union\u201d \u2013 in other words, an EU in which the fiscally responsible subsidise the fiscally irresponsible \u2013 that they have always feared. With a presidential election in France and a general election in Germany in 2017, positions are likely to harden over the next 12 months.</p> <p>This may all seem like the kind of arcane drama from which Britain voted on 23 June to liberate itself. But whether Britons like it or not, it will inform the way the EU negotiates with the UK. Behind the European commission\u2019s negotiating position will be member states concerned about Euroscepticism at home. It is the fear of empowering the Front National in France and the AfD in Germany, rather than a desire to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain, which is behind the reluctance to give the UK the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d that it wants. There may also be implicit trade-offs between member states linking the negotiation with the UK and negotiations in other areas.</p> <p>Chancellor Merkel seems, for now, to have prevailed with her patient approach to Brexit; as the reality set in that there was nothing anyone could do to make the UK invoke article 50, the calls for the UK to \u201cgo quickly\u201d largely stopped. Informal negotiations even seem to be taking place despite the initial Brussels mantra of \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d.</p> <p>But two months on from the referendum, the answer to the big question \u2013 will the UK be able to negotiate access to the single market, particularly for services, while restricting immigration from the EU? \u2013 remains unclear. Last week, Germany\u2019s European affairs minister indicated Britain could be given a \u201cspecial status\u201d. To British ears, that might sound like the best of both worlds \u2013 perhaps the access to the single market that comes with EEA membership together with the ability to restrict immigration that comes with a looser trade agreement. Whether that turns out to be wishful thinking will depend on the domestic political pressures on Europe\u2019s leaders and the negotiation between them about the future of the EU \u201cat 27\u201d.</p> <p><em>Hans Kundnani is senior transatlantic fellow at the </em><a href=\"http://www.gmfus.org/\" title=\"\"><em>German Marshall Fund of the United States</em></a><em>, based in Berlin.</em></p>"
