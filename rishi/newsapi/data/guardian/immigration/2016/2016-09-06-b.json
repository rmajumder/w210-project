  "<p>On 27 August, six Danish MPs boarded an aeroplane in Copenhagen. Our intention was to visit Australia and the tiny Pacific island state of Nauru \u2013 a country that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/a-short-history-of-nauru-australias-dumping-ground-for-refugees\">depends on the money</a> it receives for hosting the internationally criticised Australian offshore detention centre for asylum seekers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/nauru-fiasco-serves-to-confirm-danish-groups-suspicions-of-australian-tactics\">The delegation consisted of MPs from six different political parties </a>with different views on the Australian offshore asylum model. The nationalist Danish People\u2019s party has for many years argued in favour of a similar model in Denmark. They suggest the deportation of refugees to a Danish military base in Greenland. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, had sharply criticised the Australian camps in Danish and international media. The governing party in Denmark has been lying low, but the minister for integration, who was originally going on the trip, has indicated that inspiration could be sought in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/03/nauru-fiasco-serves-to-confirm-danish-groups-suspicions-of-australian-tactics\">Nauru fiasco serves to confirm Danish group's suspicions of Australian tactics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 29 August \u2013 just over 24 hours after arriving in Australia \u2013 we received a disheartening piece of information. Three MPs were denied access by the government of Nauru, which didn\u2019t even try to hide the reason. Government representatives openly said to the chairman of the delegation and to the Danish embassy that critics were not welcome.</p> <p>Nauru is an extremely poor country facing serious democratic challenges. Law professor and president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, has been denied a visa. Very few journalists have been granted access to the camps.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I repeatedly tried to get an answer to the question: who has the legal responsibility for the refugees on Nauru?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is, however, quite disturbing that Australia operates refugee camps on these conditions. During our visit to Canberra we met UNHCR representative Thomas Albrecht. He told us that after 30 years of working with refugees he expected that nothing could shock him. But on Nauru he saw greater hopelessness than anywhere else. He told us of his shocking encounter with a girl of about eight years old \u2013 the same age as his grandchild. He had asked her name. \u201cEZBO7,\u201d she replied. \u201cNo, what is your <em>name,\u201d</em> he insisted. \u201cEZBO7.\u201d He told us about children that had stopped playing and about self-harm and attempted suicide even among pre-teenagers.</p> <p>During our Australian visit, I repeatedly tried to get an answer to the question: who has the legal responsibility for the refugees on Nauru, in light of the Nauru files? I have asked high-ranking representatives of the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the assistant minister, Alex Hawke. After asking for a whole week I still haven\u2019t got a clear answer. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">Nauru files</a>, we can read about a great number of incidents where children were abused. The Danish delegation hasn\u2019t been able to get an answer to the question whether even one single incident has been investigated by police or led to a verdict in court.</p> <p>The vast majority of the asylum seekers who have been sent to Nauru and Manus Island have been recognised as refugees according to the UN refugee convention. They are supposed to be under protection and they will be at risk if they are sent home. But where can they go? After 10 years, their residence permit on Nauru will expire. What\u2019s next? This question also remains unanswered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/mp-andrew-wilkie-says-nauru-visa-denial-proves-australia-has-much-to-hide\">MP Andrew Wilkie says Nauru visa denial proves Australia 'has much to hide'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a European I wondered how this can take place within the framework of international law. Triggs gave me the answer. As opposed to Europe, where almost all countries are part of the European Convention on Human Rights (and its court), there is, in Australia, no authority with legal powers to stop human rights violations. UN committees may express criticism, but they can\u2019t enforce the rules.</p> <p>In Europe, we also have an ongoing debate on how to handle people who flee their countries. And rightwing politicians, not only in Denmark, praise the Australian model. If I were to even go near considering the concept of regional processing centres for asylum seekers, I would need good answers to these questions: how will you ensure that conditions in these centres live up to human rights and to the UN refugee convention? And how do you ensure a realistic perspective for resettlement?</p> <p>The Australian camps are certainly no source of inspiration. On the contrary. The secrecy in itself and the undefinable legal responsibility call for a massive international condemnation.</p> <p><em>Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen is a member of the Danish parliament for the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten).</em></p>",
  "<p>Nicaragua said on Tuesday it has given political asylum to former El Salvador president Mauricio Funes, who has come under scrutiny back home for a truce with gangs during his administration and is also facing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/salvadoran-ex-president-francisco-flores-stand-trial-corruption-charges\">multiple legal cases</a>.</p> <p>The Nicaraguan government\u2019s official Daily Gazette published a notice announcing that Funes, his partner and three children have all been granted asylum.

Investigators argue that he and his family need to justify the origin of more than $700,000 in income.</p> <p>Salvador prosecutors have also opened an investigation into possible corruption dating to his 2009-2014 government. In August, Salvadorian authorities raided several homes and businesses searching for evidence related to alleged \u201ccrimes of embezzlement, illicit negotiations, misuse of funds, illicit enrichment and influence-trafficking\u201d.</p> <p>Funes denies any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cAsylum only seeks to guarantee protection from persecution,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI have not given up on confronting the judicial process nor proving my innocence.\u201d</p> <p>Funes\u2019s government repeatedly denied approving negotiations with the gangs, which are blamed for violence that has pushed El Salvador\u2019s homicide rates to among the highest in the world. However, several officials from his administration say otherwise, and a group of mediators were allowed to meet gang leaders inside and outside prisons.</p> <p>His FMLN, which continues to be the governing party of El Salvador under the current president, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, was formed from a former guerrilla movement similar to the origins of Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega\u2019s Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p> <p>Funes arrived in Nicaragua three months ago saying he was working as a consultant.</p>",

  "<p>Protesters have gathered outside the Jamaican high commission in south-west London to demonstrate against Jamaica\u2019s cooperation with a deportation flight due to take off on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Mothers, fathers and grandparents are among those due to be forcibly removed from the UK to Jamaica despite many of them having spent their entire adult lives in Britain. In some cases they are still fighting their immigration cases, activists said. </p> <p>Critics have raised questions about the tactics used by Home Office immigration enforcement, which has been accused of \u201cstrategically\u201d detaining individuals to fill the flight, without consideration of their circumstances. </p> <p>The Unity Centre, a Glasgow-based migration support collective, said <a href=\"http://unitycentreglasgow.org/home-office-restarts-racist-jamaica-charter-flights/\">in a statement</a> that it has spoken to more than 50 of the passengers booked on the flight, all of who came to the UK as children but have failed to regularise their immigration status. </p> <p>It says all but one of them have British children, one has been married to a British national for 12 years, and two are full-time carers to their partners. Many have never been convicted of a criminal offence. </p> <p>Hilary Brown, managing director of the law firm Virgo Consultancy Services, based in south London, said she had managed to get clients taken off the flight by filing judicial reviews of the actions taken by the Home Office. </p> <p>One of those clients is a woman in her 60s who was married to a British man but whose application for indefinite leave to remain was held up by so much bureaucracy that her husband died before it was completed, Brown said. </p> <p>After her husband\u2019s death, she was told she no longer had a case to stay, despite having children and grandchildren in the UK. She was seized on Friday at her daughter\u2019s house and taken into immigration detention. </p> <p>Another Jamaican on the flight is Twane Morgan, 33, from Birmingham, a veteran of the British army who suffers from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder after two tours of Afghanistan. </p> <p>His sister, Tenisha Morgan, said he was detained a fortnight ago after he went to sign on at an immigration centre. He was served with a deportation order three years ago after a conviction for GBH, she said. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got kids here, he\u2019s got a young baby here [of] four months old,\u201d Tenisha Morgan said. \u201cThey are not taking those into consideration. He\u2019s got family here, he\u2019s got people to support him. When he goes to Jamaica he\u2019s going to be a madman on the street. I don\u2019t want to hear that my brother is dead. He\u2019s got no one in Jamaica, totally no one.\u201d</p> <p>She said her brother\u2019s mental health problems began after his two tours of Afghanistan, during which he saw friends killed. She believed that the act that led to his conviction was related his mental ill-health. He is reliant on strong injections of sedatives to keep his mental health problems in check, medicines that would not be available to him in Jamaica, she said.</p> <p>Activists believe this is the first immigration removal flight to Jamaica since November 2014. Brown said it seemed that immigration enforcement was acting quickly in an effort to prevent those being removed from making legal challenges.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you can do is go to the high court and challenge the fact that you are not being given an in-country appeal and that in itself is a breach of your human rights,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cBut what they are doing is they are trying to snatch these people away very quickly before the three months [time limit for lodging a judicial review] is up so the lawyers may be trying to gather all of the evidence to make sure the Home Office knows everything \u2026 before we\u2019ve gathered that and before the three months is up they will try to put them on the plane.\u201d</p> <p>Lee Jasper, the veteran black-rights activist and former equalities adviser to the mayor of London, wrote a plea to the Jamaican government on the Facebook page for the protest. \u201cThe people on that flight have lived in Britain for years. Some have committed criminal offences, most have not. We urge you not to accept this charter flight that constitutes a grave infringement of the human rights of [Jamaicans] living in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Home Office declined to comment on Tuesday evening.</p>",

Of those sent home on Tuesday, about 20 pupils returned to classes wearing the correct uniform.</p> <p>\u201cThis is part of raising expectations and standards so that every child has a fantastic education,\u201d said Tate, who joins the school from Trinity Free School in Sevenoaks. \u201cA small minority of parents were not happy but we have had emails and phone calls from other parents to express their support.\u201d<br></p> <p>In his welcome message on the school\u2019s website, Tate says that part of the school vision is \u201cexcellent uniform, a commitment to perfect uniform\u201d.

The secretary agreed she was allowed to go home to get her blazer, but she\u2019s not allowed in due to her shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Sian Williams added: \u201cThere were 11-year-old children on their first day at school in tears because they were being sent home. There was one girl who was sent home because she had a gold buckle on her black shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Another parent, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI think this has been handled badly especially the head teacher being so strict with the children. The school has a duty of care - anything could have happened to those children.\u201d</p> <p>Hartsdown, which is rated \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted and is sponsored by the Coastal Academies Trust, is a challenging school with a large number of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, including unaccompanied asylum seekers and eastern European children with English as an additional language.</p> <p>The executive head of the Coastal Academies Trust, Paul Luxmoore, said: \u201cHartsdown has previously been viewed in the community as a scruffy school.

For every grammar school there are three or four \u2018secondary modern\u2019 schools. All the evidence makes clear that segregating children in this way leads to lower academic standards. The argument that grammar schools create \u2018social mobility\u2019 are, in the words of the Ofsted chief inspector, \u2018tosh and nonsense\u2019.

But there is still more to be done. There are still parents who feel that their children aren\u2019t getting the opportunities they want them to have because of what happened to their local school.

Loughton, a Conservative, has taken over as acting chair of the home affairs committee pending the election of a full-time replacement. He was speaking to journalists in Portcullis House, Westminster, flanked by other committee members after the committee\u2019s private meeting where Vaz confirmed his resignation. Loughton said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Keith Vaz came to the meeting of the select committee. He gave a very frank account of what had happened and he told us of his intention to resign as chairman of the home affairs select committee ...</p> <p>The committee listened, I think in sadness, to what Keith had to say and with a good deal of respect. Keith has clearly acted in the best interests of the home affairs select committee and the important work that we do. And with sadness we all accepted that that was the appropriate course of action that he has taken. And we also appreciate the many challenges facing him personally and his family.</p> <p>All members of the home affairs select committee, across all parties, paid very fulsome tributes to the work that Keith has done. It is remarkable that he has been chairman of the select committee for nine years, the longest serving select committee chair. In that time he has overseen the publication of 120 reports and I think he has a reputation for getting the best out of witnesses, for being a robust chair, but also being a fair chair as well. I don\u2019t think it is an underestimate to say the work of the committee under his chairmanship has had a direct and big impact on government policy, on law and also on public opinion at times as well. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2652986f08911f78de1c33d93fbb7290ecf98f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2652986f08911f78de1c33d93fbb7290ecf98f7/145_0_515_309/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Loughton talking to journalists in Portcullis House.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Loughton talking to journalists in Portcullis House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ced27ee4b0f2c90ce7734a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:29:59.279Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nusrat Ghani, </strong>a Conservative member of the Commons home affairs committee, has also been tweeting about Keith Vaz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162618135740416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/3 It is saddening that Keith Vaz&#39;s time as Chair of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a> has come to an end in these circumstances.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162618135740416\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162727279853569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/3 His contribution to strengthening the credibility and effectiveness of the select committee system is respected across the House.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162727279853569\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162814999527424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/3 However, it is right that he has stepped down now, in order that the Committee&#39;s work is able to carry on free of distraction.</p>&mdash; Nusrat Ghani MP (@Nus_Ghani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nus_Ghani/status/773162814999527424\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cece75e4b0955f84308e10\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:12:11.215Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chuka Umunna</strong> has also been tweeting about Keith Vaz\u2019s resignation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132533819203584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/3 Keith Vaz has done a fine job chairing our committee for almost a decade, a view widely shared across the House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132533819203584\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132649527476225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/3 I am very sad to see Keith step down but believe he has made the right decision by Parliament and those we serve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132649527476225\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132768171724800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/3  It is incredibly important the Committee carries on the important work we are doing scrutinising Government. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsHomeAffs\">@CommonsHomeAffs</a></p>&mdash; Chuka Umunna (@ChukaUmunna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/773132768171724800\">September 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57cecd1ce4b0d24abcb74e94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-06T14:06:23.740Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Has the work of the committee been undermined by Vaz\u2019s actions?</em></p> <p>Loughton says he does not think so.

This work has included the publication of 120 reports, hearing evidence from ministers 113 times, and hearing from a total of 1379 witnesses. I am very pleased that so many members of the committee have gone onto high office and ministerial positions.</p> <p>I told the committee today of my decision to stand aside immediately from committee business, and my intention to resign. This is my decision, and mine alone, and my first consideration has been the effect of recent events on my family. I have recommended that in the interim, Tim Loughton MP, the senior Conservative member, should Chair proceedings.After speaking to the House authorities, I will formally tender my resignation to Mr Speaker so that it coincides with the timetable for the election of other committee chairs, such as the Brexit Committee, Culture, Media and Sport, and Science and Technology, so that the elections can take place together.</p> <p>I would like to thank my fellow members of the committee, past and present, for their tremendous support. I would also like to thank the clerks of the House for the amazing work they have done to strengthen the Select committee system, we are not quite on par with the United States, but we are getting there.

In Belfast the south and west of the city would be merged into one single constituency called Belfast South West.

Sinn Fein\u2019s <strong>Alex Maskey</strong> said his party had concerns that the recommended changes would also reduce the number of Stormont Assembly seats to 16 or less. <strong>Lord Empey</strong> of the Ulster Unionists said the proposals would mean places like Lisburn and Ballymena would be \u201ccut off from their natural hinterlands\u201d by the boundary changes.</p> <p>The changes also put under threat the Ulster Unionist seat won back from Sinn Fein in the last general election, Fermanagh/South Tyrone.

  "<h2>ONE EL OF A STORY</h2> <p>Europeans may just be making their very first shaky steps on the long and gilded road to Russia 2018, but elsewhere, like a line of Martin Skrtels defending a string of set pieces, push has very much come to shove. In the North and Central American region snappily rechristened Concacaf in football circles, Tuesday night is decision night, the last round of matches in the fourth and antepenultimate stage of qualifying. Mexico\u2019s place in stage five is assured, Costa Rica and Panama have sailed through Group B and USA! USA!! USA!!! will emerge from Group C with Trinidad &amp; Tobago unless they lose to the Soca Warriors and Guatemala go goal-crazy against a St Vincent &amp; Grenadines side whose defence is less impressive than a Sports Direct shelf-stacker\u2019s benefits package. Which leaves only the vexed question of who will come second in Group A.</p> <p>Honduras hold a shaky advantage, being as they are three points and a goal differential of five ahead of third-place Canada, who they beat in San Pedro Sula last Friday. But they must still visit Mexico City\u2019s Aztec Stadium, where \u2013 for all their happy memories of winning there in 2013 \u2013 they will almost certainly lose, while Canada\u2019s final game is at home to group whipping boys, El Salvador. To be fair, Canada emphatically failed to whip them when they met last November, labouring instead to a goalless draw, but matters will surely be different in Vancouver. After all, the Canucks go into the game knowing they will probably need to win by at least a couple of goals, and what motivation do El Salvador have?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/el-salvador-players-allege-bribe-canada-2018-world-cup-qualifier-honduras\">El Salvador players allege bribe over Canada World Cup qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This last question appears to have particularly troubled a mysterious deep-pocketed Honduras-supporting lair-dwelling cat-stroking semi-villain. A businessman, named by Salvadoran newspaper La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica as Ricardo Padilla, met some of the Salvadorian side over the weekend on behalf of \u201ca friend\u201d whose name he was \u201cnot authorised to say\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/06/el-salvador-players-allege-bribe-canada-2018-world-cup-qualifier-honduras\">offering them a complicated incentivised cash-making scheme</a>: $30 per player per minute played if they win in Canada (that\u2019s a maximum of $2,700, maths fans), $20 if they draw, $15 if they lose by a single goal, and not a dime if they let themselves suffer a thorough pasting. \u201cListen, match-fixing is when you get paid to lose, but there\u2019s none of that here,\u201d Padilla said, although there was a bit of that, kind of. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not my offer. If you don\u2019t want it, no problem. I came to see if you were interested. I am sure that you are interested in money. But if you don\u2019t accept, no problem. What I\u2019m doing is legal. Where\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p> <p>He was, essentially, encouraging the El Salvador side to play well, or at least not terribly badly, which doesn\u2019t sound particularly scandalous on the face of it. But if you\u2019re going to wave cash in the face of a footballer, it\u2019s probably wise not to pick those from a nation which handed life bans to 14 players for match-fixing less than three years ago. That kind of thing can make a player nervous. \u201cWe thank you for the time you took to come and make this proposal,\u201d one of them told Padilla at the end of the meeting, \u201cbut no one has accepted it. Tell your friend not to worry. We\u2019ll do our best to win.\u201d</p> <p>We know precisely what was said, because the players recorded the conversation, called a press conference, and played it. \u201cWe want to make clear that we\u2019re against anything like this,\u201d declared the striker Nelson Bonilla. \u201cWe want to be very transparent about anything happening with the national team and want to disassociate ourselves from whatever bad impression this could cause.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s only one way for the Salvadorians to prove that this nefarious persuasion has totally failed. And thus, our anonymous Honduran anti-hero might come to look upon this whole business as a bit of an own goal.

  "<p>For me, it\u2019s marshmallows. The moment I catch the scent of powdered sugar I remember lying with my head in my grandmother\u2019s lap as a child. For Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9, it\u2019s apple-flavoured sticks from Rouen that exert the Proustian pull, transporting him back to his Normandy childhood and squabbles with his twin sister over the sugary treats.</p> <p>Sweets may be universal, but the nostalgia they hold is intense and intimate, which is why \u2013 says Loyaut\u00e9 \u2013 they are the perfect vehicle for his long-term project to highlight the \u201cimmaterial heritage\u201d of Syria. With a man-bun and a curator\u2019s love of critical theory, the Brussels based artist and designer makes an unexpected confectioner. Yet when we meet in the foyer of his London hotel, on the table in front of us are little packets of pink candies created to his exacting specifications. </p> <p>At first glance they could be the cheap sweets sold by Syrian street vendors, except that each is shaped to resemble an \u201ceye idol\u201d \u2013 those ancient Syrian figurines whose use and meaning archaeologists are still debating. Loyaut\u00e9 describes his sweets as \u201ctransmitter objects\u201d \u2013 everyday things with \u201ca real value and symbolic value linked to emotion, history, heritage\u201d. In other words, as it says on one of his text paintings: \u201ccandy keeps the past alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne woman said she never ate these candies because they are sold on dusty trolleys \u2013 they are not for rich people,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was only when they started disappearing from the streets thanks to the war, that she realised: \u2018I miss them\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait any longer and break off our chat to open the simple plastic packet and pop one in my mouth. The soft texture yields an intense burst of sugar and rose. For an artwork, they are pretty delicious. And at this month\u2019s London Design Biennale, visitors will get their own chance to scoff. Loyaut\u00e9\u2019s exhibit includes \u201ca practical sculpture\u201d, otherwise known as a vending machine. For \u00a35, it will dispense a packet of the sweets and design buffs will be invited \u201cto do their bit\u201d. </p> <p>The money put into the machine will directly transfer to the <a href=\"https://mosaicinitiative.org.uk/\">Mosaic initiative</a>, a small London-based charity which distributes aid, both within Syria and to educational projects for Syrian refugees elsewhere. If Loyaut\u00e9 has his way, it will be only the first step in a Willy Wonka-ish ambition to bring people together through sweets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e809deb7ef1ed237681207524d786bc603c1bfa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e809deb7ef1ed237681207524d786bc603c1bfa0/0_0_8389_6711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Astounding Eyes of Syria installation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candy keeps the past alive ...

Loyaut\u00e9 is thinking big: aiming to work with a company like Kraft to mass produce these sweets and use the money raised to protect Syrian heritage. \u201cHaribo sells one billion strawberry sweets a year. I am a dreamer, but if I sell 100,000 in two years that\u2019s something tangible,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These Louloupti sweets are an ambassador for a way of living ... in Syria people want to share</p> <footer> <cite>Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the heart of the London exhibition is his film, The Astounding Eyes of Syria, shot in the Bequaa Valley refugee camp, which lies in the \u201cred zone\u201d of Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria. Loyaut\u00e9 travelled to the camp last winter with Syrian and Lebanese friends, rather than an NGO, so he could quietly meet families. The result is a heartbreaking 20 minutes of Syrians talking about the sweets they miss. Focusing on this tiny, delicious detail of their former lives highlights how much the war has swept away: a living culture, close-knit communities, simple pleasures.</p> <p>Loyaut\u00e9 says the families \u2013 some of whom he remains close to \u2013 enjoyed the chance to discuss happy memories. \u201cThere are always westerners who want to film the dust and the horror. They were thankful to shine a smile inside the horror, because that does exist,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe can destroy buildings and kill humans, but we can\u2019t erase the living heritage; the memory of things, the culture, the civilisation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd3bd024d90681148a9f14a9f743db094ed5149b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd3bd024d90681148a9f14a9f743db094ed5149b/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Astounding Eyes of Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A smile inside the horror\u2019 \u2026 a still from The Astounding Eyes of Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Loyaut\u00e9 Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One father, Hanadi Abbas, talks of the penny sweets he used to buy to give to guests or relatives. Today a bag costs \u00a310 to \u00a320. A woman shows the camera a plastic box of baking moulds she saved during her flight to the camp. Bringing out a biscuit cutter, she remembers baking her husband heart-shaped biscuits. \u201cHe asked, \u2018Why so many tiny hearts?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because I love you.\u2019\u201d A mother of three, Hani Koubaisi remembers how, on feast days, she would invite neighbours to her house for homemade pastries. If she had fallen out with one of them, it was a chance \u201cto make peace\u201d. Now, she says sadly, \u201cIt\u2019s all been lost and we will never get it back.\u201d</p> <p>Interspersed with their stories are fictional scenes: a sweet seller in an empty shop; one of the traditional ice-cream makers Damascus is famous for, making rhythmical music as he pounds the dessert. They bring the sights and sounds of Syria to life. For Loyaut\u00e9, sweets also represent the generosity of Syrians, a theme he returns to repeatedly. \u201cLouloupti is an ambassador for a way of living in Syria \u2013 sharing sweets in the street. In Syria people want to share.\u201d Even in the camp, he says, he noticed this reflex. When he went to a small shop to buy sweets to take to the families he was visiting, the shopkeeper \u201chad nothing and was very poor \u2026 but he didn\u2019t want to take my money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da741e53889ad255da6f182ba2662d41f3de89e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da741e53889ad255da6f182ba2662d41f3de89e4/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Candy colours ... a Syrian sweet shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candy colours ... a Syrian sweet shop</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lens Young Dimashqi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not hard to see how passionate Loyaut\u00e9 is about Syria.

  "<p>Crickets bounce, bees wobble, hoverflies dart and <a href=\"http://www.jessicaalbarn.co.uk/\">Jessica Albarn</a> stands in the middle of her steep, sunny meadow and scrunches up her hands in delight. \u201cQuite a bit of my work is about layers,\u201d she says, crouching down to investigate the depth of the grass with her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to get right in there and explore an area.\u201d</p> <p>Albarn is a visual artist best known for her beautifully detailed pencil drawings of spiders, bees, butterflies and other insects. Perhaps it is inevitable that peering through a microscope at dead insects in her London studio led her to the lanes of south Devon to create a meadow, and capture some of its richness in a series of artistic adventures.</p> <p>If you feel there\u2019s something familiar about the name, you\u2019d be right: Albarn is the younger sister of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn\">Damon of Blur</a>, and her meadow is on the old farm he bought for his family 20 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have this antidote to London,\u201d she says. \u201cDamon bought this as a family place, so we could all have somewhere to meet. This work is part of him, because I wouldn\u2019t have had this otherwise. It\u2019s been wonderful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spider, a drawing on paper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spider ... a drawing on paper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Albarn spent most of her childhood in rural Essex. Her dad, Keith, taught at Colchester School of Art. \u201cIt was great for me as a kid. We had a bit of freedom. You could walk to the woods and down to the river, and I had loads of animals. That\u2019s where it all began for me.\u201d Her mum came from a farming family in Lincolnshire and Albarn thinks a love of the land \u201cis also probably a bit in the blood\u201d.</p> <p>She took her art foundation course under her dad at Colchester (\u201cHe was great, but I had a bit of a hard time from some of the other staff\u201d) and moved to London to complete her degree. She was just getting going as an artist when she gave birth to her daughter, who is now 21, and she has an 18-year-old son. But just when she might have had more time to make art, she had another daughter, who is five. Some artists struggle to continue working with family and financial demands. Albarn has \u201cfought like crazy to keep going\u201d, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been very dogged about it. Being a woman and having children, your career takes a different path. I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do an MA, but I\u2019ve found my path \u2013 and it\u2019s made me very disciplined.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323/0_96_4211_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artist\u2019s meadow at Damon Albarn\u2019s farm in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Field-good factor ... the artist\u2019s meadow at the family farm in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She likes to go out on a forage, she says, and her art \u201cusually begins with something I find\u201d. She has been particularly inspired by bees, and undertook a \u201cbee marathon\u201d at the Natural History Museum, drawing bees all day in \u201chomage to their industry\u201d. She laughs. \u201cEveryone is going on about the bees dying, which is very tragic and depressing, so it is nice to try and do something positive.\u201d </p> <p>Albarn began raising money for the <a href=\"http://bumblebeeconservation.org/\">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> and learned of the importance of \u201ccreating corridors for wildlife and wild flowers\u201d. And that\u2019s when she decided to turn a small, steep south-facing sheep field into a meadow. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly lush down here and there\u2019s a lot of wild flowers, so my parents thought I was a bit mad when I said I wanted to create a meadow. But I hope to encourage two species in particular \u2013 <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/very-rare/shrill-carder-bee/\">the shrill carder bumblebee</a> and the <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/scarce/\">blaeberry bumblebee</a>. They are around in this area but they are very, very rare.\u201d</p> <p>Following advice from a BCT outreach officer, she created the meadow. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been studying insects for a long time, I\u2019m quite a novice and am learning as I go,\u201d she says. Much of her art mixes insects with geometrical forms and the meadow is marked out in six hexagon shapes \u2013 inspired by beeswax \u2013 arranged in a triangular shape. She and her mum collected as much local seed as they could find (locally sourced seed is always best for \u201cnew\u201d meadows) and bought extra BCT-approved native seeds, and scattered them over the slope.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad/197_0_2239_2798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albarn at the launch for her illustrated book, The Boy in the Oak.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents thought I was mad\u2019 ...

It\u2019s a wonderful thing to watch.\u201d This is Albarn\u2019s second summer managing the meadow, and it is improving each year: crucially, yellow rattle is now established, a flower that is parasitic on grass and so creates more space for other flowers.<br></p> <p>It is a kind of artistic study plot. \u201cI wanted to create an archive, a piece of land that I could manage myself. I\u2019m looking to gather as much information as I possibly can about the insects and the wildlife that passes through, and that will inform the work I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve wired up these electric ink drawings \u2013 put your hand neart and it activates the sound</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her exhibition in London this September marks a midpoint in her three-year project. There will be drawings, obviously, but also an oil painting of her youngest daughter in the meadow, \u201cwhich is a bit of a departure for me,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time on our own down here together, she really gets into it and she helped me broadcast the seed. Kids love a bit of manual work \u2013 well, for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Albarn has been painting and etching on glass and creating images from solar paper, an early form of photographic paper. By laying plants upon it when it is exposed to the light, you create shadowy outlines. \u201cYou get some wonderful, quite ghostly effects,\u201d she says.

  "<p>When my mother left England to get married in Egypt before the second world war, her father gave her a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/subscribe-guardian-weekly\" title=\"\">subscription </a>to the Manchester Guardian.

Five years later we moved to Sacramento, California. I decided to go back to school to study music, and gave private piano lessons before retiring.</p> <p>My mother (pictured, left) came to live with us in 1990 after my father passed away, and immediately re-established her subscription. She would sit with her magnifying glass reading it from cover to cover all week, and enjoyed tackling the Quick crossword, right up until she passed away at the age of 101. At that point there were still six months left on her subscription, so I began reading the paper, instantly got hooked and have been reading it ever since \u2013 seven years to date.

  "<p>Switzerland has blinked first in a standoff with the EU that mirrors the UK\u2019s Brexit debate on the critical trade-off between free movement and a special trade deal with the bloc.</p> <p>The Alpine republic voted narrowly to impose EU immigration quotas in a 2014 referendum that must be implemented by next February, but Brussels has said any cap would deny Switzerland its privileged access to the single market.</p> <p>With talks between Bern and the EU commission due to resume on 19 September, Swiss ministers have welcomed a parliamentary panel\u2019s plan to give preference to local people in job hires rather than impose unilateral quotas on foreigners.</p> <p>It is not yet clear that the compromise, which must be debated by the full parliament, will win EU approval. But it represents at least a potential way out of the corner into which Switzerland has painted itself.</p> <p>Any \u201cmajor concession\u201d by the EU, which has not budged from its stance that Switzerland must respect free movement rules or lose trade benefits, was plainly \u201cunrealistic\u201d following Britain\u2019s exit vote, the justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga told the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. </p> <p>Both Swiss and EU officials had previously said the UK referendum result had \u201ccomplicated\u201d the talks between the two sides, since any EU compromise with Switzerland would be almost certain to fuel similar demands from Britain. </p> <p>All main political parties have supported the proposal, with the exception of the rightwing Swiss People\u2019s party, which denounced it as a betrayal of voters who backed annual limits on foreigners\u2019 residency and working rights.</p> <p>Sommaruga said she believed a bill that encouraged Swiss employers to \u201cfill open jobs first of all with suitable workers from Switzerland\u201d could reduce immigration and comply with EU freedom of movement rules.</p> <p>The economy minister and Swiss confederation president, Johann Schneider-Ammann, who will meet the EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Zurich later this month, said the plan could allow the government to \u201cmeet its constitutional obligation to manage immigration, without violating its EU agreements\u201d. </p> <p>Switzerland\u2019s relations with the EU are governed by a set of multiple bilateral treaties that give it privileged access to much of the single market and are linked by a \u201cguillotine clause\u201d \u2013 if one treaty is breached, they all collapse. </p> <p>Neither side wants that to happen: the EU takes more Swiss exports than any other market, and Switzerland is the EU\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner. About 1 million EU citizens currently live in Switzerland.</p> <p>But in a vote with a striking resemblance to Britain\u2019s, the populist, Eurosceptic SVP called for and, against all establishment expectations, won the 2014 referendum, with 50.3% of voters \u2013 in a country whose population is almost one-quarter foreign \u2013 demanding immigration quotas.</p> <p>As a result, the country not only finds itself threatened with exclusion from the EU\u2019s single market, with potentially dramatic economic consequences, but has already been ejected from the EU\u2019s science research programme, Horizon2020, and the Erasmus student exchange programme. </p> <p>It has one further possible solution to its dilemma. A petition calling for a second referendum that would allow voters to make an explicit choice between imposing immigration controls on EU citizens and maintaining Switzerland\u2019s special trade deal with the bloc has gathered enough signatures to trigger a new plebiscite.</p> <p> The draft legislation unveiled late last week would \u201cseverely reduce\u201d the attractiveness of hiring people from abroad, the parliamentary committee said, by favouring people \u2013 including EU citizens \u2013 already living in Switzerland.</p> <p>If parliament and the EU do not approve it, the government is obliged to call a second referendum \u2013 the consequences of which would, this time, be rather clearer. It would be watched with interest in Britain. </p>",
  "<p>David Greig, the recently installed artistic director of Edinburgh\u2019s venerable <a href=\"http://lyceum.org.uk/\">Royal Lyceum theatre</a>, says there are a hundred reasons why he chose a 2,500-year-old play to be the opening production of his debut season. But those familiar with the funny, sexy, challenging work of the award-winning playwright may be surprised to learn that one of them is a millennia-old pipe called an aulos.</p> <p>Greig had already been in discussion with director Ramin Gray and composer John Browne, with whom he collaborated on the internationally acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/dec/31/best-theatre-of-2013-no-1-the-events\">The Events</a>, about the possibility of staging one of the world\u2019s oldest plays, The Suppliant Women by ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was going to do an adaption and, incredibly hubristically, I thought the point of doing an adaption was to improve, to fix problems, and make it work for an audience as if it was written yesterday. But what I realised quickly was that Ramin and John were interested in the archeology of the work, and were coming at it from another angle.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/sep/10/david-greig-artistic-director-royal-lyceum-theatre-edinburgh\">Running the Lyceum could be David Greig's greatest show yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Browne had discovered a specialist musical archeologist who had reconstructed and learnt to play an aulos, the ancient Greek wind instrument, akin to bagpipes, that provided the usual accompaniment to theatrical performances of that time. </p> <p>\u201cRamin was saying, \u2018This instrument has not been heard for millennia!\u2019, and I\u2019m smiling, but thinking, \u2018I bet there\u2019s a reason for that\u2019. Then we heard [a recording] and it was genuinely beautiful.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cFor me there was a flash that I should go in precisely the other direction: instead of making this \u2018normal\u2019 for our audience, to go back, so the audience think, \u2018My God, this is 2,500 years old but it\u2019s talking to me as directly as if it was written yesterday\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The modern-day parallels of the story of 50 young women who flee forced marriage in Egypt to seek asylum in Greece are plain enough. But for Greig, the resonances of the piece extend beyond the immediately political. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I got the job at the Lyceum, I needed an opening show, but also [something that marked] the unrolling of a whole bunch of things that I think about theatre. Music is at the heart of it, and political engagement, and it\u2019s a play from the birth of democracy, and Edinburgh is the Athens of the north \u2026 it was the obvious choice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7f687155369b4a0ee4363d1bc65526e43507c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7f687155369b4a0ee4363d1bc65526e43507c31/0_123_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neve Macintosh and Rudi Dharmalingham in The Events, David Greig\u2019s previous collaboration with Ramin Gray and John Browne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neve Macintosh and Rudi Dharmalingham in The Events, David Greig\u2019s previous collaboration with Ramin Gray and John Browne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talking alongside his collaborators on a breezy Edinburgh morning, just as rehearsals are beginning in earnest, it is clear that Greig also wanted to call on their triumvirate energy, previously used to great effect in The Events, about the aftermath of a gun massacre. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the way we work as a group of three that\u2019s more than rigorous, that\u2019s about pushing as hard as you can possibly push. And for an opening show it would have a vulnerability to it. There\u2019s no point doing an opening show that you know everyone\u2019s going to like: it had to feel like a worthy risk.\u201d</p> <p>Irish composer Browne chips in: \u201cThe common feature [of how we work together] is dramaturgical. The three of us have that drive, and here the story is the smallest part of this piece, while the context is massive. It\u2019s a very simple story that can be told and absorbed in a single sentence, but thematically and politically it\u2019s very complex.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gray, currently the artistic director of <a href=\"http://www.atctheatre.com/\">Actors Touring Company</a>, adds: \u201cThere are all sorts of assumptions people make because of the way the technology of theatre has evolved over the past 2,500 years, but [this work] is about poetry, music, dancing, philosophy, politics, ritual \u2026\u201d<br></p> <p>Drawing these strands together is a chorus of non-professional local young women, representing the suppliants of the title. In ancient Greece, the theatrical chorus was like a finishing school for young men, Gray explains. It was, says Browne, \u201con the cusp between a religious ceremony and public entertainment and political debate\u201d.</p> <p>But in modern day Edinburgh, as well as Belfast and Newcastle, The Suppliant Women will also be performed by local choruses, the cities represented on stage by 50 volunteers, aged between 16 and 30, whose voices will carry the performance. \u201cThere are 55 pages of just chorus!\u201d Gray exclaims, as the young women, who are learning their lines by rote around a piano rather than from a script, plead for sanctuary. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t told them that yet \u2026\u201d he adds jauntily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f7f8275009fe056ee0ca10af0206b7ff8a6fa82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7f8275009fe056ee0ca10af0206b7ff8a6fa82/0_238_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramin Gray, centre, in rehearsals for The Suppliant Women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramin Gray, centre, in rehearsals for The Suppliant Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan McCredie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greig\u2019s version is written in rhythm, and Browne says that he has stuck as closely as possible to the inverse and anti-verse choral device used by Aeschylus. \u201cWith the chorus, its about getting dynamic through antithesis, for example between war and justice. We\u2019ve just allowed 50 refugee women in, but the worry is that this may lead to war in our city. The debate at the heart of the play is the current debate.\u201d</p> <p>Gray adds: \u201cIt can be helpful when you have a very contemporary and pressing issue to look at it through a 2,500-year-old lens. It enables you to look at it in a more abstract way.\u201d</p> <p>Greig pre-empts the charge that his adaption has shoe-horned in its current politics: \u201cThere will be people who say, \u2018Well they\u2019ve made this all about asylum seekers, and that line about Syria has obviously been placed\u2019, and the frustrating thing is that all that stuff is already there \u2013 it isn\u2019t imposed by us.\u201d</p> <p>Gray interjects with delight: \u201cIn the fourth line in Aeschylus, Syria is name-checked!\u201d</p> <p>For Greig, the usefulness to a contemporary audience is obvious: \u201cWe\u2019re not watching propaganda and we\u2019re not watching op-ed pieces; we\u2019re watching stories and performances that require us to engage with each other. This play is primal, it\u2019s the very beginning of what drama is, it\u2019s a play from a year before democracy was invented in Athens.\u201d (The original text also contains the first ever recorded use of the word democracy, and a public vote \u2013 on whether the women should be allowed to stay \u2013 is a key plot point.)</p> <p>\u201cTo have theatre and democracy linked like that, I think is a really important and profound statement about what the role and purpose of theatre is.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The Suppliant Women, a co-production between Actors Touring Company and the Lyceum, is at <a href=\"http://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/the-suppliant-women\">Edinburgh Lyceum</a> from 1-15 October; <a href=\"http://belfastinternationalartsfestival.com/\">Belfast international arts festival</a>, 21-22 October; and <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk/\">Northern Stage</a>, Newcastle, 3-5 November.<br></li> </ul>",

  "<p> \u201cLeaving the refugees unprotected means you leave your country and society unprotected, and we have to do something,\u201d says Efi Latsoudi, a Lesbos resident who\u2019s seen her hometown engulfed by the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. </p> <p>Originally from Athens, the 48-year-old human rights activist moved to the Greek island in 2001, and for the past four years has been one of the founders and administrators of an open, self-organised refugee camp, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pikpalesvos/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&amp;tab=page_info\">Pikpa</a>. The camp has been run, through all the tumult of the last few years, entirely on the efforts of volunteers and donations. </p> <p>Pikpa, on the south-east corner of the island, grew out of a solidarity network of local NGOs and volunteers, and started sheltering refugees in 2012. Though the Greeks have been hit by their own economic crisis for eight years, many such as Latsoudi have re-focused their worries on alleviating the urgent needs of refugees. </p> <p>Latsoudi\u2019s response to the refugee crisis was partly political. \u201cWe had refugees starting to arrive on the island in August 2012. I thought that if we don\u2019t do something for these people, we are giving an advantage to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/neo-fascist-greek-party-election-golden-dawn-third-place\"> fascist party to raise their power</a>,\u201d Latsoudi says.

Initially, the camp operated as a hostel, but it has responded to the changing nature of the refugee crisis, and temporary shelter has become permanent. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We believe the solidarity of people can be part of the solution. And this is a great thing</p> <footer> <cite>Efi Latsoudi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine this [reaching this point]. But I think if you\u2019re in this refugee solidarity work, you have to be prepared for anything. Because it\u2019s not an organised trip to Europe, there\u2019s always a situation of crisis that can change any minute.\u201d</p> <p>For Latsoudi, the unity of Greek people and refugees is vital, especially on an island which has a very personal history of migration. Approximately 60% of the 90,000 or so residents in Lesbos are descended from Greek Orthodox Christians expelled from Turkey in the 1920s. \u201cCitizens from Greece are doing this even though they are facing an economic crisis \u2013 they are affected by all the uncertainty that it brings to them. But we believe the solidarity of people can be part of the solution. And this is a great thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Pikpa camp offers shelter, activities, food, and medical support for the most vulnerable refugees, and the families of those who have died at sea. What makes this camp different, Latsoudi says, is humane treatment and an \u201cidea of community\u201d. </p> <p>She has taken on a monumental task: at the peak of the crisis, this time last year, Pikpa was hosting 600 refugees a day, despite a capacity of just 150, and distributing more than 2,000 meals each day. Lesbos has welcomed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83\">93,600 refugees by sea this year alone</a> \u2013 equal to the island\u2019s own population. Though Latsoudi believes the government response has been poor, the reaction of Greek people has been positive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40579b8465f31d7f1f4694a873ce430c4e6569c/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winners of UNHCR\u0092s Nansen Award 2016, Konstantinos Mitragas and Efi Latsoudi on the beach with life jackets in background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Efi Latsoudi and her fellow award-winner, sea captain Konstantinos Mitragas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gordon Welters/UNHCR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Latsoudi seems to have taken the last few years in her stride.

Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s colt has not done much wrong when beaten at Salisbury in July and Yarmouth last month, both times finishing runner-up to an opponent who enjoyed an ideal passage, and has not moved up in the weights since the most recent of those starts.</p> <p><strong>Stoneboat Bill (5.05) </strong>was the only runner to make any impression on the front-running Intalza at Carlisle on 22 August and the winner there has already franked the form under a penalty, while<strong> Mountain King (6.40)</strong> and <strong>Alyasan (3.10)</strong> look best on the jumps cards at Perth and Worcester respectively.</p> <h2>Tipping competition, day two</h2> <p><strong>Our winners so far: </strong></p> <p><strong>Monday:</strong></p> <p>Green Zone 5-1, Purple Party 9-2, Fast Act 10-1</p> <p>And our leaders Day One are: <strong>wemeanyounoharm</strong> +8.50 and <strong>wiggy12</strong> +8.50, followed by jakebuckfast +8, lcprestes +8, cerises +8, BearRides +8</p> <p>\u2026 and ubikubik +3</p> <p>amesstod +3</p> <p>yasmin11 +3</p> <p>72luca +3</p> <p>FinsburyPark +2.50</p> <p>DrKelso +2.50</p> <p>orso +2.50</p> <p>Mulldog +2.50</p> <p>Harrytheactor +2.50</p> <p>sandiuk +2.50</p> <p>Crasivo +2.50</p> <p>moidadem +2.50</p> <p>elliot45 +2.50</p> <p>GipsyHiller -3</p> <p>LansonUproar -3</p> <p>slackdad38 -3</p> <p>Ormrod76 -3</p> <p>Rivercity -3</p> <p>diegosigod -3</p> <p>23skidoo -3</p> <p>millreef -3</p> <p>johne5knuckle -3</p> <p>Geoff Staddon -3</p> <p>Renzofan -3</p> <p>melonk -3</p> <p>BatmanKaisers -3</p> <p>donlewis -3</p> <p>kingklynch -3</p> <p>AshleyBrook -3</p> <p>chris1623 -3</p> <p>Ellandback -3</p> <p>JahLion -3</p> <p>William36 -3</p> <p>Perry Tang -3</p> <p>slowhandray -3</p> <p>gregcwb -3</p> <p>waltersobchak -3</p> <p>TL127 -3</p> <p>LexLondon -3</p> <p>ID0228872 -3</p> <p>Esherhammer -3</p> <p>kmill68 -3</p> <p>Toptrapper -3</p> <p>Blitzwing -3</p> <p>MrWinnersSonInLaw -3</p> <p>GForce1 -3</p> <p>Bacciodilupo -3</p> <p>Copshaw -3</p> <p>Fixxxer -3</p> <p>AndieAndson -3</p> <p>16heathermac01 -3</p> <p>maghazi -3</p> <p>Ben Leo -3</p> <p>ps4999 -3</p> <p>joehow -3</p> <p>ID3814422 -3</p> <p>Bonzodrongo -3</p> <p>spudpt -3</p> <p>TheVic -3</p> <p>Goldkid999 -3</p> <p>goodfellow1 -3</p> <p>Bigboozer -3</p> <p>titusisashambles -3</p> <p>PHILYERBOOTS -3</p> <p>Lindsey6677 -3</p> <p>What a joy to see so many familiar names in this week of weeks, including some that haven\u2019t been involved for a while. Wemeanyounoharm and wiggy12 both started strongly, pairing Green Zone with Purple Party, while four others hit Fast Act and share a close third place.</p> <p>Today, we\u2019d like your tips, please, for these races: <strong>3.50 Redcar</strong>, <strong>4.00 Leicester</strong>, <strong>7.40 Perth</strong>.</p> <p>The prize for our final competition of 2016 is a copy of the new volume of Chasers &amp; Hurdlers, to be published next month by Timeform. Running to 1,100 pages and retailing at \u00a375, it is a big, beautiful record of the last jumps season, including many of the famous Timeform essays discussing the major performers and the issues raised during the winter. Evidently one of the essays suggests that some stewards are \u201cblind \u2026 to non-triers\u201d! If you don\u2019t win, <a href=\"https://www.timeform.com/horse-racing/shop/annuals\" title=\"\">you can buy a copy here</a>.</p> <p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -3.</p> <p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p> <p>For terms and conditions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"\">click here</a>.</p> <p>Alas, we\u2019re not going to be able to continue with these competitions every week and the one this week will be the last until the new year. A reorganisation of duties has meant we no longer have the time needed to keep scores while also obtaining and distributing prizes.</p> <p>We will still have competitions in the biggest weeks (Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and maybe one or two others, as well as the Christmas quiz). And we\u2019ll still have a Talking Horses each day for tips, analysis and news, so we very much hope you\u2019ll join us to chew over whatever racing happens to be going on, especially those of you who have been in the habit of sharing winning tips at good prices.</p> <p>It\u2019s been almost eight years since DrKelso won our very first competition, which is not a bad length of time to sustain something like this. Congratulations to all our winners since then, commiserations if you never quite got your nose in front; there will be fewer chances to break your duck now but there will still be chances, so stay with us.</p> <p>Good luck!</p> <p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p>",
  "<p>I landed in the United States as a child. My father was waiting for us. In a nod to the local western culture, he was wearing this strange thing on his head, a cowboy hat, and not recognizing him at first, I began to cry. My father was in Wyoming \u2013 truly the wild west \u2013 on a Fulbright fellowship, and my mother and I joined him several months into his tenure. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/22/tell-us-how-you-got-here\">Tell us how you got here: share your stories of immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He loved cowboy culture: he had watched all the American westerns in Poland. We planned to return there once the fellowship ended. In fact, my parents were so sure of this that they had brought very little with them. Even prized possessions like family photographs and my grandmother\u2019s handwritten recipe book were left behind. </p> <p>We ended up staying much longer than expected. The political situation in Poland had changed for the worse in the early 1980s with the rise of nationwide strikes led by the Solidarity movement, a massive opposition movement. There was talk of Soviet intervention. My father\u2019s colleagues in Poland began to advise him against returning, as did some local folks in Wyoming. <br></p> <p>Wyoming is a small place, and my father was soon introduced to its lone member in the US House of Representatives, a fellow by the name of Dick Cheney. Cheney, a staunch anti-communist, met my father and encouraged him to defect and stay in the US. Don\u2019t worry, he said, Reagan will soon be president, and we will sort out all the immigration matters. Political asylum would be a slam dunk, he predicted. <br></p> <p>We stayed. <br></p> <p>The immigration matters, it turns out, were a bit harder to sort out than Cheney predicted. Visas for Fulbright fellowships come with strict requirements to return to one\u2019s home country for at least two years. Cheney and other prominent people made a valiant effort, but the immigration bureaucracy pushed back. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/america-acceptance-muslim-france\">America accepted me \u2013\u00a0an Algerian Muslim \u2013 in a way France never did | Melyssa Haffaf</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After several years of being out of status (we had UN refugee passports), we were granted political asylum \u2013 which we received, coincidentally, the same year as Reagan\u2019s 1986 general amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Amnesty: a word that has become politically toxic today among the Republican set, even as a Republican legend was the first to implement it \u2013 helped us to gain legal status once and for all, six years after we decided to stay. <br></p> <p>We lived for several years in small-town Wyoming before moving on to the excitement of California. As one of the few immigrant families in small-town Wyoming we stuck out like a sore thumb. But everyone wanted to help. A stranger paid our rent. In California, we were among oceans of immigrants just like us, but we were often alone. <br></p> <p>When generalized, the immigrant story is clich\u00e9. But to each individual immigrant, his or her story is extraordinary. A character in one of Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s stories, an immigrant to the United States, expresses this best when he observes that he is not the \u201conly man to seek his fortune far from home\u201d but nevertheless is \u201cbewildered by each mile\u201d he has traveled. \u201cAs ordinary as it all appears,\u201d he says, \u201cthere are times when it is beyond my imagination.\u201d <br></p> <p>My father enjoyed a successful career as a chemist in California, and this year was the recipient of a major award from the American Chemical Society for his work. We all attended the award banquet, where many of the honorees were immigrants or former refugees. <br></p> <p>Anyone who witnessed this event would be living in a total vacuum if they did not notice the sad irony of the heated anti-refugee, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric in our current political campaign juxtaposed with the lasting contributions that a refugee from communist Poland, a Muslim immigrant from Egypt and countless others have made to the United States through chemistry alone. <br></p> <p>Just a year ago I would have thought this a clich\u00e9 not worth repeating, but these days maybe it\u2019s important to repeat often. My brother is a successful manager in a well-regarded company. And both my younger sister and I went on to serve the United States as diplomats, and American Fulbright fellows overseas. In a twist of fate, as a US diplomat, I had to deal with cases of Fulbright scholars who wanted an exception to the \u201ctwo-year\u201d rule. <br></p> <p>All of this may seem ordinary \u2013 but it\u2019s not, and in many ways it is uniquely possible in the United States.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/23/american-dream-trailer-park-i-couldnt-be-happier\">My American dream led to a trailer park.

In another twist of fate, I ended up trying to undo some of the mess that resulted from the war that Mr Cheney had so fervently advocated in my final diplomatic assignment in Iraq. And yet I will always be grateful to him for his role in helping to make the USA my home.</p>",

It won\u2019t solve climate change, but it would reduce overfishing that has depleted a third of the world\u2019s fisheries, put the brakes on drilling and seabed mining, and galvanize action to stem the pollution that flows from the land into the sea. It\u2019s also a tangible target to rally around, although some would like to go further.</p> <p>EO Wilson, the renowned conservationist, said that we should aim for \u201cthe whole shooting match\u201d and attempt to protect almost all marine species by putting half of the world\u2019s oceans off limits. This would be done by banning fishing on the \u201chigh seas\u201d \u2013 the wide expanse of ungoverned ocean beyond the exclusive economic zones that end 200 miles from a nation\u2019s coastline. Wilson <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/half-earth/\">has advocated</a> a \u201chalf for them, half for us\u201d approach for land-based conservation too.</p> <p>The Alabaman waves aside any suggestion this would prove practically impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a pollyanna but my response is \u2018no big problem,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. </p> <p>\u201cThere are <a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/27845/20160831/stop-fishing-high-seas-lives-depend.htm\">studies</a> showing that if we were to prohibit all fishing in the open sea, then lo and behold the productivity of the territorial waters rises. There would be a dramatic increase in the fisheries and profits of individual countries. Do it now, do it as soon as you can. Put aside half of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Given that one in five fish that end up on the plate are caught illegally under current protections, Wilson\u2019s optimism for a sweeping increase in no-take areas seems misplaced. But the UN is finally edging towards addressing the question of the high seas \u2013 a festering omission from the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/depts/los/\">Law of the Sea</a> treaty signed three decades ago that clarified nations\u2019 rights along their coastlines but did little, critics contend, to conserve the oceans.</p> <p>In August, Unesco <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/world_heritage_in_the_high_seas_an_idea_whose_time_has_come/#.V80ZWpMrLBK\">put forward</a> the idea of protecting certain prized jewels of the high sea. It imagined World Heritage status for areas such as the \u201cwhite shark cafe\u201d, the only known gathering point for white sharks in the north Pacific, the Atlantis Bank, a sunken fossil island in the Indian Ocean and the Sargasso sea, a productive area of the north Atlantic where a swirling gyre provides a concentration of algae that is vital for sharks, sea turtles and fish. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve got better maps of the surface of Venus than we do of our own sea floor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More formally, talks are taking place at the UN to thrash out a conservation plan for the high seas.

There are jobs and businesses dependent not only on the industries in place but also affordable power. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just flip a switch and go from fossil-fuel-based energy to non-fossil-fuel-based energy overnight.

But even if emissions are radically cut, scientists argue that more protected areas are needed for the changes that are already in train.</p> <p>\u201cWe are locking ourselves into a future where it will be hard to take our foot off the accelerator,\u201d Laffoley said. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing now is running well ahead of what we can cope with.

  "<p>Every year, my son spends half the summer in Ukraine with my parents. He has a ritual: as soon as he wakes up, sun glaring and white-hot at 8am, he runs into the garden, straight to the cucumber plant. My mum taught him how to twist them at the stem gently, so as not to pull on the whole plant, and how to embrace the sharp ends of the prickles on his soft palms: a quick polish and the spikes come off, leaving it safe for nibbling with abandon.</p> <p>We only use one word for cucumber in Ukraine \u2013 <em>ogirky \u2013</em> which refers to them in all their forms \u2013 fresh or pickled, and whatever variety. British cucumbers (those rather watery15cm-long behemoths!) are different to the smaller, spiky kind I grew up with. As a student shopping at the Warwick University branch of Tesco, I made do, and lLuckily, now I can get more compact and flavoursome varieties in London, although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever make up for the gherkins we enjoy in Ukraine.</p> <p>Ukraine gets very hot in summer and the gherkins we get are rather dry \u2013 in a good way. They are dense, extremely fragrant and sweet. Picked while still warm, they are an absolute flavour bomb. Come early autumn, when the sun calms down a little and the cucumbers are not watered as much, they become even more intense. This is the time to start pickling. Not with vinegar, but by letting lacto bacteria do its job.</p> <p>Back in the day, when aircon wasn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s wildest dreams, Ukrainians built small kitchens close to where veg was grown, tiny brick houses where all the windows and doors could stay open to let some welcome air in to the mini preserving factories that they would become. One of the first things to pickle would be cucumbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/31/ukrainian-courgette-caviar-recipe-olia-hercules\">Olia Hercules\u2019 recipe for courgette caviar | Recipes from Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My mum and I love long-fermented gherkins \u2013 salty, strong beasts, almost olive green, the ones that make you wince, but still reach for another. (I call them \u201cnuclear\u201d gherkins.) My dad, however, loves a gentle one- or two-day ferment. <em>Malosolni ogirky</em> (literally \u201clittle-salted gherkins\u201d \u2013 those that are quickly pickled) are incredibly easy and a good introduction to fermentation. All you need is some good water (no chlorine as it kills bacteria) and organic produce (pesticides again get in the way of the process), salt, some flavourings and a maximum of two summer days. My Russian-Kazakh friend Mari, when in a rush, also uses carbonated water \u2013 extra CO2 is believed to be a catalyst for the process.</p> <p>If your kitchen is hot, the <em>malosolni</em> will be ready within 24 hours. And then ... oh my. Slightly fizzy, delicately sour, retaining freshness but with enough funk to be served with rye bread and lardo, taming the heat of a freshly downed ice-cold vodka shot. This is a classic I\u2019m giving you here. But I have also gone further than that. Add some halved chilli and garlic slices to the ferment. When ready, finely dice the gherkin and his friends. Then, alongside a small spoonful of the fizzy brine, pour it over an oyster. Because the ferment is so young, it won\u2019t kill the delicate oyster flavour. Basically, use as normal gherkins but with a fresher, funkier edge. And when the gherkins are gone, do not dump the brine. Use it as a vodka pickleback or drink it in the morning on a hangover. I grew up watching my dad do this, always bewildered \u2026 he hates the nuclear but he drinks that strong brine!</p> <h2><strong>Quick-fermented cucumbers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Makes 1 x 3 litre jar</strong><br>1kg fresh <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Natoora-Ridge-Cucumber/69875011?from=search&amp;tags&amp;param=cucumbers&amp;parentContainer=SEARCHcucumbers_SHELFVIEW\">organic cucumbers</a>, the smallest ones you can find<br>20g sea salt flakes<br>1 litre mineral water<br>1 red chilli, whole but bruised with the blade of a knife<br>10 garlic cloves<br>1 tsp raw honey<br>2 sprigs of leaf celery<br>10 peppercorns (pink are good too!)<br>1-2 dill umbrellas or some bruised dill stalks<br>Horseradish leaves, if available<br>Blackcurrant leaves, if available</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Sterilise your jar and a muslin cloth.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Prepare the cucumbers by cutting them into the sizes and shapes you like. You can also leave them whole.</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>To make the brine, dissolve the salt in the water. You may need to help things along by heating it slightly. (If you do this, add the herbs and spices too to infuse.) Leave the brine to cool down to room temperature.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Now, pack the cucumbers, chilli, garlic, honey, celery, peppercorns, dill and leaves into the jar and cover with brine. If the cucumbers bob up at the top, cover them with the sterilised muslin and weigh it down with something. Sometimes I just wedge a couple of celery sticks across the neck of the jar to keep them under the brine.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Leave in a warm place in your kitchen for at least 24 hours. Check the next day \u2013 if you see bubbles on the surface you are in luck. Take one pickled cucumber piece out with a sterilised fork to check. It should be pleasantly sour. If they don\u2019t taste too different, give them another day. If the weather is cool, you may need three days.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> When you are happy with the result and you don\u2019t want them to become stronger, pop them into the fridge to slow down the fermentation process. If you like some funk in your life, leave them for another few days.</p> <p>Note: You shouldn\u2019t have any problems in terms of infections. But if you see any blue growth, just take it off with a spoon carefully. Things are bad if you get slime in your brine, but this should not happen in such a short period of time. Just make sure you sterilise the jar properly.</p> <ul> <li><em>Olia Hercules is a chef, food writer and regular contributor to Cook.

Almost every BME student I\u2019ve met at Oxford has a story about how a tutor has been racist towards them in some way. </p> <p>I see cultural appropriation all the time. It seems to be a particular issue when it comes to fancy dress; I\u2019ve been to a \u201890s-themed party where people came dressed as \u201cterrorists\u201d, complete with turbans, toy guns and brown face paint. Another time, at a house party, someone came as Kanye West \u2013 with black face paint on. I think the majority of people who culturally appropriate are just ignorant, and don\u2019t realise the wider implications of their actions. But there are definitely people who do it to make a point about political correctness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fc439388167af104c31c5f7769e5de0ebf2ed5f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc439388167af104c31c5f7769e5de0ebf2ed5f5/40_0_360_360/360.jpg\" alt=\"Pooja Kawa\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Inequalities are rooted in a very long history\u2019<br></h2> <p><em><strong>Pooja Kawa is studying for a master\u2019s in world history at Kings College London</strong></em></p> <p>My previous university was very Eurocentric \u2013 there wasn\u2019t any non-European history until the third year of my degree. But when I finally started studying it, I realised that there was so much about imperial history I didn\u2019t know, right down to my own family\u2019s roots in India. I was interested in the relationships that Britain had across the world, and it amazed me how they are still reflected in international politics and representations of different countries.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s purely British or purely European \u2013 particularly in the past few centuries. We need to make the effort to find the links to the non-Western world. I don\u2019t think lecturers are to blame \u2013 they\u2019re allowed to have their own historical focuses \u2013 but universities don\u2019t employ as many world historians as they should.</p> <p>I\u2019m studying colonial African medical history at the moment. In the colonial period, people, systems and beliefs from the continent were all pushed into the same category of \u201cAfrican\u201d rather than acknowledging the huge differences between them. One of the things I\u2019ve been working on is trying to split colonial Africa into constituent parts, which helps to restore specific histories. Colonial visions of Africa can bleed into public life and culture \u2013 so these things really do matter.<br></p> <p>Inequalities don\u2019t appear out of nowhere. Whether it\u2019s race or gender or something else, they\u2019re rooted in a very long history, and postcolonialism can help people understand this. It\u2019s also good to get a sense of the broader picture \u2013 European powers and the colonies had a reciprocal relationship based on exchange, for example in medical knowledge. To me, postcolonialism challenges Eurocentricity which, in an increasingly connected world, is paramount.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4dda552b0b2d8adb9b5d5551750029e241164c3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dda552b0b2d8adb9b5d5551750029e241164c3c/0_1_262_262/262.jpg\" alt=\"Mostafa Rajaai\" width=\"262\" height=\"262\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mostafa Rajaai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mostafa Rajaai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Britain still holds the power\u2019<br></h2> <p><em><strong>Mostafa Rajaai is international students officer at the National Union of Students</strong></em></p> <p>For many British students, it can be surprising to discover how hard it is for their non-British counterparts to get a visa to study here. To qualify for it, you need thousands of pounds, NHS fees and proof that you intend to leave as soon as you finish your degree. The process is strict and expensive. But in spite of this, the quality of life, security, opportunities and good education system still make the UK an attractive place to move to.</p> <p>The question is, why are all of these qualities concentrated in the UK, but so desperately lacking in the former colonies? One of the many legacies of the empire is the ex-colonies being stripped of much of their wealth, while ex-colonisers have become increasingly prosperous. Britain protects its wealth from those who have paid the price for it. For students and many other migrants, it\u2019s still Britain that holds the power.<br></p> <p>Borders are not the only barrier that international students have to overcome when studying in Britain. The often Eurocentric curricula, the lack of recognition for many non-English resources and deeply entrenched racism are still issues that plague universities. But acknowledging their roots is an important first step. Colonialism has played an integral role in the development of many of these problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"090510e0f1b5851b1beaae9ea11ca7c00ea0f4e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/090510e0f1b5851b1beaae9ea11ca7c00ea0f4e3/163_0_2136_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katarzyna Kubin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Hold institutions accountable for their pasts\u2019</h2> <p><strong><em>Katarzyna Kubin is a PhD candidate at SOAS University of London </em><br></strong></p> <p>The colonial past is ever-present in our lives; it\u2019s difficult to imagine how it could be undone or wiped away. It\u2019s not always as simple as just removing one single object or artefact. At the same time, there is a pressing need to counteract the inequalities that are rooted in colonialism. Is it possible to fully cleanse institutions of their colonial past? What would that look like?</p> <p>Rather than wiping them clean, we must hold institutions to account for their pasts. This will require honesty and openness about the implications of colonial history.

He needs to let the committee continue its work.\u201d <br></p> <p>The committee is due to question the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, from 3.30pm.</p> <p>The BBC reported that committee members would give Vaz 24 hours to \u201creflect on his position\u201d before he faces a possible no confidence vote.</p> <p>A senior member of the committee told the BBC that Vaz would be given the opportunity to \u201cjustify himself\u201d, adding that he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d Vaz would at least stand aside on a temporary basis.</p> <p>On Monday, Theresa May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/theresa-may-speaks-out-over-keith-vaz-reports\">increased the pressure</a> on Vaz by calling for MPs to maintain the public\u2019s confidence in them or consider their positions.</p> <p>Speaking at the G20 summit in China, the prime minister said: \u201cWhat has been clear throughout my political career, and what is important for people, is that they feel they are able to have confidence in their politicians, and that is what we have a duty to apply for those who elect us.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Keith does is for Keith and any decisions he wishes to make are for him. But overall, what people want is confidence in their politicians.\u201d</p> <p>The Sunday Mirror reported that Vaz had paid for the services of male prostitutes and had asked one of them to bring along poppers, a sex-enhancing drug that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/22/poppers-alkyl-nitrites-drug-escapes-ban-on-legal-highs\">government nearly banned</a> earlier this year. </p> <p>Vaz has apologised to his family, but condemned the tactics of the newspaper reporters. <br></p> <p>On Monday, he appeared in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons\">House of Commons</a> chamber to take part in questions to the home secretary, Amber Rudd. He welcomed Rudd to her role and asked about terrorist suspects who had fled Britain while on police bail to join Islamic State. Vaz made no mention of the newspaper reports.</p> <p>The MP for Leicester East could face an investigation by the commissioner for standards over the newspaper claims. It was alleged that he met male eastern European sex workers at a flat he owns in north London. According to the paper, Vaz asked one of the men in a text message sent before the encounter to bring poppers.</p> <p>Vaz had argued in parliament that poppers should not be included in a list of substances banned by the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act. In the Sunday Mirror, he is quoted as telling the escorts that he did not use poppers himself.</p> <p>Vaz reportedly told the men that his name was Jim and he was a washing machine salesman. He was quoted discussing with the men the possibility of obtaining cocaine for the next time they met, although Vaz reportedly said he would not want to take the drug himself.</p> <p>Following claims by Vaz\u2019s friends that the MP may have been drugged during the sting, the Daily Mirror released new details on Monday night of the alleged encounter, which the paper claims was the second meeting between Vaz and the two sex workers. It included a transcript of him allegedly ordering them to take up sexual positions. The Mirror claims it is proof that he was in control of the situation.</p>",
  "<p>At the Softex refugee camp in northern Greece, it is lighter by night than it is by day. Inside this windowless former warehouse, the lamps only work in the evenings. That is partly because the place was not designed to house people.

Attempting to stem the flow into Europe, politicians have established <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-deal-turkey-migrants-refugees-q-and-a\">a deportation deal with Turkey</a>, from where most Europe-bound migrants depart, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/balkans-refugee-route-closed-say-european-leaders\">built fences</a> throughout the Balkans, trapping about 50,000 people in Greece. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/tens-of-thousands-migrate-through-balkans-since-route-declared-shut\">Some still smuggle themselves north</a>.

Refugees have been here since the border shut in May, forcing the cash-strapped Greek authorities to hastily house people in whatever spaces they could find. Several hundred have now smuggled their way north, but about a thousand are still left. Most of them live in tents inside the gloomy warehouse. The rest sleep outside, a few hundred metres from a grim row of burnt-out trains and factory chimneys.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re suffering, emotionally \u2013 we\u2019re not good,\u201d says Mohammad Mohammad, a 30-year-old taxi driver whose wife and children are under siege in a Damascus suburb. Mohammad came to Greece in February, hoping he could make his way to Germany, claim asylum, and then apply for his family to join him. Instead, the border shut before he could leave \u2013 meaning that he must pay a smuggler to take him north, or wait for the EU relocation programme to assign him a permanent place elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>But as so many stuck in Greece point out, relocation is not working properly \u2013 with just 5,100 places made available in the space of nearly 12 months. \u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says Mohammad. \u201cAt this rate, they\u2019ll need 10 years to get it finished. But if we\u2019re here for another month, we\u2019ll be in a mental asylum.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/greece/giv-31075CK6XCQ45Xfpp/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/greece/giv-31075CK6XCQ45Xfpp/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>It is a familiar sentiment. Interviewees consistently said that the limbo they are trapped in \u2013 which has left them far from loved ones, without access to work and education, and without any clarity on their future \u2013 has led to a wave of depression and mental health problems.</p> <p>Abouni, 17, is at Softex without his parents and sister, who are still under siege in Aleppo. As a minor, Abouni hoped to apply for family reunification after being granted asylum. Instead he is likely to turn 18 before that can happen, and he says the anxiety of the situation has led to him being taken to hospital four times with panic attacks. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes I feel so angry that I can\u2019t breathe, and then I fall unconscious,\u201d says Abouni, who asked to be referred to by a pseudonym to avoid being stigmatised at the camp. \u201cI have family in Syria under the bombs, and when I talk to my little sister on the phone, she asks if she\u2019ll ever see me again. I\u2019m stuck here in this jail.\u201d</p> <p>At the Vasilika camp outside Thessaloniki, one of seven visited recently by the Guardian, the warehouse is brighter than at Softex but the despair is the same. Hisham worked as a medic for an international aid group for 10 years in Syria but now finds himself as its beneficiary rather than its employee. The work he did in Syria still haunts him, with the images of dead bodies flashing before him as he tries to sleep at night.</p> <p>\u201cFor years I saw people getting killed in Syria, and then you\u2019re here for six months without knowing what\u2019s going on, and I cannot sleep,\u201d says Hisham. \u201cWhat happened in Syria is playing every night like a film in front of my eyes. Psychologically, I need a doctor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9498dfc75f08148a0b3cfa9c3fe5156a408e5326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9498dfc75f08148a0b3cfa9c3fe5156a408e5326/0_80_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hendiya Asseni with her husband Badreddine their son Mohammad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hendiya Asseni with her husband Badreddine and their son Mohammad.

Aid groups like the Red Cross are present during working hours at most camps, but the services they can provide are limited. In serious cases, ambulances sometimes take too long to arrive. At Softex, Hendiya Asseni\u2019s husband, a 71-year-old former civil servant, had his fifth stroke. Asseni said the ambulance took more than an hour to arrive. When he finally reached hospital, the doctors said he was too weak to live in a tent. But their advice was ignored, and he was still taken back to the camp a few days later.</p> <p>Medicine is also scarce. At Vasilika camp, Mohammad Ibrahim, 10, has a blood disorder known as thalassaemia, a condition his sisters died from. The Greek government pays for Mohammad\u2019s blood to be transfused once a month, but they cannot supply the medicine he needs. His existing supply, his brother Rezan says, \u201cwill run out in about two weeks. And the hospital says they don\u2019t have any more.\u201d</p> <p>To add to all this, no one feels safe. The camps are nominally run by the army and patrolled by the police. But officers usually leave at night, and by day their presence is often light. Like in any population of 50,000 people, this has allowed a small minority of refugees in some camps to form gangs. According to testimonies from both refugees and aid workers, these gangs have sometimes robbed and attacked other asylum seekers, abused women, and forced others into prostitution.</p> <p>Maria Diakopoulou helps run a programme that moves some of the camps\u2019 most vulnerable residents into private accommodation in Thessaloniki. One woman Diakopoulou helped \u201cwas taken by the leader of the mafia in the camp, badly beaten, and was then made to have sex with people in the camp. The [gang leader] took the money.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian is aware of other alleged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/child-refugees-sexually-assaulted-at-official-greek-camps\">cases of sexual abuse</a>, including ones committed by non-refugees, but has agreed not to publish details in order to preserve the anonymity of the victims.

Each time Hassan was caught, he says, \u201cand my smuggler ate all my money\u201d. He had no means of moving on \u2013 and no means of staying put.

But then when our families stop sending us money, we have to come here full-time.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest desperation can be found on the islands, where you can find the most overcrowded camps. Before the deportation deal with Turkey began, new arrivals could move quickly to the mainland. But since March, most newcomers have not been able to leave legally \u2013 while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/turkish-police-withdrawal-greece-stalls-eu-migration-pact-unhcr\">deportations have largely failed to materialise</a>. So the camps are overflowing, leading to tensions with some local residents. On the tiny island of Leros, refugee campaigners were told to leave by a mob of angry islanders, while on Chios, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53904e70-6b78-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f\">a dead rabbit</a> was left outside an activists\u2019 kitchen.</p> <p>Refugees there face an even more precarious fate.

UNHCR hopes to move 10,000 people out of the camps, and into private accommodation. Small private projects \u2013 like Maria Diakopoulou\u2019s \u2013 are also helping to integrate refugees into local households and communities.

QS, a higher education thinktank, said the referendum had added to the uncertainty undermining the UK sector but did not fully explain the downward trend.</p> <p>Of the 48 UK institutions in the top 400, 38 have dropped down the rankings this year. Cambridge slips to fourth place, and Imperial College London drops from eighth to ninth. King\u2019s College London (KCL) falls from 19 to 21, the London School of Economics (LSE) from 35 to 37, the University of Bristol from 37 to 41 and Warwick from 48 to 51.</p> <p>Four UK universities remain in the top 10 in the world: Cambridge, Oxford (unchanged at 6), University College London (still at 7) and Imperial. On the up are the University of Edinburgh, climbing from 21 to 19, and Manchester University, now ranked in the top 30.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/ng-interactive/2016/sep/05/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2016-the-table\">Top 200 universities in the world 2016 - the table</a> </p> </aside>  <p>QS said storm clouds were gathering over UK higher education. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/12/uk-scientists-dropped-from-eu-projects-because-of-post-brexit-funding-fears\">Uncertainty over research funding</a>, immigration rules, and the ability to hire and retain the top young talent from around the world seems to be damaging the reputation of the UK\u2019s higher education sector,\u201d said Ben Sowter, head of research at QS.</p> <p>The government\u2019s promise to guarantee EU funding levels for research projects signed before this year\u2019s autumn statement had helped address some of the uncertainty, but QS said more support was needed if the UK higher education sector was to retain its reputation for excellence.</p> <p>Leading US universities which benefit from substantial private funding continue to dominate the rankings, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in top spot followed by Stanford University, California, in second and Harvard third.</p> <p>Asian universities continue to make strong progress. Of the 74 Asian universities in the top 400, 68% have risen in the latest rankings. <br></p> <p>Almost three-quarters of British universities in the top 400 have seen a drop in both academic reputation and employer reputation this year, and 58% have seen a fall in the number of foreign academics.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the drop in the rankings was worrying for British universities. Echoing QS, he blamed funding and the perception that the UK was a little less open to the rest of the world than it had been in the past.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where Brexit is going to take us. We do know we have got a prime minister who for all her strengths looks like she is going to continue to have no particular soft spot for universities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>London continues to fare well, however, with more top 40 institutions than any other city in the world. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cBoasting more of the globe\u2019s top universities and welcoming the most international students, London is the higher education capital of the world and I want to make sure it stays that way.\u201d</p> <p>The QS World University Rankings are based on four categories: research, teaching, employability and internationalisation. The methodology consists of six indicators: academic reputation (40%), employer reputation (10%), faculty student ratio (20%), citations per faculty (20%), international students (5%), and international faculty (5%). <br></p> <p>In a separate report, the <a href=\"https://www.offa.org.uk/\">Office for Fair Access</a> (OFFA), the university admissions watchdog, has announced that universities will spend \u00a3833.5m in 2017-18 on schemes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/18/percentage-of-poorer-students-accepted-to-oxbridge-falls-figures-show\">improve access to higher education for under-represented groups</a>.</p> <p>The figure represents a 10% increase on last year, funded by increased tuition fees. Just under half (\u00a3408.7m) will pay for financial support including bursaries, fee waivers and accommodation discounts. The rest pays for outreach work in communities, homework clubs, summer schools, as well as pastoral support and study skills training.</p> <p>James Westhead, executive director of Teach First, which aims to address educational disadvantage, said: \u201cWhile it is welcome that universities will increase spending on widening access to higher education this year, too much of this money is spent on ineffective schemes, or as recruitment incentives for those who have already decided to apply. </p> <p>\u201cStill only a quarter of access money is spent on activities to raise attainment and aspirations in younger children, including primary age, and unless this is significantly increased we will continue to see poorer pupils struggle to reach university.\u201d</p> <p>Research from the <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\">Social Market Foundation</a> (SMF) has found that retention rates in higher education in England have barely shifted since 2009/10 and that rates for students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds remain lower than for others. </p> <p>The SMF report, Staying the Course, says just over 8% of students from low-participation areas dropped out of higher education in 2014/15, compared with just over 6% of students from other areas.</p> <p>The report identifies a group of 20 institutions where around one in 10 students are not continuing in higher education after a year, and highlights the University of Bolton, where more than one in five students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds drop out.</p> <p>Emran Mian, the report\u2019s author, said: \u201cEvery student who does not continue in higher education means a loss of potential, a bad experience for that student and poor value for the taxpayer, as the investment in tuition costs is likely to have a low return. </p> <p>\u201cThis research suggests a link between an institution\u2019s students\u2019 satisfaction and its drop-out rates. Institutions which prioritise student success are likely to see lower rates of non-continuation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Dear Friends,</p> <p>I wish to address this short statement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\">Mr Geert Wilders</a>, his acolytes, indeed to all those like him \u2013 the populists, demagogues and political fantasists. </p> <p>To them, I must be a sort of nightmare.

And I am angry, too. Because of Mr Wilder\u2019s lies and half-truths, manipulations and peddling of fear. You see, twenty years ago I served in the UN peacekeeping force during the Balkan wars \u2013 wars so cruel, so devastating, which flowed from this same factory of deceit, bigotry and ethnic nationalism.</p> <p>Geert Wilders released his grotesque eleven-point manifesto only days ago, and a month ago he spoke along similar lines in Cleveland, in the United States. I will not repeat what he has said, but there are many who will, and his party is expected to do well in the elections in March.</p> <p>And yet what Mr Wilders shares in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Mr Trump</a>, Mr Orban, Mr Zeman, Mr Hofer, Mr Fico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Madame Le Pen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Mr Farage</a>, he also shares with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Da\u2019esh</a>.<br><br>All seek in varying degrees to recover a past, halcyon and so pure in form, where sunlit fields are settled by peoples united by ethnicity or religion \u2013 living peacefully in isolation, pilots of their fate, free of crime, foreign influence and war. A past that most certainly, in reality, did not exist anywhere, ever. Europe\u2019s past, as we all know, was for centuries anything but that. </p> <p>The proposition of recovering a supposedly perfect past is fiction; its merchants are cheats. Clever cheats.</p> <p>Populists use half-truths and oversimplification - the two scalpels of the arch propagandist, and here the internet and social media are a perfect rail for them, by reducing thought into the smallest packages: sound-bites; tweets. Paint half a picture in the mind of an anxious individual, exposed as they may be to economic hardship and through the media to the horrors of terrorism. Prop this picture up by some half-truth here and there and allow the natural prejudice of people to fill in the rest. Add drama, emphasising it\u2019s all the fault of a clear-cut group, so the speakers lobbing this verbal artillery, and their followers, can feel somehow blameless.</p> <p>The formula is therefore simple: make people, already nervous, feel terrible, and then emphasize it\u2019s all because of a group, lying within, foreign and menacing. Then make your target audience feel good by offering up what is a fantasy to them, but a horrendous injustice to others. Inflame and quench, repeat many times over, until anxiety has been hardened into hatred.</p> <p>Make no mistake, I certainly do not equate the actions of nationalist demagogues with those of Da\u2019esh, which are monstrous, sickening; Da\u2019esh must be brought to justice. But in its mode of communication, its use of half-truths and oversimplification, the propaganda of Da\u2019esh uses tactics similar to those of the populists. And both sides of this equation benefit from each other \u2013 indeed would not expand in influence without each others\u2019 actions.</p> <p>The humiliating racial and religious prejudice fanned by the likes of Mr Wilders has become in some countries municipal or even national policy. We hear of accelerating discrimination in workplaces. Children are being shamed and shunned for their ethnic and religious origins \u2013 whatever their passports, they are told they are not \u201creally\u201d European, not \u201creally\u201d French, or British, or Hungarian. Entire communities are being smeared with suspicion of collusion with terrorists.</p> <p>History has perhaps taught Mr Wilders and his ilk how effectively xenophobia and bigotry can be weaponised. Communities will barricade themselves into fearful, hostile camps, with populists like them, and the extremists, as the commandants. The atmosphere will become thick with hate; at this point it can descend rapidly into colossal violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/demagogues-and-cheats-un-human-rights-chief-condemns-trump-and-wilders\">'Demagogues and cheats': UN rights chief condemns Trump and Wilders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We must pull back from this trajectory. My friends, are we doing enough to counter this cross-border bonding of demagogues? A decade ago, Geert Wilder\u2019s manifesto and Cleveland speech would have created a world-wide furore. Now? Now, they are met with little more than a shrug, and, outside the Netherlands, his words and pernicious plans were barely noticed. Are we going to continue to stand by and watch this banalisation of bigotry, until it reaches its logical conclusion? <br><br>Ultimately, it is the law that will safeguard our societies \u2013 human rights law, binding law which is the distillation of human experience, of generations of human suffering, the screams of the victims of past crimes and hate. We must guard this law passionately, and be guided by it.</p> <p>Do not, my friends, be led by the deceiver. It is only by pursuing the entire truth, and acting wisely, that humanity can ever survive. So draw the line and speak. Speak out and up, speak the truth and do so compassionately, speak for your children, for those you care about, for the rights of all, and be sure to say clearly: stop!

  "<p>Leading British universities are considering opening campuses in Europe in order to keep crucial research funding and partnerships, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/11/referendum-academic-research-universities-eu-students-brexit\">uncertainty</a> over the consequences of the UK leaving the EU. The idea, which is already proving controversial among university heads, comes as universities wrestle with how to reassure students and academics across the world that they will not close their doors to Europe.</p> <p>Universities are playing their cards close to their chests, and it is not yet clear where they intend to set up overseas operations. Senior figures say that although these campuses would probably take students, the main motivation would be research money.</p> <p>Cardiff University is re-examining its strategy after the EU referendum result, and its vice-chancellor, Colin Riordan, says a new campus will be one of the items up for discussion. \u201cI know there are universities who are thinking about setting up campuses in Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve considered it before because of visa restrictions and so on, but the critical thing is thinking it through. The world is littered with universities setting up new campuses and getting their fingers burned. If you are going down that route you have to be clear about the risks are and how you mitigate them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stakes are certainly high. Cardiff is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, which together received more than \u00a3500m in EU research grants in 2014-15. The Treasury has guaranteed research awards from the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme, an \u20ac80bn (\u00a369bn) pot for science and innovation, but vice-chancellors remain anxious about funding. They are also worried about whether scientists will be able to move freely across borders.</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, also in the Russell Group, says: \u201cWe are thinking: \u2018Do we need a presence in another European country?\u2019 Right now this is talk over the coffee cups. We\u2019ve never been in favour of campuses elsewhere, and there are legal issues that might put us off. But we want to support our research base.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way the core point is not the money. What really matters in modern science is the collaboration. We would be damaging ourselves if we weren\u2019t making it as easy as possible to work with those we collaborate with most.\u201d</p> <p>Opening a university branch abroad is expensive. Nottingham University\u2019s award-winning campus in Ningbo, China, is one success story. But there have been high-profile failures. University College London announced last year that it would be closing its campus in Adelaide, Australia, and in 2013 the University of East London closed its campus in Cyprus after six months because of low student numbers.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says universities should not rush into something they might regret. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Brexit means yet. And if you were proposing a campus to get tens of millions of research funding you\u2019d need a very serious presence. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d sign that off as a governor, especially when there are examples of campuses going wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Nancy Rothwell, vice-chancellor of Manchester University, agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t see the logic of having a European campus. I don\u2019t see the value. Who would pay the running costs? Within the university I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to reassure staff and students who were upset and feeling unwelcome that, for the foreseeable future, nothing has changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5d82f2e45b0483fe2bddf8dac2ac233c62977fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d82f2e45b0483fe2bddf8dac2ac233c62977fb/0_177_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"students dancing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">De Monfort University students dance with refugees during a visit to Berlin.e</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shocked by a referendum result they weren\u2019t expecting, many university chiefs say now is a time for taking stock and quiet lobbying behind the scenes. But Prof Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, Leicester, vehemently disagrees. Last week he was in Berlin, the fifth stop on a campaigning tour of Europe designed to persuade prospective students, parents and overseas media that his university is not giving up on the European dream.</p> <p>\u201cAt every venue on this tour there has been a sharp intake of breath when I start speaking openly about Brexit,\u201d Shellard says. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe I\u2019m addressing it. All the diplomats are very interested in what we are doing as no one else has gone out yet because there is so much uncertainty and they don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d He tells them that most 18- to 24-year-olds voted to stay in and that \u201cin my university there is a feeling of some desolation. People are worried about the UK becoming very insular. And they are horrified about the episodes of hate crime.\u201d</p> <p>Shellard realised he needed to act after a meeting of staff and students on the morning of the referendum result. He expected 50 people \u2013 but 850 turned up. There was a lot of confusion. A Polish student was going home that weekend and asked for a letter from Shellard so he could get back into the UK.</p> <p>This confusion has been mirrored in Europe. In Warsaw, Shellard shared the stage with two Polish students from his university, and the local media asked them whether they had been asked to leave the UK. \u201cThe students were pretty taken aback,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to the university, non-UK EU student applications are up 30% at De Montfort this year \u2013 from 2,260 in 2015\u201116 to 3,166 in 2016-17. Shellard thinks this is in part because he was on the ground talking to parents and students about their anxieties about what might await them in the UK after the leave vote, before they changed their minds about coming. But like all vice-chancellors he is worried about the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/brexit-vote-cost-uk-universities-tens-millions-student-fees-ucl\">Brexit vote 'could cost UK universities tens of millions in student fees'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>European students applying to study in the UK this academic year are still eligible for student loans, but there are no guarantees for students applying after 2016-17. Coventry University has pledged to counter this by keeping fees for non-UK EU students at the same level as home students for five years.</p> <p>Prof Ian Marshall, the university\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor, says: \u201cWe have over 1,000 EU students this year, so for us Brexit is a major thing. As soon as we talked to students after the referendum they were worried that fees would jump up. Given all the uncertainty, you want to put as much certainty into the situation as you can.\u201d</p> <p>Coventry\u2019s move has angered competing vice-chancellors. One, who asked not to be named, says: \u201cThey\u2019ve done it for political reasons, and I understand that, but it is foolish to commit to treating French or Spanish students one way and Chinese or Australian students another when we have left the EU.\u201d</p> <p>But most vice-chancellors admit that after Brexit, fees for EU students will have to rise in line with international student fees.

Labour still does well in big cities such as London, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester, but flounders in the south and east of England. The party may also be losing its hold on its old industrial heartlands, and in Scotland it looks headed for extinction. Labour\u2019s poll ratings have been stuck in the same lowly place since before 2010.</p> <p>This is not fundamentally about the party\u2019s current internal strife. Labour is engulfed by the same crisis facing its sister parties in Europe. Political commentary tends to focus on politicians, and describe the world as if parties can be pulled here and there by the sheer will of powerful individuals. But Labour\u2019s problems are systemic, rooted in the deepest structures of the economy and society. The left\u2019s basic ideals of equality, solidarity and a protected public realm should be ageless. But everything on which it once built its strength has either disappeared, or is shrinking fast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that one single party or ideology can represent a majority of people is looking like a relic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The western left faces three grave challenges, which strike at the heart of its historic sense of what it is and who it speaks for. First, traditional work \u2013 and the left\u2019s sacred notion of \u201cthe worker\u201d \u2013 is fading, as people struggle through a new era of temporary jobs and rising self-employment, which may soon be succeeded by a drastic new age of automation. Second, there is a new wave of opposition to globalisation, led by forces on the right, which emphasise place and belonging, and a mistrust of outsiders. And all the time, politics rapidly fragments, which leaves the idea that one single party or ideology can represent a majority of people looking like a relic. The 20th century, in other words, really is over.<strong> </strong>Whether the left can return to meaningful power in the 21st is a question currently surrounded by a profound sense of doubt.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>On the morning of May 8 2005, </strong>Tony Blair stood on the steps of Downing Street, after an unprecedented third consecutive Labour election victory. On the face of it, this provided proof of Labour\u2019s newfound dominance, and another occasion for union jacks, talk of a new dawn, and the same blithe optimism that had carried Blair to power in 1997. But this time he took a much more hard-headed stance. Labour had just been been re-elected on 35.2% of the vote, with the support of only 22% of the electorate. The first-past-the-post system had worked its strange magic and taken the party back into government \u2013 but on the lowest figures for any government in the democratic age.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/sep/23/does-the-left-have-a-future-podcast\">Does the left have a future? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That day, Blair seemed contrite. \u201cI\u2019ve listened and I\u2019ve learned, and I think I\u2019ve a very clear idea what the people now expect from the government in a third term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to say to them very directly that I, we, the government, are going to focus relentlessly now on the priorities that people have set for us.\u201d He spoke of the idea that \u201clife is still a real struggle for many people\u201d, and devoted one section of his speech to rising public angst about immigration.</p> <p>Five months later, Blair made his 12th annual conference speech as party leader, and all traces of humility had vanished. His essential message reflected one of the key strands of his political theology: the mercurial magic of modern capitalism, and his mission to toughen up the country in response to the endless challenges of the free market. \u201cChange is marching on again,\u201d he announced, in that messianic tone that had begun to emerge in his speeches around the time of 9/11. \u201cThe pace of change can either overwhelm us, or make our lives better and our country stronger,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is pretend it is not happening. I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer.\u201d</p> <p>His next passage was positively evangelistic. \u201cThe character of this changing world is indifferent to tradition. Unforgiving of frailty. No respecter of past reputations. It has no custom and practice. It is replete with opportunities, but they only go to those swift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">The Podemos revolution: how a small group of radical academics changed European politics | Giles Tremlett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I watched that speech on a huge screen in the conference exhibition area. And I recall thinking: \u201cMost people are not like that.\u201d The words rattled around my head: \u201cSwift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change.\u201d And I wondered that if these were the qualities now demanded of millions of Britons, what would happen if they failed the test?</p> <p>Listening to Blair describe his vision of the future \u2013 in which one\u2019s duty was to get as educated as possible, before working like hell and frantically trying not to sink \u2013 I was struck by two things. First, the complete absence of any empathetic, human element (he mentioned the balance between life and work, but could only offer \u201caffordable, wraparound childcare between the hours of 8am-6pm for all who need it\u201d), and second, the sense that more than ever, I had no understanding of what values the modern Labour party stood for.</p> <p>If modern capitalism was now a byword for insecurity and inequality, Labour\u2019s response increasingly sounded like a Darwinian demand for people to accept that change, and do their best to ensure that they kept up. Worse still, those exacting demands were being made by a new clique of Labour politicians who were culturally distant from their supposed \u201ccore\u201d voters, and fatally unaware of their rising disaffection.</p> <p>In 2010, under Gordon Brown\u2019s butter-fingered leadership, Labour fell to a miserable 29% of the vote \u2013 its lowest share since 1983, when it came within a whisker of finishing third. Five years later, despite opinion polls suggesting a possible Labour win, Ed Miliband could only raise Labour\u2019s vote share by a single percentage point.</p> <p>If the party hoped to reassemble the electoral coalition that had just about held together through the second half of the 20th century, the world that gave rise to it had clearly gone. Trade union membership was at an all-time low, heavy industry had disappeared, and traditional class consciousness had waned.</p> <p>As those foundations crumbled, so did the party\u2019s old nostrums of nationalisation and redistribution. In their place, and in unbelievably favourable circumstances that veiled Labour\u2019s underlying weaknesses \u2013 a long economic boom, and a Conservative party incapable of coherence, let alone power \u2013 Blair and Brown had come up with a thin social democracy that stoked the risk-taking of the City and used the proceeds to spend huge amounts of money on public services. But the financial crisis had put an end to that model as well.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as deindustrialisation ripped through 20th-century economies, the instability and fragmentation embodied by the financial and service sectors was taken to its logical conclusion by new digital businesses. In turn, the latter have spawned what some now call \u201cplatform capitalism\u201d: a model whereby goods, services and labour can be rapidly exchanged between people, companies and multinational corporations \u2013 think of Uber, eBay, Airbnb or TaskRabbit, which link up freelance workers with people who need help with such tasks as cleaning, deliveries or moving home \u2013 with little need for any intermediate organisations. This has not only marginalised retailers and wholesalers. It calls into question the traditional role of trade unions, and further reduces the power of the state, which is now locked into a pattern where innovations take rapid flight and it cannot keep up.<strong> </strong></p> <p>In retrospect, the left\u2019s halcyon era was based on a straightforward project. When the archetypal factory gates swung open, out came thousands of men \u2013 and by and large, they were men \u2013 united by an unchanging daily experience, and ready to support a political force that would use the unions, the state, and the fabled \u201cmass party\u201d to create a new, much fairer world in their monolithic image.</p> <p>Now, an atomising, quicksilver economy bypasses those structures, and has fragmented people and places so thoroughly that assembling meaningful political coalitions has begun to appear almost impossible. These are the social and political conditions that define relatively prosperous places such as the commuter towns of Surrey, or Essex, the centres of the knowledge economy to be found around Cambridge, and the gleaming new town of Livingston in Scotland. And in a very different way, these new conditions can be experienced just as powerfully in the tracts of the UK that modernity seems to have left behind.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In the spring of 2013,</strong> a couple of days after the death of Margaret Thatcher, the Guardian dispatched me to the post-industrial south Wales town of Merthyr Tydfil, to talk to people about the legacy of her time in power. I had been there many times before, and always beheld a place in which Labour\u2019s decline was not a matter of symbolism and metaphor, but something to be directly experienced.</p> <p>Essentially, it is a place defined by absences: of the coal and steel industries, and the huge Hoover factory that closed in 2009 \u2013 but more generally, of the ideas and institutions that once defined the Labour party and the wider Labour movement. Between 1900 and 1915, Merthyr was represented in the House of Commons by Keir Hardie, Labour\u2019s first leader and founding icon. In 1997, the party received an astonishing 77% of the vote in the town. But by 2010, that figure had crashed to 44%, as local politics belatedly reflected a lingering sense of dismay and loss that dated back to the defeat of the miners\u2019 strike in 1985.</p> <p>As I drove into town, I clocked an EE call centre, which pays its customer services operatives around \u00a316,000 a year. Outside the town\u2019s vast Tesco, I spoke to two retired men, who understood what had happened to Merthyr as a kind of offence to their basic values. In the past, one of them told me, \u201ca man wanted to be a working man: he didn\u2019t want to be in here, stacking shelves\u201d.<strong> </strong>When I asked him about the legacy of the miners\u2019 strike, what he said was full of pathos and tragedy. \u201cThirty years ago, whatever \u2026 it\u2019s still embedded in us down here, he said. \u201cWe still talk about it every day: what might have happened if it had gone the other way.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One in seven Britons is now self-employed. In the US, it is predicted, 50% of people will be partly freelance by 2020</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the town centre, I then met an 18-year-old who was finding it impossible to get a job. \u201cI\u2019ve applied and applied, and it\u2019s all been declined,\u201d she said. She wondered whether there was something wrong with her CV: the idea that there were perhaps larger forces to blame for her predicament did not enter the conversation. I wondered, did she know what a trade union was? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>One in seven Britons is now self-employed. In the US, Forbes magazine has predicted that by 2020, 50% of people will at least partly work on a freelance basis. In 2015, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that since 1995, \u201cnon-standard\u201d jobs \u2013 which is to say, temporary, part-time or self-employed positions \u2013 accounted for the whole of net jobs growth in the UK since 1995.</p> <p>Such is the rise of the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d. Economists and sociologists talk about \u201cthe precariat\u201d, a growing part of the population for whom work is not the basis of personal identity, but an on-off part of life from which they often need protection. Some of this, of course, is down to the venality and greed of businesses. But the central momentum behind it is rooted in technology, and what Marxists would call the \u201cmode of production\u201d. In a world in which businesses can survey their order books on an hourly basis and temporarily hire staff at the touch of a button, why would they base their arrangements on agreements that last for years?</p> <p>Merthyr is still said to be a Labour heartland. But like so many other places, it is brimming with a sense of a politics now hopelessly out of time: older people whose sense of a meaningful Labour identity is tangled up in an increasingly distant past, and younger residents who know nothing of any of this, and have little sense of the relevance of politics to their lives. In Merthyr, 56% of voters supported Brexit; at the Welsh assembly elections of 2016, Ukip won 20% of the local vote. In such places, the sense of Labour\u2019s fall is palpable<strong>.</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Go to any traditional Labour area,</strong> and people will tell you that Labour was once \u201cthe party of the working man\u201d. Even now, from its name onwards, this reductive understanding of Labour, its people and its essential mission still runs deep, not least within the party itself. In place of \u201cthe working man\u201d, the New Labour years ushered in a politics pitched at \u201chard-working families\u201d, a term partly intended to reflect people\u2019s increasing antipathy towards people on benefits. Even when it was advocating enhancements to childcare and pre-school provision, Labour tended to do so in terms of getting new mothers back into paid employment as soon as possible.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Labour party has not shed these outmoded ideas about the nature of work. Both Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn have sketched utopian plans to somehow magic the world back to some unspecified time before 1980. Smith wants to revive the Ministry of Labour, done away with by Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government in 1968. Corbyn\u2019s \u201c10-point plan to rebuild and transform Britain\u201d is all about \u201c<a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/work\">full employment and an economy that works for all</a>\u201d, and promises to restore \u201csecurity to the workplace\u201d. These visions are either naive or dishonest, but they reflect delusions that run throughout Labour and the left.</p> <p>In a world in which work is changing radically, modern Conservatism applauds these shifts. For clued-up Tories, it is time to rebrand as \u201cthe workers\u2019 party\u201d \u2013 in which the worker is a totem of rugged individualism, not a symbol of solidarity. For proof, read Britannia Unchained, a breathless treatise about economics and the future of Britain co-authored by five Tory MPs who entered parliament in 2010: Kwasi Kwarteng, the new international development secretary Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss, who Theresa May appointed justice secretary in her first reshuffle. According to Britannia Unchained, the ideal modern worker is represented by the drivers who work for the London cab company Addison Lee. These people \u201cwork on a freelance basis. They can net \u00a3600 a week in take-home pay. But they have to work for it \u2013 up to 60 hours a week.\u201d In this vision \u2013 taken to its logical conclusion by Uber \u2013 the acceptance of insecurity becomes a matter of heroism, and a new political division arises between the grafters and those \u2013 as Britannia Unchained witheringly puts it \u2013 \u201cwho enjoy public subsidies\u201d. In other words, the \u201cskivers\u201d versus the \u201cstrivers\u201d.</p> <p>Blair tried to lead New Labour in this direction, but his attempts always jarred against his party\u2019s ingrained support for the traditional welfare state and its attachment to increasingly old-fashioned ideas of secure employment. But in the context of the modern labour market, lionising work for its own sake will never bolster support for a politics built on those values. Instead, it may push people to the right.</p> <p>People who work, after all, are no longer part of a monolithic mass: many increasingly think of themselves as lone agents, competing with others in much the same way that companies and corporations do. In the build-up to the 2015 election, I saw vivid proof of how fundamentally this erodes the left\u2019s old understanding of its bond with its supporters.</p> <p>In Plymouth, I watched a woman answer the door to a Labour canvasser with the words: \u201cI\u2019m a grafter \u2013 you ain\u2019t doing nothing for me.\u201d I spoke to a man in the north-eastern steeltown of Redcar who told me he would never vote Labour \u201cbecause I work\u201d. In the bellwether seat of Nuneaton, two women told me that Ed Miliband would probably win the election because \u201call the people on benefits\u201d were going to vote for him. As these people saw it, Labour was no longer the \u201cparty of work\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People on the left should be thinking about extending maternity and paternity leave and reviving adult education</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a hell of a knot to untangle. But for the left, a solution might begin with the understanding of an epochal shift that pushed politics beyond the workplace and the economy into the sphere of private life \u2013 a transition first articulated by feminism, with the assertion that \u201cthe personal is political\u201d.</p> <p>Belatedly building this insight into left politics does not entail a move away from the kind of regulation and intervention that might make modern working lives much more bearable, nor from the idea that government might foster more rewarding and useful work, chiefly via investment and education.</p> <p>But beyond the old gospel of hard graft and the dignity of labour, any modern centre-left politics has to surely speak powerfully to elements of people\u2019s lives \u2013 as citizens, carers, friends and parents \u2013 which it has long underplayed, and for which the incessant demands of modern capitalism leave little room. People on the left should be thinking about extending maternity and paternity leave and allowing its reprise when children are older; reviving adult education (often for its own sake, not just in terms of \u201creskilling\u201d); assisting people in the creation of neighbourhood support networks that might belatedly answer the decline of the extended family; and, most obviously, enabling people to shorten their working week \u2013 think about a three-day weekend, and you begin to get a flavour of the left politics of the future.</p> <p>The deep changes wrought by our ageing society will anyway begin to increase the numbers of people beyond working age, and accelerate the shift away from paid work towards caring.<strong> </strong>But the most radical shift will be caused by automation<strong> </strong>and its effects on employment. If the Bank of England now reckons that as many as 15m British jobs are under threat from technology, and if a third of jobs in the retail sector are predicted to disappear by 2025, does the myopic, often macho rhetoric of work and the worker really articulate any meaningful vision?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0068c92d7742e2b005cd14e8c3ec2b6c765a6eff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0068c92d7742e2b005cd14e8c3ec2b6c765a6eff/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Matt Chase\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Matt Chase</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Matt Chase</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The left naturally embraced</strong> the mantra of the Occupy movement \u2013 the glaring division between the super rich and the rest of us embodied by the slogan \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. Objectively, the idea of a division between a tiny, light-footed international elite and everybody else holds true. But in everyday life, this division finds little expression.</p> <p>Instead, the rising inequality fostered by globalisation and free-market economics manifests itself in a cultural gap that is tearing the left\u2019s traditional constituency in two. Once, social democracy \u2013 or, if you prefer, democratic socialism \u2013 was built on the support of both the progressive middle class and the parts of the working class who were represented by the unions. Now, a comfortable, culturally confident constituency seems to stare in bafflement at an increasingly resentful part of the traditionally Labour-supporting working class.</p> <p>The first group has an internationalised culture, a belief in what the modern vernacular calls diversity, and the confidence that comes with education and relative affluence. It can apparently cope with its version of job insecurity (think the freelance software developer, rather than the warehouse worker on a zero-hours contract). But on the other side are people who have a much more negative view of globalisation and modernity \u2013 and in particular, the large-scale movement of people. In the UK, they tend to live in the places that have largely voted Labour but supported leaving the EU, and whose loudest response to globalisation is to re-embrace precisely the \u201ccustom and practice\u201d, as Blair put it, that modern economies tend to squash: to emphasise place and belonging, and assert an essentially defensive national identity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does anyone on the left want to write off the working-class voters who chose Brexit as a mass of bigots and racists?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From a sympathetic perspective, to put out a flag can be a gesture way beyond mere jingoism. It often stands as an assertion of esteem \u2013 and collective esteem, at that \u2013 in an insecure, unstable world that frequently seems to deny people any at all. Those who were once coalminers or steelworkers may now be temporarily-employed \u201coperatives\u201d waiting for word of that week\u2019s working hours.<strong> </strong>In a cultural sense, by contrast, national identity offers people at least some prospect of regaining a sense of who they are, and why that represents something important. Even when it comes to resentments around immigration, a nuanced, empathetic understanding should not be beyond anyone\u2019s grasp: people can be disorientated by rapid population change and anxious to assert a sense of place without such feelings turning hateful.</p> <p>There is also a much nastier side to all this \u2013 a surge in racism, which has happened all over Europe, and appears to have been given grim licence by the Brexit vote. Even so, does anyone on the left want to write off the 3.8m people who voted for Ukip in 2012 \u2013 or the even larger number of working-class voters who chose Brexit \u2013 as a mass of bigots and racists? Even in its most unpleasant manifestations, most prejudice has a wider context, and it is clear that these modern antipathies are most keenly felt in places that have either been left behind by modernity, or represent its most difficult elements: insecure job markets, scarce housing, overstretched public services.</p> <p>And this new mood is growing partly because of factors tangled up with the decline of the left: the demise of trade unions and the traditional workplace, which have left political vacuums now filled by another form of collective identity. A glaring example is the new politics of England and Englishness, which is as much bound up with class as it is with place, and has so far simmered away without finding a coherent expression.</p> <p>I have met enough people who have identified themselves as \u201cEnglish\u201d to know that it is usually not just a matter of national pride. It also tends to translate as a set of defiant cultural rejections, on the part of people who are not middle-class, not from London, and angry about the way that people who fit both those descriptions view the rest of the country. The UK census of 2011 was the first ever to include a question about national identity \u2013 and in England, 60% of people described themselves as English only. But the left, in Britain as much as in Europe, remains in denial about why people have taken refuge in such expressions of nationhood. This is something that applies to both so-called \u201cBlairites\u201d, and Corbyn and his supporters: one is so enraptured by globalisation that it thinks of vocal expressions of patriotism as a retrogressive block on progress; the other cleaves to a rose-tinted internationalism that regards such things as a facade for bigotry.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 2014, I spent three days</strong> in and around the Kent coast, following Ukip activists, and talking to people watching their manoeuvres. In the town of Broadstairs, a group of energetic leftwing activists \u2013 who would go on to found a thriving local branch of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum \u2013 had organised a day of campaigning against Ukip, focused on Nigel Farage\u2019s candidacy in the seat of South Thanet. I watched them debate with a man sitting on the town\u2019s seafront, who was determined to vote for Farage, and scornful of their attempts to dissuade him.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be voted in, and there\u2019s nothing you people can do about it,\u201d he said, gesturing to them with a kind of camp contempt.</p> <p>He then explained his main source of anger. His son, he said, had a speech disability, and could not find work in his chosen field of catering. \u201cNobody will give him a job. But a foreigner could come over here and speak not one word of English and they get a job.\u201d</p> <p>The truth of this was batted around for two or three minutes, before he came to his conclusion. \u201cI\u2019m brassed off,\u201d he said, and he then spoke pointedly about his own sense of insecurity. \u201cI\u2019m a working man. I\u2019ve paid all my taxes and everything. And if anything goes wrong with me or my family and I get thrown out of my house because I can\u2019t pay my mortgage, I\u2019ll get put in a bedsit.\u201d</p> <p>What, then, did he want? \u201cA better England,\u201d he said, and I could instantly sense that he had a basic set of grievances \u2013 about insecurity and unfairness \u2013 to which the political left would once have been able to confidently speak. Unfortunately, in the absence of any meaningful cultural bonds, the avowedly leftwing people to whom he was talking were residents of a completely different reality.</p> <p>Can things be any different? If left politics is not to shrink into a metropolitan shadow of itself and abandon hope of gaining national power, they have to. Indeed, if British politics is not to speed towards the kind of nasty populism taking root all over Europe and calling the shots in such countries as Poland and Hungary, this is a matter of urgency \u2013 not least because as automation takes hold, the disorientation on which the new rightwing politics feeds will only increase.</p> <p>Scotland is perhaps instructive. The Scottish National party\u2019s essential triumph has been to bond with millions of people via a modern, \u201ccivic\u201d kind of nationhood, and thereby recast a social democratic model of government in terms of identity and belonging<strong> </strong>\u2013 rather than standing on the other side of a cultural divide, as Labour now does in England. To some extent, this is a matter of clever branding, and the successive political feats pulled off by Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon: the lion\u2019s share of SNP MPs and MSPs are almost as metropolitan and media-savvy as the scions of New Labour were. But for the time being, it undoubtedly works.</p> <p>South of the border, by contrast, a key part of Labour\u2019s crisis is that it so clearly fails to speak to swaths of England \u2013 and Wales \u2013 and leaves these places open to political forces that want to sever their residual links to left politics for good. Circa 2006, it was the BNP. From around 2012 onwards, Ukip began to slowly push into Labour\u2019s old heartlands. Now, the millionaire Ukip donor Arron Banks is said to be mulling over a new party that might capitalise on the support for Brexit in working-class Labour areas and deliver them a new political identity. The stakes, then, are unbelievably high:<strong> </strong>if the left cannot speak for the people it once represented as a matter of instinct, much more malign forces will.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>If the left\u2019s predicament comes down</strong> to a single fault, it is this. It is very good at demanding change, but pretty hopeless at understanding it. Supposedly radical elements too often regard deep technological shifts as the work of greedy capitalists and rightwing politicians, and demand that they are rolled back. Meanwhile, the self-styled moderates tend to advocate large-scale surrender, instead of recognising that technological and economic changes can create new openings for left ideas. A growing estrangement from the left\u2019s traditional supporters makes these problems worse, and one side tends to cancel out the other. The result: as people experience dramatic change in their everyday lives, they form the impression that half of politics has precious little to say to them.</p> <p>In a political reality as complex as ours, there are inevitable problems for the political right as well. It is a long time since the Conservative party has spoken the visceral, populist language that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher. As with Blair in 2005, the Tories were recently elected to power with the support of less than a quarter of the electorate. Similarly, in Germany, Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats once vied with the Social Democrats for the support of a majority of the population, but they are now down to around 30%. But modern challenges for the centre-right will always be less difficult than they are for the left. The former, after all, seeks to safeguard and advance modern capitalism rather than substantially change it. Even in the absence of a broad social base, the right is sustained by big business and the conservative press, which give it huge political advantages.</p> <p>The left has responded to its crisis by looking endlessly inward \u2013 but occasionally, there are flashes of hope. There is a rising recognition, among both former followers of Blair and alumni of the traditional left, that Labour\u2019s old majoritarian dreams are probably finished \u2013 and that it should finally embrace proportional representation and build new alliances and coalitions. This change would probably trigger a split between the party\u2019s estranged left and right, and thereby bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe, where the left\u2019s crisis is highlighted by a tussle between traditional social democrats and new radicals.</p> <p>In Britain and plenty of other places, there is growing interest in the idea of a universal basic income, built on an understanding of accelerating economic changes, and their far-reaching consequences for the left\u2019s almost religious attachment to the glories of paid employment. It is early days for such a leap. But proposing that the state should meet some or all of people\u2019s basic living costs would be an implicit acknowledgement that work alone cannot possibly deliver the collective security that the left has always seen as its basic mission, and that space has to be created for the other elements of people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>Whether the left can come to terms with the new politics of national identity and belonging and thereby rein in its nastier aspects is a much more difficult question \u2013 but if it doesn\u2019t, its activists may very well gaze at their parties\u2019 old \u201ccore\u201d supporters across an impossible divide.</p> <p>Perhaps the most generous verdict is that here and across the world, the left \u2013 radicals and liberals alike \u2013 is stuck in an interregnum. You could compare it to the predicament of the 1980s, but it is even more reminiscent of the 1930s, when the aftershocks of an economic crash saw the left pushed aside by the politics of hatred and division.</p> <p>In 1931, the great Labour thinker RH Tawney wrote a short text titled The Choice Before the Labour Party, casting a cold eye over its predicament in terms that ring as true now as they must have done then. Labour, he wrote, \u201cdoes not achieve what it could, because it does not know what it wants. It frets out of office and fumbles in it, because it lacks the assurance either to wait or to strike. Being without clear convictions as to its own meaning and purpose, it is deprived of the dynamic which only convictions supply. If it neither acts with decision nor inspires others so to act, the principal reason is that it is itself undecided.\u201d</p> <p>No party can exist forever. Political traditions can decline, and then take on new forms; some simply become extinct. All that can be said with certainty is that if the left is to finally leave the 20th century, the process will have to start with the ideas and convictions that answer the challenges of a modernity it is only just starting to wake up to, let alone understand.</p> <p>\u2022 This is the first in a series of pieces by a range of contributors on new futures for the left.</p> <p><strong>Main illustration: Matt Chase</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump kicked off Labor Day by pivoting yet again on immigration.<br></p> <p>On a day when he barnstormed Ohio like a conquering hero, the Republican nominee left open the possibility of a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants and indicated a desire to move on from the issue.</p> <p>In an interview with reporters on his jet, somewhere over north-eastern Ohio, Trump insisted that while anyone seeking to become a citizen was \u201cgoing to have to get out and come back in through the process\u201d, he was \u201cnot ruling out anything\u201d when it came those who remained in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to make that decision into the future. That decision will be made.</p> <p>\u201cOur first thing will be to get all the bad elements out, the gang members, secure the border, stop the drugs from coming in.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I talk about more than anything else is jobs. We\u2019ve been talking about immigration \u2026 if I didn\u2019t bring up immigration, you guys wouldn\u2019t have been talking about it. Immigration is a huge problem. I\u2019ve proved that and I\u2019ll solve that problem. But the thing I am going to be best at is jobs, at renegotiating trade deals, which are a disaster.\u201d </p> <p>As the Republican nominee later declared in his in-flight interview \u201cit\u2019s all about jobs \u2026 The immigration position is so clear and so well announced \u2013 we gotta stop the drugs, we gotta stop criminality, get rid of the bad ones, and a lot of them are bad \u2013 it\u2019s really now so much talking about jobs because our country has been destroyed by other countries taking our jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Less than a week earlier Trump had given a hardline immigration speech, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/in-arizona-we-saw-the-real-donald-trump-the-one-we-already-knew\">proclaiming firmly</a>: \u201cThere will be no amnesty\u201d and insisting \u201canyone who enters the United States illegally is subject to deportation, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d</p> <p>But surrogates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">appearing on Sunday shows</a> made his position sound more nuanced. The former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump confidante, told CNN he had left \u201ca very big opening for what will happen with the people that remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure\u201d.</p> <p>On Monday Trump seemed eager to focus on jobs in blue-collar Ohio communities. Starting with a roundtable with union members outside Cleveland, then making a retail stop before being mobbed by crowds at a county fair outside Youngstown, Trump bathed in the adulation \u2013 the New York City real estate mogul transformed into a working-class hero. </p> <p>At the roundtable, introduced by Tom Coyne, the Democratic mayor of Brook Park, Ohio who cast his first Republican vote for Trump in March\u2019s presidential primaries, the nominee bemoaned the fact that Mexico and China were taking American jobs. As he told reporters later: \u201cThey are taking our jobs like Grant took Richmond.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised Barack Obama over his visit to China where the G20 hosts didn\u2019t \u201cgive him stairs, the proper stairs to get out\u201d.

At a county fair in traditionally Democratic Mahoning County, Trump was mobbed as he briefly walked through the crowd. The Republican nominee smiled and waved as infatuated Ohioans shouted \u201cWe love you Donald\u201d and even shrieked in glee. </p> <p>Adulation in Ohio, maybe \u2013 but Trump faces as a tough battle as he lags in national and state polls. Looking ahead to the debates, he pledged that barring \u201churricanes [or] natural disaster, I expect to do all three. I look forward to the debates. I think it is an important element of what we\u2019re doing. I think you have an obligation to do the debates.\u201d</p> <p> He confirmed that he was not engaging in traditional preparation \u2013 no mock debates, no one playing Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people do so much prep work that when they got out there they can\u2019t speak.\u201d</p> <p>The first debate between Trump and Clinton takes place on 26 September. </p>"
