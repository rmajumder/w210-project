  "<p>Teams from a Chinese oil and gas company exploring in the remote Bolivian Amazon have reportedly had near encounters with a group of indigenous people living in what the United Nations calls \u201cisolation\u201d, raising major concern for the group\u2019s welfare. </p> <p>The company doing the exploring, BGP Bolivia, is ultimately a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. The near encounters are reported to have taken place in the north-west of the country, close to the border with Peru and just to the east of the world-famous Madidi National Park.<br></p> <p>One near encounter has been confirmed in a BGP report dated 17 September. It includes hand-written statements by three eyewitnesses - all Bolivian nationals - as well as photographs of evidence provided by two BGP teams believed to confirm the isolated group\u2019s existence.</p> <p>\u201cPersonnel from the team called Topografia 10 reported the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous people shouting and calling out. . . initially about 100 metres away,\u201d states the report, written by BGP\u2019s Yu Fengbo and Alfredo Salvador and dated the same day as the encounter. \u201cAfterwards, the three workers reported that they continued to hear shouts and calls, getting increasingly closer until they were about 80 metres away and it became clear they were men and women. . . Their immediate reaction was to stay calm in order not to be detected. Later, the shouting stopped and the team, with considerable caution, began its return to camp.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd50243e61f40adc9e7049a370a0e6e1682044c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd50243e61f40adc9e7049a370a0e6e1682044c2/112_348_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A BGP fly camp in the Bolivian Amazon where company teams have reportedly had near encounters with indigenous people in \"isolation.\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A BGP fly camp in the Bolivian Amazon where company teams have reportedly had near encounters with indigenous people in \u201cisolation.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tacana II</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of BGP\u2019s team, Freddy Mullisaca, reported hearing a \u201cshout from an uncivilised man about 100 metres away on our right\u201d, before feeling scared and later hearing further shouts about 80 metres away. Another, Jose Carlos Paredes Caiti, described how \u201cwe heard a shout up to about 80 to 100 metres away on our right. We kept calm and stayed together. We approached the stake [used for the team\u2019s survey work] and the shouts could be heard like they were surrounding us. We were scared but [continued working], while I watched to check no one came near us. We finished. . . and then heard various shouts by men and women.\u201d</p> <p>BGP\u2019s 17 September report effectively acknowledges that this wasn\u2019t the first time evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been found during its operations, noting that on 12 September a member of Topografia 10 had said, via radio, that they had come across \u201cpaths and human footprints.\u201d The report states that this raised the possibility that there were \u201cpeople hunting in the area\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t \u201csufficient to indicate the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous peoples.\u201d The third member of Topografia 10, Franklin Beltran Aguada, appears to refer to this evidence in his testimony about the 17 September encounter, saying he had found signs of \u201cuncivilized people\u201d prior to that. </p> <p>A BGP report issued two days later, also written by Yu Fengbo and Alfredo Salvador, records another near encounter involving a different BGP team. According to the report, Topografia 3 \u201creported the presence of possible members of <em>originarios</em> indigenous peoples\u201d sometime between 23:00 on 18 September and very early morning of 19 September near a fly camp and helicopter landing area, where some company belongings were attacked.</p> <p>Yet further evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been reported as a result of BGP\u2019s operations - although it isn\u2019t included in either of the company\u2019s 17 or 19 September reports. On 14 September, the Central de Comunidades Indigenas Tacana II Rio Madre de Dios (CITRMD), an organization representing indigenous Tacana people, wrote to Bolivia\u2019s Vice-Ministry of Justice and Vice-Ministry of the Environment, among others, urgently requesting government intervention and expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about the threats posed by the company.</p> <p>According to the CITRMD, evidence for \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people - \u201cfootprints and broken branches\u201d - had been found by Cuadrilla 7, another BGP team, on 20 and 23 August. In addition, the CITRMD alleges further evidence was found by Topografia 10 on 13 September, although BGP\u2019s 17 September report says that team found nothing on that day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e620c4d24f5f092581c10fbbe11d9d1eb2add0d1/0_0_2170_1222/1000.png\" alt=\"Do\u00f1a Teo, an indigenous Tacana woman who has expressed serious concern about BGP\u2019s operations in Bolivia.

The response from the team\u2019s colleague, Diego Rivas, is to continue working but withdraw if they see anyone.</p> <p>The CITRMD also wrote to BGP, accusing it of failing to heed a 2013 Bolivian law specifically intended to protect indigenous peoples who are \u201cuncontacted\u201d or in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d, \u201cforced isolation\u201d, \u201cinitial contact\u201d and \u201cdanger of extinction.\u201d BGP\u2019s response, in its 17 September report, was that the law did not apply at that point because, although some evidence had been found on 12 September, it wasn\u2019t enough to definitely indicate the existence of isolated indigenous people in the region. Despite that, BGP states that it began withdrawing its teams that day, and then took \u201cmore serious\u201d action five days later after the 17 September encounter was reported. </p> <p>The following day, 18 September, the CITRMD wrote to several indigenous organisations stating that Yacimientos Petroliferas Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), Bolivia\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company which in May 2015 sub-contracted BGP to operate in this region, had been previously warned about the existence of \u201cuncontacted\u201d indigenous people. The company was urged, CITRMD claims, to respect \u201ctheir wish not to be contacted\u201d and to stop operating if they came across them. </p> <p>The CITRMD\u2019s letter claims that that advice was ignored - an allegation apparently supported by the radio conversation transcript and the eyewitness testimonies in BGP\u2019s 17 September report. Concern about contact with the group is particularly high because indigenous peoples living in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon do not have immunity to outsiders\u2019 diseases, meaning they can be easily infected and epidemics can spread among them with devastating consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcb5eac3501be19adfa4adf0b4557d016d10baa/0_0_1200_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing BGP\u2019s oil and gas concession in the Bolivian Amazon.

The \u201cToromonas\u201d are one of more than 100 groups of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d in the Amazon - with the vast majority in Brazil and Peru.</p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s 2013 law commits to protecting the lives of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d and requires \u201cpublic and private institutions\u201d \u201cresponsibly\u201d exploiting natural resources to abide by the law\u2019s protection measures - one of which is establishing \u201cbuffer zones\u201d to avoid accidental contact with outsiders. However, the government institution created by that law and responsible for instituting such measures, the Direcci\u00f3n General de Protecci\u00f3n a Naciones y Pueblos Ind\u00edgena Originarios (DIGEPIO), does not exist. </p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s Constitution arguably provides better legal protection than the 2013 law, with Article 31 stating that indigenous peoples in \u201cvoluntary isolation\u201d will be \u201cprotected and respected\u201d and that they have the right to \u201cthe territory which they occupy and inhabit.\u201d Bolivia is also a signatory to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169, an international law which recognises indigenous peoples\u2019 ownership rights to their land and obliges the government to protect it.</p> <p>Neither BGP nor YPFB responded to questions from the Guardian, but on 17 October Bolivian newspaper <a href=\"http://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20161017/ypfb-niega-existencia-pueblo-no-contactado-descarta-cambios\">Los Tiempos</a> reported YPFB\u2019s president, Guillermo Ach\u00e1, \u201cdenying the existence of supposed uncontacted indigenous people in Bolivia\u2019s Amazon\u201d and saying oil and gas operations will continue as planned.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no confirmation of any uncontacted people whatsoever,\u201d Ach\u00e1 was quoted as saying. \u201cI understand this [the recent reports of contact] has been a distortion of information and what we will be doing is looking to continue with all activities.\u201d</p> <p>Ach\u00e1\u2019s reported claims were made despite other YPFB personnel appearing to accept that evidence of indigenous people in \u201cisolation\u201d has been found by BGP. An internal 18 September YPFB report, titled \u201cPresence of <em>Originarios</em> Indigenous People at High Risk\u201d, draws heavily on BGP\u2019s report from the day before and states that \u201cas a result of the events described\u201d and the 2013 law, YPFB had withdrawn all personnel from the critical area. The next day, YPFB\u2019s Miguel Angel Rojas Castro informed the Vice-Minister of Justice about the 17 September near encounter and sent her BGP\u2019s report. However, both YPFB documents appear to express some doubt: the internal 18 September report refers to the \u201cpossible indigenous peoples at high risk\u201d who had been heard calling and shouting by a BGP team, and the letter to the Vice-Minister talks of \u201cthe presence of possible members of <em>originario</em> indigenous people.\u201d</p> <p>Georgina Jimenez, from Bolivian NGO CEDIB, calls the claims made by Ach\u00e1 \u201cscary\u201d and says they \u201crespond more to business interests than the state\u2019s responsibility\u201d to Bolivian citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat should be done? All exploratory activity should be immediately stopped,\u201d Jimenez told the Guardian. \u201cAccording to the Constitution, people who are uncontacted or in isolation have the right to remain in that condition and to have the territory where they live legally recognised.\u201d </p> <p>The reports of the near encounters with BGP teams has led to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) becoming involved. According to Bolivia\u2019s Defensoria del Pueblo, with which the UNHCHR is coordinating, a meeting will be held in Santa Cruz on 31 October to discuss how to prevent possible conflict in the region and ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples at \u201chigh risk\u201d in Bolivia are respected.</p> <p>BGP\u2019s environmental permit to operate was granted in November 2015. According to the EIA, it will involve cutting 21 seismic lines running for over 1,000 kms and detonating underground 190,000 kgs of explosives in its search for oil and/or gas. BGP\u2019s concession is called Nuevo Esperanza, an 800,000 hectare area.</p> <p>A reserved zone was established for the \u201cToromonas\u201d in 2006, although it is in the Madidi National Park and to the south-west of where BGP is currently operating. According to a 2013 report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the \u201cToromonas\u201d in the reserved zone were at that time threatened by narco-traffickers and an oil and gas concession - different to BGP\u2019s.</p>",
  "<p>In 1991, at just 23 years old, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">John Singleton</a> made his explosively powerful debut with Boyz N the Hood, a film for which he deserved \u2013 and largely got \u2013 the kind of respect Scorsese earned for Mean Streets, although his Academy Award nomination was not converted into a win and a black director has yet to get the Oscar. In last year\u2019s NWA movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/30/straight-outta-compton-review-pulsating-account\">Straight Outta Compton</a>, Ice Cube is shown being furious with Eazy-E for calling it an \u201cafter-school special\u201d. It\u2019s way more than that.

Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are Reva and Furious, the sundered parents of Tre Styles \u2013 played by Cuba Gooding Jr, whose face looks heartbreakingly boyish and vulnerable \u2013 a kid growing up in South Central Los Angeles. Fishburne\u2019s \u201cgentrification\u201d speech is as fierce as ever, along with his denunciation of SAT exams as culturally loaded, with the exception of maths. Ice Cube is Tre\u2019s troubled friend Doughboy, with Morris Chestnut as Doughboy\u2019s brother Ricky; Tyra Ferrell is excellent in the role of their mother, who keeps plastic wrapping on her couch cushions to keep them from getting messed up, a personal touch which ultimately assumes tragic significance.</p> <p>Ice Cube\u2019s final speech about how fatalistic he is about his own life is subtly moving. It was a movie about male responsibility and sexual behaviour in an era oppressed by HIV/Aids, which perhaps makes it of its time. But it hasn\u2019t dated: this is a key text for the Black Lives Matter movement.

  "<p>The British and French governments were accused of breaching children\u2019s human rights as up to 50 teenagers were abandoned by authorities in Calais and forced into an industrial estate near the cleared-out refugee camp to sleep in makeshift conditions.</p> <p>The teenagers were lured out of the site of the camp in the afternoon with the promise of transport to a reception centre where they could be assessed for asylum or reunification with families in the UK.<br></p> <p>However, after an hour no bus had arrived.

One, Alice Sturrock from Edinburgh, said: \u201cI did not think at 22 I would be on fire patrol in a refugee camp. There is a fire burning over that side and there are CRS [French police] with rubber bullets on the other. How is this a safe haven for children?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are fed up, tired and sad. It is crazy that no provision has been made for them. They have been given no information all day,\u201d Inca Sorrell, another volunteer who has worked with child refugees in Calais for the past year, said.</p> <p>Sheehan had earlier said she could not believe what she was seeing, given that the French ambassador in London and and Home Office minister Baroness Williams had given assurances some weeks ago that the demolition of the site would not begin before all the children were safeguarded.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is so humiliating and undignified,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThese children have literally been pushed from pillar to post. They have sat there obediently under the bridge for several hours and then they were kettled. Now the instruction is that these people must disperse. It is as if the authorities are trying to wish the problem away. But the longer the keep their heads in the sand and don\u2019t offer a solution, the bigger the problem will be.\u201d</p> <p>An atmosphere of despair among charity workers was mirrored by the behaviour of the children, all aged approximately 14 to 17, some of whom huddled against the wall in blankets as the temperature plummeted.<br></p> <p>One Afghan teenager, wrapped in a yellow and green sleeping bag, said: \u201cFuck France, Fuck Britain. You are racists.\u201d<br></p> <p>He was in tears as a French volunteer tried to console him by asking him not to be angry with aid workers. He retorted: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to sleep on the side of the road last night \u2013 you have documentation, you have money. Fuck France.\u201d<br></p> <p>Annie Gavrilescu, a volunteer with the charity <a href=\"http://helprefugees.org.uk\">Help Refugees</a>, said there was no sign of any official assistance for the children. \u201cThe <em>sous-pr\u00e9fet</em> [highest-ranking local civil servant] has washed his hands of them. There is nowhere for them to go. Those kids have been there with volunteers and officials, all day, waiting for buses. They have been given nothing. They are just tired and hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Save the Children spokeswoman Dorothy Sang, whose organisation had helped persuade the children to leave the camp on a promise of fresh shelter and the start of a new life, said: \u201cYet again these children have been put in a dangerous position.

Fabienne Buccio said 1,500 children had been housed in the container camp, while another 68 were given shelter in a hangar that had been used for the now-closed processing centre.</p> <p>But inside the camp some 50 children slept on a sandy ridge with bedding provided by Refugee Youth Service. Another 40 were sent to a makeshift school, while others were sent to the temporary church and the temporary mosque, bringing the total of official and unofficial unaccompanied children outside the container camp closer to 200.</p> <p>The Home Office confirmed that a bus-load of Calais children arrived in Croydon on Thursday, with more expected in the coming days. French officials said a total of 234 minors had been resettled in the UK since 17 October.</p> <p> Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, condemned scenes of \u201cutter chaos for children and teenagers\u201d that were \u201cputting them in serious danger\u201d. She said she had been in touch again with Home Office ministers to urge them to put serious pressure on the French authorities to provide an immediate safe place for children to go.</p> <p>The Labour peer Alf Dubs, whose amendment to the Immigration Act has forced the government to accept a number of vulnerable refugee children, described the situation in Calais as \u201cdisastrous\u201d. \u201cWe argued that the children in Calais should be in a place of safety, but they are not. I don\u2019t know who to blame,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>The teenager from Darfur</h2> <p>Five of his 16 years were spent in a refugee camp in Darfur, but Hussein\u2019s last five months have been spent in the Calais camp, where he hoped to obtain legal sanctuary somewhere.<br></p> <p>When it came in the shape of the clearance operation, Hussein (not his real name) jumped at the chance to move on. The youngster is used to to a hard life but not inured to it, and told the Guardian that he still has hopes of getting back to school and becoming an engineer.<br></p> <p>Despite his best efforts, and queuing before dawn on three successive days, Hussein said he never made it to the head of the line to be processed, and on Wednesday night became one of the estimated 200 unaccompanied children left to sleep rough. Now he faces a second night in the grass with temperatures dropping and despondency setting in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"927d1e61ee26d428ac3498179e74251e2dd7d8a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/927d1e61ee26d428ac3498179e74251e2dd7d8a0/0_0_3645_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An unnamed teenager rests on the ground near the cleared-out camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unnamed teenager rests on the ground near the cleared-out camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the teenager says his life before was worse. He said that he walked through the desert for 10 days before he and his friend, also in Calais, got a lift to Libya and then on to Italy.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was very difficult in Zamzam,\u201d he said, referring to one of the biggest refugee camps in Darfur. \u201cIt is very dangerous there.\u201d He said he was racially abused when he was there, pointing to the colour of his dark skin.</p> <p>Despite the poor conditions, the Calais camp had been a better place to be: \u201cThe Jungle is better than Zamzam. There is no war. There is no danger. You have freedom. They kill anybody in Zamzam \u2013 women, children. They don\u2019t care.\u201d<br></p> <p>He hasn\u2019t spoken to his mother since 2014, and doesn\u2019t know if she is alive or dead.<br></p> <p>But like many, Hussein is in despair as he finds himself facing a night of sleeping in makeshift conditions after being duped into a police kettling operation instead of being placed on a bus to a special reception centre for minors, as was promised to charities on Thursday morning.<br></p> <p>\u201cI slept on the ground last night. Me and my friends have been queuing for three days. I don\u2019t want to go back [to Darfur]. If I go back, I die.\u201d</p> <h2>He came across Europe and thought he might reach the UK</h2> <p>Sameer (not his real name) had been living in Germany for the past 15 months, but took a chance and came to Calais on Wednesday after hearing that he might get a chance to come to the UK as part of the camp clearance programme.</p> <p>The 17-year-old said he fled the Taliban in Afghanistan and crossed by foot and using people-smugglers to Turkey, Greece and on to Germany as part of the sea of refugees who migrated to Europe last summer. He added that he made the decision to go to France because he had \u201cno future\u201d where he was.</p> <p>Speaking fluent English, Sameer said he wants to come to Britain because he can understand the language and can make a life for himself and a contribution to the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe Germans wanted to send me back to Bulgaria, where I was fingerprinted under the Dublin regulation. But I don\u2019t want to go back to Bulgaria. The police there beat me up and kept me in jail for 15 or 16 days. They kicked us and starved us and treated us like animals.</p> <p>\u201cI had a few friends in the Jungle and received news that people were going to get a chance to apply for asylum, so I thought I might be reassessed here and given a fresh chance away from Bulgaria.\u201d</p> <p>He had only been in the Jungle one night \u2013 the night that part of it was razed to the ground. \u201cMy expectations of Calais were so high. But the Jungle is so terrible,\u201d said the teenager, who did not want his name or photograph published. \u201cI never guessed there would be such a place. How can people live like that?\u201d But he added: \u201cNothing can be worse than the experience I have had, the problems everyone has had. Nobody, if they had a choice, would live in the Jungle.\u201d</p> <p>He said he came from a \u201cbroad-minded family\u201d, with a father who \u201csupported our education\u201d. But problems started when two of his brothers started working for the US embassy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid\">USAid</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban asked why they were working for these non-Muslim people. \u2018You must bring them to us and we will kidnap them and in exchange force them to release the Taliban in jail.\u2019 They say, why do you not join our party? But I don\u2019t want to join that disgusting party \u2013 my father taught us to be broad-minded.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cBut in Europe, even, nobody wants to give me a chance. Even in Germany, where I have been for 15 months. It took them eight months to process me and then they said I had to go back to Bulgaria,\u201d he said.</p>",

Whatever your view, it is unquestionably the case that at this rate, the snowballing Brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrage, and a big opportunity for a party willing to channel them. At the national level at least, this seems unlikely to be Labour, for three reasons: the number of \u201ccore\u201d Labour voters who supported leave, the anti-EU inclinations of its leadership, and the general cluelessness that suggests it tends to view glaring political opportunities as some kind of bourgeois trick. In which case, there is one obvious candidate: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/23/liberal-democrats-remain-voters-witney-surge-byelection-liz-leffman\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p> <p>For sure, they have a hell of a lot to surmount: the deep damage to their reputation done by the coalition years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/tim-farron-tories-are-creating-a-nastier-more-divided-britain\" title=\"\">a leader</a> who has yet to break into the public consciousness, and an almost total lack of powerbases, even in their traditional redoubts. But with memories of their grim partnership with the Tories fading, an intersecting alliance of voters could yet be theirs: those variously worried about hard Brexit, drawn to the Lib Dems\u2019 insistence on a second referendum, and in many cases opposed to leaving the EU per se \u2013 people who, if the government sticks to its current hard line and/or the EU refuses to play ball, may well become one big anti-Brexit bloc.</p> <p>There was a flavour of this at this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/witney-byelection-lib-dems-tories-slashed-majority\" title=\"\">at last week\u2019s Witney byelection</a>, whose pretty miraculous result \u2013 a 19% swing from the Tories to a party we all thought was dead \u2013 has been rather overlooked, along with Tim Farron\u2019s trumpeting of the result: a clear rejection, he said, \u201cof the Conservative Brexit government\u2019s plan to take Britain out of the single market\u201d.</p> <p>What happened there highlighted a tension, hardly unique to that corner of the country, that was arguably always going to explode. The Conservative party faced thousands of Tory-inclined voters who supported remain (in West Oxfordshire, the <a href=\"http://election.news.sky.com/referendum/west-oxfordshire-3061\" title=\"\">pro-EU side won by 54% to 46%</a>). After weeks of telling them that whatever their anxieties, it was now likely to be hard Brexit all the way, surprise, surprise: a lot of them didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>Something similar is likely to happen in the looming Richmond Park byelection\u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/27/zac-goldsmith-vote-extreme-brexit-byelection-labour-not-contest-richmond-park\" title=\"\">Zac Goldsmith</a> wants to be about a third Heathrow runway, but thanks to the absence of an official Tory candidate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/anticipation-abounds-as-the-lib-dems-begin-battle-for-richmond-park\" title=\"\">an already-energised Lib Dem campaign</a>, may well turn out to be a contest much more focused on Europe, and Goldsmith\u2019s leap away from thousands of his constituents. They live in a borough <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/london-eu-referendum-results-borough-by-borough-breakdown-of-brexit-poll-a3279731.html\" title=\"\">that voted 70% for remain</a> \u2013 in which context, he will be hobbled not just by his support for the leave side, but the downright racist mayoral campaign that gave a sharp flavour of the nastiness that would erupt both before and after the referendum.</p> <p>I\u2019m old-fashioned: I would rather political divisions were based on such trifles as inequality, and the limits of the market. But these are hardly normal times. As also evidenced by a steady stream of council byelection results, a proper Lib Dem revival may only be a matter of time. Whatever the contortions of the Labour leadership, I wonder about the Labour leaders of our big cities, and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37324214\" title=\"\">first minister of Wales</a>, and at what point they may break from their hopeless party line, and begin to pointedly question something that will so deeply damage the places where they hold power.</p> <p>All the time, it gets louder: the early stirring of a messy realignment, and the birth pangs of 48/52 politics, whose consequences \u2013 on both sides of the divide \u2013 could be just as seismic as Brexit itself.</p>",
  "<p>At last, child refugees are being rescued from the squalor and danger of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/fear-stalks-final-hours-calais-camp\" title=\"\">the Calais camp</a> and brought to Britain. But the process has taken far too long; and even now it is still too slow. This evening, 24 hours after the French government declared \u201cjob done\u201d, the home secretary was sending angry messages to her opposite number to demand that children left to sleep rough on the first night were now properly protected. The Home Office is finally grinding into action. But the inaction of both London and Paris, allowing the camp to fester for years, has meant it metastasised into a crisis of inhumanity, devastating for its victims and shaming for the British government.</p> <p>Many of the people who cross Europe to Calais do so to come to Britain, a country where many have family, where they share a language, and think they have the best chance of getting a job or an education. They are only a tiny number compared with the thousands who find refuge in Germany and Sweden. But the British government still insists that asylum seekers must apply in the first safe country they reach. It argues that admitting asylum seekers through Calais acts as a pull factor, attracting even young and vulnerable children to make a perilous journey from which only people smugglers benefit.</p> <p>Charities that work in the camps and try to help people with their paperwork believe the inertia comes from the very top of the British government. Even after the Home Office was forced by parliament earlier this year to accept the Dubs amendment allowing in as many as 3,000 unaccompanied minors without family ties in the UK, the decision was taken to work in Greece and Italy among newly arrived refugees, rather than in Calais. While Yvette Cooper, now chair of the home affairs committee, argued that each country should take half the children and teenagers, progress remained near-invisible. Only this month, as domestic political pressure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/french-presidential-election-brexit-closure-calais-refugee-camp\" title=\"\">embarrassed French politicians into bulldozing the camp and dispersing its occupants</a>, has the Home Office agreed to take children under the Dubs deal along with those with British family.</p> <p>So for months over the summer, when children could have been interviewed and assessed and their British families contacted and visited, nothing at all happened. At the end of August the new home secretary Amber Rudd met her opposite number Bernard Cazeneuve and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-plays-down-calais-border-tensions-with-critical-ally-france\" title=\"\">reaffirmed their commitment</a> to the Le Touquet agreement, allowing UK immigration officials to work in France \u2013 politically helpful for Britain, but little help to the thousands of migrants. Only a fortnight ago, with the demolition of the camp now scheduled, was there a further meeting at which Ms Rudd promised to take 300 children from the camp regardless of family ties. A week later, Mr Cazeneuve wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/18/uk-french-blame-game-over-calais-camp-must-end-warns-cazeneuve\" title=\"\">a stinging comment article </a>for the Guardian denouncing Britain\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d policy and demanding that it take responsibility for the misery of the Calais camp. That is a charge few even of the government\u2019s most vehement critics would accept. Yet if Britain is not to blame for the lack of safeguarding for children in the camp, particularly teenage girls, nor for the squalor of the conditions, it is true that first Mrs May and then Ms Rudd, desperate to isolate the UK from the global refugee crisis, failed to act for far too long.</p> <p>The Home Office knows how to do this. Campaigners are appreciative of the management (if not the scale) of the scheme to take 20,000 vulnerable Syrians identified and processed in camps neighbouring the country. That was the result of designating a responsible minister, who assembled a team of officials to tackle the inevitable obstacles. Dealing with Calais has appeared to be a much more haphazard process. Professionals like <a href=\"http://www.tactcare.org.uk/about-us/?gclid=CjwKEAjwy8bABRD5osXMovTHpmQSJACfZY0FikpoScho1g7X7ZSoGSHkShKbh4pRsdJy7rkNMPw0_BoC6yDw_wcB\" title=\"\">The Adolescent and Children\u2019s Trust</a>, a charitable fostering and adoption agency, wonder why officials and social workers were not sent out together weeks ago to identify lone child refugees, find out how many there were, and start the process of assessing them. Councils complain that not enough money has been allowed to support the children; they fear the money will run out after this financial year. And while in the past couple of weeks real effort has gone into speeding up the process, the Home Office lacked even reliable figures for the number of unaccompanied minors it wanted to find \u2013 and still seems uncertain how many have arrived. A start has been made. Children and teenagers can at last imagine a future. But it began too late; it has taken too long. And much still remains to be done.</p>",

  "<p>David Bradley wants to meet in Barnsley. This is where he grew up. It is where Kes, the film that changed his life, was made, and where he still lives. He is waiting for me in the middle of the road as I come out of the station, waving exuberantly. He then drives me a few miles south to the village of Tankersley. It was here, in 1965, that author Barry Hines\u2019s younger brother, Richard, trained a kestrel, homing her in the air-raid shelter at the bottom of Barry\u2019s garden. Richard wanted to call her Kessy; Barry suggested Kes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/08/kes-review\">Kes \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley wants to talk in a pub he likes, which seems a generic suggestion until we get there: the last time he was here, he says, was for Barry Hines\u2019s wake. Hines, who had Alzheimer\u2019s for nine years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-obituary-a-kestrel-for-a-knave-author\">died in March</a>, age 76, and is buried at a nearby church. Bradley, now 63, softly spoken and sensitive, has been inextricably linked to Hines and Kes since he was cast, aged 14, in Ken Loach\u2019s 1969 adaptation of Hines\u2019s novel A Kestrel for a Knave. The film, about Billy Casper, a neglected working-class 15-year-old who finds solace training a kestrel, was a gentle drama about harsh circumstances. It was a sensation, winning Bradley a Bafta for most promising newcomer.</p> <p>Bradley was, he says, an ordinary kid who had failed his 11-plus and went to St Helen\u2019s, a Barnsley secondary modern school. His father was a miner, and Bradley was expected to follow suit, but says he wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope down the pits. Local author Hines didn\u2019t yet know Bradley, but he knew kids just like him. Hines\u2019s father was a miner, and Hines, who had been a teacher at St Helen\u2019s and modelled the school in his book after it, wanted to write about the pig-headedness of disregarding pupils who failed the 11-plus, thus branding them with inferiority complexes. Loach was equally keen to mine the subject on film.</p> <p>Bradley, who had starred in school pantomimes at St Helen\u2019s, showed off keen improvisational chops in auditions, and was offered the job. The same day, a fortnight before shooting began, he was summoned to Barry Hines\u2019s house to start training the three kestrels to be used in the film. (They were named Freeman, Hardy &amp; Willis, after the shoe shop.) Bradley was paired with Hardy, while Barry and Richard worked with the other two, which was just as well: \u201cWillis was freaking out all the time: it just wouldn\u2019t do anything. We had to reintroduce him back into the wild.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aabffb48b78f45bd852a9d0fc2dd9cbecf60a138\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aabffb48b78f45bd852a9d0fc2dd9cbecf60a138/0_0_2745_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley during the filming of Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley with Barry Hines during the filming of Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Woodfall Film Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In striving for authenticity, Loach was as unpredictable as Willis. \u201cHe would play tricks to see if he could get a reaction,\u201d says Bradley. In one scene, Bradley runs down a street, chased by a barking dog: he is convinced Loach had someone hiding who \u201cthrew the dog into the middle of the road\u201d. For <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aabrXxnvTpU\">the famous sequence in which Bradley and other schoolboys are caned</a>, they had been assured Loach would call \u201ccut\u201d just before they were struck \u2013 he didn\u2019t. \u201cYou can\u2019t imitate that expression, the point at which the cane strikes the hand,\u201d Loach later explained. \u201cSo we just caned them, really.\u201d</p> <p>To elicit a realistic emotional response for the film\u2019s bleak climax, in which Billy\u2019s self-loathing brother Jud (Freddie Fletcher) kills Kes, Loach approached Fletcher and Bradley in the lunch queue and told Fletcher to go off with Richard Hines and slaughter Hardy for the required corpse. Bradley says he wasn\u2019t convinced \u2013 \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe these nice people could be so cruel\u201d \u2013 and after shooting the scene was reunited with Hardy (the one on camera had died from natural causes). \u201cI said to them: \u2018I knew you wouldn\u2019t kill him! I knew you wouldn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Kes, Bradley changed his professional name to Dai (because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bradley_(actor)\">the other David Bradley, last seen in Game of Thrones</a>), got some TV work, enjoyed a spell with the National Theatre (including the lead in Equus), and on film appeared in Zulu Dawn and 1979\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front. After that though, work dried up somewhat. He bought a church and spent three years part-converting it into a home, but his co-investor didn\u2019t come up with the other 50%. Meanwhile, a play he was doing in the US came to nothing when the producer didn\u2019t arrange for him to get a green card. He came home, and reluctantly sold the church.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V3x_2fSCK8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8V3x_2fSCK8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He speaks with great affection about Kes \u2013 the tie has not been cut. In 2009, he told a BBC TV crew that every couple of years he revisits the woods filmed in Kes, as they remind him of making the film. Does he feel emotionally attached to it? He pauses for some time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say ... I don\u2019t often go now, I try to go at least once a year, because the wood which Billy used to walk through to the old ruined manor house was absolutely fantastic when I was a young lad. It was as you saw it in the film, a canopy of green dappled sunlight.\u201d</p> <p>He appears at public screenings of Kes, but can\u2019t watch the last 20 minutes as it upsets him too much. \u201cI have to apologise to audiences,\u201d he says. \u201cI say to them: \u2018Please excuse me if you see this shadow walking out at the end; it\u2019s just too much to stay behind.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80e7bfea55e7079502d89072cb8afae642067b33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80e7bfea55e7079502d89072cb8afae642067b33/0_0_3275_2540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley in Kes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley in Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask about the <a href=\"http://www.kes-billycasper.co.uk/\">site he runs, called Kes: Billy Casper</a>, which features his CV, a guestbook and a detailed rundown of the film\u2019s locations. \u201cIt was prompted by the fans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I get so bored of it. There\u2019s a fan section where they\u2019re invited to write to me, and there are hundreds of these little promos for various types of pills. And I just get so bored of erasing those all the time.\u201d Spam? \u201cYes, offering legal-high-type things. I erase a month\u2019s worth and then another couple of months\u2019 worth comes within a week, and I think: \u2018God, why did I invite the fans to write to me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask if he stays in touch with anyone from the film. \u201cWe try to see each other once a year if possible, just for half an hour, to say hello,\u201d he says of Loach, and then, talking about Barry Hines, comes a reveal. Bradley had got back in touch \u201cbecause I\u2019d penned a sequel to Kes\u201d, he says, matter of factly. What? He wrote a sequel? A book or a screenplay? \u201cI\u2019d loved for it to have been both. But I didn\u2019t think that I could go through with it without Barry\u2019s approval.\u201d He says that he\u2019s written a few things over the years, including a couple of TV scripts \u2013 one called Shake, Rattle and Roll based on his own experiences in the World Backgammon Championships \u2013 that didn\u2019t work out.</p> <p>His Kes sequel came about because someone told him they had funding and an idea for a sequel, but Bradley didn\u2019t like the idea and besides, the money never materialised. \u201cI discovered that he was wanted by the police on three different continents,\u201d he says of the financer. \u201cI tend to commit myself to projects without any kind of financial insurance. And I\u2019m the one that gets burned.\u201d So he wrote his own sequel, in which Billy runs away to London and gets into trouble, sniffing glue, washing car windscreens at traffic lights, but is adopted by a couple and ends up converting a narrowboat. Bradley never showed it to Hines. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t well enough. I didn\u2019t even tell his wife. I thought it would upset her.\u201d</p> <p>He drives me back to the train station, pointing out the church where Hines is buried. I think of an old Loach interview in which he said he cast Bradley because he was vulnerable, open and true. He still is. \u201cI know I\u2019ve had a chequered career, a bit of a rollercoaster. But then that\u2019s because of, I guess, my appearance?\u201d he says, and I\u2019m not quite sure what he means.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not the boy-next-door type,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not the macho, martial arts type. I\u2019m just an ordinary chap. An amiable guy.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about his recent work \u2013 a bit-part in the Jason Statham film Hummingbird, and an appearance in Holby City. I ask him if he\u2019s still hoping for something to happen with his Kes sequel. \u201cI\u2019m not pursuing it at the present,\u201d he says, wistfully. \u201cThe moment is gone. Sometimes I wonder if there were moments when things should happen.

We understand specialist facilities have been made available elsewhere in France to ensure this happens.\u201d</p> <p>The clear implication of the pressure from the home secretary is that the promised buses should be provided for those refugee children who have been pushed outside the camp to take them to a new reception centre.</p> <p>The Home Office confirmed that a further group of Calais children arrived in Croydon on Thursday with more expected in the coming days.</p> <p>The call followed renewed pressure from amongst others Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee. She said had been in touch again with Home Office ministers to urge them to put serious pressure on the French authorities to provide an immediate safe place for children to go.</p> <p>\u201cThey also need to accelerate the British assessments and transfers to get more children and teenagers into stable accommodation and to urgently free up more places in the container camp too,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>\u201cChildren need safe accommodation to stay in tonight \u2013 they cannot be left to sleep rough by the side of the road again.

Here\u2019s a few sections from it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The EU is a flawed institution, but we judged it better to fight for its reform than to leave. By a majority, the referendum shows that the British people made a different choice.</p> <p>Britain voted to leave the EU, and that decision should be and must be respected. We have to now think about what Britain after Brexit will be like.</p> <p>As the negotiations get underway, we will face a series of choices. \u201cHard\u201d versus \u201csoft\u201d Brexit does not cover it. We will need to decide on our openness to trade, investment, and migration.</p> <p>Labour will always prioritise supporting jobs, growth, and the public finances in making those choices. </p> <p>But this is not only about getting the best possible deal for the British people in any negotiations. It is about our values, and who we are as a society. It is about our identity, as much as it is about the kind of economy we live in.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There ought to be a political consensus on finding a deal that protects jobs, prosperity, and the public finances. Yet there is a minority Tory opinion that favours a scorched earth approach. They are making the running in the government\u2019s own Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>The government is hurtling towards a chaotic Brexit that will damage our economy, and hurt the poorest and most vulnerable most of all. By pulling up the drawbridge and tearing up longstanding ties to Europe, we will inflict huge and unnecessary pain on our society.</p> <p>Yet a hard-line Tory minority believe that if we allow market forces to tear through our society in the wake of Brexit, we will emerge a more productive society. It is the fantasy of turning our whole country into a giant offshore tax haven, with rock-bottom wages and no public services....</p> <p>Let me be clear: those who voted Conservative in 2015 are not the same as the Tory establishment. Like me, you will have friends who have voted Conservative. They don\u2019t want a bankers\u2019 Brexit any more than I do.</p> <p>The simple truth is that the Tory establishment cannot be trusted to make a success of Brexit. They want to take control for themselves, not the many. They want to turn Britain into a Singapore of the north Atlantic.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are also committed to making sure that Brexit works for everyone not an elite few. The Tories want to cut special deals for bankers, and cut taxes for big multinationals.</p> <p>Labour would work with our European neighbours to protect our key industries like steel, and negotiate deals with the EU to make sure big multinationals like Google pay their fair share in tax.</p> <p>Labour will take back the economic levers of power currently in the hands of the EU, such as state aid rules, and return them to the people.</p> <p>Not a bankers\u2019 Brexit for the lucky few, but a people\u2019s Brexit for the many.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5811f3e1e4b01c528432d42a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:39:38.371Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business secretary refuses to say if Nissan was granted special deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7647c5c9a4259a94e2f6f3ea70ce1ffd5c7d73/0_9_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The business secretary Greg Clark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business secretary Greg Clark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The business secretary, <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, has just treated listeners of BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One to a masterclass in political waffling. By my count, host Martha Kearney asked him six times whether the government had struck some sort of deal with Nissan over potential post-Brexit tariffs to persuade the carmaker to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-to-make-new-qashqai-and-x-trail-models-in-britain\">build new models in its Sunderland plant</a>. </p> <p>Each time Clark answered an entirely different question, and at great length. Not a man afraid of numerous sub-clauses in a sentence, he at times resembled a contestant on another Radio 4 show, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp\">Just a Minute</a>, seeking to run down the clock without actually saying anything of note.</p> <p>To give you a flavour, here\u2019s Clark\u2019s first two answers, in full:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we\u2019ve established a clear understanding of the seriousness of the government\u2019s intention to make sure that the car manufacturing industry not only retains its competitiveness, but actually, through our commitment through the industrial strategy we\u2019re developing for investment in research and innovation and science \u2013 especially on very important technologies like electric vehicles \u2013 that we are going to be even more a magnet for investment in the future.</p> <p>And over the weeks that I\u2019ve been having conversations with Nissan, and indeed other companies, I think we do have mutual confidence that this is going to be a very exciting place to invest, and that\u2019s what we agreed.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We talked about the Brexit negotiation and obviously it is something that was in their minds, but the first thing we were able to show was that we are absolutely determined to do a good deal with our European friends and neighbours. </p> <p>There\u2019s strong mutual interest in the automotive sector in particular, where there is mutual exporting from one country to another, and from Britain to the rest of the EU, supply chains are quite integrated. So we not only have the ambition and the intention but actually good grounds for looking forwards to a good relationship here.</p> </blockquote> <p>A bit later, Clark came close to an actual answer on one point, saying there had not been a specific deal on compensation over possible tariffs, but that was as precise as it got:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:44:35.371Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5811ed26e4b08d944ba4b3bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-27T12:05:40.121Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273cb99052b55f5defb9d0c391cb24280791e532/0_75_3670_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m still lacking a copy of John McDonnell\u2019s Brexit speech, but here are some more full quotes from it via PA:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour are not about to make cynical promises like the Conservatives on reducing migrant numbers, knowing full well they can\u2019t be met on the scale, or timescale, with the methods they propose.</p> <p>It is not migrants [who are] to blame for low pay and insecurity at work, or the high cost of housing, it is the failure of our whole economic model, which is not supplying the investment in work, or in housing, that people need. We have to change the model.</p> <p>What we experienced during the referendum ... people voted on a whole range of issues, one of which was their concern about the low standard of living. They actually looked at migration being exploited by employers and others to undermine that standard of living. </p> <p>What we will negotiate is a future with Europe that protects people\u2019s standards of living, that doesn\u2019t allow migration to be used and exploited in that way.

We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, Labour\u2019s mayor of London Sadiq Khan is set to call on the government to prioritise the City\u2019s EU passporting rights at a speech at the City of London Corporation\u2019s annual dinner tonight.<br></p> <p>McDonnell said he was also determined to protect financial services, but would not prioritise a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d over other industries. \u201cIt sends out messages to the rest of our economy that special deals are being cooked up.

  "<p>The last time many people would have caught a glimpse of Michael Gove was on the morning after the EU referendum when he appeared before the TV cameras looking like a bloke who had just come down from a bad acid trip to discover he had murdered several of his closest friends. </p> <p>That, though, turned out to be just the start of his Charlie Manson political killing spree. Within a week, he had stabbed Boris Johnson repeatedly in the front before crashing and burning in his bid to become prime minister. His punishment was to be sent to the backbenches to reflect on the foolishness of his actions.</p> <p>As justice secretary, Gove was a firm believer in the saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t do the time, don\u2019t do the crime,\u201d but he\u2019s not finding it so easy to put into practice himself.</p> <p>The normal sentence for a serial killer is life without parole, but Gove has come to the conclusion that, in his case, a couple of months is quite long enough. Mikey has had enough of being just another political hack, occasionally chipping in with backbench speeches that go unreported and unappreciated. Mikey believes he is worth more than this. Mikey believes the world is ready for The Return of the Govester. Mikey 2.0.</p> <p>Sadly for Mikey, just about the only person to agree with him is the Brexit-supporting Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/19/lord-glasman-radical-traditionalist\">Maurice Glasman</a>, and the pair have set up a two-man commission to \u201cDo Something About Immigration\u201d. Which is why Mikey finally got the attention he had been craving for so long and was invited to appear on Sky News. </p> <p>Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. There are some humiliations even a politician shouldn\u2019t be made to endure. \u201cLet\u2019s just remind ourselves of one of the most momentous occasions of this summer,\u201d said Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton, not even bothering to conceal a smirk. The screen switched to Boris Johnson announcing he wasn\u2019t going to run for leadership of the Conservative party after all. \u201cWhat did you think when you saw that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t watch it,\u201d Gove insisted.</p> <p>Boulton arched an eyebrow. Was Mikey really trying to suggest he hadn\u2019t bothered to watch Boris: My Part in His Downfall? No matter. Boulton pressed on.</p> <p>\u201cBut you did effectively bring about Boris\u2019s withdrawal from the leadership race?\u201d he observed.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a complete coincidence,\u201d said Mikey.</p> <p>\u201cTreachery. Nicking his phone. Conspiracy ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an unfair characterisation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no betrayal by you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. The mistake I made was that I should have paused before offering Boris support.\u201d </p> <p>Or, indeed, before withdrawing it. It\u2019s fair to say Mikey has a bit of a way to go in his rehabilitation classes. Restorative justice must be on next year\u2019s curriculum.</p> <p>Boulton pressed on for an easy kill of his own. \u201cSo, what was your biggest mistake?\u201d he enquired. \u201cSupporting Boris, knifing Boris or thinking you were fit to be prime minister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did come third,\u201d Mikey squeaked, defiantly.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/02/andrea-leadsom-v-theresa-may\">But more MPs believed <em>even</em> Andrea Leadsom was a better bet than you</a>.\u201d That was the lowest of low blows. Living with the knowledge your colleagues have more faith in the environment minister\u2019s competency is enough to keep anyone in therapy for decades.</p> <p>Boulton\u2019s bloodlust was out of control. Gove had been a key man and was now excluded. Boris was foreign secretary and doing well and Gove wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re left to going around bayoneting the wounded,\u201d he said, oblivious to the irony he was guilty of doing just that himself.</p> <p>By now, Mikey was a wreck, praying for the interview to end as quickly as possible. He\u2019d only imagined doing a three-minute interview and it was already creeping up to 10. Mikey found himself babbling stuff he knew that even he didn\u2019t believe. \u201cIt\u2019s great news the pound has been devalued by 30%,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what are the immigration targets of your new commission?\u201d asked Boulton, finally getting round to the reason Mikey had volunteered himself for this debacle.</p> <p>\u201cUm ... er ... I don\u2019t really know. That\u2019s why I want to have a commission.\u201d</p> <p>As Mikey tiptoed out of the studios, his phone rang. Maybe it was Theresa asking him back into the cabinet, having been dazzled by his performance. It wasn\u2019t. It was his probation officer. His licence had been revoked.</p>",
  "<p>In 1988, the British artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/mark-leckey\">Mark Leckey</a> spent the summer in Brighton. He was 24 and looking for work, but he found play \u2013 specifically at the front doorstep of the Zap nightclub, which essentially kicked off his art career. \u201cI literally walked into this rave where it was full of dry ice,\u201d says Leckey on the phone from PS1, where he opened an exhibition on Sunday. \u201cThis guy just loomed out of the dry ice with this smiley face mask on.

The title of his new show <a href=\"http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/415\">Containers and Their Drivers</a> is probably the first museum exhibition ever to be named after a song by Mancunian postpunk legends the Fall.</p> <p>For his first US survey, Leckey may seem like an art world superstar \u2013 he showed with Damien Hirst in 1990 at ICA\u2019s New Contemporaries show, is collected in the Tate and the Centre Pompidou and is even married to the head of programs at Serpentine Galleries, Lizzie Carey-Thomas. But that\u2019s not to categorize him. The song Containers and Their Drivers is about the shipping industry, which resonates with the setup of Leckey\u2019s exhibition. \u201cEverything in the show is a kind of container; a fridge, sound systems, objects that contain something,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a0599877e9e103be33735e2f6b114b45b5cdcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a0599877e9e103be33735e2f6b114b45b5cdcb/0_0_4495_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leckey: \u2018The art world is cautious with the word \u2018retrospective,\u2019 it\u2019s a \u2018mid-career survey,\u2019\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leckey: \u2018The art world is cautious with the word \u2018retrospective,\u2019 it\u2019s a \u2018mid-career survey,\u2019\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Enriquez/MoMA PS1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what container does Leckey fit into?

You don\u2019t get a retrospective until everyone is absolutely certain. There hasn\u2019t been full consensus.\u201d</p> <p>While his introduction to the Zap marked Leckey\u2019s foray into rave culture, it didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cRaves were in warehouse parties, illegal raves, things you can\u2019t do now in London,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The memories are now immortalized in a 1999 video collage called Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, (named after the Italian clothing brand, popular with the fashion-and-football obsessed \u201ccasuals\u201d subculture), a euphoric and strangely poignant work which stitches together footage of clubbers dancing from the days of Northern Soul in the 70s to the raves of the 90s. </p> <p>Looking back on this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/aug/03/fiorucci-made-me-hardcore\">fine showcase of British nightlife</a>, there may be countless rave compilations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/26/how-mark-leckey-became-the-artist-of-the-youtube-generation\">on YouTube</a> today, but he made it in a time before social media. \u201cThe internet was in its early stages,\u201d said Leckey. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t email people, I would write people and request VHS tapes and get them converted from analogue to digital. It was a long, involved process; everything became precious and special. It became more about video than rave.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fcb8c71cfb29640b74f8c5fb7796506f1e6c192\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fcb8c71cfb29640b74f8c5fb7796506f1e6c192/0_152_4495_2697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheesy quavers: a half-deflated Felix the Cat, the cartoon character who often pops up in Leckey\u2019s work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheesy quavers: a half-deflated Felix the Cat, the cartoon character who often pops up in Leckey\u2019s work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Enriquez/MoMA PS1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore celebrates the era of boundary-breaking electronic music made on cheap equipment in bedrooms, raves in warehouses and fields, the joy of a young generation seizing upon new technologies to express themselves through dance. \u201cThe same happened to me with video,\u201d said Leckey. \u201cIt was only when I was able to make and edit video at home on a computer that I started making art properly.\u201d</p> <p>And then, of course, there were the drugs, the first explosion of acid house in 1988 fuelled by the widespread availability of ecstasy which, legend has it, made the football casuals who would fight the supporters of rivals teams on the terraces start hugging and dancing with them in the clubs. \u201cRave is a diminishing attempt to find the experience of ecstasy again, not the drug but through other means,\u201d says Leckey. \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the reason to make work, that moment of psychedelic bliss.\u201d</p> <p>His love of sound is personified in his Sound System sculptures from 2001 to 2012, as Leckey has built five functioning sound systems which spew out sporadic, intermittent sounds and songs in the gallery space, from bassy soundscapes to gurgling stomach sounds, \u201cand farting\u201d, adds Leckey. \u201cBasically, I have a huge library of found sounds and I throw them on the speaker systems to see what works best, conceptually and acoustically,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew they had this quality of being both sculptural and sonically powerful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6572ab9408e7b21cbfea96ab04e61301a42b979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6572ab9408e7b21cbfea96ab04e61301a42b979/0_0_4495_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another view of the PS1 show: \u2018As a 52-year-old man, there are things I haven\u2019t resolved\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another view of the PS1 show: \u2018As a 52-year-old man, there are things I haven\u2019t resolved\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Enriquez/MoMA PS1</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Probably the most truth-telling piece in the show is a new, expanded presentation of his 2015 short film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN6-0nwxfFmN0Y1hOJroYUb6vzq7KboZK\">Dream English Kid 1964\u20131999 AD</a>, a sort of autobiography told through TV clips, props that play out personal memories and YouTube videos, like clips of a 1950s housewife trying LSD, videos by the Beatles and a documentary on David Hockney. \u201cI did it to exorcise stuff that was lingering too long inside of me,\u201d said Leckey. \u201cAs a 52-year-old man, there are things I haven\u2019t resolved and am trying to fathom, it\u2019s a self-diagnosis.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s full circle from the challenging time he had in art school, a place he went to meet like-minded people but ended up getting ensnared in the academic concepts.

Race, culture and dining out are explored, and Pashman politely recommends you listen to all four episodes in order. Take his advice and you\u2019ll come out with more questions than answers, in a good way. When you go into a sushi restaurant, do you expect to see Japanese staff? Is it wrong to assume that white people won\u2019t get the best food in an Indian restaurant?</p> <p>Facing your prejudices around dining out is tough and the final instalment is where The Sporkful hits hard, with the extremely likable comedian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wkamaubell?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">W Kamau Bell</a> talking about why he doesn\u2019t wear hoodies in restaurants.

The food\u2019s probably better because they have to serve a lot of different palates.\u201d</p> <p>But one horrifying incident comes out when he tells the tale of a visit to a \u201cfancy coffee shop\u201d in Berkeley. He stopped to talk to his wife, who was sitting outside with their baby and her friends. The staff told him to go away because they thought he was trying to sell something. In fact, he was showing his wife a book he\u2019d just bought. \u201cIt just reminded me that wherever you go, you\u2019re still black,\u201d he says. \u201cMark Zuckerberg can walk in dressed in a hoodie and jeans, whereas if I walk in dressed that way, it means something completely different.\u201d Hearing that he feels like he needs to come across as ultra-friendly (and smaller) to feel comfortable in a restaurant is hard to swallow.

  "<p>In 2013, I contracted a virus that I thought was the flu. It ended up being <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/dengue-sucks-donkey-balls/\">dengue</a>, sometimes referred to as \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d. The nickname is a reference to the levels of pain some people experience when they are in dengue\u2019s throes. I expected my symptoms to subside once the active infection went away. After all, friends who contracted dengue, sometimes multiple years in a row, seemed to return to a sense of normalcy. Instead, the joint pain remained, below the fever pitch of \u201cbreaking bones\u201d but nowhere near my old self. For a long time I waited for that \u201cold self\u201d to materialize, and for the pain to recede. It took three years to finally surrender to my present and admit that the pain wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p> <h2>Pain, fatigue and my new normal</h2> <p>\u201cPain is a message to the mind that something is wrong,\u201d Anna Altman wrote in <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/every-body-goes-haywire/\">a devastating piece</a> about managing her own pain and migraines. \u201cTo this day I guard a hidden hope that I will receive a new diagnosis, one that clearly explains the severity of my symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Like Anna, I don\u2019t have a definitive answer about what to call the aggregate of pain that has taken up residence. However, I do have an idea of how it got there.</p> <p>The scene of the \u201ccrime\u201d: Saigon, where I got dengue fever.</p> <p>I got dengue in Vietnam, while already having celiac disease. It hung out, and wreaked further havoc on my immune system. Doctors have offered up that the dengue triggered post-viral fatigue, which may or may not go away. It also gifted me with <a href=\"http://www.raynauds.org/\">Raynaud\u2019s</a> disease, a disorder of the small blood vessels that reduces blood flow. </p> <p>When exposed to cold, my blood vessels go into spasms, which causes pain, numbness, aching and tingling. When I touch cold food or I am in cold weather, my hands and feet turn white, then blue. I tried making meatballs this summer, but had to stop because touching the ground meat was so painful that I stood in the kitchen in tears. </p> <p>To add to the list, I seem to have lost my fingerprints. I found this out when applying for a visa. After placing my hands on the digital fingerprint reader, all of my fingers had giant red Xs on them. \u201cOh!\u201d said the man reading the scans. \u201cYou have no fingerprints!\u201d <em>Excuse me?</em> I found <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1820184/\">a 1970 study</a> noting that some celiacs have fingerprint atrophy, but mine were definitely intact pre-dengue. A mystery. Jokes about my going out and robbing banks abound, don\u2019t worry.</p> <p>And finally, the most debilitating thing after the joint pain itself has been the fatigue. A deep, never-ending bone weariness that makes simple things seem like obstacles. And a restless sleep that does not provide respite from the haze of exhaustion.</p> <p>The combination of chronic pain, circulation issues and fatigue combined to compress my resilience and made it difficult to see the forest through the trees. Emotionally, it felt like small disagreements loomed large. I found myself more reactive than before, taking things more personally.</p> <p>Instead of facing my days with resolve, I started curling into myself, warding off intrusions that might make things hurt more. I started fearing the next shoe that could drop, and wondering if I would be able to cope. Anxiety can be magnificently destructive, but when combined with chronic pain it becomes paralyzing. Worrying about whether you can withstand more pain is a valid concern. But as I eventually figured out, it only serves to make things worse.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evQ16l\">Full Catastrophe Living</a>, Jon Kabat-Zinn notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you have a chronic illness or a disability that prevents you from doing what you used to be able to do, whole areas of control may go up in smoke. And if your condition causes you physical pain that has not responded well to medical treatment, the distress you might be feeling can be compounded by emotional turmoil caused by knowing that your condition seems to be beyond even your doctor\u2019s control.</p> </blockquote> <p>My distress was compounded by the fact that I looked healthy, even though I was in pain all of the time. \u201cYou seem great!\u201d friends would say, glimpsing a photo on Facebook. Some would tell me to take supplements, or to just \u201cthink positive\u201d about the pain and live my life as I used to. They meant well, of course. But the comments reveal a dismissiveness about longer-term pain that other friends with \u201cinvisible illnesses\u201d struggle with also. It\u2019s as if people expected us to will it away. If only we had thought about being more positive! How silly of us.</p> <p><a href=\"https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/\">The Spoon Theory</a> explains the effects of invisible pain with very effective imagery. You only have a certain amount of \u201cspoons\u201d in a day, and you use them to do things that most people don\u2019t think twice about. Because for you, being in constant pain, even simple things require spoons. So everything you do, every decision you make about undertaking activities, it comes with the knowledge that there\u2019s a spoon-like opportunity cost. And if you use up all your spoons that day, that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t do anything but rest, since you are so depleted.</p> <p>The problem is that for most people, pain is temporary. When it becomes a full-time roommate, the things that used to help \u2013 going to the gym to work through it, climbing a mountain and communing with nature, going to a concert \u2013 become threats instead of pleasurable experiences. And for many, that kind of sustained bracing is beyond contemplation.</p> <p>No matter the challenges in my life, be it someone who bet me I <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/why-i-quit-my-job-to-travel-around-the-world/\">couldn\u2019t get into law school </a>or the other <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/three-years-of-sickness-and-travel-by-the-numbers/\">illnesses on my travels</a>, I have always found a way around. This time felt different, because the pain was ongoing and frustratingly opaque.</p> <p>The Portuguese have a word I love, <em>saudade</em>.

A wistful longing for something that may never return. After so long, seeking an answer to \u201cfix\u201d the pain was not helping. I only turned toward healing once I forced that deep, destructive nostalgia out of my mind.</p> <h2>Turning things around</h2> <p>In her <a href=\"https://blog.longreads.com/2016/09/14/stat/\">long, thoughtful piece</a> about her daughter Carmen\u2019s MS journey, Maria Bustillos interviewed a doctor named George Jelinek. Dr Jelinek referred to the difference between \u201chealing\u201d and \u201ccuring\u201d, with the central message that it really matters to take a more active role in the care of our own bodies. Ultimately, if you fall through the cracks of the medical system, or if you fail to receive a diagnosis that has clear, actionable treatment, you have to take some control back for your own sense of self and health.</p> <p>Maria\u2019s reaction to his philosophy was one of comfort:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Being encouraged to take care of herself made a world of difference to Carmen, and to us. We weren\u2019t waiting around for the next bad thing to happen; we were working together in a diligent and increasingly hopeful state of mind.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the absence of finding a solution to stop <em>feeling</em> pain, I found hope in being able to reframe my attitude <em>toward</em> the pain. This included actively cultivating a sense of self-compassion, acceptance and gratitude. These are all words that pre-travel Jodi would have taken a look at and rolled her eyes forever.</p> <p>Simply accepting what is unmanageable and not trying to control what you cannot change is a marked shift from my old way of thinking. It is also directly in conflict with the way I was raised in western society. \u201cGive up and just accept that things suck? Are you <em>kidding</em>?\u201d But it is the only way that I have been able to turn things around. By focusing on my progress (or lack thereof), I was making a difficult situation more untenable. Now, I celebrate the small steps I have started to take instead of fighting for bigger goals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/when-pain-persists-what-makes-hospital-patients-really-unhappy\">When pain persists: what makes hospital patients really unhappy? | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rachel, a reader of mine who contracted dengue and malaria at the same time, has struggled with issues of chronic pain and fatigue. Her journey mirrored mine, except that she was able to see a pain specialist in her home country. She and I have gone back and forth about our experiences, and our respective attempts to find joy in a life that is now different for each of us. For her, too, it has meant accepting the pain and not struggling against it. She has also actively sought out what brings her joy. \u201cI had to try and look for joy and gratitude even when I didn\u2019t feel it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis became reflexive, and somewhat automatic.\u201d</p> <p>Like me, Rachel wasn\u2019t brought up to seek out gratitude moment to moment. But she too found that focusing on it, even if things hurt, helped shape the outline of her healing.</p> <h2>How I learned to cope with chronic pain</h2> <p>The most important, most difficult, most fundamentally frustrating thing is this: you simply need to accept that this is your reality, and move forward from there. Even when moving forward feels like crawling on the floor, a millimeter at a time. Even when progress feels elusive, and you can\u2019t bend your hands in the morning. The only thing you can do is care for yourself and try to find solutions that work for the body you\u2019ve been given.</p> <p>I do want to add that I have experimented with a lot of different diet-based changes, supplements and therapies. I have been tested for inflammation markers in the blood (thankfully they\u2019re low), and thyroid disorders, and many other things. While I appreciate those telling me that I should try x and y thing that will magically fix it, with all due respect, I have tried many of those things.</p> <p>The pain is here, and it may be here to stay. All I can do is carve out my own joy within it, and accept that it is now a part of who I am.</p> <p><strong>1. Daily meditation</strong>: I meditate both morning and night, and while there are times where I feel resistant to the practice, I cannot deny that it makes a big difference. Meditation has helped <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/vipassana-meditation/\">accepting what my body is feeling moment to moment</a>, and also reduced reactivity in other areas of my life.</p> <p>2. <strong>Read.</strong> I read three very helpful books for stress and pain management. The following books are three of the dozens and dozens that I have read in the realm of pain management, stress, self-help and more. They are books that I will return to, because they tackle the precise tool that has helped turn things around: my attitude toward the pain. I highly recommend all three, and each of them were suggestions from close friends who found them comforting. I\u2019ll be posting book summaries of these soon also.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evPCAS\">Full Catastrophe Living</a>, by Jon Kabat-Zinn. As the creator of mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes, Zinn focuses on mind-body strategies derived from meditation and yoga to counteract stress, establish greater balance of body and mind, and help you get out of the rut of fearing pain.</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2dN108Y\">Self-Compassion</a>, by Kristin Neff. Self-esteem work isn\u2019t the fix to perfectionism, argues Neff. Accepting the present, being kind and compassionate to ourselves and still striving to do better is. The book offers exercises and questions in each chapter to help.</li> <li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2evOTQj\">When Things Fall Apart</a>, by Pema Chodron. I picked this book up a few years ago, but wasn\u2019t really ready to read it. Or rather, I was not yet willing to accept the pain and change my perspective about it. I was still looking for a fix. Chodron writes that when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety and pain, the way out is to stop bracing against it and learning to stay open. Not easy, and you have to be willing to read her words without judgment, but I\u2019ve found them very helpful.</li> </ul> <p>3.<strong> I started to understand that resilience is a process</strong>. Like many overachievers, I trafficked in perfectionism for most of my life. I\u2019ve had to let that go. Warding off imperfection doesn\u2019t make us stronger, even if it feels like it might protect us. As with opening your heart to others, cultivating openness makes you resilient, not weaker. For chronic pain, baby steps feel like giant leaps. Progress doesn\u2019t happen overnight.</p> <p>4.<strong> Accepting what is</strong>. One of my best friends often mentions \u201cmagical thinking\u201d, that wishful place when you \u201cwhat if\u201d something to oblivion. Magical thinking isn\u2019t reality, it\u2019s simply a story you are telling yourself. Instead of my fantasy that I\u2019d wake up healthy one day, I\u2019ve worked on accepting what is. I\u2019m a person with significant pain problems, and I\u2019m availing myself of tools to cope better. It is what it is. All you can do is work with the reality you are living, and for me that meant accepting that these limits are valid and I need to respect them.</p> <p>5.<strong> Practicing gratitude</strong>. A friend argued that my <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/\">blog</a> is a practice of gratitude, since it shares the many wonderful things I\u2019ve encountered and appreciated during my travels. While that\u2019s true, it also hasn\u2019t been enough to help me in this journey with pain. What has helped is very simple: writing down three things at the end of each day that I am grateful for, within my reality. There is <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/expandinggratitude\">science behind this practice</a>, despite my initial skepticism. Nowadays I\u2019m all for reminding myself of the good in my life, which is plentiful despite the pain.</p> <p>6.<strong> Implement movement wherever you can.</strong> Walking when the pain is slightly better, doing restorative yoga classes (highly recommended and far more gentle than a different type of yoga class), stretching and taking stairs when they are around. Every little bit of movement counts. I\u2019m used to it hurting when I move but I still try to move when I can.</p> <p>7. <strong>Trying to find joy in this new space</strong>. As I mentioned above, the things that brought me joy were the ones that now hurt. I had to get creative with the things that <em>were </em>available. I started to make lists, with a hat tip to the app <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> \u2013 if this, then that. I made two-column sheets: if this isn\u2019t available then I\u2019ll do that instead. If I can\u2019t climb a mountain, I can go for a long walk in the park. If I can\u2019t eat chillies, I can cook a fun meal at home. And so on.</p> <p>8. <strong>Morning and evening routines</strong>. These are <em>very</em> simple routines \u2013 not the \u201chow I hacked my mornings and became The Most Productive Entrepreneur Ever\u201d lists. I have found that even if it is a really painful day and I feel like it was a wash, I still feel like I accomplished something if I stick to them.</p> <p>9. <strong>Diet changes.</strong> Some of what has worked for me:</p> <ul> <li>This may be common sense to the rest of humanity, but I\u2019ve spent most of my life in a state of normalized dehydration. It\u2019s amazing how much better I feel when I drink water. It\u2019s as though everyone else telling me I was crazy for not drinking more of it was right.</li> <li>Cutting out caffeine except for that one (glorious) cup of coffee per day.</li> <li>Cutting out alcohol, with rare exceptions.</li> <li>Cutting down on sugar as much as possible. It\u2019s in a lot of foods, and I do put a spoon in my coffee, but I have eliminated desserts and snacks that have sugar.</li> <li>Taking a robust probiotic daily.</li> <li>I am already celiac, so I don\u2019t eat gluten but I have found when I do nowadays by mistake it\u2019s far worse than it was pre-dengue. So I\u2019m extra careful about cross-contamination. When my joints are particularly bad, I also cut out corn and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae\">nightshades</a>.</li> </ul> <p>10.<strong> Connect with others.</strong> Chronic pain has a tendency to make you feel alone and misunderstood. While it\u2019s true that some people may not grasp the extent of it, no doubt if they are true friends they will love you all the same. Connecting to friends who accept me despite the current limitations has been really important in helping me out of my foggy isolation. I also appreciate friends and the three readers named Rachel who have been willing to share their experiences with chronic pain and immune disorders. As humans, we are wired for connecting to others and it\u2019s times like these that we need to remind ourselves to do so.</p>",
  "<h2>THE SOUND OF INEVITABILITY</h2> <p>Wicked bigots, a number of whom have recently been trying to seize control of England, are in an advanced state of confusion today as they try to make sense of what they saw during Wednesday night\u2019s West Ham v Chelsea joust in the Coca-Cola Cup. Footage and photographs across a variety of media outlets clearly show rows of valiant individuals trying to stop hordes of mostly white savages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/27/fa-west-ham-chelsea-crowd-trouble-investigation\">from tearing into each other</a> and spilling rivers of blood in the stands in the name of some ancient tribal feud.

Of course, the fact that around 10,000 tickets went unsold for the game suggests that many people foresaw the outbreak of violent stupidity, having picked up the clues from West Ham\u2019s previous attempts to safeguard supporters at their spacious new home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/05/west-ham-karren-brady-stadium-move\">That new brand</a> that Karren Brady said she and her highly respected employers want to give West Ham isn\u2019t looking too hot right now.

As a Newcastle fan, I was almost at the point of feeling the same way. The experience of looking at the results with a mixture of excitement and expectation is without doubt better than looking at them with a mixture of dread and frustration. So much so that I was on the cusp of preferring life in the Championship to that of life in the best league in the world. However, that was before I saw Football on 5: The Championship for the first time. Having to watch the highlights of a winning performance on what appears to be an A-level media studies project, staffed by pundits whose only qualification for the role seems to be that they own a suit, has killed my budding love for my team\u2019s new league.

  "<p>Leaving the EU could present positive opportunities for Britain\u2019s arts and creative industries rather than the feared disasters \u2013 but only if the government takes the right decisions on a series of important issues, a report delivered to ministers argues.</p> <p>The findings are in a report by the <a href=\"http://www.creativeindustriesfederation.com/\">Creative Industries Federation</a>, which draws on evidence from around 500 contributors, many of whom attended 11 quickly-convened \u201cwhat next\u201d meetings across the UK after the vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>John Kampfner, the federation\u2019s chief executive, said there were opportunities to be seized because of Brexit and that the government needed to see the sector as a \u201cmassive asset\u201d which it could \u201cwork more closely with in the new agenda\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no time for lament. It is absolutely vital for this sector to be incredibly involved in helping the government to forge a very practical relationship between the UK, the EU and the sector. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to roll up our sleeves and work through all the various areas where there are deep and ongoing concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Kampfner gave the example of how the creative industries tend to employ a higher proportion of international workers than other sectors because of longstanding skills shortages. </p> <p>One key hope in the report is that the government creates \u201ca visa system for the 21st century\u201d enabling easy access to \u201cworld class talent\u201d and recognising the importance of freelance employees.</p> <p>At the other end there needed to be a \u201creboot\u201d of education and training so young people could fill the jobs where there are skills shortages \u2013 in sectors such as animation and visual effects.</p> <p>Kampfner said: \u201cIf the sector is not to just continue to be strong, but to grow further and employ more British workers in that endeavour, the education and skills agenda has to adapt as quickly to help foster that.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/huge-creative-step-backwards-arts-view-brexit-eu-referendum\">Hardly anyone in the arts world was in favour of Brexit</a> with 96% coming out against in a federation poll of its members. The most immediate effect has been the weak pound making it markedly more expensive for arts organisations who commission and stage a lot of work from overseas companies.</p> <p>The creative industries, whether theatre, games, heritage, fashion or film, constitute the fastest growing sector of the UK economy and should be at the heart of new international trade deals, the report says.</p> <p>The 73-page Brexit report, being presented on Thursday to the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, has been welcomed by a raft of arts and creative leaders. It is complete with data, analysis and recommendations around the key dilemmas facing cultural organisations in a post-Brexit world. They include the visa system, education and training, intellectual property and funding.</p> <p>The peer and businesswoman Martha Lane Fox said: \u201cWithout great data and great analysis you can\u2019t make great decisions. With so much at stake for our creative sectors in light of Brexit, we need this kind of work more than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of Tate who will next year become new chair of Arts Council England, said the success of Tate had depended on the ability to employ people from across the EU at all levels.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, this is an essential ingredient in creating one of the world\u2019s great galleries. We attract significant numbers of international visitors and a staff with different kinds of cultural and educational experience helps us to understand what engages these audiences. </p> <p>\u201cAs the government works out arrangements for the future, we would not want any artificial barriers erected which might make it harder for us to attract the skills that we need in order to serve our public well.\u201d</p> <p>The report also calls on the government to appreciate the role that the creative industries have in healing fractures in society caused by the referendum.</p> <p>Other recommendations include the government conducting an audit of existing EU funding to the creative sector to identify what should be replaced by the UK, and upholding intellectual property rights in trade deals, especially with markets which have bad copyright infringement records.</p> <p>The designer Sir John Sorrell, who founded the Creative Industries Federation, said: \u201cIt has taken two decades and more to turn our creative industries from an afterthought to a key driver of wealth and global success. To imperil that would be to imperil our wider economy. That is why we need to be at the heart of the new government\u2019s industrial strategy and negotiating priorities in coming months.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019re sitting outside a pub in Camden Town, north London, watching the world go by. This is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madness\">Madness</a>\u2019s old stamping ground. Forty years on, it\u2019s still their stamping ground. The man who just passed, says singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/13/suggs-madness-interview\">Suggs</a> (Graham McPherson), is the richest fella in Camden. A couple of hundred yards away is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/03/london.music\">the Dublin Castle</a>, the Irish pub where Madness were given their first residency. You\u2019ve got to watch the world, says saxophonist Kix (AKA El Thommo, AKA Lee Thompson), drink it all in. If you aren\u2019t watching, he says, you might as well call it a day.</p> <p>Which is what Madness did for six years from 1986 to 1992. The fun had gone for pop\u2019s most fun band. The self-proclaimed Nutty Boys had spent years bringing smiles back to the upper regions of the charts \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIe_sjKeAY\">Our House</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmezIIrFQmY\">It Must Be Love</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJOLwy7un3U\">Baggy Trousers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ2X9SANsME\">House of Fun</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw-8AGRcyvk\">My Girl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpN_TOP9hg8\">Embarrassment</a>, and so many more. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kinks\">the Kinks</a> before them, they chronicled London, but their version was less lyrical; more singalong, more laddy. It was music at its most infectious.</p> <p>Now Madness are back with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Touch-Us-Now-Madness/dp/B01JOMSHSG\">Can\u2019t Touch Us Now</a>, their 12th album. The tunes haven\u2019t changed much over the decades, but there is a new depth to their storytelling. Here are wonderful character vignettes, about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NKNGKNBYs0\">Mr Apples</a>, (devout by day, whorer by night) and Pam the Hawk (London\u2019s most skilled tramp, who pisses her earnings away on fruit machines).</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping to meet all six of Madness in the pub, but their publicist says that will be impossible. Why? Well, it\u2019s hard to get them all together at any one time, he says. Which is true. But it turns out there is another, more important reason. You won\u2019t be able to cope with them all, he says. In the end, we settle on Suggs and Kix. It turns out the publicist was right. Just the two are a handful.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuvdeEC5y8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rXuvdeEC5y8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Madness were every bit as nutty as they made out. Kix had done time in borstal for stealing cars; Suggs was an aspiring football hooligan. There was nothing special about that back then, Suggs says \u2013 they were all hoolies. \u201cEverybody from the estate I grew up on went to the football, and you ran around shouting at people and booting people up the arse. We were all prone to behaving badly.\u201d</p> <p>Kix doesn\u2019t like to think what would have become of him if he hadn\u2019t found Madness. He talks of an old friend from the criminal fraternity who recently died. \u201cThere was only two people at the church. His son and his brother. They couldn\u2019t bury him for four or five weeks because they couldn\u2019t afford the coffin. Very sad. Real sad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore so for Kix but, for all of us, that band was a saviour from getting stuck in the world that had been preordained,\u201d Suggs says. He pauses. \u201cPre-whatever-it\u2019s-called.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs is a big lad these days, with imposing gnashers and a hint of James Bond\u2019s Jaws about him. Kix looks like the kind of wheeler-dealer you would have second thoughts about returning soiled goods to. They are smoking liquorice-flavoured rollies and supping on half-pints of lager while reminiscing about their pre-Madness days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afa64e0d164d3b28ea2e5057edb10e6d3e5c13f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afa64e0d164d3b28ea2e5057edb10e6d3e5c13f5/0_0_5150_3750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suggs: \u2018that band was a saviour from getting stuck in the world that had been preordained.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"728\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suggs: \u2018That band was a saviour from getting stuck in the world that had been preordained.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virginia Turbett/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-o-toole\">Peter O\u2019Toole</a>\u2019s daughter would have a house party in Hampstead and they\u2019d be away and there\u2019d be 150 people in the house for a weekend,\u201d Suggs says.</p> <p>Wow, I say, how come you were invited to such posh parties?</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get invited, no!\u201d they say simultaneously, and start giggling.</p> <p>\u201cWe invited ourselves and sometimes left with an odd record or two,\u201d Kix says. \u201cA suitcase appeared out of the window with a knotted sheet.\u201d</p> <p>A police car passes with its siren blaring. \u201cThey\u2019ll never sell ice-cream at that speed,\u201d Kix says. And they\u2019re in fits again.</p> <p>They were funny old days, they say \u2013 rough, too. Mods, rockers, Teddy boys, all spoiling for a fight, and hapless hippies caught in between. They had a pal with long hair and opinions who had cause to regret both. \u201cHe turned up at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazooka_Joe_(band)\">Bazooka Joe</a> gig. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-ant\">Adam Ant</a> was the bass player, and [Madness keyboard player] Mike Barson\u2019s elder brother was the singer. They were the band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols\">the Sex Pistols</a> supported in the first-ever gig they did at Central St Martin\u2019s. That\u2019s the history of that,\u201d Suggs says, who does pride himself on being a bit of a social historian.</p> <p>Kix: \u201cAnyway, our mate with the hair had a disagreement about something and he took a chain over the head.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs: \u201cThey were the days ... bicycle chains.\u201d</p> <p>Kix: \u2018\u201cBicycle chains, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>At times, they sound like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/02/derek-and-clive-rerelease\">Derek and Clive</a> sketch.</p> <p>What happened to their mate?</p> <p>Kix: \u201cHe ended up getting several stitches in his head and shaved his head from that day on.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs: \u201cLegend has it that\u2019s why we all got short hair at that time, when it wasn\u2019t fashionable.\u201d Though, to be fair, he says, he can\u2019t remember.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"132b7d151a8034b35a6f1e6b9b8e1a2cf48c02ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/132b7d151a8034b35a6f1e6b9b8e1a2cf48c02ac/0_332_2997_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Legend has it that\u2019s why we all got short hair at that time ...\u2019 Performing in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Legend has it that\u2019s why we all got short hair at that time ...\u2019 Performing in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madness formed as the North London Invaders in 1976, and by 1979 they were making hits. The all-white band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/12/madness-pay-tribute-to-prince-buster-ska-legend\">playing black music</a> attracted a racist following in the early days. \u201cIt was very tough for us,\u201d Suggs says. \u201cNo one can know what we went through, seeing a thousand people sieg heiling. We\u2019d jump in the audience to try to put people off, but there came a point where it was overwhelming. It was fucking everybody, and you\u2019d see the NF geezers at the back organising these skinheads. You\u2019d see people you knew with a swastika tattooed the wrong way round on their forehead. I don\u2019t think they even knew what the fuck they were on about. We got the credit for it, but they were doing it at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-specials\">Specials</a> concerts, too. It was all over the place for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs says Madness took the blame because, in one interview, one member had said he didn\u2019t mind who came to the gigs so long as people had fun. \u201cThe headline comes out that we don\u2019t care who comes to our gigs, with the implication that we were encouraging racist skinheads, which we certainly weren\u2019t. All we could do in interviews is say, \u2018We don\u2019t like it,\u2019 and continue to make music of black origin.\u201d He grins. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the brightest sparks.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from that, they say, those were wonderful days. \u201cIt was a bunch of fellas just having a whole lot of fun,\u201d Kix says.

All the arts are just fucking old Etonians and that is a big problem. And it\u2019s boring. Where are the urchins? We certainly wouldn\u2019t be sitting here now.\u201d</p> <p>Madness were a constant presence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/26/top-of-the-pops-50-bbc-bring-it-back\">Top of the Pops</a> back then. They would get to Television Centre early and pass the day boozing.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to know the commissionaire at the BBC bar, an old Irish geezer who would let us in because he liked us. And we\u2019d have eight hours in the fuckin\u2019 bar,\u201d Kix says.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time we went down to the set, we were off our crackers,\u201d Suggs says. \u201cD\u2019you know we got banned from Top of the Pops four times?\u201d</p> <p>He starts counting on his fingers. \u201cWell, there was the time our saxophonist turned up with a T-shirt that said, \u2018I need the BBC,\u2019 and he pulled it off and the one beneath said, \u2018like a hole in the fuckin\u2019 head\u2019. Another time we got banned because one member whose brother was in prison pulled out a card that said: \u2018Hello, prisoner number B46244\u2019 or whatever. It was: \u201cCut! CUT!\u201d Deadly silence. And the producer, Michael Hurll, pointed at your main man and said, \u2018You\u2019re an embarrassment to yourself, an embarrassment to the BBC\u2019, and I\u2019m sure he said, \u2018You\u2019re an embarrassment to the Queen\u2019, at the end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"888064862c8e8efae18c1350f09bc51bab2b2c26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/888064862c8e8efae18c1350f09bc51bab2b2c26/0_748_4528_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On stage at The Tube.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage at The Tube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there was the time, 10 minutes before the show went on air, that they deliberately stopped the lift they were sharing with a group of dancers by jumping up and down. \u201cThere were 10 of us in there,\u201d Kix says. \u201cThey had big fur coats on and, if you opened the fur coat, there was all the tackle on underneath. There was a lot of rubbing going on, a lot of jumping up and down. I was full of beans. I was in a lift with a load of furry things, and I just couldn\u2019t help myself. The fire service had to rescue us.\u201d</p> <p>Suggs snorts so much at the memory that his beer goes down the wrong way. \u201cDon\u2019t choke on that, Suggs,\u201d Kix says. \u201cIt\u2019s coming out of your nose.\u201d</p> <p>Any excuse they had to dress up, they did. \u201cThe costumes got more bizarre and extreme,\u201d Suggs says, \u201cand one day our saxophonist turned up as an exploding traffic warden. Hehehehe! Hoohoohoo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne time we got our hands on authentic coppers\u2019 uniforms,\u201d Kix says. \u201cNow, can you imagine the fun we had out on the streets in them, truncheons and everything? When we discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/clash\">the Clash</a> were rehearsing around the corner \u2026 \u2018Nobody move! It\u2019s the police!\u2019 Two of them run in the toilet. Just the sound of doors slamming and toilets flushing. They never spoke to us for five years. It must have been good gear, eh?

We got pissed off with each other all the time. I mean Chris and Kix nearly killed each other.\u201d Guitarist Chrissy Boy Foreman attacked Kix with a knife and fork. Another time, Chrissy Boy came at him with two bottles. \u201cIf it had been Jack Daniels bottles, I wouldn\u2019t have minded, but he\u2019s come in with two Perrier bottles. I thought: \u2018Chris, what you going to do with those?\u2019 Then we ended up hugging a couple of hours later. As you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, the odd blow has been thrown,\u201d Suggs says, \u201cbut not many, considering.\u201d</p> <p>After the band split up in 1986, they fell on hard times. \u201cWe all got a bit potless,\u201d Suggs says. But you became a successful television presenter, I say. Yes, for a while, he explains, but then he blew it. \u201cI won three awards at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/23/royal-television-society-awards-2016-full-list-of-winners\">Royal Television Society</a>, I got on the stage and said: \u2018You can stick television up your arse.\u2019 Needless to say, I was only joking, but I never worked again. It\u2019s true \u2013 never got another job again. They don\u2019t forget that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>In the 90s, Madness reformed but, creatively, it was a sterile period. \u201cWe were tempted into the black hole of 80s nostalgia,\u201d Suggs says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like dancing on the spot,\u201d Kix says. \u201cDoing the same thing over and over.\u201d It solved their money problems, but little else. They talk about artists who go on for ever, reheating the same old classics. \u201cThey call it Rod Stewart syndrome,\u201d Suggs says, \u201cIf you\u2019re just sitting on artificial grass next to your swimming pool in LA, there\u2019s not much to fuckin\u2019 write about, is there?\u201d</p> <p>Madness did not have Los Angeles homes, but they had their own homegrown version of Rod Stewart syndrome. They had stopped observing life. If they were to produce something worthwhile, they realised they had to take a fresh look at the world. The result was the 2009 concept album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/14/madness-liberty-norton-folgate\">The Liberty of Norton Folgate</a>, which is as rooted in historical London as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/peterackroyd\">Peter Ackroyd</a> at his finest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ym7TfXt-aA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ym7TfXt-aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After a disappointing followup album, the band are back to their observational best with Can\u2019t Touch Us Now.

She said: \u2018All right, nutty boy?\u2019 as she walked past,\u201d Suggs says. \u201cIt made me laugh because I\u2019m 55 fucking years old, but it\u2019s such a Winehouse thing to say. \u2018All right, nutty boy?\u2019 It really got me. What a sad thing.\u201d</p> <p>And, for once, the banter stops. Suggs stares across the street and you can almost see the memories revisiting. This place, this town, this city, has provided such inspiration down the decades. He talks about some of the amazing residents he has met from Arlington House, a local hostel for the homeless. \u201cThe fella in an undertaker\u2019s outfit, the fella dressed as a sailor, full of stories.

  "<p>The only real question about the chaotic closure of the Calais camp that has left lone children sleeping out in the open is whether it is the result of incompetence or deliberate policy.</p> <p>When the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\">Amber Rudd</a>, and the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, met on 10 October to finalise plans to close the camp, they say they agreed on the importance of keeping all children safe during the clearance operation.</p> <p>But there appears to have been little discussion of how that was going to happen in practice. The French ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, disclosed earlier this week that the government rejected a request to take all the lone child refugees to Britain before the camp closure began.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we asked the British government is to take all unaccompanied children, and they said they want to process the cases and check if they have families [in Britain].

It seems to be early morning. Remember a time you greeted the dawn after a club, or waiting for a Greek ferry. But this is different. There\u2019s no bed to go to and no destination in sight. A camp that provided some kind of desperate community is being demolished. The people here are falling into a gap in the modern world. They look like they are bound for a homeless future. These are the people we have decided we have no space for, no interest in and no compassion towards. This is the result \u2013 people mingling with discarded plastic bottles in the streets of abandonment. For human beings don\u2019t disappear, unless you actually kill them. They stand around, slump in blankets, lie wrapped up and trying to dream of somewhere better. Here they are \u2013 the unwanted.</p> <p>We have no Statue of Liberty, of course. There is no poem of welcome and generosity engraved on the white cliffs of Dover to shame our failure of imagination with the words put up in New York harbour in 1903: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to think of an image that more perfectly expresses the migrant condition \u2013 as Emma Lazarus acutely summed it up in the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus\">poem she wrote for the Statue of Liberty</a> \u2013 than this.

There is no case in history when a wave of hatred was justified or grounded in fact. Yet such waves of fear and loathing can be so forceful and widespread that they appear completely sane to those affected, and are hard to resist. There was no rational basis for the antisemitism that made Rothko\u2019s family flee Russia. Labour MPs who think the left needs to accept the current anti-migrant mood are utterly wrong because such moods can and do thrive independently of fact.

But the British government persistently failed to act, despite its legal obligations. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to project the refugee crisis as if it is always someone else\u2019s problem. In failing to address the inhuman conditions in Calais, the government excuses itself, claiming that it is primarily a French problem.</p> <p>This is a recurring theme of the official response to this emergency.

If they do avoid death or drowning, we regard it as Italy\u2019s or Greece\u2019s problem. Other European countries take the approach that they are rescuing refugees; others, such as Germany and Sweden, actually want to offer them refuge.</p> <p>There is an alternative. Britain could take far more refugees than it has done to date. It could first prioritise all those who have a legal right to be here. It could use the Royal Navy to rescue people, even while it clamped down on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/uk-warship-to-tackle-libya-people-smugglers\" title=\"\">people smugglers</a>. It could end the scandalous conditions at any new Calais camp by accepting refugees and establishing a safe and sanitary processing centre. This should be a moral imperative. As it happens, it would also be a benefit to all of us. Sweden\u2019s economy is booming in part because of a growth in both refugees and migrants.</p> <p>Britain could also collaborate with all those internationally who are trying to establish safe and legal routes for refugees from conflict zones. We should act now to prevent further conflicts and to tackle climate change, two of the major causes of modern mass displacement of people. Otherwise this generation of British politicians will be remembered as one that knew what was happening and did nothing to help.</p>",

  "<p>Freedom Studios is a Bradford theatre company with a habit of cropping up in the city\u2019s most unexpected locations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/27/bradford-mill-city-of-dreams\">The Mill: City of Dreams</a> was staged in an abandoned weaving shed, and focused on the city\u2019s industrial past. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/06/now-arriving-at-bradford-bus-station-new-play-celebrating-immigration\">Brief Encounters at Bradford Interchange</a> was a theatrical intervention at the railway station, which brought the story of the city\u2019s migrant communities into the present day. Now, Tajinder Singh Hayer\u2019s North Country presents a post-apocalyptic vision of Bradford\u2019s future.</p> <p>Once again, it\u2019s the interplay of theme and environment that makes Freedom Studio\u2019s work distinctive. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more authentically post-apocalyptic atmosphere than the <a href=\"http://wildwoodsbradford.co.uk/\">Wild Woods</a>, a pop-up arts venue located in the basement of an abandoned Marks &amp; Spencer. This, you sense, is how communities will continue to live following the collapse of civilisation \u2013 hunkered down on a bare expanse where the socks and underpants used to be.</p> <p>Hayer imagines a very near future in which a plague has wiped out most of the world\u2019s population, leaving three Bradford teenagers to deal with the problem of survival. Alleyne has the resources of his father\u2019s farm; Harvinder the dwindling medical supplies left by his doctor parents; and Nusrat the makings of a textile empire within the city\u2019s old mill-working communities. What emerges is a form of feudalism based on dynastic marriages, the payment of tithes and a bartering system based on the scarcity of food. </p> <p>The measure of good science fiction is what it has to tell us about the present, and Hayer\u2019s scenario unfolds like a bleak inversion of the current immigration crisis. Nusrat\u2019s journey ends with a hopeful walk through the Channel tunnel; and it is hard not to hear reference to \u201cfires on the Leeds road\u201d without considering images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/calais-refugee-children-sleeping-rough-demolition-charities-france\">the clearing of the Calais refugee camp</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1e2dff72e398da89186a5d309cd2f1095090217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1e2dff72e398da89186a5d309cd2f1095090217/0_49_3283_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Duguid-McQuillan as Alleyne and Natalie Davies as Nusrat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Duguid-McQuillan as Alleyne and Natalie Davies as Nusrat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Spadafora</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plot does perhaps overplay its hand with a coda projecting as far as 2058 (here\u2019s a foretaste: Marks &amp; Spencer won\u2019t be back in business).

It is followed by Iraq and Syria, where members of Isis murdered at least six journalists over the past year.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a73f5cd01b4f7562bd273bd74c3fadca309d901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a73f5cd01b4f7562bd273bd74c3fadca309d901/39_0_956_1194/801.png\" alt=\"The global index report.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The global index report.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: CPJ</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, extremist groups have also repeatedly targeted journalists with impunity in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Pakistan. They appear on the index for at least the second consecutive year. </p> <p>At the same time, violence perpetrated against journalists by criminal groups and local officials allowed impunity to tighten its grip in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico each moving two spots higher on the index this year. </p> <p>The index, published annually to mark the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_to_End_Impunity_for_Crimes_Against_Journalists\">International day to end impunity for crimes against journalists</a> on 2 November, calculates the number of unsolved murders over a 10-year period as a percentage of each country\u2019s population. </p> <p>For the current edition, CPJ analysed journalist murders that took place between 1 September 2006 and 31 August, 2016. Only those nations with five or more unsolved cases for this period are included on the index \u2014 a threshold that 13 countries met this year, compared with 14 last year. </p> <p>In rank order (with the numbers of unsolved murders in brackets) they are: <strong>1.</strong> Somalia (24); <strong>2.</strong> Iraq (71); <strong>3.</strong> Syria (17); <strong>4.</strong> Philippines (41); <strong>5.</strong> South Sudan (5); <strong>6.</strong> Mexico (21); <strong>7.</strong> Afghanistan (5); <strong>8.</strong> Pakistan (21); <strong>9.</strong> Brazil (15); <strong>10.</strong> Russia (9); <strong>11.</strong> Bangladesh (7); <strong>12</strong>. Nigeria (5); <strong>13.</strong> India (13). </p> <p>Cases are considered unsolved when no convictions have been obtained (cases in which some, but not all, perpetrators are held to justice are classified as partial impunity and are not included in the tally). <br></p> <p>While militant extremists are responsible for the greatest numbers of attacks against journalists in recent years, they are not the only ones getting away with murder, nor are conflict zones the only place where impunity thrives. </p> <p>For example, the Philippines is placed fourth in the index because of the failure to prosecute any of the perpetrators behind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao_massacre\">the 2009 massacre in Maguindanao</a>, in which 32 journalists and media workers were killed. </p> <p>In Mexico and Brazil, criminal groups and government officials are also leading suspects in murders of journalists in Russia and India. Each of those countries except Brazil has appeared on the index since its inception.</p> <p>Sri Lanka, where violence against journalists has receded since the end of a decades-long civil war, dropped off the list for the first time since CPJ began calculating the index in 2008.</p> <p> CPJ recorded only four unsolved murders in Sri Lanka for the latest 10-year period, leading to its elimination from the index. Amid the country\u2019s becalmed political climate, no journalist there has been murdered in direct connection to journalism since editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasantha_Wickrematunge\">Lasantha Wickramatunga</a> was killed in 2009. </p> <p>Justice has not been achieved in any murder despite a pledge from the president, Maithripala Sirisena, to reinvestigate old killings. But Wickramatunga\u2019s case did inch forward this year with one arrest and the exhumation of the editor\u2019s body for a new post-mortem.</p> <p>Impunity is widely recognised as one of the greatest threats to press freedom, and international pressure to address it has mounted in recent years, with states, in- cluding some of the repeat offenders on this list, beginning to respond. </p> <p>Six countries on the index \u2014 Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, and Somalia \u2014 convicted perpetrators of journalist killings in the past year, up from three countries in the previous year\u2019s report.</p> <p>In another positive development, more countries on this year\u2019s index participated in Unesco\u2019s impunity accountability mechanism, which requests information on the status of investigations into killed journalists. </p> <p>In previous years, half of the countries on the index ignored this process. This year, only three states among the 13 index countries \u2014 India, South Sudan and Syria \u2014failed to respond. </p> <p>Other findings that emerged from the index: </p> <p>\u2022 Eight of the countries have been listed each year since CPJ began the annual analysis in 2008, an indication of how entrenched impunity is in some nations.</p> <p>\u2022 Despite their poor records in achieving justice, four countries on the Impunity Index \u2014 India, Mexico, Nigeria, and the Philippines \u2014 are on the governing council of the <a href=\"https://www.community-democracies.org/\">Community of Democracies</a>, a coalition dedicated to upholding and strengthening democratic norms. </p> <p>\u2022 Political groups, including Isis and other extremist organisations, are the suspected perpetrators in more than 40% of all murder cases. Government and military officials are the leading suspects in nearly a quarter of the cases. </p> <p>\u2022 In at least 40% of cases, the victims reported receiving threats before they were killed. Threats are rarely investigated by authorities and in only a handful of cases is adequate protection provided.<br></p> <p>\u2022 In the past 10 years, around 30% of murdered journalists were first taken captive, the majority of whom were tortured, amplifying the killers\u2019 message of intimidation to the media community.</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, the British-born, Los Angeles-based writer Simon Reynolds published a much debated book called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/29/retromania-simon-reynolds-review\"><em>Retromania</em></a>, which examined pop music\u2019s growing devotion to revivals, reissues and reunions. Wasn\u2019t this phenomenon, he speculated, \u201canother facet of the recline [sic] and fall of the West\u201d? If so, then perhaps innovation in music and sound, together with the spirit of \u201crebel yell\u201d, was now more likely to emerge from China, Africa and Latin America \u2013 parts of the global south where \u201cpopular energies and desires will be stoked that come into friction with existing political structures and social norms, producing sparks and possibly conflagrations\u201d.</p> <p>One of the people best placed to cast more light on these tantalising vistas is <a href=\"http://www.jaceclayton.com/\">Jace Clayton</a>, otherwise known as DJ /rupture and once described by the influential music magazine <a href=\"http://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/333\">Wire</a> as a \u201cpan-global, post-everything superhero \u201d. In his DJ sets and on his popular <a href=\"http://www.negrophonic.com/\"><em>Mudd Up!</em></a> show on the American <a href=\"https://wfmu.org/\">WFMU</a> radio station, he routinely meshed Jamaican dub, Japanese noise, south London jungle and Egyptian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/01/dj-sadat-mahraganat-salam-cairo\">mahraganat</a> \u2013 electronic music born of Cairo\u2019s slums. Harvard-educated, a writer for art journals such as <a href=\"https://bidoun.org/\">Bidoun</a> and <a href=\"https://frieze.com/\">Frieze</a>, he\u2019s also responsible for conceptual art projects such as <a href=\"http://www.beyond-digital.org/sufiplugins/\">Sufi Plug Ins</a>, for which he created a series of programs that readjusted and retuned western sounds according to north African quarter-tone scales. Essentially, the goal was to orientalise the technology of late capitalism.</p> <p><em>Uproot</em>, his first book, is a meditation on how sounds are made, circulated and used by people around the world. It also chronicles an era at the beginning of the 21st century when the ecology of music \u2013 the material on which it was pressed, the shops where it was sold, the money made by its creators \u2013 had become mostly nonexistent. But Clayton was too young to spend all his time bemoaning past epochs; he self-released a frenetically polycultural mixtape, <em>Gold Teeth Thief </em>(2003), made it freely available online, and parlayed the attention it received into a still-intense schedule of air-mile-racking DJ sets.</p> <p>The book is a travelogue of sorts. Here he is in Zagreb, Dubai and Osaka. Here he is in Lebanon using Bluetooth to grab some of the tunes his Adidas-tracksuited cabbie is playing on his mobile phone. Here he is in Monterrey, north-east Mexico, going past emo kids and reggaeton fans on his way to hear thundering tribal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jun/15/scene-heard-tribal-guarachero\">guarachero</a> played by a DJ behind whom is projected a Harry Potter movie. And here he is in Kingston where he is gobsmacked to hear George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d dropped by dancehall DJs.</p> <p>Among the Berbers in Morocco, he hangs out with local singers, listening to them make showy use of Auto-Tune, the audio processor that shifts pitches \u2013 made famous by Cher in her single \u201cBelieve\u201d. He ponders the popularity of Whitney Houston-style melisma across the Maghreb, from \u201cbawdy folksingers whose throats have been burned by a lifetime of whisky, to honey-voiced Koranic reciters, who \u2018sing\u2019 the Koran magnificently yet consider all music to be sinful\u201d.</p> <p>In places like these, there is groove and grit, tradition and reinvention. (Closer to home, in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park, an especially well-textured section of the book concerns the Mexican sound-system parties he attends.) Clayton isn\u2019t looking for undiscovered music or acoustic authenticity; today, he argues, physical instruments and spaces to rehearse, along with dexterity, technique and muscle memory, are less important than computer access, \u201calthough, in a pinch, a PlayStation or smartphone will do\u201d. Rather, he\u2019s fascinated by \u201caudio terroir\u201d, the ways in which environments \u2013 even tough, unprepossessing ones \u2013 can gestate and nurture novel sounds.</p> <p>Enemies of promise are often lurking. DJs and producers scour the planet looking to extract resources from previously untapped areas, plundering emergent scenes for grabby rhythms and samples. In one excellent riff, Clayton contrasts the daring, almost violent collage techniques of 1920s dadaists and Soviet montagists with the \u201cboring, tidy, toothless\u201d ways in which the copy, cut and paste functions on a keyboard allow data to be moved around a screen today. Even more insidious are the sports and soft drinks companies that increasingly seek to forge brand-enhancing relationships with \u201cunderground\u201d culture. \u201cOur sounds and struggles activate their environs as places of heightened meaning.\u201d</p> <p><em>Uproot</em> is witty and nuanced rather than sloganeering, and shot through with the immersive research and hard\u2011earned access to key, sometimes evasive, figures that would be the envy of any Ivy League anthropologist. But Clayton is at his most suggestive when, true to his title, he discusses the relationship between the movement of sounds and of migrant bodies. In Barcelona he has a friend, Mark, an undocumented African musician who lives out a kind of \u201cMediterranean gothic\u201d, squatting in an ex\u2019s apartment, unable to use electric lights after dark for fear of alerting others to his presence. In Casablanca, he heads to a market where the \u201cinorganic tang of injection-molded plastics off-gassing complex, probably carcinogenic, polymer molecules mingles with sweat and diesel exhaust\u201d. Here, as in much of the world, he says, the sellers of cheap, Chinese-run, factory-produced plastic are also the sellers of bootleg, MP3-stuffed CDs.</p> <p>Indeed, when Clayton talks about techniques such as transcoding and compressing \u2013 the art of squeezing recorded music into easily exportable and copyable packets of data \u2013 he could almost be talking about the journeys of refugees and migrants: \u201cThis is the sound of files that have survived patchy connections and erroneous metadata, straddling pirate servers and shaky Bluetooth transfers and YouTube rips, evading spam filters en route to Russian wares sites, to end up on a desktop or in some web video accompanied by an equally messed-up JPeg.\u201d Foreign sounds, like foreigners themselves, invade. But Clayton, like many club goers, embraces the idea of music as a zone of mutation and adaptation, of new rhythms as thrillingly contagious, of the dancefloor as a place of both affirming and redefining community.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Uproot</em> is published by <a href=\"http://www.fsgoriginals.com/books/detail/uproot\">FSG Originals</a>.</p>",

Farcically offensive to all communities, he even suggested Khan would raise taxes on their family jewellery, assuming gold is what motivates non-Muslims.

We don\u2019t forgive the Liberal Democrats for their collusion in cuts that impoverished the most vulnerable and devastated public services. But there are times when it is right for a party to stand back and raise our sights to Britain\u2019s future.

What can they be thinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what he\u2019s done and said is indefensible,\u201d says Jim Arnold. \u201cBut when you compare it to what she\u2019s done they\u2019re not comparable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me worry about the intelligence of some of these people,\u201d says Margaret Niccum.</p> <p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t fix that,\u201d says Arnold. </p> <p>More than 50 million people are likely to vote for Trump, even if he goes down in flames. It would be unhelpful to generalise about all of them, reducing them to caricature only to dismiss them. Something is happening here and it behooves people to try to understand it, whether or not they like it. From interviews with a range of Trump voters in Muncie, it\u2019s clear most are not blind to his flaws, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe them in the manner of his detractors. </p> <p>The CDCGG was originally set up to repeal property taxes in Indiana which the group argued were exorbitant. After a successful campaign, they gained the ear of the governor and won a cap on property taxes statewide, and transformed themselves into a local group rallying around local issues. Mostly small businessmen and retirees, half male, half female, all white, it feels like a reconstitution of the Tea Party. </p> <p>Good government, in this context, means small government; with <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/articles/58583-muncie-mayor-says-fbi-investigating-city-government\">Muncie\u2019s Democratic administration under investigation by the FBI for corruption</a> they feel like they are pushing at an open door and would push harder if the local Republican hierarchy were not so reticent. The atmosphere in the room is cordial; these are not just ideological allies, with a keen sense of civic engagement \u2013 two are running for local office and the conversation touches on water rates, sewage rates and teachers\u2019 contracts among other things \u2013 but also friends.</p> <p>Only a couple had wanted Trump to win in the Republican primaries earlier this year. Most preferred Ted Cruz, the Texan who has tried to style himself as a Reaganesque disruptor of Republican politics, or Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida. \u201cI would have been happier with almost anyone else,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cI wanted [Ben] Carson, then Cruz then Rubio. Trump would have almost been my last choice.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask if they are worried that he will do something embarrassing again they mostly laugh and nod.</p> <p>Dave Jamison, who is retired and voted for Obama twice, says he thought Trump was an \u201carrogant SOB when he was on The Apprentice\u201d, but his hunting buddies in southern Indiana persuaded him to take a second look and now he\u2019s thinking seriously of voting for him.</p> <p>Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and training to be a mortician, variably describes Trump as \u201cgarbage\u201d and a \u201cword-butcher\u201d. Walsh, who got in contact with the Guardian through this project, grew up in Muncie but moved away because she saw drugs, single parenthood or incarceration claiming her peers on the southside \u2013 the white working class part of town \u2013 and felt the need to escape. She now lives in the Indianapolis suburb of Brownsburg and probably would have voted for John Kasich, one of the more moderate Republicans in the primaries, if she had registered for a party. \u201cI hated Donald Trump during the primaries,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a mockery.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f46b0f1f895a60c804d632b3af5de701337d68c/0_58_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Trump and Pence election sign outside a house near downtown Muncie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh has only voted in a presidential race once: for Obama in 2008. She is likely to vote for Trump now, but says of him: \u201cHe\u2019s a 70-year-old white man. He\u2019s been supported in bigotry his entire life. He\u2019s been validated his entire life. And people wonder why he acts like this. No wonder he acts like this.\u201d</p> <p>One local senior Republican tells me privately: \u201cLook, he\u2019s a bully. Everyone can see that.\u201d</p> <p>The question of why they would vote for a man of whom they apparently have such a low opinion brings us to something else that connects most of them: their loathing of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>It is a disdain of such depths that not a single virtue can be salvaged; a contempt nurtured and tended with such animus and anomie over the decades that she has been in the public eye that any redeeming features she might claim have long been stripped away. \u201cUnlike Hillary, he hasn\u2019t done anything criminal,\u201d says Hiatt. </p> <p>Niccum believes this moment is the culmination of a longstanding plot hatched by the Clintons several years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s been planning this since she was in college,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you let all this stuff go?\u201d asks Walsh, referring to things Clinton has been accused of of late. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy stuff going on in these emails if you read \u2019em. This is all the stuff the crazy people have been talking about for years and now it turns out it\u2019s most likely true ... She\u2019s a professional politician. How do you make millions of dollars as a politician? You\u2019re supposed to be a civil servant.\u201d </p> <p>Jamison is rare among Trump supporters I\u2019ve met, in saying he could vote for Hillary, if Trump were \u201cto go off the deep end again\u201d.</p> <p>But for the overwhelming majority, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/8/1478776/-Why-Do-People-Hate-Hillary-Clinton-So-Much\">Hillary hatred</a> is their driving force. What they see as the apocalyptic scenario of Clinton running the country has them reaching for the largest immovable object to stop her. This cannot simply be dismissed as misogyny. Until just a couple weeks ago Clinton and Trump were running almost even among white women, while white women without college degrees <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a12016ElectionTrackingNo1.pdf\">still favour him 51-42</a>. </p> <p>\u201cWhat has she ever done for women?\u201d asks Campbell. \u201cJust look at the kind of women she has standing behind her.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump called Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d at the last debate he not only faithfully reflected their sentiments \u2013 he actually understated it. They do not only think she is dishonest, they think she is a criminal, scheming, cheating snob who will sell America to the highest bidder and pocket the proceeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173ddacb9ab862b73b7405fc4a2c0aefc9336dcc/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump window sticker in Muncie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump window sticker in Muncie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Younge for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey look at things through the global order,\u201d says Will Statom, the head of the Delaware Republican party. \u201cA lot of people are looking at Hillary Clinton as nothing good. It\u2019s laughable that she can relate to the middle class \u2013 laughable. They\u2019re elitists. They have always have been elitists. They were elitists in Arkansas. They have just found a way to get ultra rich with that sham called the Clinton Foundation.\u201d</p> <p>There are policies of Trump\u2019s they like too. \u201cUnderneath all the crap there are decent ideas but people don\u2019t see them,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cYou have to go looking for them. That\u2019s his own fault. His position on tax reform, trade reform \u2013 they\u2019re not bad. And the plan to privatise the Veterans Administration, that\u2019s a really good plan.\u201d</p> <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is the government agency that is supposed to provide services, including healthcare, to those who have served in the military. It is so notoriously badly run that <a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/06/jon-stewart-vs-va-how-tv-host-raged-against-red-tape/31207623/\">Jon Stewart made improving it a campaign on The Daily Show</a>. Walsh\u2019s husband served in Iraq and has PTSD and hearing loss, following an IED explosion. The VA care he is entitled to is hard to access and inadequate when he does get it, so he uses his employer\u2019s health insurance instead.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they get home the VA just hands them pills and sends them home,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cBut psychological pills aren\u2019t one size fits all. You need therapy and treatment and they\u2019re not getting that. It\u2019s like a flow chart of pills. It\u2019s a mess. We have soldiers killing themselves in epic proportions and it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting for care.\u201d</p> <p>For Arnold it\u2019s the supreme court \u2013 currently hanging in the ideological balance after the death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left a four-four split between liberal and conservative judges. \u201cThat can change our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t see how anyone who calls themselves a Christian can vote for her. There\u2019s Roe v Wade, LGBTQ and then she says she\u2019s for the second amendment but then she\u2019ll tell you all the restrictions she\u2019ll put on gun owners.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is the biggest issue of all in a town like Muncie, which lost much of its manufacturing base as companies moved south. About a third of what was once a thriving blue-collar town lives in poverty; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/oct/25/middletown-muncie-factories-photo-essay-midwest\">huge factory plants lie abandoned</a>, sitting like gigantic art installations depicting the post-industrial era. The broad consensus is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalised trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, helped kill the economic life of this town: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\">an agreement championed by Bill Clinton</a> and supported by Hillary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff3198f199983f8af88503d0f93057c8c32f681/0_0_5000_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Indiana Steel &amp; Wire Co used to employ 300 people but closed operations in 2002 and now only two staff members remain on site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Statom drove me around the empty factories, elegising about the loss of both jobs and communities, the tumbledown streets where his grandparents lived and the shuttered buildings where they and his father used to work, he tells me he helped load the last machines on to the trucks in nearby Anderson that took the jobs to Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the unions got greedy. That was part of it. And then Nafta did the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d says Jamison. \u201cGet America back, middle-class jobs and everything. I think we need some of that.\u201d Do you think those jobs are coming back? I ask Jamison. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The devastation wreaked by that hollowing-out is what Walsh felt the need to escape when she left Muncie. \u201cI have friends from high school who were incarcerated for bank robbery. One of the guys I went to high school was killed not so long ago. My best friend, who has a daughter, she\u2019s on her own. It\u2019s just a mess. People addicted to drugs. There\u2019s nothing to do. It\u2019s a sad situation. It\u2019s textbook of how you create an inner city.\u201d</p> <p>During the primaries, when all but a couple of the Republican contenders had dropped out, Trump did well on the southside where Walsh grew up. The white working class \u2013 and particularly white men without a college degree among whom he leads by a whopping 60-21 \u2013 form a significant part of Trump\u2019s core support. But it would be a mistake to conclude from that that he has the bulk of support in these areas. <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/\">Nationally, Trump supporters are generally wealthier than most Americans</a> and considerable wealthier than those who voted for Clinton. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dcelectionday.com/2016-2/primary-election-2016/\">Democrats outpolled Republicans by a significant margin</a> during the primaries in most, if not all the southside precincts in Muncie. Bernie Sanders, the \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d insurgent on the Democratic side, got more votes than Trump on the southside and even though Clinton lost to Sanders there, she wasn\u2019t far behind Trump in vote totals.</p> <p>\u201cNobody speaks up for the poor,\u201d says Walsh, explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to those she grew up with. \u201cThere is systemic racism but black people have advocates. Poor white people don\u2019t. They\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t feel racist, they don\u2019t feel sexist, they don\u2019t want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But for them white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you\u2019re poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they\u2019ve never experienced it on a level that they understand. </p> <p>\u201cYou hear privilege and you think money and opportunity and they don\u2019t have it. I understand how it works but I don\u2019t think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he\u2019s saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don\u2019t. And then you\u2019ve got people calling them stupid and deplorable. Well how long do you think you can call people stupid and deplorable before they get mad?\u201d</p> <p><em>Pictures by David Levene and Gary Younge</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

Its culture, traditions, costumes and dialect are unlike anywhere else in Iran. In 1973 it was registered as a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5197/\">national heritage site</a>. Houses built of mud and straw are stepped into the hillside; narrow unpaved roads slope up and down the hills. Women wear colourful headscarves \u2013 the size of the flowers denoting their marital status, while married men wear voluminous satin trousers.

The madrasa courtyard is peaceful and a great place to sit quietly, watch the mullahs in discussion and see life unfold. Continuing down the same alley, hang left and you enter the famous bazaar where you can try <em>faloodeh</em>, the refreshing, if strange, Shirazi dessert.<br><strong>Gr\u00e1inne Mc Namara</strong></p> <h2>Eco-tour and intellectual chit chat</h2> <p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeeYouinIran\">See You In Iran</a> Facebook page and check for upcoming events or tours.

This traditional hostel radiates Persian warmth and hospitality, and it\u2019s a perfect base for exploring the ancient city. There is a charming courtyard with a blue-tiled pool, flowering vines and bright, scattered cushions. It\u2019s hard not to mingle, chai in hand, in such a tranquil place. <br><a href=\"http://golshanhotelshiraz.blogfa.com/\"><em>golshanhotelshiraz.blogfa.com</em></a><br><strong>Shaz Rakhshan</strong></p> <h2>The Golestan Palace, Tehran</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f25045cbcdb53b4c2a2742d103655748a1daa922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25045cbcdb53b4c2a2742d103655748a1daa922/0_175_4990_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Golestan Palace, Iwan-e Takht-e Marmar - Marble throne veranda, Teheran, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a beautiful 400-year-old masterpiece, displaying the earliest representations of a fused European and Persian style, and the complex formed the foundation of Iran\u2019s modern artistic movement. My top tips for inside the palace are the dramatic and awe-inducing Takht\u2019e Marmar (Marble Throne), which stands in an outdoor terrace, and the magnificent Talar-e Ayaheh (Hall of Mirrors) which is exactly that. Only a stone\u2019s throw away is Tehran\u2019s famous Grand Bazaar.<br><strong>ID9101224</strong></p> <h2>Isfahan, for tea and coffee lovers</h2> <p>Navigating Isfahan by its old teahouses and new coffee shops is a nice way to spend an afternoon. The Azadegan Teahouse, in a lane off the north-east corner of Imam Square, has ceilings and walls decked with metal pots and lanterns, with tea, snacks and <em>qalyan</em> (hookah) on the menu. On the other side of the city, stylised coffees and virgin cocktails can be found in Caf\u00e9 Ahang, near Charbagh Abasi Street. With its bookshelf and tables decorated with post-it notes, it has a cosy, local feel.</p> <p><strong>Nicole Zandi</strong></p> <h2>Bam</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f8b9ee01725662baac948add322f2a8269cb0f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8b9ee01725662baac948add322f2a8269cb0f2/0_134_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Arg-e Bam citadel, Bam, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Arg-e Bam citadel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Earl and Nazima Kowall/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desert oasis of Bam, in the province of Kerman, was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 2003 but has since been rebuilt.

It\u2019s the festival of mourning for the murder of Imam Hossein and there is a genuine grief evident in the rituals. Visitors are welcome to the upper galleries of mosques, generally opposite the women\u2019s galleries, to witness hundreds of men beating their chests as the story is chanted. Our group was invited to a large temporary feeding area for a free lunch and supper (donations welcomed). You will also see fountains running red.<br><strong>HelenCurrie </strong></p>",
  "<p>New York City endured another brutal summer this year, and you know what that means: a severe <a href=\"http://thegreencity.com/the-causes-and-effects-of-the-urban-heat-island-effect/\">urban heat island</a> effect and the omnipresent stench of rotting garbage. Summer in New York makes one acutely aware of the near-constant presence of waste piling up on pavements waiting to be collected and trucked to an out-of-state landfill.</p> <p>New York is, in fact, widely <a href=\"http://matadornetwork.com/life/new-york-wasteful-city-world/\">reported</a> to be the world\u2019s most wasteful city. Wastefulness in this case means New York uses the most energy (<a href=\"http://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/megacity-metabolism-is-your-city-consuming-a-balanced-diet/\">\u201cthe equivalent of one oil supertanker every 1.5 days\u201d</a>), disposes of the most trash (33m tonnes per year), and uses the most water. The dubious title comes from <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5985.abstract\">a study</a> published last spring in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p> <p>While the world\u2019s most wasteful city could well be in the consumption-rich US, New York is an unlikely culprit. If the world\u2019s most wasteful city is American, as it very well may be, it\u2019s probably a sprawling sunbelt metropolis like Houston, Atlanta, Tampa, or Phoenix \u2013 all of which rate worse than New York on most environmental metrics but weren\u2019t included in that particular study.</p> <p>Among global megacities, Mexico City generates the most trash after the New York region: 12m tonnes per year. That\u2019s largely a function of relative wealth: the regions have similar population sizes of just over 20 million and 21 million people respectively, but GDP per capita is three times higher in the US.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/11/beautiful-lebanon-becoming-rubbish-tip-beirut-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hfbd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2471620\"            data-video-name=\"How beautiful Beirut is becoming a rubbish tip \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/11/1457690096249/KP_1832931_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56e295fee4b0dfdfc0925967\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/3/11/1457690096249/KP_1832931_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/11/160311Stink_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/11/160311Stink_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/11/160311Stink_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/11/160311Stink_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/11/160311Stink.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/11/beautiful-lebanon-becoming-rubbish-tip-beirut-video\">The parody rubbish film that went viral in Beirut</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But waste is a bigger quality of life problem in Mexico. At least the steaming trash in New York is being put out for the sanitation trucks. In 2011, Mexico City closed its largest dump, <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/sustainable-communities/gov-mexico-city-recycling-incentive-more-food.html\">causing trash</a> to pile up at illegal dumping sites and be left out on the street, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/09/waste-mountain-mexico-city\">highlighting the absence</a> of a comprehensive policy for urban waste collection, disposal and processing. There are signs of hope, though. A number of recycling initiatives have been launched, including one that <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/virgin-unite/trash-food-mexico-city-market-thats-tackling-capitals-waste-problem\">allows residents to trade in recyclables</a> for vouchers to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>The third biggest waste producer among megacities is Tokyo, which is actually impressively austere. Greater Tokyo has more than 50% more residents than Mexico City, but it produces slightly less rubbish. Japan is very densely populated, and so it lacks the space that the US and China have to throw their garbage in landfills. Instead, they have adopted hyper-aggressive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/asia/how-do-japanese-dump-trash-let-us-count-the-myriad-ways.html\">recycling programmes</a> to cut down on waste. Tokyo, which <a href=\"https://msu.edu/~hillrr/The%20Zero%20Waste%20City%20whole%20text.pdf\">strives to be</a> a zero-waste city, is no exception.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Kovac, World Resources Institute</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So how can Tokyo be rated the third most wasteful city? This is the tricky thing about measuring wastefulness: waste is a byproduct of consumption, and consumption generally tracks with income. \u201cThere are some general rules for consumption levels: as income rises, people just cycle through more consumption patterns in general,\u201d says Alex Kovac, a research analyst at the World Resources Institute, an international environmental research organisation. \u201cThe wealthier a place is, the more is wasted and thrown.\u201d</p> <p>A city\u2019s waste rate, Morton says, roughly follows that of the country it\u2019s in. According to a World Bank <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/0,,contentMDK:23172887~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:337178,00.html\">study from 2012</a>, the most recent on the subject, New Zealand generated the most garbage, 3.68kg per person every day, among developed countries, followed by Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, and the US. But the data on smaller countries may be failing to account for recycling. </p> <p>Norway, for example, has high rates of recycling and Oslo, its largest city, has <a href=\"http://oslo.miljobarometern.se/state-of-the-environment-oslo/waste-and-litter/annual-household-waste-per-capita/\">successfully reduced</a> its waste production in recent years. Ireland, on the other hand, has <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ireland-has-third-highest-waste-level-per-capita-147581.html\">lower recycling rates</a> than in the rest of western Europe. Dublin might be one of the most wasteful cities in Europe, but it is still only a second-tier competitor for world\u2019s most wasteful city, as its greenhouse gas emissions are still only half the rate of the US or Australia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7e2f72fff782e42f7f5d7327e2f5a5d51dca364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e2f72fff782e42f7f5d7327e2f5a5d51dca364/0_0_3913_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walking in the street, Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo is densely populated, so doesn\u2019t have the space for landfills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuya Shino/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/global-development/la-fg-global-trash-20160422-20160421-snap-htmlstory.html\">producer of trash</a> in absolute terms, generating 624,700 metric tonnes per day, which is <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/which-countries-produce-the-most-waste/\">2.58kg/capita</a>.

Nalgene found New York was found to be the third least wasteful, after San Francisco and Seattle. (On the subject of water waste, Phoenix, which is built in a desert, devotes half of its residential <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/us/an-arid-arizona-city-manages-its-thirst.html\">water use</a> to irrigate lawns.)</p> <p>In China, waste is growing twice as fast as the population. As the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/chinas-trash-is-taking-over/article24367032/\">Globe and Mail notes</a>, China now produces an average of 1.12kg per person per day of residential waste, nearly 10% more than the average in Ontario, even though China\u2019s GDP per capita is more than six times lower. Chinese cities don\u2019t recycle, meaning that their waste output could be cut in half, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-the-worlds-geniuses-of-garbage-disposal-1463519134\">as it has been</a> in neighbouring Taiwan.</p> <p>China doesn\u2019t break out its waste data by city, but some Chinese cities with notable refuse problems include <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/897061.shtml\">Beijing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1530028/thousands-people-visit-garbage-sites-guangzhou-tries-build-support-new\">Guangzhou</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-03-17/what-to-do-with-china-s-trash-burn-it\">Shenzhen</a>, which have started building trash incinerators to pick up the slack from a shortage of landfill capacity.

Most wasteful as measured by total garbage created, will knock out almost all developing world cities, for the simple reason that they cannot afford to buy and waste as much. But if you\u2019re talking about some of the local problems associated with trash, like having it piling up in your streets, some of the world\u2019s poorest cities, such as <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/6\">Manila </a>and <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/7\">Port-au-Prince</a>, have very big problems indeed.</p> <p>Without the infrastructure to collect garbage, it\u2019s dumped in rivers, canals and streets, and the result is unsanitary chaos. Other developing cities that are overburdened with trash they cannot process include those with fast-growing economies such as <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/10\">Bangalore</a> and Delhi.</p> <p>Mumbai produces the fifth most waste of any megacity, and last year Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-16/mumbai-is-being-buried-under-a-mountain-of-its-own-trash\">reported</a> it was \u201cbeing buried under a mountain of its own trash\u201d. The city of over 18 million people produces 11,000 metric tonnes of trash per day. Plastic wrappers and bottles fill the gutters, backyard waste burning contributes to air pollution, and the rest winds up in a giant open landfill.</p> <p>In Delhi, which <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/22/world/la-fg-india-trash-mountain-20120422\">experienced</a> a 50% increase in waste between 2007 and 2012, the lack of formal trash pick-up systems leads to rubbish mountains and impoverished waste pickers sorting through it for anything that can be reused or resold. Delhi\u2019s garbage problem and its overwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/11/delhi-considers-shutting-schools-as-toxic-smog-continues\">smog</a> could certainly make it the world\u2019s dirtiest city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47f4b6b120ddc56611849275befd71575ca4b0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f4b6b120ddc56611849275befd71575ca4b0e1/0_329_3902_2342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Indian scavengers look for coins and re-usable items amongst the religious offerings and wooden frames of idols of goddess Durga which are piled up in the Yamuna river in New Delh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men scavenge for coins and re-usable items in the Yamuna river in New Delhi, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapid population growth itself may also be a risk factor. <a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/8\">Jakarta</a>, for example, is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities and many of its residents are in the habit of dumping their household items in the nearest waterway. So much makes its way out to sea that 100 tonnes of garbage a day is collected on the beaches of an island five miles away.</p> <p>Even a rich city can find it impossible to stash away all its waste if it\u2019s too tightly packed. Hong Kong is on the precipice of <a href=\"http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/msw/htm_en/executive/main.htm\">running out</a> of space in its landfills. A decade ago, Singapore <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-waste-singapore-idUSSP9046620080522\">had the same problem</a>, but it implemented policies to boost recycling and burn trash for energy. Now it <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/singapores-innovative-waste-disposal-system-1442197715\">puts</a> only 2% of its waste in landfills. That\u2019s not without its own drawback: burning rubbish creates <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/where-trash-is-a-burning-problem-17973\">air pollution</a>, from carbon emissions to toxins and particulates.</p> <p><a href=\"https://weather.com/science/environment/news/worst-cities-trash-garbage-problems-20130926#/9\">Cairo\u2019s </a>trash problem is unique: not only does it produce 625 kg per person per year of solid waste \u2013 a very high rate for a poorer country \u2013 but its system of trash pickers, and feeding waste to pigs, have been disrupted by political instability, religious disapproval of pigs by the temporary Muslim Brotherhood government and an outbreak of swine flu.</p> <p>Whichever of these cities is truly the world\u2019s most wasteful, New York probably doesn\u2019t take the crown after all. The 2015 study titling it thus misleadingly measured its metropolitan region, rather than the city itself. New York City\u2019s metro region includes large swathes of suburbia and satellite cities spread across three states. What\u2019s more, the study only took into account megacities over 10 million people, leaving out a whole host of incredibly wasteful smaller cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/27/new-york-rubbish-all-that-trash-city-waste-in-numbers\">What does New York do with all that trash?

That discrepancy is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/suburbs-carbon-emissions-_n_4556474.html\">very pronounced</a> in New York, thanks to the city\u2019s unusually high share of non-drivers and relatively small homes. New York City also has aggressive recycling programmes that are currently expanding beyond paper, metals, and plastics to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/nyregion/with-compost-program-keeping-waste-from-going-to-waste.html?_r=0\">compost</a> food waste. </p> <p>The greater density, more pedestrian-oriented urban planning, and vastly superior mass transit networks in Europe and Japan make their cities and suburban towns much more energy efficient than most of the US.

  "<p>Warm beer and cold hands, the peal of church bells and a healthy suspicion for human rights. Despite the divisive Brexit referendum, widening inequality and a surge in hate crime, these are the things that unite Britons after voting to leave the European union, according to the veteran broadcaster Alan Partridge. </p> <p>Partridge, the fictional character played by Steve Coogan \u2013 who has been a regular fixture on television and radio for 25 years \u2013 told the Today programme on BBC\u2019s Radio 4 that he disagreed with doomsayers who say Britain has never been more divided in politics and culture. </p> <p>Speaking to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz, Partridge said that in researching his latest book, Alan Partridge: Nomad, a deeply personal journal of his travels around the British Isles, he had discovered there were \u201ccertain things that unite us all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm beer and cold hands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the clacking of bowling balls, the peal of church bells; it\u2019s tutting when you see an ice-cream van selling hamburgers; it\u2019s a healthy suspicion of human rights; it\u2019s a Punch and Judy show having a giggle at a domestic incident; it\u2019s a dozen sausage rolls in a tupperware box and a pair of trunks wrapped in a towel; it\u2019s an iPhone, it\u2019s an iPhone charger.</p> <p>\u201cYou take my point, don\u2019t you?</p> <p>\u201cPeople say Britain\u2019s divided, just because people voted for a Conservative government, which, without hinting at my own political views, is as British as it gets. And what are leftwing politics? An idea developed by a German and popularised by the Chinese. What\u2019s British about that? Julian Fellowes believes Labour voters should be charged with treason, and I think he has a point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad1a92883d1404c3ce485db102c0eaa81290a8db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1a92883d1404c3ce485db102c0eaa81290a8db/0_0_1807_2766/653.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Partridge: Nomad\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Partridge\u2019s new book, Nomad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Partridge character first appeared in 1991, presenting sports on Radio 4 current affairs programme On The Hour, before being approached by BBC talent spotters to present his own chat show on the station, Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, which was soon transferred to television. </p> <p>However, by 1997 he was fired from the corporation for punching the then chief commissioning editor in the face with a stuffed partridge, and spent several years in the wilderness of commercial local radio, presenting the graveyard shift on Radio Norwich. In more recent years, following a successful autobiography, he has transformed himself into a chronicler of British life in documentaries and print. </p> <p>In Nomad, Partridge combines a travelogue of British life with a personal exploration of what has made him one of the country\u2019s best loved personalities. Published last week, it has already been awarded five stars in 18 Amazon customer reviews, and four in the 19th. </p> <p>\u201cAnother volume of pedantic, over-wrought, stylistically and tonally muddled prose from a man who once again comes across as petty, parochial and ludicrously vain,\u201d one buyer writes. </p> <p>But Partridge said his decision to turn his hand to travel writingcame from more than just a love for his native country. He said: \u201cBritain loves a travel writer. One thinks of Michael Palin, Judith Chalmers, Bill Bryson with his gentle ribbing of this country\u2019s way of life \u2013 which is meant to be affectionate but I think is a little bit if-you-don\u2019t-like-it-Bill-go-back-to-America for my tastes. </p> <p>\u201cSo I looked at them, looked at their passion for travel, and crucially how they monetise that passion for commercial gain.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>In Bristol, a house awaits. There is food in the cupboards. Beds are made up with crisp blue linen. A cheery red hot water bottle has been placed on each duvet.</p> <p>This is a home for a family about to arrive on the official Home Office sponsored Syrian <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/refugee_services/resettlement_programme\">vulnerable persons resettlement programme</a>: the Labour-controlled city council has taken in 35 Syrians to date, and is now preparing for more. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/brits-helping-refugees-help-britain\">The Brits helping refugees help Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But getting to this point has not been an easy journey, as Loubaba Mamluk, a research epidemiologist at Bristol university who co-chairs the local Citizens UK campaign group explains. \u201cIt was 18 months ago that a small group of concerned people got together, and asked for a meeting with the council,\u201d she recalls. Mamluk is Syrian, and was reeling from the devastation being wreaked on her country. She was not an expert in refugee resettlement, and nor were any of the rest of the group.</p> <p>Nor, as it turned out, was Bristol city council. During the meeting with officials \u2013 \u201cit was six of us and three of them, and we were describing the problem, and there was a bit of emotion going on\u201d she recalls \u2013 it became evident to Mamluk that the feeling from the council side was more about asking advice than giving it. \u201cIt was very frustrating\u201d she says. \u201cWe were not the council - we felt they should be telling us!\u201d</p> <p>There was no doubt as to the council\u2019s desire to help, Mamluk says. But it may be telling that confusion about how to approach the task was the initial reaction even in one of the UK\u2019s largest and most diverse cities. The expansion of the government\u2019s existing vulnerable persons resettlement scheme to take another <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34171148\">20,000 Syrian refugees over five years</a> had not yet been announced, and the funding mechanism for taking people in was far from clear, remembers Mike Hennessey, Bristol\u2019s director of adult social care, who has led on this project from the start. Traumatised refugees cannot simply be flown here and dropped anywhere. \u201cWe knew that to create any basis for a productive life, people needed somewhere to live. And housing is in very short supply in Bristol,\u201d Hennessey explains.</p> <p>He also knew that education, health and therapeutic support from organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.montpelierhealthcentre.co.uk/services/haven/\">The Haven</a> would need to be brought on board. </p> <p>The political challenges were considerable. This may be why four Conservative councils now taking Syrian refugees have either refused to speak to the Guardian or failed to reply to repeated interview requests.</p> <p>Housing is a hot potato across the country: despite this, it is interesting to note that, just north of Bristol, LibDem-controlled Cheltenham has opted to make 100 social housing homes available to Syrian refugees. The town is now home to 19 Syrians, and more houses are on offer. Cheltenham\u2019s cabinet member for housing Peter Jeffries acknowledges the potential for criticism, but says these are people \u201cwho have nothing other than the clothes they stand up in, refugees, displaced by wars ... I think the number we are taking is pitiful. We should be doing more, and it should be speeded up.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jul/14/cost-uk-councils-take-in-syrian-refugees\">How much does it cost UK councils to take in refugees?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Bristol, a city where there are already 8,000 people on the housing register, the decision was made that social housing would not be used, so the Citizens UK group mobilised contacts in the media to make a plea to private landlords. After each appeal, offers of help flooded in: managing the public response and the project overall has required the equivalent of one salaried post. </p> <p>Hennessey has also been challenged by organisations already working with refugees: \u201cOne person said to me, \u2018we\u2019re supporting 400 people and you\u2019ve got a whole working group supporting [at that time] eight.\u2019\u201d It was, he says, a fair point \u2013 the Syrian scheme has created a hierarchy of refugees: most in the city are scraping by with very little recourse to public funds at all.</p> <p>Even on the resettlement programme, Home Office funding does not fully meet the cost of renting and furnishing a home. Individuals and businesses in Bristol have responded by donating many of the items needed. But the way the council has managed the money, so that the people who need more support get it and funding can be reallocated from those who are more self-sufficient more quickly, means, Hennessey says, that it is now nearly enough.</p> <p>Perhaps because of the energetic outreach and communication by Mamluk and her fellow volunteers \u2013 the Citizens UK group have convened city-wide discussion forums, organised Welcome Refugees marches and rallies, and invited Bristolians to help with befriending, English lessons and practical tasks \u2013 Hennessey believes concerns about the political sensitivities have been allayed. \u201cWe have not experienced any adverse reaction. What we have had is neighbours who\u2019ve made biscuits to welcome families, and people who\u2019ve tidied their gardens. We\u2019re not letting this disadvantage other people, we\u2019re talking about people being contributors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/13/coventry-city-council-shelter-for-refugees-housing-education\">How Coventry city council is providing shelter for refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The council and Citizens UK are soon to launch a campaign entitled 25 Homes, 100 Lives, which states the scale of the ambition for the city, and are working together on how best to provide for the 10 unaccompanied child refugees Bristol has initially committed to take; five immediately, five in the coming weeks. \u201cI feel like the lesson of why Bristol is looked at as a successful resettlement programme, is that we did a successful co-production between so many organisations,\u201d says Mamluk. \u201cWe looked at their fears and we looked at our ambitions, and tried to find a happy place, because that is the only way.\u201d</p> <p>More houses are set to be approved by Bristol council. And when the next families arrive, they will see that someone put food in the kitchen. Someone donated bed linen, and someone ironed it. Someone constructed 15 flat-pack beds instead of having a weekend. Someone carefully laid the red hot water bottles on the duvets, because they didn\u2019t want children to feel cold as they fell asleep on their first night in this country.

She was the best imaginable mentor: if she felt she had any wisdom to share she was always happy to do so. She was by nature somebody who liked to connect people. Quite apart from anything else she was hilarious \u2013 very, very funny, and excellent fun to be around.<br></p> <p>Anita was very supportive of what I was doing. One of the most tangible things she did as my mentor was to connect me with <a href=\"http://svn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Venture Network</a>, a networking organisation for people who run social enterprises, co-founded by her friend Josh Mailman.<br></p> <p>In 1993, a couple of years after Green &amp; Black\u2019s launched, Anita recommended me for membership so I went to lots of conferences \u2013 in Boston, Zurich and Italy \u2013 and got to rub shoulders and hear the stories of other people who were trying to do the same sort of things that we were. </p> <p>Anita would introduce me to everybody.

What I loved about her was that she just did not care about playing by the rules. <br></p> <p>We didn\u2019t ever disagree but I remember once in Bucharest she had left something behind in her room by accident \u2013 classically her \u2013 so I went upstairs to get it and noticed that she\u2019d forgotten all her toiletries, too. I gathered them up from the bathroom but when I presented them to her she told me she\u2019d left them behind on purpose for the staff. That really made me think. We\u2019d just spent five traumatic days and I hadn\u2019t thought about doing something like that. What she really did was show me that you could do good through doing business, which is what I hope Green &amp; Black\u2019s did.<br></p> <p>Anita also showed me the value of mentoring so I have always felt honour-bound to pay that forwards.

It\u2019s all sugar cane fields round there and they\u2019re basically dissolving back into the earth, causing the town to fall apart. There\u2019s no good news really: Belle Glade has been in decline since the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/02/us/poverty-scarred-town-now-stricken-by-aids.html\">1980s, when it had the highest incidence of Aids</a> per capita in the US, thanks to the number of Haitian refugee farmers living there in abject poverty. </p> <p>It was July and they were burning the leaves off the sugar cane. Just being outside was a pretty intense experience: it was raining ash. I was trying to take photographs of these 18-wheeler sugar cane trucks and, to keep my sanity, I\u2019d decided not to leave the car. But it wasn\u2019t working, so I got out and took a shot. </p> <p>As I turned back round, I saw my car rolling away. I grabbed the door, but it was going too fast and just plopped down into this canal. I was screaming \u201cFuck!\u201d and thinking: \u201cRight, as I\u2019m probably going to have to buy this rental car, I\u2019d better start taking some pictures.\u201d In the end, some family friends helped me pull it out. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are no guardrails, just fields with canals all around.

  "<p>Poor Cordelia Gummer.

And our prime minister was presumably either faking it in front of the Goldman Sachs faithful, or is faking it now when she insists that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/02/hard-brexit-eu-trade-deal\">hard Brexit</a> will be a rip-roaring success, or is secretly in two minds about the most totemic issue of the day \u2013 but dammit, the British people ordered a burger, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ll get. And we wonder why people don\u2019t trust politicians.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Compare the recording of May with her rather different script now, it\u2019s hard to tell which one sounds fake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her friends will say, of course, that this tape simply confirms what we already knew. May dutifully backed remain when her prime minister asked her to do so, before transforming magically into a super-Brexiter when occasion demanded, like Lynda Carter going into a spin and emerging as Wonderwoman. (If nothing else, it\u2019s clear why May was so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/theresa-may-allies-reject-claim-role-eu-referendum-campaign\">resistant to making public appearances for the remain campaign</a> in the spring, to the screaming frustration of Downing Street; she presumably anticipated her words being later used against her.)</p> <p>But the fascinating thing is that if you compare the recording of May trotting out the pro-European line then with her rather different script now, it\u2019s surprisingly hard to tell which one sounds fake.</p> <p>Even Johnson, who famously wrote one newspaper column arguing for Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/secret-boris-johnson-column-favoured-uk-remaining-in-eu\">one against it</a> before settling on the former, couldn\u2019t manage that. His unpublished ode to Europe, salvaged from the bin for a forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/battle-of-the-books-inside-story-brexit-bloodletting\">book on Brexit by the Sunday Times journalist Tim Shipman</a>, arguably goes some way to restoring the old rogue\u2019s reputation because you can feel his heart wasn\u2019t really in it. But the sphinx-like May sounds equally inscrutable whichever way she\u2019s arguing.</p> <p>Nobody wants to hear that fudge and obfuscation, ambiguity and half-truths \u2013 not to mention a willingness sometimes to tell different stories to different audiences \u2013 are as essential to the political process as principle and passion. But it\u2019s true all the same.</p> <p>The Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition wouldn\u2019t have survived past Christmas if David Cameron and Nick Clegg had been tub-thumping conviction politicians; it worked only because neither of them is particularly tribal, often to the fury of their respective tribes. Theresa May is a very different character, but her natural reserve can make her something of a blank screen, on to which others project what they want to see \u2013 one way, perhaps, of managing a government that is essentially a coalition of diametrically opposed views over Brexit.</p> <p>Two years ago I spent weeks researching a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/03/can-theresa-may-make-it-to-the-top\">profile of May</a> as a prospective Tory leadership contender, and the hardest question to answer was what she thought deep down about Europe. The consensus among old friends was that she just wasn\u2019t all that interested in what for many Tories was an existential question, so the modernisers\u2019 aversion to banging on about Europe suited her just fine.</p> <p>But if it came to it, most thought she\u2019d be a pragmatic if hardly enthusiastic inner. True, she\u2019d become increasingly hardline on immigration at the Home Office and picked up quicker than most on the boiling anger of white van man, but as an ex-banker the economic case would prevail.</p> <p>And that\u2019s still what much of Whitehall assumed when she came into No 10, promising that the will of the people would be sovereign, and that Brexit really would mean Brexit. When she brought back David Davis and Liam Fox, some even wondered if this was all part of a cunning plan to give hard Brexiters just enough rope to hang themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/why-theresa-mays-secret-speech-really-does-matter\">Why Theresa May's secret speech really does matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But increasingly it\u2019s dawning on everyone that she actually means it.

But nobody forced her to run for leader, and now it\u2019s time to lead.</p> <p>The Goldman tapes do not, in themselves, make May a hypocrite. Only she could do that \u2013 if she sought to pretend that everything she said is no longer true, or that the downsides of Brexit will, like fairies, magically die away just because 52% of voters don\u2019t believe in them. Every decision has problems and consequences, which we elect politicians to analyse and overcome: odd that it\u2019s only in the case of Brexit that it\u2019s deemed undemocratic even to mention what might go wrong. Never mind the detail; swallow this.</p> <p>But May should remember that the mistake John Gummer made all those years ago wasn\u2019t just to drag his daughter into politics. It was to treat the rest of us like children, incapable of understanding the risks for ourselves.</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, when the UK had a future in the European Union and Ed Miliband was a potential prime minister, the chief business commentator of the Financial Times, John Gapper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6e43e54-f8a3-11e3-befc-00144feabdc0\">announced the demise</a> of Britain\u2019s rightwing tabloids. Unusually for an FT journalist, Gapper had once worked at the Daily Mail, and at the FT he often writes about the media, sweepingly and authoritatively even by that paper\u2019s standards. \u201cThe era of the Fleet Street tabloids, the populist and fearsome emblems of British culture and politics, is over,\u201d he wrote on 25 June 2014. \u201cIt has been over for some years, in fact, but neither they nor their critics chose to admit it.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to their shrunken print circulations: in 1950 the Daily Express was \u201cthe world\u2019s best-selling paper\u201d, he wrote, and \u201csold more than 4m copies each day\u201d. Yet by 2014 it was selling barely a ninth of that; and it has weakened further since. \u201cThe tabloids appeal to a readership limited by class, occupation, and social attitude,\u201d Gapper continued. \u201cThat is not sufficient in the digital era. Young people are not loyal to one tabloid title and few of them will subscribe online.\u201d</p> <p>Gapper cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">the phone-hacking scandal</a> which closed the News of the World in 2011; competition from politically neutral, free tabloids such as Metro; the distraction of readers by smartphones; and the advancing years of key tabloid figures such as Paul Dacre, now 67, who has been the crusading, splenetic editor of the Mail for almost a quarter of a century. Gapper predicted that Dacre would probably be the last tabloid editor to successfully \u201cexpress their readers\u2019 inner thoughts and emotions \u2026 more strongly than the readers could themselves\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/nov/14/revenge-of-the-tabloids-podcast\">Revenge of the tabloids \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent years, the many observers and enemies of the tabloids have repeatedly forecast their political decline. In 2010, the blogger Sunny Hundal wrote in the New Statesman that that year\u2019s general election had been \u201cnotable for how little impact the tabloids had\u201d. He concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely the Sun can claim victory after an election ever again.\u201d This June, in the middle of the EU referendum campaign, the i newspaper declared on its front page, \u201cThe Media Won\u2019t Decide This Vote\u201d. In August, a former managing editor of the Sun, Stig Abell, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/britains-paper-tigers.html?_r=0\">wrote in the New York Times</a> that the other tabloids had become \u201cliving relics\u201d, with the Express \u201cno more than an incontinent shriek of made-up facts about health and immigration\u201d. The headline for the piece was \u201cBritain\u2019s Paper Tigers\u201d.</p> <p>Yet on 23 June 2016, almost two years to the day after Gapper had written their obituary, one of the biggest, oldest dreams of the tabloids came spectacularly to life, when Britain voted to leave the EU, against the predictions of most broadsheet commentators. It was an outcome for which the tabloids had campaigned doggedly for decades, but never more intensely \u2013 or with less factual scrupulousness \u2013 than this spring and summer, when the front pages of the Sun, Mail and Express bellowed for Brexit, talking up Britain\u2019s prospects afterwards, in deafening unison, day after day. Two days before the referendum, the Sun gave over its first 10 pages to pro-Brexit coverage.</p> <p>The referendum has not been the only tabloid triumph of the last 18 months. At the 2015 general election, again contrary to most predictions, the Conservatives won a majority against the Labour bogeyman the papers had alternately mocked and feared for the previous five years: \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cWeird\u201d Ed Miliband. At Loughborough University, Prof David Deacon and his colleagues have studied the tabloid coverage of the last six general elections, going back to 1992. \u201cWe were doing our initial analysis of 2015 while the campaign was going on,\u201d he remembers, \u201cand there seemed to be laughably extreme anti-Labour headlines. The levels of partisanship were at least the equal of what we recorded in 1992,\u201d widely considered the previous high point \u2013 or low point \u2013 of tabloid electoral influence.</p> <p>\u201cOn polling day in 2015,\u201d Deacon continues, \u201cI was doing the final data runs, and I thought to myself, \u2018If Miliband gets a hung parliament, in spite of this hostility, it will be extraordinary. This election will put us out of business.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/28/when-tabloids-publish-and-dont-give-a-damn\">When tabloids publish and don\u2019t give a damn | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, this July, Theresa May suddenly swept past the favourite Boris Johnson to become Conservative leader and unelected prime minister. The Mail has long admired and promoted her as a stern, controlling figure, like Dacre himself. To his usually formal paper, which was thrilled by her fierce party conference speech this month, she is \u201cTheresa\u201d.</p> <p>British politics now feels relentlessly tabloid-dominated. From the daily obsession with immigrants to the rubbishing of human rights lawyers, from the march towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d to the smearing of liberal Britons as bad losers and elitists, the tabloids and the Conservative right are collaborating with a closeness and a swagger not seen since at least the early 90s.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sun and Mail have more power now than they have for a long time,\u201d says David Yelland, editor of the Sun from 1998 to 2003. \u201cYou could argue that in Brexit the tabloids had their most powerful moment ever.\u201d In a text less than an hour after the Brexit victory was declared, the current editor of the Sun, Tony Gallagher, told the Guardian\u2019s media editor: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Even the most confident and successful<strong> </strong>modern British politicians have regarded the tabloids as culturally and electorally pivotal. In 2012, Tony Blair told the Leveson inquiry into the behaviour of the British press: \u201cIf you have a readership of three to four million \u2026 that\u2019s power \u2026 I don\u2019t know any other way of describing it.\u201d In his autobiography, Blair writes of his decision as Labour leader to appease the Sun and its proprietor Rupert Murdoch: \u201cNot to [do so] was to say carry on and do your worst, and we knew their worst was very bad indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Like almost every book about New Labour, Blair\u2019s has dozens of index entries for the Sun and Mail. Conservatives tend to be more reticent about their relations with the tabloids: there are no index references to the Sun in either volume of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs. But shortly before her 1987 general election victory, she spoke privately about Murdoch to her confidant Woodrow Wyatt. \u201cWe depend on him to fight for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Sun is marvellous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3094b0b1a09238e686b6edd408dc7f77f4dddd3e/125_79_3201_4358/735.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail has long admired Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/08/general-election-2015-how-britain-really-voted/\">research by YouGov</a>, the paper you read is still \u201ca far better predictor of Labour and Tory support than any other indicator\u201d. This applies to all national papers \u2013 in 2015, Guardian readers chose Labour over the Tories by 10 to one. But with the rightwing tabloids, uniquely, the link is rapidly growing stronger. At the 2015 general election, the Tory advantage over Labour among Sun readers was one-and-a-half times as big as it had been in 2010. Moreover, as John Curtice of Strathclyde University, the veteran analyst of British voting behaviour, points out: \u201cPeople who still read papers in print are disproportionately politically interested. They vote!\u201d</p> <p>The word \u201ctabloid\u201d was invented in 1884 by the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome; before it referred to pithy newspapers, it meant a concentrated dose of medicine.</p> <p>Consider some headlines from the Express this autumn: \u201cMigrant Influx Is Threatening To Destroy Our Way Of Life\u201d; \u201cMuslim Bus Driver \u2018Put Children\u2019s Lives At Risk\u2019 By Stopping For Prayer\u201d; \u201cBenefit Cheats Spared Jail As Fraud Rockets\u201d. For the rightwing tabloids, they are unremarkable \u2013 such themes and stereotypes and phrases have run through the papers for decades: on front pages, in news stories, in features, editorials and pieces by columnists, almost all the articles agreeing with each other, almost every day. The papers have tirelessly devoted themselves to what the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci referred to as the manufacturing of \u201ccommon sense\u201d, by which he meant the partisan but often unnoticed and unchallenged assumptions that tilt public opinion rightwards. In 2013, an in-depth survey by <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx\">Ipsos MORI revealed</a> that Britons vastly overestimate the number of British immigrants, Muslims and benefit fraudsters.</p> <p>In an era when agreed facts are becoming rarer, and voters are increasingly impatient and distracted, but also disorientated by shock events, influencing how issues are talked about is more important than ever \u2013 possibly more important, in fact, than influencing elections. In Britain, uniquely among democracies, a few tabloid newspapers are at the heart of both; their preoccupations so familiar that the terms \u201ctabloid\u201d and \u201crightwing tabloid\u201d have become almost synonymous.</p> <p>Yet the exact workings and nature of their influence are fiercely disputed. Politicians, journalists, academics, and tabloid proprietors say contradictory things about it. Defenders of the papers say that tabloids understand and represent their readers; critics say that they talk down to them and manipulate them. Even the owners of tabloids can\u2019t always keep their story straight. In 2012, Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that the Sun\u2019s famous claim after the 1992 election \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won it\u201d \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/25/rupert-murdoch-sun-wot-won-it-tasteless\">\u201ctasteless and wrong \u2026 We don\u2019t have that sort of power.\u201d</a> But at the Sun\u2019s offices in London, some of the rooms have glass walls with reproductions of its most mythologised headlines embedded in them, including the front page from the day of the 1992 election, about the then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock: \u201cIf Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.\u201d</p> <p>Like Miliband, Kinnock unexpectedly lost. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry he thought this front page was \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. He could not resist revelling in his paper\u2019s power, it seemed, even as he denied it.</p> <p>In 1992, the political scientist Ken Newton wrote that identifying the political role of newspapers was \u201ca classic conundrum of the behavioural sciences\u201d. Do people think and vote as rightwingers because they read rightwing papers \u2013 or is it the other way around? Are tabloids just one voice in a larger media babble, or do they play a unique role in setting the agenda for other journalists, such as broadcasters? To what extent do the tabloids shape their readers\u2019 social values \u2013 or have the tabloids\u2019 own values been made to shift by changing public attitudes towards race and gender and sexuality?</p> <p>In the Britain of Theresa\u2019s Brexit and seemingly perpetual Tory government, the rightwing tabloids reign again \u2013 even as their business, like the rest of the print media, continues to crumble. Is theirs a brittle supremacy? Or is their hold on the national discourse secure for another generation?</p> <p>One way to investigate these questions is to tell the story of their political influence on modern Britain. It is not a simple tabloid tale.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Britain is in many ways a perfect environment for a partisan press. It is a small, centralised country with a raucous party politics and an enduring culture of national newspapers. Unlike local papers, the nationals do not have to appeal to everyone, but can have intense relationships with particular readerships. British newspapers first appeared regularly during the civil war of the 1640s: the earnest Mercurius Britannicus supported parliament, the mocking Mercurius Aulicus backed the royalists. Three hundred years on, political bias remained so blatant that in 1947 Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government established a royal commission to investigate the press, in particular the power of its disproportionate number of rightwing proprietors. Lord Beaverbrook, the domineering owner of the Express, told the ineffectual commission: \u201cMy purpose originally was to set up a propaganda paper, and I have never departed from that.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, the pioneering social research organisation Mass Observation conducted one of the first British studies of the interactions between newspapers and their readers, by scrutinising press consumption in libraries and other public places. \u201cMost people choose their paper primarily for its politics,\u201d it found. Fifty-eight per cent of people read political news stories, far more than read sport or \u201cgossip\u201d. With huge electoral turnouts and party memberships, Attlee\u2019s Britain was a highly politicised society. \u201cNewspaper influence on [reader] opinion,\u201d the study went on, was \u201ca subtle, almost imperceptible process\u201d: either \u201cthe long-term reinforcement of opinions already held\u201d, or to \u201csow seeds and implant suggestions on points to which people have up to now given next to no thought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aef06dcd98537d709e418dee36c26edd1aa25b42/0_0_3259_4164/783.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Express has run a steam of anti-migrant front pages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express Newspapers/Daily Express</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Mass Observation warned over\u2011ideological proprietors: \u201cPeople tend to resist newspaper influences that lead them in a direction they are not disposed to follow.\u201d During the 1945 general election, one Express headline read, \u201cGestapo In Britain if Socialists Win\u201d. Attlee won by a landslide.</p> <p>So used to thinking of tabloids as always omnipotent, modern Britain has forgotten that their political influence actually dwindled during the postwar decades. Improving literacy and the complexities of the war reduced the impact of simplistic newspapers. Mass Observation found the press falling behind \u201cbooks\u201d, \u201cpersonal experience\u201d, and \u201cfriends and family\u201d as political influences. The arrival of television during the 50s, which was not allowed to be partisan, made the Mail and the Express, founded in 1896 and 1900 respectively, look still more like bombastic Victorian throwbacks. So did the increasingly consensual nature of postwar party politics.</p> <p>In 1952, the Labour politician and diarist Richard Crossman spent a hospital stay reading a British newspaper history: \u201cWhat struck me,\u201d he wrote afterwards, \u201cwas the enormous power of the press in politics before 1918 and its steady decline since... Today, [when there is] a campaign against a cabinet minister, the effect is usually to strengthen his position.\u201d</p> <p>As the economy recovered from the war, advertising revenue became more important to papers, and this brought a pressure to publish fewer political, potentially reader-alienating stories. According to the media historians James Curran and Jean Seaton, the amount of \u201cpublic affairs\u201d coverage in the tabloids halved between 1945 and 1975. The Mail and Express carried on backing the Conservatives, but their readers increasingly ignored the editorials: by 1963, 28% of Mail readers and 38% of Express readers supported Labour.</p> <p>In 1964, the struggling Daily Herald, founded half a century earlier as a radical paper for striking trade unionists, was relaunched as the Sun. It remained Labour-supporting;<strong> </strong>but as its apolitical-sounding, blandly uplifting name might suggest, it was more interested in consumerism, and in what it called \u201cpacesetters\u201d: young working-class people, often women, who were joining the expanding middle class of southern England.</p> <p>The idea that newspapers should no longer lecture their readers received support from academia. The Sun was conceived partly on the advice of a sociologist and social forecaster, Dr Mark Abrams. He produced reports with graphs and tables which appeared to prove the existence of a new, increasingly well-educated, less politically tribal, mass newspaper readership. Meanwhile in America, where most academic work on the media was done, the analysis of press influence converged on a \u201cminimal effects model\u201d. It noted that few voters changed their minds during presidential races, when coverage of politics was at its most feverish, and concluded that papers were not much of a factor in electoral contests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a12941e044bc5f936f928e83dc0d5d4bab4bc7f/0_0_1036_1351/767.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that this Sun front page was \u2018tasteless and wrong\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GNM/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many postwar American ideas, \u201cminimal effects\u201d quickly crossed the Atlantic, and helped shape the thinking of the small number of British media analysts. In 1974, the respected Colin Seymour-Ure wrote languidly in his book The Political Impact of Mass Media: \u201cMost British national newspapers ... are \u2018partisan\u2019 in only a loose sense.\u201d Beaverbrook had died in 1964. The equally rightwing co-creators of the Mail, Viscount Northcliffe and Viscount Rothermere, had died in 1922 and 1940, respectively. Newspapers were increasingly controlled by corporations seeking profits or prestige rather than political clout. In a 1977 essay titled \u201cThe Organization of Public Opinion\u201d, the media academic Tom Burns concluded: \u201cThe power of the press barons has gone.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It had not. In 1969 Murdoch bought his first British paper, the News of the World. While mostly interested in sex and scandals, it was traditionally a Tory paper. According to Roy Greenslade\u2019s reliable 2003 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/society1\">Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda</a>, Murdoch was permitted to acquire it partly because the other potential buyer was Robert Maxwell, then a book publisher and Labour MP.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s own politics, at this stage, were a slightly unformed but usefully ambiguous mix, both pro-business and pro-trade union. Despite the elite-bashing persona which he would deploy, brilliantly and shamelessly, in the intensely class-sensitive world of British newspapers for decades to come, he was in fact the son of an Australian press magnate, Sir Keith Murdoch. Sir Keith had been so influenced by the Mail\u2019s Northcliffe that he was nicknamed Lord Southcliffe. When Murdoch junior was asked if he would tell the News of the World what to say, he replied: \u201cI did not come all this way not to interfere.\u201d</p> <p>When the Sun was also put up for sale in 1969, after its first incarnation attracted too few readers, Murdoch and Maxwell again competed to buy it. Maxwell wanted to slim the Sun\u2019s staff, while Murdoch assured the paper\u2019s powerful unions that he had no such intentions. Again, Murdoch won. His Sun tried to be youthfully, fashionably left-liberal: it was against the death penalty, nuclear weapons and the Vietnam war; for Labour and personal freedom. Its endorsement of the party at the 1970 general election deferred to readers rather than tried to browbeat them: \u201cThis \u2026 far-from-perfect Labour government has just about earned the right to \u2026 another term of office. That is our view. But you have a mind of your own.\u201d</p> <p>During the late 60s and early 70s, the large advantage that the Conservatives had always enjoyed among the tabloids, in terms of both circulation and opinions expressed, suddenly evaporated. When the national union of mineworkers (NUM) went on strike in 1972 against Edward Heath\u2019s Tory government, the Express, despite still being owned by the Beaverbrook family, was sympathetic: \u201cThese men do a hard, dirty, dangerous job \u2026 All they ask is a decent wage. They should have it.\u201d The Mail acknowledged \u201cwidespread public support\u201d for the strike, and commented: \u201cSympathy for the miners is a good cause. It makes sense for Britain.\u201d The editor of the Sun, Larry Lamb, was the son of an NUM official and had once edited a union journal. Of the Sun\u2019s pro-strike coverage, Murdoch said afterwards, \u201cWe certainly pushed public opinion very hard behind the miners.\u201d</p> <p>Just as startling and forgotten, in Britain\u2019s first referendum on EU membership, in 1975, the tabloids urged their readers to vote in favour of Europe. When the pro-EU side won by 67% to 33%, the Mail rejoiced: \u201cThis is the most crushing victory in British political history. The effects of this thunderous YES will echo down the years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b44b4916709999db45cefad43a9a877459f631/0_0_4096_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Murdoch inspects one of the first copies of the Sun in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the tabloids\u2019 flirtation with cosmopolitanism and the left was short. In 1974, the miners went on strike against Heath again, and the Mail condemned them. When he called a general election that February, to try to end the dispute, the Sun endorsed the Conservatives. Some of this shift was a reaction against the increasing radicalism of parts of the union movement and the Labour party. The Mail became preoccupied by the presence of communists in the NUM. But the tabloids were also increasingly hit by strikes themselves. The stalling, inflationary British economy of the mid-70s had brought lower advertising revenues, higher newsprint costs, and higher wage demands. All Fleet Street papers had prickly unions, but the Sun\u2019s were the most rebellious of all, regularly stopping editions from appearing.</p> <p>James Alan Anslow joined the Sun in 1977, and worked there on and off for four decades, as well as writing and lecturing in academia about tabloids and their readers. \u201cSoon after I started at the Sun,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was working on production, and I let the word \u2018victory\u2019 through on a headline about a strike by the firemen\u2019s union. Kelvin MacKenzie [who later became the paper\u2019s most aggressively rightwing editor] gave me a bollocking. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know what we\u2019re all about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After Margaret Thatcher seized the Tory leadership from Heath in 1975, Larry Lamb quickly became a convert. The Sun editor would invite her to his office for evening chats and whisky, and published so many favourable pieces about her that the more cautious Murdoch, anxious about the Sun\u2019s large residue of Labour readers, would phone Lamb and ask, \u201cAre you still pushing that bloody woman?\u201d The Sun had backed the losing side at both the 1970 and February 1974 general elections. But by the late 70s many voters were turning against unions and collectivism, and the individualistic Sun\u2019s circulation surged, doubling over the decade. In 1978, it overtook its once-dominant leftwing rival, the Daily Mirror, to become Britain\u2019s best-selling daily paper. In January 1979, amid the strike chaos of the Winter of Discontent, the Sun lethally punctured the credibility of the Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, with a headline that sounded like a quote from him but was actually disguised editorialising: \u201cCrisis, What Crisis?\u201d</p> <p>The Mail was an early and effective Thatcher ally too. Its editor during the 70s and 80s was David English, a zealously rightwing former entrepreneur who had backed her coup against Heath (the Mail was the only paper to do so). English modernised the Mail\u2019s design, and turned the paper into a less fusty, more seductive advocate of Conservative values, presenting them as basic British common sense, somehow above mere party politics. The day before the 1979 general election, the Mail\u2019s front page read, \u201cThe Woman Who Can Save Britain\u201d. The Sun\u2019s endorsement of the Conservatives was less personal and more equivocal, but eye-catching: \u201cVOTE TORY THIS TIME.\u201d The return of the rightwing tabloids was complete \u2013 and with it came the press culture we still live in now.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As British voters have become more disengaged since the 70s, the tabloids\u2019 political messages have had to become louder. \u201cVOTE FOR MAGGIE,\u201d yelled the Sun\u2019s front page on the day of the 1983 general election. When Labour moved rightwards after losing, choosing the pragmatic Kinnock as leader, the Sun immediately dismissed him regardless: \u201cHe has no intellectual depth, no coherent philosophy.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnock\u2019s strategist Philip Gould, who would become Labour\u2019s key interpreter of voter behaviour during the 90s, began reading the tabloids closely. \u201cI looked at those papers and silently wept,\u201d he wrote after the 1992 general election campaign. Some tabloid journalists had mixed feelings about their papers\u2019 power. James Alan Anslow remembers: \u201cWhen the Sun did the lightbulb\u201d \u2013 its famous 1992 front page of Kinnock\u2019s balding head inside a bulb \u2013 \u201cI was out on the doorstep canvassing for him. Politically, I thought it was awful. Journalistically, I felt \u2026 professional admiration. I couldn\u2019t help smiling. In the office after the paper came out, there was a lot of chatting and smiling. There was a sense of being in amongst it \u2013 of counting.\u201d</p> <p>When Labour lost, despite a tired Conservative government, there was a surge of academic and media interest in the tabloids\u2019 political role. The \u201cminimal effects\u201d model had already begun to attract British doubters. In 1991, the media analyst William Miller had written about what he instead called \u201cthe Basildon effect\u201d. In this heavily working-class Essex constituency, which had one of the highest proportions of Sun readers in the country, a small and supposedly vulnerable Conservative majority had risen rather than fallen at the 1987 election. According to Miller, this swing had happened late in the campaign \u2013 when the Sun\u2019s onslaught on Labour was at its loudest \u2013 and it had been repeated in other similar Tory marginals. He suggested the paper had played a major role.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c1fe1b3a9785cb8adaeff8801526fc2f3aa100/0_0_590_768/384.jpg\" alt=\"The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.\" width=\"384\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The famous 1992 front page of Neil Kinnock\u2019s head inside a bulb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GMN/NI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1992, John Curtice interviewed a panel of voters from across the country, before and after the general election. Unlike Miller, he did not find tabloid readers shifting from Labour to the Conservatives. But he wrote that the papers did play a part in \u201cwinning over or maintaining in the Conservative camp electors who might otherwise have abstained or voted Liberal Democrat\u201d. All the scare stories about Labour, it appeared, had persuaded these pivotal voters to choose the Tories as the lesser evil, as they would in 2015.</p> <p>More ominously still for non-Tories, in 1992 Ken Newton found that people with Labour views who read a rightwing paper \u2013 of whom there were still millions \u2013 were more likely to vote Conservative than people with Tory views who read a leftwing one were to vote Labour. Tory papers were better at making converts than Labour ones, in other words, just as they would prove better at turning leftwing readers into Brexiters than the Labour press would be at creating remainers.</p> <p>By the 90s, many political observers assumed that readers of rightwing tabloids were a sort of block vote, to be deployed en masse by proprietors as decisively as union members had been by their leaders during the 70s. In academia and beyond, the tabloid factor was frequently cited as a reason why Labour would never win power again.</p> <p>There were weaknesses in this argument. The gap between the Conservative share of the newspaper market \u2013 between 70 and 80% \u2013 and the Conservative share of the vote at general elections \u2013 around 40% \u2013 suggested that papers were not terribly efficient creators of Tory voters. Even in 1979, when the Sun had said \u201cVOTE TORY\u201d, fewer than half of its readers had done so. Another third actually believed it had endorsed Labour. As Britain became a less deferential, less politicised society, readers could no longer be relied on to absorb or even notice bossy political articles in the way that they had in the editorialists\u2019 heyday of the 40s.</p> <p>Yet by the mid-90s, after four consecutive general election defeats, Labour was not interested in examining such complexities. Under Blair, the party generally sought to accommodate rather than challenge rightwing interests: Gould decided that the Mail was \u201cthe key influencer of Middle Britain\u201d, Blair that Murdoch was \u201cimmensely powerful\u201d. More than a year before Blair became Labour leader in 1994, a delicate political dance began between him and the tabloids \u2013 each side seeking to draw maximum advantage from the rising strength of the other \u2013 which culminated in the Sun endorsing Labour at the 1997 general election.</p> <p>The day before the announcement, Blair\u2019s press secretary Alastair Campbell was contacted by the Sun and told to call its editor, Stuart Higgins. \u201cHe said they were going to come out for us in a big front page tomorrow,\u201d Campbell wrote in his diary, capturing the sense of mutual triumph and machismo. \u201cStuart said Rupert Murdoch was sure [about Blair], and laughed \u2026 I took [Blair] to one side and \u2026 I said you remember in 1994 when I said we should try to get the Sun on board and you said you weren\u2019t sure it was possible, well, they are. He thought it was good news in its own right \u2026 [and] in the effect it would have on the other side\u2019s morale.\u201d The next day, the Today programme on Radio 4 reported that the Conservatives felt bewildered: \u201cOld friends\u201d \u2013 its correspondent meant the Sun \u2013 \u201care passing them by on the other side of the street.\u201d</p> <p>Less noticed was the fact that the paper had endorsed Labour on its own, almost unchanged, rightwing terms. \u201cLike us, Blair recognises that the Tories under Maggie Thatcher achieved remarkable reforms,\u201d said the Sun. \u201cBlair has promised to slay the dragon of Europe,\u201d it went on, and might even \u201ctame\u201d the welfare state. As well as choosing governments, the tabloids now wanted to decide what they did.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In 2004, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published a deceptively breezy political book called Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant! Its central argument was that how issues are \u201cframed\u201d \u2013 which points of view the media and other political tastemakers defined as acceptable, and the language used to do so \u2013 largely decides how voters think about them.</p> <p>For the last two decades, through Labour, coalition and Conservative governments, the tabloids have successfully chosen and then framed most of the debates that have dominated British domestic politics, ensuring that law and order, immigration, the role of the state, and Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe have all been discussed in ever more rightwing terms.</p> <p>The Blair government\u2019s determination to be \u201ctough on crime\u201d; the Brown government\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d; the Cameron government\u2019s onslaught on benefits-claiming \u201cshirkers\u201d; the May government\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d \u2013 all have been catchphrases, not always with workable policies attached, intended to \u201cplease the tabloids\u201d, in the euphemistic stock phrase of British political punditry.</p> <p>On occasions, the newspapers have directly intervened in the making of government policy. According to Nick Davies\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/21/hack-attack-truth-rupert-murdoch-nick-davies-review\">Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch</a>, in 2001 the Sun forced Brown as chancellor to permit more private sector involvement in the NHS. First, the paper condemned his cherished plan to increase NHS spending as too profligate, writes Davies, then a \u201cpanicked\u201d Brown \u2013 desperate not to be portrayed as a traditional tax-and-spend leftwinger \u2013 \u201ccontacted the Sun \u2026 agreed to rearrange his diary so that he could go to their office that day \u2026 [and] sat down with the Sun\u2019s outspoken rightwing political editor, Trevor Kavanagh, for an interview which \u2026 rapidly became a negotiation about policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff0099559541821fd4340b2de64fb6748741e78/47_36_1149_1569/732.jpg\" alt=\"The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Daily Mail backs Theresa May for prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, policy ideas that have been popular with the public but not with these papers, and their proprietors \u2013 raising taxes on the wealthy or on property; renationalising loathed and ineffective privatised utilities \u2013 have almost never been enacted.</p> <p>During the Blair era, tabloid circulations, like those of all newspapers, stagnated and then fell. British party politics, fixated on the \u201ccentre ground\u201d, was often as consensual as it had been during the 50s, when the tabloids had felt obliged to tone down their rhetoric. Yet this time they did the opposite, emboldened by the Blair government\u2019s acceptance of their agenda and eagerness to have friendly relations. The tabloids became more influential still.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the media in general adjusted to a new world of internet competitors, squeezed budgets, and recycled content, the papers became a dependable source of polemic for other outlets. \u201cSky and the BBC are still obsessed by reviewing the papers,\u201d says Charlie Beckett, a former TV executive who is professor of media at the London School of Economics. Presenters holding up tomorrow morning\u2019s front pages to the camera, he points out, \u201cis cheap telly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The need for broadcasters to be balanced, once seen as a threat, has created a market for tabloid shrillness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yelland says: \u201cThe first thing you do when you\u2019ve put together a front page, is get it over to Sky, to the paper review shows.\u201d Tom Baldwin, Ed Miliband\u2019s press strategist as Labour leader, told me: \u201cThey could say \u2018Black Is White: Exclusive\u2019 on the front of the Mail, and the next day, there\u2019d be a story on the BBC: \u2018Controversy over whether black is white \u2026\u2019\u201d The legal requirement for British broadcasters to be balanced, once considered a threat to the tabloids, has created a new market for their shrillness.</p> <p>It is even possible that the papers\u2019 political stances are even more influential now than in the past, precisely because they are less and less read. Their positions are simply assumed \u2013 rather than widely scrutinised for flaws or contradictions \u2013 and politicians and public opinion adjust accordingly. Gramsci, who died in 1937, would be appalled and fascinated.</p> <p>As the editor of the Sun, says Yelland, \u201cI was very much aware that most people were not reading the political stuff. But the Sun set the mood music of Westminster, of the lobby [journalists], of the morning meetings in every department in Downing Street.\u201d Like any good tabloid journalist, he may be overstating a little, but to manipulate the elite while insisting your journalism is for the masses is certainly quite a trick.</p> <p>While Labour leader, Miliband tried to break out of his party\u2019s suffocating tabloid relationship. Baldwin, who supported the move, remembers: \u201cAt first, we felt we had better keep talking to them, have dinners with the editor of the Sun. Ed would have drinks with Dacre. Then phone-hacking happened \u2026\u201d Miliband reacted to the scandal by attacking the tabloids\u2019 political influence, and calling for them to be properly regulated. \u201cThere weren\u2019t ever drinks with Dacre after that,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cDacre was screaming down the phone at Ed. It felt liberating, exciting, scary. Gordon Brown said to us, \u2018This is a big thing you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve got to keep your foot on their neck, or they\u2019ll come back up and smack you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet as often with Miliband, his anti-tabloid initiative petered out. \u201cEd\u2019s management style is to balance,\u201d says a former adviser, \u201cand there were some good personal relationships in the Labour team with some tabloid reporters.\u201d Baldwin says: \u201cWe lost the [internal] argument. We got back to business as usual.\u201d At the 2015 election, the tabloids tore into Miliband and Labour regardless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Cameron governments, it felt like Murdoch and Dacre were the adults, and the politicians were children</p> <footer> <cite>David Yelland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Cameron underwent a similar experience with the papers. At first, as Tory leader \u2013 influenced by his adviser Steve Hilton, who believed that in the digital era the views of newspapers were of increasingly minor relevance \u2013 Cameron decided that rather than \u201csucking up to Murdoch\u201d, as one of his aides put it, it was better to \u201ckeep your distance\u201d from the tabloids, and to focus instead on television appearances. Yet when the effectiveness of Cameron\u2019s leadership was widely criticised in 2007 \u2013 not least by Murdoch\u2019s papers \u2013 he quickly changed his approach. He hired the former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his director of communications, and maintained a high-profile, highly political friendship with the editor of the Sun and Murdoch favourite, Rebekah Brooks. In 2009, the Sun switched its support from Labour back to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/21/andy-coulson-resigns-david-cameron\">Coulson\u2019s resignation over phone-hacking</a> in 2011, and conviction for the same offence in 2014, Cameron\u2019s governments remained tabloid-friendly throughout, straining to come up with populist policies and language.But while the Mail backed the Conservatives as always, Dacre and his paper remained lukewarm towards the metropolitan Cameron. And when Cameron finally challenged the tabloids\u2019 worldview, the EU referendum, they were brutal towards him, and helped terminate his premiership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ee1058c1c337f8d863433588946bd42451e386/24_23_761_981/388.jpg\" alt=\"When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Cameron challenged the Sun\u2019s views on Europe he was brutally attacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baldwin says, \u201cI\u2019ve been amused to hear Craig Oliver\u201d, Coulson\u2019s successor as Cameron\u2019s communications director, \u201craging to left-of-centre journos about the rightwing press and how awful they are.\u201d Yelland argues that the tabloid barons are simply \u201cbetter at what they do than the politicians. Murdoch and Dacre have been around for so long, fashioning words and campaigns. During the Cameron governments, it felt like they were the adults, and the politicians were children.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Will the reign of the tabloids ever end?<strong> </strong>It was interrupted when the second world war created a kinder Britain, and again, fleetingly, after the phone-hacking scandal in 2011. Profound social change, or the exposure of journalists\u2019 excesses, can weaken even apparently impregnable tabloid citadels.</p> <p>Over recent decades, shifting public attitudes have undermined some of the papers\u2019 certainties. \u201cWhen I look back at the words I used to use as a Sun sub,\u201d James Alan Anslow remembered, \u201c\u2018the gay plague\u2019, \u2018black gangs\u2019. You\u2019d get sacked if you used those now!\u201d</p> <p>Charlie Beckett detects a hard-nosed rationale behind this softening: \u201cIn a tightening market, you don\u2019t want to put off readers. When you had a circulation of four million, it mattered less if you said something racist, say, and put off 5% of your readers.\u201d Moreover, the tabloids have sometimes received disproportionate credit for their liberal moments. The Mail\u2019s much-praised campaigning for the truth about the racist murder in 1993 of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence sits uneasily with the endless xenophobic nudges of its immigration coverage.</p> <p>The tabloids still look much the same now as they did three decades ago. Redesigns have been much rarer and more cautious than at other papers. So have alterations to the basic tabloid prose style. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re going to get from the first sentence,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThey haven\u2019t caught the conversational tone of the internet \u2026 their style is very clunky.\u201d David Deacon of Loughborough University says that in his research on election bias he finds that \u201cPeople are far more aware [now] of the narrative games, of tabloid-speak.\u201d The tabloids have always been self-conscious \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s The Sun Wot Won It\u201d \u2013 but nowadays their political rages would be almost camp, if they did not have such consequences. As Baldwin puts it, the papers often read \u201clike a parody of themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Anslow, who is 65, said he sometimes sensed a nostalgia in the air at the Sun\u2019s offices. \u201cIf we do a special front page, people say, \u2018It\u2019s a real classic. It\u2019s just like the old days.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the paper moved from its old premises in east London, an intimidating compound of hulking, almost windowless blocks behind high-security fences, widely known as \u201cFortress Wapping\u201d, to a much blander, more generic office building in central London. Its glass-walled, approachable-feeling lobby faces directly on to the street. Down one side are blown-up photographs from various Murdoch publications. The Sun\u2019s is just a generic showbiz shot, as if the paper\u2019s political coverage is less of a priority nowadays. On the Sun and Mail websites, political stories are much less prominent than in their print editions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is 14 months into an experiment in ignoring the tabloids. It may well be doomed; but his leadership has already lasted longer than the tabloids expected, and their ceaseless attacks on him, like their shouting down of anyone who doubts Brexit will be a success, have a small undertone of anxiety about them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00019ddb76e32e5f9e22e148aa42199f851bfbb3/0_0_3153_4055/778.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.\" width=\"778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may be ignoring the tabloids but they are not reciprocating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty-four years ago, the British political scientist Ken Newton pondered the multilayered puzzle of how newspapers and their readers relate politically, and produced perhaps the closest thing to an answer. \u201cThe press and its readers are likely to be mutually dependent,\u201d he wrote, \u201cinfluencing each other in a constantly shifting process of mutual adaptation.\u201d The tabloids may have adapted \u2013 a little \u2013 to their readers\u2019 changing attitudes, but the papers retain an old-fashioned suspicion of new kinds of Briton, and a nastiness towards people who do not fit their rigid worldviews. Above all, the tabloids remain stubbornly attached to the optimistic free-market ideas of the one prime minister that they have never turned against, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 an optimism that many of their readers have not felt since at least the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>This autumn, both the Sun and the Mail have responded to what the Mail\u2019s owner called a \u201cchallenging market\u201d for newspapers by making editorial redundancies. A Sun journalist emailed me: \u201cJust had massive compulsory redundos in editorial. Hardly enough bodies left to get out the paper. Mood is of the post-apocalyptic variety \u2013 survivors staggering around dazed and confused.\u201d</p> <p>Anslow, who started on the Sun 39 years ago, was one of those culled. Well before it happened, he told me he could imagine a Britain without tabloids \u201cwithin my lifetime\u201d. He went on: \u201cIf you take that kind of political communication away, we [Britons] will all go into our own ideological silos, because of the way social media works.\u201d</p> <p>More surprisingly, Tom Baldwin also fears that if the tabloids die, then what comes next could be worse. \u201cTheir political stories contain at least kernels of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout the tabloids, we\u2019ll be in a totally post-truth world.\u201d But in a world without tabloid truths, perhaps other kinds of politics will have a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\"> here</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

  "<p>Why has Britain\u2019s response to the dismantling of the refugee camp in Calais been so lively \u2013 or ugly? Because it raises fundamental questions about who we are as a country.</p> <p>Migration is being discussed, but it\u2019s a debate bedevilled by myth. There never was a time when Britain and the British identity was impervious to migration. Migration to Britain didn\u2019t begin when we joined the EU. The more common but equally faulty story that Britain slowly developed organically from Anglo-Saxon roots, until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/23/immigration-windrush-west-indians-jamaica-britain\">Windrush</a> arrived from the Caribbean and changed everything, is an increasingly embarrassing sign that we simply don\u2019t know the facts of our own history. The key economic, political and cultural events in our history \u2013 Roman Britain, the development of the English language, Magna Carta, the industrial revolution, the world wars \u2013 cannot be understood without reference to migration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/operation-to-clear-calais-refugee-camp-finishes-ahead-of-schedule\">Concern grows for 'left-behind' child refugees as fires hit Calais camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Three themes resonate across the centuries. First, immigration has been intimately tied to economic innovation and growth, notably finance, trade, wool and silk production, metalworking, and of course the enslavement of Africans that helped to fund the industrial revolution. One of the best-known examples is the tens of thousands of French Protestant refugees (Huguenots) who from the 1680s onwards settled in Britain. As the historian William Pettigrew writes on the Runnymede Trust\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/\">new website, ourmigrationstory.org.uk</a>: \u201cThey revolutionised the textiles industries, the arts and journalism, and provided much of the hard cash for the financial revolution that took place in London in the 1690s and allowed the English state to defeat Louis XIV.\u201d Silkweavers were perhaps most prominent in shaping the identity of Spitalfields, but they also spread to Macclesfield and Sudbury in Suffolk, where silkweaving is still practised.</p> <p>Second, the waves of migration were accompanied by waves of discrimination and violence against the migrants. The <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/from-slavery-to-freedom-the-narrative-of-james-albert-ukawsaw-gronniosaw\">Narrative of the freed slave James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw</a> reveals the extent of Britain\u2019s links to the transatlantic slave trade, the development of British colonies, and how its connections to the Americas underpinned migration links back to Britain. During the American war of independence (1775-83), but also during the seven years\u2019 war (1754-63) and the war of 1812 (1812-15), Britain offered freedom to any enslaved man willing to fight on its side. This was often the only way out of slavery, and following the 1772 Somerset case, formerly enslaved people were legally protected from being returned to the Americas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/26/fires-burn-in-calais-jungle-as-demolition-operation-continues-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59c5f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2843250\"            data-video-name=\"Fires burn in Calais refugee camp as demolition operation continues \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5810c2a5e4b01c528432cec1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026calaisburns_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/26/fires-burn-in-calais-jungle-as-demolition-operation-continues-video\">Fires burn in Calais Jungle as demolition operation continues \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gronniosaw was one of the thousands of migrants who made the journey. to Britain, and is known to us because his \u2018Narrative\u2019 went through many reprints. As Gronniosaw explains in his narrative, he met his wife, a white textile worker named Betty, and travelled with his children around the country looking for work. <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-ryan-hanley\">Historian Ryan Hanley</a> says: \u201cNot only did migrants like Gronniosaw experience many of the hardships common to poor people in Britain at the time, but they also had to contend with racial prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>The third theme is more positive. The historical record shows how the British people and state could and would accept migrants, and that migrants generally integrate. The state\u2019s response, as in <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/becoming-english-letters-of-denization\">the Letters of Denization</a> (which gave migrants the protections of citizens), or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1965\">1965 Race Relations Act</a>, was often a less complete affirmation of open, inclusive definitions of our country, and more a way of defending notable and principled citizens. They have existed down the ages; think Daniel Defoe writing in 1701 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/44081\">Since scarce one family is left alive, / Which does not from some foreigner derive</a>.\u201d) or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\">Gary Lineker speaking up for migrants in 2016. </a></p> <p>Because of their success, we barely acknowledge the multiple examples of migrant contribution, even the more recent ones \u2013 be they Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, or easyJet. We should better excavate that history at local levels across the country whether in public records offices, buildings, or even cemeteries and death records.</p> <p>Integration has most obviously occurred in the case of the Huguenots, who \u2013 along with other white European migrants \u2013 have simply been absorbed into Britishness. Will the British-born children of Polish migrants be more likely to follow this route to integration than the great-grandchildren of migrants from the Caribbean?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are, as we have always been, a country defined by immigration (and indeed emigration)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some groups \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/oms/romani-gypsies-in-16th-century-britain\">Jews, Roma, Gypsies</a>, African and Asian people \u2013 have been continually excluded, with our society actively blocking their integration. The belief that British identity struggles to include those identified as outsiders on grounds of race or ethnicity is also supported by evidence of discrimination in the labour market and other <a href=\"http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/CERD%20Civil%20Society%20Report%20UKfinal.pdf\">worrying indicators of social outcomes</a>.</p> <p>To the question of who we are, there is an obvious answer. We are, as we have always been, a country defined by immigration (and indeed emigration). It\u2019s a truth we should embrace, one that will provide the best resources for our success in the 21st century, post-Brexit or otherwise. But right now that truth is elusive. It\u2019s strange to see Germany, a country with much less history of migration and with onerous baggage from its past, appearing more confident in terms of its identity and values.</p> <p>Many in Britain spoke this year of \u201ctaking our country back\u201d, asserting the importance of sovereignty and democracy in the face of European bureaucracy. But it\u2019s equally obvious that many based those aspirations on an imaginary history. This confusion imposes a cost, as the notion of a country where people of migrant background are never truly British doesn\u2019t just misunderstand our past, it also pushes our nation down a route towards economic stagnation and social conflict.</p> <p>The good news is that for the foreseeable future, where we stand in terms of identity will be at the centre of national discussion. Let that be an informed discussion. This post-EU referendum moment allows us to face up to who we have been, and to understand who we are today.</p>",

  "<p>A startup bankrolled by Bill Gates is about to conduct the first public trials of high-speed body scanners powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/STA_Print.cfm?mode=initial&amp;application_seq=74125&amp;RequestTimeout=1000\">documents filed</a> with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Boston-based <a href=\"http://evolvtechnology.com/index.html\">Evolv Technology</a> is planning to test its system at Union Station in Washington DC, in Los Angeles\u2019s Union Station metro and at Denver international airport.</p> <p>Evolv uses the same millimetre-wave radio frequencies as the controversial, and painfully slow, body scanners now found at many airport security checkpoints. However, the new device can complete its scan in a fraction of second, using computer vision and machine learning to spot guns and bombs. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/us-airport-security-lines-homeland-tsa-pre-flight\">Homeland Security: 'be patient' as airport lines reach extreme lengths</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This means individuals can simply walk through a scanning gate without stopping or even slowing down \u2013 like the hi-tech scanners seen in the 1990 sci-fi film Total Recall. A nearby security guard with a tablet is then shown either an \u201call-clear\u201d sign, or a photo of the person with suspicious areas highlighted. Evolv says the system can scan 800 people an hour, without anyone having to remove their keys, coins or cellphones.</p> <p>\u201cThe importance of it being fast can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d said Aaron Elkins, an AI professor at San Diego State University, who is developing his own AI security technology. \u201cAny place you currently see a metal detector would probably consider an upgrade.\u201d</p> <p>Millimetre-wave scanners are useful because they can identify both metallic and non-metallic items, such as 3D printed guns and explosives. But they have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/04/airport-scanners-here-to-stay\">attracted criticism</a> because scanners were able to capture realistic images of people\u2019s bodies beneath their clothes. </p> <p>\u201cWe never build an image that would enable anyone to see anatomical details, so there\u2019s no naked peepshow in the first place,\u201d says Michael Ellenbogen, Evolv\u2019s CEO. \u201cNone of the raw data is stored and none of the data we do keep is traceable to an individual.\u201d</p> <p>Evolv claims that no human sees what the scanner is looking at. The system uses solid state micro-antennas to steer radar beams over anyone walking through the gate, and to pick up the reflections. That data is then fed to an AI system that has been trained to spot distinctive scattering patterns from all kinds of objects, including firearms, suicide bomber vests and even knives. The scanner also has a camera that takes a photo of each person passing through, enabling facial recognition. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2dd04aeabe14c5cd008ff33028f22152f905f100\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dd04aeabe14c5cd008ff33028f22152f905f100/83_0_348_209/348.jpg\" alt=\"The Evolv scanner.\" width=\"348\" height=\"209\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Evolv scanner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evolv Technology</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because it promises to be faster and cheaper than existing millimetre-wave scanners, the new device could bring airport-level screening to venues that were previously difficult to secure. </p> <p>\u201cTransportation is a very soft and attractive target,\u201d said Alex Wiggins, the executive in charge of security for Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cGiven the recent large-scale attacks at transit facilities in Europe, we need to see if there is technology that can screen large number of peoples and focus in on weapons and explosives.\u201d</p> <p>The three locations named in Evolv\u2019s FCC application process upwards of 300,000 people every day, although Denver airport said its pilot project with Evolv had yet to be finalised. The test in LA is due to run in November for three or four days, and will involve thousands of members of the public. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to see how finely these [scanners] can be tuned, and what size of weapons and explosives they can detect,\u201d says Wiggins. </p> <p>Evolv was spun out in 2013 from the Seattle-based firm of Intellectual Ventures, considered by some a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/27/intellectual-ventures-myrhvold-patent-lodsys\">patent troll</a> but by its founder Nathan Myhrvold as a <a href=\"http://www.intellectualventures.com/inventions-patents\">hi-tech invention factory</a>. </p> <p>Evolv received $11.8m in funding from investors, including a sizable chunk from Bill Gates, the ex-Microsoft billionaire. The company recently raised another $8m. </p> <p>Evolv has also benefited from close links with the US government, perfecting its technology with the help of a contract from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to <a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=165012&amp;x=.\">documents previously filed with the FCC</a>, Evolv\u2019s scanner was tested last year at the DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Laboratory in New Jersey, and the FBI\u2019s headquarters in Quantico, Virginia.</p> <p>But public tests will be invaluable, said Elkins. \u201cWhat was a really high-performing detection algorithm in the lab can get tripped up in the chaos of the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will go through with ice cream cones and sunglasses and backpacks.\u201d</p> <p>Evolv\u2019s Ellenbogen admits that luggage could be a problem. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what people can carry through the system versus what has to be separately inspected,\u201d he said. \u201cOur intent is for people to be able to walk through while carrying all the things they would normally carry.\u201d</p> <p>Another issue that worries both Wilkins and Elkins is false positives \u2013 when people are incorrectly flagged as carrying something dangerous. \u201cIf too many people are falsely checked, they have to turn down the sensitivity and just flush people through,\u201d Elkins said. \u201cThen it starts to not really be useful.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest problem, however, could be the very artificial intelligence that makes Evolv\u2019s scanner so attractive. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the hazards of algorithmic, as opposed to human, detection, is that an attacker who can reverse-engineer a machine can almost certainly find a way to make dangerous objects appear benign,\u201d said Ari Juels, a computer science professor at the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech.</p> <p>\u201cCountermeasures may be possible, but the research community does not yet have a good sense of how to construct them.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article\u2019s headline was amended on 26 October to clarify that Evolv\u2019s technology is not designed to replace existing airport security screening</em></p>",
  "<p>It seems so long ago now, but in the print media age the crispest insights we gained into the mindset of sportspeople often came via the humble magazine Q&amp;A. Thus we learned the favoured tipple of Australian cricketers was either their home state\u2019s major brand of lager, or, if they were a little bit edgy, rum and coke. Entirely anomalous fast bowler Geoff Lawson didn\u2019t drink at all, so his team-mates sprayed the aforementioned beverages all over him.</p> <p>Once you\u2019d processed the fact that every male athlete in Australia thought The Shawshank Redemption was cinema\u2019s high water mark, the funniest answers were often in response to that classic hypothetical: who are your three dream dinner party guests? Were an Australian cricketer to exclude any of Elle Macpherson, Greg Norman or Nelson Mandela they stood alone as a maverick (and their name was probably Greg Mathews). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/say-it-with-shane-warniemojis-is-the-app-no-one-asked-for\">Say it with Shane: WarnieMojis is the app no one asked for | Elle Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many settled for that exact formation \u2013 not exactly a triumph in social dynamics, unless Mandela was having previously undocumented trouble with his short game or Macpherson had some particularly searching questions about the South African justice system. Sadly, this table formation never actually occurred outside the fever dreams of Sheffield Shield dressing rooms. </p> <p>Anyway, the point I\u2019m trying to make is that having yearned to know more about the interior lives of these men, once we had, we were often confronted with childlike internal monologues. Which brings me to Shane Warne, whose soap opera life is now set to be turned into an unauthorised telemovie by Australian TV network Seven. </p> <p>Bless him, Warne has never hidden from the fact that the pleasures he derives from life are simple and, thanks to social media, they\u2019re as achingly transparent to the general public now as at any point of his life. We no longer need the Q&amp;A, we can just scroll through Twitter and check which z-grade celebrity he\u2019s currently nattering away to, or which drinks are scattered around his poker table. </p> <p>We already know Warne\u2019s favourite movie is American Pie because he never stops tweeting about Stiffler, a character who would also presumably end up spearing a rissole at Warnie\u2019s dream dinner party, which would also be attended by Bruce Springsteen, Chris Martin, a topless Angelina Jolie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/19/shane-warnes-mural-succeeds-in-uniting-the-art-and-cricket-worlds\">the rest of the gang from the infamous Warnie mural.</a></p> <p>Which is not to say Warne is happy about being the butt of condescending jokes, a philosophy some would say is at odds with social media stream in which he posts topless photographs of himself looking up from bed into a full length ceiling mirror. In the last 20 years Warne has variously been described as a \u201cgenius\u201d by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and also been openly mocked by former team-mates, but nobody has ever accused him of being enigmatic. </p> <p>To explain why Warne isn\u2019t happy with his life being turned into scripted television, one should step back in time a little to his playing career, when a publishing cottage industry developed around the Australian leg-spinner. That genre produced Spun Out, Paul Barry\u2019s excruciating 540-page opus of tittle tattle and pop psychology (\u201csneering and priggish\u201d, one reviewer called it), on which the new TV production will be based. </p> <p>In short, and not just because of books like Barry\u2019s, Warne came to the firm view that the genre of biography should not exist at all. He\u2019s on record, in fact, for saying that it should be<em> illegal</em> to write a book about a figure such as himself without permission. For much of his playing career he accepted the tabloid media scrutiny that came as part and parcel of what some saw as indiscretions in his private life, shrugging his shoulders at the headlines, but the books enraged him. </p> <p>Shane Warne is actually many good things, and in a lot of respects his enduring vanity has served him well in life, but his decades-long aversion to <em>other people</em> telling his story is something he\u2019s never let go and doesn\u2019t quite fit with his 2016 persona. Australians have always tended to take Warne entirely seriously when he\u2019s discussed leg-spin or had a cricket ball in his hand, but not so much otherwise. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/jun/02/david-squires-on-shane-warne-and-the-ball-of-the-century\">David Squires on ... Shane Warne and the ball of the century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem here for Warne is that having spent most of the last five years exposing every social and romantic happening of his waking life for all to see, he\u2019s not in a strong position to oppose a sensationalist TV series. How could it possibly be any stranger or more embarrassing than his actual life?</p> <p>The TV production basically writes itself, and if it\u2019s only movie-length, you sense the main problem for producers (and a relief for Warne) will be the process of omission. \u201cOK, we need John the Bookie in there, yep, and the diet pills, for sure, but when will the inflatable penis scene take place?\u201d</p> <p>In a poignant artistic flourish, maybe they\u2019ll start at the scene of Warne\u2019s first day job, delivering beds for Forty Winks, and perhaps end at his aborted rendezvous with Brynne Edelsten in May. \u201cBrynne then invited me back to her place around 1am for a nightcap, when I arrived, paparazzi were conveniently waiting outside her home to get the pic,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/confidential/shane-warne-furious-after-nightcap-pap-at-brynne-edelstons-house-after-celeb-poker-night-in-geelong/news-story/f2d78ad40fc488c9e2314f9bd4affc60\">Warne complained at the time</a>. \u201cI left instantly and thought how sad is that!\u201d </p> <p>Yet hovering awkwardly here is the possibility that no matter what the script-writers come up with, this new small-screen re-telling might not be anywhere near as \u201csad\u201d as the snippets we\u2019re so often fed by Warne himself. </p> <p>The cricket writer Christian Ryan once hit on a solid theory about Warne: maybe he\u2019ll always be more famous than he is loved. Maybe, one day, he\u2019ll assume a level of comfort with that fact. Whenever this telemovie airs, surely he\u2019ll also admit deep down that with respect to his own triumphant, turbulent and occasionally gobsmacking life, truth is far stranger than fiction.</p>",
  "<p>Growing up in multicultural Australia, I first really understood multiculturalism by going to school. Not via textbooks, but through my lived experience of making friends with kids from a dozen different cultural backgrounds, and being exposed to the range of different ethnic groups with whom I shared my suburb. I learned to get along with people very different from myself, or at the very least, I accepted their right to share my school community.</p> <p>For young people, schools are unique in their ability to foster these cross-cultural communication skills, and for orienting kids to the realities of our globalising world. British geographer Ash Amin describes schools as \u201cmicropublics\u201d, places where people from different backgrounds are thrown together on a daily basis to work together. In the process, they learn acceptance and cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>However, not all schools are equally well-placed to achieve this. As families increasingly turn away from the local public school in favour of private schools that are often restricted to particular religious groups, and of course, restricted to those who can afford the fees, Australian children are less and less likely to encounter the full range of our diverse society within their school communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/oct/27/all-they-see-is-your-race-because-that-is-whats-written-on-your-body-podcast\">'All they see is your race, because that is what's written on your body' | Christina Ho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same can be said for selective schools, the focus of my latest research. As education policy increasingly emphasises competition, school choice and elite programs for the \u201cgifted and talented\u201d, a growing number of schools have become demographically unbalanced, so that they can no longer operate as \u201cmicropublics\u201d or microcosms of the wider community. </p> <p>Selective high schools routinely top the annual league tables of HSC results in NSW, often outperforming prestigious private schools. For instance, James Ruse Agricultural high school, in north-west Sydney, has outperformed all other schools in the HSC every year for the past 20 years. </p> <p>The outstanding achievements of selective schools come at a cost however, to their students and to the community more broadly. Apart from the allegations that these schools are \u201chothouses\u201d breeding stress and anxiety among their pupils, my research examined another dimension of these school communities: their hyper-racialised environments. </p> <p>Almost all selective high schools in Sydney are dominated by students from a language background other than English (LBOTE). According to the MySchool website, at James Ruse, 97% of students were from a LBOTE in 2015. Across Sydney, LBOTE students regularly make up 80 or 90% of enrolments in selective schools. Most of these students are children of migrants from various Asian countries, especially China, Korea, other east and south-east Asian countries, and increasingly, India and south Asia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/east-asian-school-success-culture-curriculum-teaching\">\u2018Culture, not just curriculum\u2019, determines east Asian school success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This reflects Australia\u2019s elitist migration policy, which for the last 20 years, has favoured well-educated or wealthy applicants, who arrive as skilled or business migrants. As migration from Asia has grown, a new middle-class has formed in Australia, one that is more highly educated than native-born Australians. According to the Department of Immigration, among Australia\u2019s China-born and South Korea-born populations, nearly 40% hold a university degree, approximately double the national average. Among the India-born population, more than 50% hold a university degree.</p> <p>It is not entirely surprising that these families pay a great deal of attention to their children\u2019s education. They see education as the key mechanism for ensuring their children\u2019s future, in a society in which migrants lack the social networks and local knowledge that the native-born might use to get ahead.</p> <p>Arriving in Australia during an era of intensified educational competition, Asian migrants often adopt highly instrumental approaches to education, particularly around school choice (and residential choice), private tutoring, close monitoring of children\u2019s time use, and targeted training for selective admissions tests. As a result, their children now dominate the enrolments of most selective high schools. </p> <p>This ethnically unbalanced profile of selective schools has created a hyper-racialised environment within these school communities, in which people are eternally defined by their ethnicity. In Australia\u2019s multicultural society, we would hope that people working together would get to know each other as individuals, rather than perpetually seeing others as members of a particular ethnic group. Cultural difference could then become normal and unremarkable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Christina Ho on the ethnic imbalance in our selective schools\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/290188606&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In selective schools however, cultural difference is hyper-visible and a key means by which people identify themselves and others. As a minority group, Anglo-Australian students feel their whiteness more keenly in selective schools, while many Asian-Australian students feel more \u201cAsian\u201d, or adopt a more \u201cAsian\u201d identity than they might do in a more ethnically balanced environment. Even the homogenising label \u201cAsian\u201d \u2013 widely used by students from all backgrounds \u2013 fails to capture people\u2019s precise ethnic identity, and seems almost designed to emphasise difference from \u201cwhite\u201d. </p> <p>My interviewees, who included current students and recent graduates of selective schools, described how people\u2019s interests, abilities and preferences were seen in terms of ethnicity, and even subjects were racialised. Maths and sciences were \u201cAsian\u201d subjects, while the humanities and extra-curricular activities like debating and sport were \u201cwhite\u201d pursuits. These stereotypes could be damaging. For example, the notion that white students are \u201chopeless at maths\u201d could undermine their confidence in the subject, as one interviewee told me.</p> <p>In the playground, students often organised themselves by ethnicity, with \u201call white\u201d or \u201call Asian\u201d friendship groups sitting in their own demarcated spaces. One student told me that the \u201cwhite girls\u201d in her school even invented their own language, which they spoke loudly to each other whenever other students spoke Chinese. Another student described how the boys\u2019 lunchtime soccer teams were based on ethnicity, with the Indian (\u201ccurries\u201d) and white students teamed up against \u201cthe Asians\u201d, an arrangement known as \u201ccheckerboards versus the Asians\u201d.</p> <p>While hyper-racialised environments do not necessarily foster racism, and most of my interviewees denied that there was racial tension in their schools, they artificially inflate the importance of ethnic identification. This may make it more difficult to broaden one\u2019s outlook by transgressing cultural boundaries, or develop full-bodied cross-cultural understanding.</p> <p>Of course there are some students who do cross those boundaries and befriend people from different backgrounds to themselves. Among my interviewees were two Anglo-Australian students who joined \u201cAsian\u201d friendship groups, became fluent Chinese speakers and developed ambitions to live and work in China. One even dreams about becoming Australia\u2019s ambassador to China.</p> <p>However, systemically, selective schools are all about segregating a select few from the mainstream. These schools are also segregated from their local communities. Their enrolments do not reflect the demographic profile of the local areas in which they are located. In most cases, students of selective schools do not reside locally, but often commute long distances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/china-education-exams-parents-rebel\">Nine-hour tests and lots of pressure: welcome to the Chinese school system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the local public school can be a significant site of \u201ceveryday multiculturalism\u201d for young people and their families, selective schools rarely function as local schools, depriving their local areas of this potential micropublic. </p> <p>Ultimately, as Australia\u2019s education system becomes increasingly segmented by policies encouraging choice and competition, our schools are less and less capable of providing environments for young people to encounter diversity and learn how to deal with the rich mix of cultures found in our globalising society. </p> <p>For me, the extreme imbalance in selective school communities highlights the importance of the local comprehensive public school, where all are welcome, and where students encounter maximum diversity, not only in terms of ethnicity, but also socioeconomic status, religion, ability, aspirations and interests, and all the strange and wonderful subcultures that make up our community. Exposure to all of this is an education in itself. </p>",

Even liberal second amendment experts have called some of Clinton\u2019s explanations of her position \u201codd\u201d.</p> <p>As one law professor who supports gun rights put it, Clinton on guns is like a Republican politician who claims she supports abortion rights, even as she opposes Roe v Wade.</p> <p>At the final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be \u201ckept nonfunctional\u201d.</p> <p>In a controversial 5-4 decision, the court ruled that Americans have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for self-defense.<br></p> <p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/DemocraticDebate/story?id=4670271&amp;page=1\">dodged giving a clear answer</a> about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008, though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional.

The Clinton campaign has the candidate and surrogates arrayed across Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio today while the Trump campaign is in ... <strong>Washington DC and Utah</strong>? </p> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony today at his <strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/opinion/donald-trumps-shiny-new-washington-hotel.html?_r=0\">eerily</a> <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/trumps-d-c-hotel-shows-as-poll-sink-so-does-his-brand.html\">empty</a> new hotel</strong> in the nation\u2019s capital. He has two later events in North Carolina. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/790686778986422272\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DC does have three electoral votes <a href=\"https://t.co/3DRKa6yJYM\">https://t.co/3DRKa6yJYM</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/790686778986422272\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Trump running mate <strong>Mike Pence</strong>, meanwhile, will be covering serious ground, with events in three western states: Nevada, Utah and Colorado. Pence\u2019s stop in Utah is sure to have people talking, as the state usually is at the top of the rankings of states voting Republican. Mormon aversion to Trump and the independent candidacy of Evan McMullin have changed the calculus this time around. </p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> has two rallies in Florida today, one in Palm Beach County in the south-east and one in Hillsborough County on the Gulf coast. <strong>Tim Kaine</strong> has two events in Pennsylvania, while <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> is diligently trying to put his wife over the top in North Carolina, with three stops there today after three stops there yesterday. <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong> has three stops in Ohio, while senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has an event in Pittsburgh.</p> <h2>Trump with narrow Florida edge \u2013 Selzer poll</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-26/florida-poll\">A poll of likely voters</a> in Florida by gold-star pollster J Ann Selzer for Bloomberg politics has Trump slightly ahead of Clinton in the state, 45-43, when third-party candidates are included. That\u2019s within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Trump had 46% to Clinton\u2019s 45% in a head-to-head matchup. Clinton has a three-point lead in polling averages of the state. </p> <h2>Trump wants Biden behind barn</h2> <p>The campaign action overnight was typically nasty and nausea-inducing, with Trump saying that yes, he would like to go in back of the barn with Biden (Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/21/joe-biden-donald-trump-election-campaign-2016\">had said gym</a>), and campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich accusing Fox News host Megyn Kelly of having a \u201cfascination with sex\u201d because she takes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-sexual-allegations-nine-women-video\">women who say Donald Trump violated them</a> seriously.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/599d2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2841266\"            data-video-name=\"Trump says he would love to beat up 'Mr Tough Guy' Joe Biden \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-581013e6e4b0219a00d38b1c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/26/161026trump-biden_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/26/trump-says-he-would-love-to-beat-up-mr-tough-guy-joe-biden-video\">Trump says he would love to beat up \u2018Mr Tough Guy\u2019 Joe Biden</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The row on Tuesday night between Kelly and one of Trump\u2019s most stalwart supporters began when the host brought up the multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/13/list-of-donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations\">sexual assault and misconduct allegations</a> against the candidate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlC0-Ut8Ng\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oMlC0-Ut8Ng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>During the ensuing debate, which bordered on personal attack, Gingrich said the host was \u201cfascinated with sex\u201d and Kelly urged him to \u201ctake your anger issues and spend some time working on them\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s director of social media, later responded on Twitter, saying Kelly had \u201cmade a total fool out of herself\u201d and warning: \u201cWatch what happens to her after this election is over.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/791095922709200897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/megynkelly\">@MegynKelly</a> made a total fool out of herself tonight- attacking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>.
