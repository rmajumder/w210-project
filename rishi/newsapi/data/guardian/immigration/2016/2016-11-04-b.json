  "<p>I want to do something very simple this weekend to cut through the staging and the static in Canberra right now. I want to talk about what\u2019s happening rather than what people are saying.<br></p> <p>Over the next few weeks two things are likely to happen. The Turnbull government appears likely to unveil a deal that will allow some of the wretched souls detained in Nauru and Manus to finally be settled in other countries.</p> <p>Assuming no outbreak of extreme crazy (which is a big thing to assume in the current climate, I\u2019ll admit), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/australia-being-left-behind-by-global-momentum-on-climate-change\">it is also likely to ratify the agreement it signed up to in Paris last December</a>, the one that produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C.</p> <p>In normal political times, in that fantasy scenario where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull\">Malcolm Turnbull</a> won the July election resoundingly, banked his personal mandate and was permitted to act more or less consistently as the politician voters have seen in the past, these things could be just transacted and presented to the public on their merits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/could-a-mild-outbreak-of-humanity-be-behind-the-coalitions-cynical-new-asylum-politics\">Could a mild outbreak of humanity be behind the Coalition's cynical new asylum politics? | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Turnbull has two problems. The first is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party\">Labor</a> is within striking distance of government. When you can feel the hot breath of your opponent on your neck, the backroom wisdom in such circumstances tends to dictate that daily politics becomes about maximising the points of difference with your opponent. We can call this survivalist mantra \u2013 pick a fight, any fight.</p> <p>The second problem has been on full display since the prime minister failed to win the election in the convincing way he wanted to win. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/21/abbott-v-turnbull-pits-rightwingers-against-moderates-and-threatens-chaos\">Tony Abbott will play every point he thinks he can get away with</a>, and even some he can\u2019t get away with. Even if he\u2019s a lone assassin, and right now he is, disowned by mostly everyone in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition\">Coalition</a> for different reasons, the voters see division and the net effect on a government is corrosive.</p> <p>Quite apart from the bruised feelings and antics of the prime minister in exile, the government remains divided philosophically and factionally, and the Coalition lacks Labor\u2019s institutional mechanisms to enforce internal discipline.</p> <p>Everything is contested. Nothing is straightforward.</p> <p>So instead of just producing these two developments, the third-country resettlement deal and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris agreement</a> ratification, as straightforward achievements, as statements of what kind of government the Turnbull government aspires to be \u2013 a government that won\u2019t tolerate offending a basic principle of liberalism by keeping people arbitrarily detained offshore when they\u2019ve committed no crime, and a government that knows we have to deal with the existential threat of climate change \u2013 they have to be presaged by bouts of extremism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/climate-change-australia-falling-behind-rest-of-world-on-emissions-cuts-says-report\">Climate change: Australia falling behind rest of world on emissions cuts, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hence the proposed bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/30/asylum-seekers-face-lifetime-ban-on-entering-australia-if-they-arrive-by-boat\">banning asylum seekers from ever setting foot in Australia for the remainder of their days</a>, because that will fire up the base, wrong foot your opponent and lull the Fox News Lite night shift on Sky News \u2013 just in case anyone had a transitory impulse to wonder if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton\">Peter Dutton</a> had suddenly gone soft \u2013 which could easily trigger an outbreak of cognitive dissonance from Ray Hadley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/18/scott-morrison-offended-by-hadleys-request-to-swear-on-bible-he-backed-abbott\">and then Dutton might have to find a Bible to swear on.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/malcolm-turnbull-says-labors-stance-on-renewable-energy-is-political-claptrap\">Then there\u2019s all the shouting about windfarms</a>, which makes absolutely no sense, given that Turnbull knows precisely what has to happen by way of transition to low-emission technologies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg\">Josh Frydenberg</a> is one of the brightest people in the parliament.</p> <p>Both of these characters know full well coal is on the way out, and Australia will need the much-maligned windfarms and the solar farms to decarbonise the grid in sufficient time to meet our international commitments, and to try to mitigate against the dangerous effects of climate change.</p> <p>Both were called out diplomatically, but comprehensively, on the political bollocks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/energy-security-not-about-locking-in-status-quo-says-chief-scientist?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet\">in a speech the chief scientist made on Thursday night.</a></p> <p>Turnbull and Frydenberg, and the renewables bull horn do make a bit more sense if we tumble to the fact the government has not yet ratified the Paris deal, and doubtless wants to be able to ratify the Paris deal with only the mildest tut-tut from the Quadrant corner, rather than the whole process triggering yet another bout of internal cage fighting within the Coalition about climate change and whether it\u2019s happening or not.</p> <p>Frydenberg and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, are going to the planned meeting of leaders in Marrakech, Morocco, which starts this week.</p> <p>This pow-wow has been convened to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions, which was the core of the Paris agreement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/sorry-shock-jocks-but-the-public-isnt-buying-into-a-renewable-energy-panic\">Sorry shock jocks but the public isn't buying into a renewable energy panic | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In no rational universe does the Australian government want to be in a position of going to that meeting and telling other countries we don\u2019t intend to ratify the Paris agreement, but nothing is done until it\u2019s done and the process isn\u2019t yet locked down with a cabinet ruling.</p> <p>Obviously, this whole play \u2013 \u201clook at those dreadful renewables and, oh look, here\u2019s the Paris agreement\u201d \u2013 is a lot more complicated than a simple game of bait and switch.</p> <p>But for a bit of light relief at the weekend, you could think of this as a drawing room comedy in which the lead character says, \u201cMy, aren\u2019t windfarms terrible, Rupert,\u201d while Rupert placidly signs another piece of paper guaranteeing a proliferation of windfarms into the future.</p> <p>Thanks, Rupert.

It then added another day to the Melbourne festival \u2013 tickets for which sold out in seven minutes. It then added a third and final day \u2013 which again sold out. </p> <p>Clearly Australian drinkers, particularly Melburnians, are in the depths of a torrid love affair with the espresso martini.</p> <p>There are very few bars in Melbourne that can\u2019t or won\u2019t shake up an espresso martini. Bartender James Armstrong puts it succinctly: \u201cMelbourne loves coffee, Melbourne loves booze. It\u2019s literally the most Melbourne drink since a Melbourne Bitter.\u201d </p> <p>Despite this, the espresso martini is not at all a Melbourne invention \u2013 it was in fact invented in London during the 80s by the late, legendary bartender Dick Bradsell. </p> <p>The story goes that a famous model \u2013 Bradsell, the embodiment of old-school hospitable discretion, never said who \u2013 strode into his bar and asked for a drink that would first <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eqO-S-1PHzo?t=47\">\u201cwake me up, then fuck me up\u201d.</a> Bradsell obliged by whipping together the spirit du jour, vodka, some coffee liqueur, some simple syrup, and a shot of freshly pulled espresso. </p> <p>Bradsell christened the drink the \u201cvodka espresso\u201d but it wasn\u2019t long before it was given the name \u201cespresso martini\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/30/five-thoroughly-impressive-cocktails-you-can-easily-make-at-home\">Five thoroughly impressive cocktails you can easily make at home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once in Australia \u2013 the Melbourne bartender Fred Siggins <a href=\"http://punchdrink.com/articles/how-the-espresso-martini-became-a-national-obsession-in-australia/\">suggests that it arrived via UK bartenders on working holiday visas</a> \u2013 the espresso martini found a spiritual home in coffee-loving Melbourne. The bartenders I speak to about its popularity identify several reasons why it took off here. For David Ferris, it\u2019s the perfect common denominator:<strong> </strong>\u201cThey can fit in any setting: from fancy 40th-floor CBD cocktail bars to grimy rave clubs \u2026 If you have a group of five or more, you can\u2019t get them all to agree on a bitter Italian cocktail or something tequila-based \u2013 this drink works because it appeals to a really wide range of people.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe stimulant effect certainly plays a part,\u201d says a bar manager, Graham Espie<strong>,</strong> \u201ccoupled with Melburnians\u2019 entrenched sensibility to appreciate the bean in every available form.\u201d</p> <p>Venue managers seem to love the drink as much, if not more, than the customers who order it. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap as chips,\u201d Espie says. \u201cIt can cost the venue as little as three dollars, and is sold in some places for over $20.\u201d (Espie adds that at his venue, Howler, \u201cWe keep ours at a reasonable price and use good vodka.\u201d) </p> <p>While some of that mark-up is dedicated to labour costs, there is still some serious coin to be made from them \u2013 especially when compared with other drinks. </p> <p>\u201cI can only sell a vodka Red Bull for $12, when it probably cost me around two dollars and 80 cents to put up,\u201d says Clara Edmonds, <strong>\u201c</strong>but I can sell an espresso martini for $20.\u201d </p> <p>The numbers involved are sometimes staggering: Espie estimates that Howler sells 10 times as many espresso martinis as any other cocktail, while Edmonds calculates that at one venue she worked at, more than 50% of the drinks she\u2019d ever made were espresso martinis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"741ad9174b1f7bcf5448b3ac2486add15f301d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/741ad9174b1f7bcf5448b3ac2486add15f301d8d/0_0_2592_3131/828.jpg\" alt=\"Espresso martinis\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mixologists yearn to remain at the cutting edge.

At a party filled with hospitality workers, I mention I am working on an article about espresso martinis. </p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about fucking espresso martinis!,\u201d one bartender spits. She has, it turns out, recently worked a shift where a hen\u2019s party came in bearing little signs on sticks printed with the words \u201cespresso martini\u201d, so they wouldn\u2019t have to bother talking to their bartender. </p> <p>Another contacts me when she finds out about this article with an impressively vitriolic rant: \u201cEvery arsehole who\u2019s never ordered anything other than Melbourne Bitter and the occasional rum and ginger orders 50 of them at a time under the delusion that it will make them appear to have some kind of class and half an idea about cocktails \u2026 I\u2019ve only met one or two bartenders that don\u2019t sigh or roll their eyes or contemplate suicide every time the words \u2018six expresso martinis thanks, mate\u2019 flop out of some drunkard\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Espie argues that familiarity breeds contempt: \u201cMixologists yearn to remain at the cutting edge. If they feel that things are becoming mainstream, they don\u2019t want to be associated with it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that, at least to the cocktail cognoscenti, there\u2019s something more than a little daggy about the espresso martini. The name itself is a remnant of the benighted cocktail culture of the 90s, when nearly everything served up in a v-shaped glass was a \u201c-tini\u201d of some sort: apple martini, French martini, flirtini. (Bradsell tried, after the drink had been rechristened as the espresso martini, to rename it the \u201cpharmaceutical stimulant\u201d but it never stuck.) </p> <p>And, as Edmonds notes, it commits another cocktail crime: continuing the somewhat disreputable Prohibition-era trick of disguising the taste of liquor with strong, sweet flavours: \u201cThe espresso martini\u2019s flavour masks the booze \u2013 you can use, excuse my French, shit vodka in an espresso martini and still make it taste good. Particularly in Melbourne, because we have such good coffee.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7ac2f2d7d310f36aa3da60eb8c82b7ef3386510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ac2f2d7d310f36aa3da60eb8c82b7ef3386510/0_0_4727_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An espresso martini at Pascale\u2019s at QT Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An espresso martini at Pascale\u2019s, at QT Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Loucas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flexibility of the cocktail has encouraged experimentation to keep it on-trend, with some Melbourne bars taking it beyond Bradsell\u2019s original four-ingredient recipe. </p> <p>The easiest tweak is a more flavoursome spirit base than the original vodka, such as rum or tequila. More high-end bars use pretty recherch\u00e9 techniques to tart up the drink. Bartender Dominique Cacioli, for instance, developed a version that pairs a chilled base \u2013 Illy espresso liqueur, Chambord, and Woodford Reserve bourbon, blended together and barrel-aged \u2013 with a hot foam flavour, and bitter white chocolate floating on top.

Elika Rowell, co-owner of Melbourne coffee roastery Square One, thinks it\u2019s time to reconsider: \u201cChilling espresso over ice shocks it into severe bitterness \u2013 a totally undesirable trait in coffee. Yes, you can add simple syrup to it to try to put a veil over that bitterness, but it will always taste muddy or dirty. Why does everyone want to use a product that actually doesn\u2019t taste good unless you add sugar to it?\u201d </p> <p>Her suggestion? Bars should talk to their coffee suppliers first. \u201cThere are so many awesome coffees around that all taste totally different ... Picking a coffee to suit what you\u2019re doing could be really challenging, but also super-interesting.\u201d </p> <p>According to bartender Clara Edmonds, any drink that wants to take over as the king of caffeinated cocktails would have to jump more than a few hurdles. \u201cPlease, any bartender out there, give me a better option. One that is accessible to everyone, enjoyable for everyone, price-pointed for every owner, easy to make, one that every bartender knows how to make.\u201d </p> <p>If a drink nails all of those key components, Edmonds says, \u201cit will probably take off. But until that better drink comes along, I think the espresso martini will still be Melbourne\u2019s cocktail.\u201d <br><em><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.espressomartinifest.com/\">The Festival of the Espresso Martini</a> runs until 6 November at the Meat Market, North Melbourne</em></p>",
  "<p>The US election matters as much to the world as it does to Americans. The overriding reason is that an immense and present danger hangs over multilateralism and the notion of a rules-based global order. A Donald Trump victory would immediately make the world more worrying and unsettled than it already is. The US may no longer be seen as the world hegemon, whether benign or threatening, but it is still the single most important power. Its behaviour has unique potential to either make solutions possible or to add to areas of chaos. A Trump presidency would be bad for the US and dangerous for the world. A vote for Hillary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it.</p> <p>Domestic politics and the clash of personalities have dominated this campaign. But the little that Mr Trump has said is enough to know where the foreign policy risks and promises lie in the 8 November vote. A Trump victory would severely damage US standing almost everywhere. His strongman antics are a liability, not an asset. They are as distressing as they are ridiculous. Believing a man-to-man approach with Vladimir Putin will instantly dissolve Russia\u2019s aggressive revisionism reflects more ignorance than it does bravado. Mrs Clinton has a reputation for a hawkish outlook, but this will be tempered by war-weary public opinion in the US. She recognises that in the 21st century, US power has more chances of attaining goals if it acts inclusively, and not with go-it-alone reckless tactics. She has already applied much of this as secretary of state \u2013 playing a key role in the historic deal with Iran, in pushing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-18/hillary-clinton-secretly-pushed-cuba-deal-for-years\">a new relationship with Cuba</a> and managing the complex US relationship with China. A Clinton presidency should rely on soft power in a smart way, a philosophy she touched upon in her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-dnc-transcript.html\">Democratic convention speech this summer</a>. She should pay close attention to climate change, development and working out fairer global trade arrangements. The US should also take the lead on international justice by signing up to the international criminal court \u2013 and Mrs Clinton has expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/us-international-criminal-court\">\u201cgreat regret\u201d </a>about Washington\u2019s refusal to join.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5274f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701797\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton: Trump's continual praise of Putin 'bizarre and astonishing' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1895be4b013613fffb552\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\">Clinton: Trump\u2019s continual praise of Putin \u2018bizarre and astonishing\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are questions that Mrs Clinton\u2019s team, should they enter the White House, need to resolve. She\u2019s revealed precious little of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/17/hillary-clinton-supports-obama-keep-troops-in-afghanistan\">what she\u2019d do about Afghanistan</a>, a 14-year war that president Obama pledged to end, but that is still grinding on. If she sits behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/02/23/plan-to-close-guantanamo-bay/\">she will have to work out what to do with the</a> dozens of inmates remaining in Guantanamo Bay. When she talks of an intelligence surge, there are concerns<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\"> about what this means for the spying powers of the National Security Agency</a>. Mrs Clinton is a politician with the experience to tackle these matters. Mr Trump is not. He is more interested in pandering to dictators than in holding them accountable for crimes. He\u2019s spoken in favour of torture. His approach to trade is in line with his approach to immigration \u2013 the building of walls. He has portrayed global warming as a hoax. Mrs Clinton can be trusted with the nuclear button. Mr Trump cannot. A Trump presidency would be a leap into the unknown. His bigotry, his love of weapons, his impulsiveness and his America first-ism are all dangers. His victory would likely lead to more, not less, global confrontation.</p> <p>The most pressing issues are the burning crises of the Middle East. These will continue to hinder a US \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia. There are no easy answers here. Mrs Clinton may want to put as much emphasis on protecting civilians as on combating Isis \u2013 she has spoken of creating a no-fly zone in Syria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">a proposal that carries too much risk</a>. She will have to search for better leverage in the region; heftier diplomacy that perhaps includes coercion through sanctions.</p> <p>For Europe the stakes are high. Mrs Clinton is concerned about the old continent\u2019s prospects. Mr Trump plays on American isolationism \u2013 he supported Brexit and cares little for transatlantic security guarantees. Russian muscle-flexing means that, whoever becomes president, European nations can no longer rely on the US to do all the heavy lifting. Global governance is under increased strain. Geopolitical competition is rife. US leadership has a key role to play. Mrs Clinton helped turn the page on the disastrous George W Bush era. The diplomatic accomplishments of the past eight years should not be minimised. Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Obama could have anticipated the crises that befell them once they reached office. How a president reacts matters greatly. On this count alone Mrs Clinton deserves to be elected.</p>",

Noting that one of the themes dominating this year\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://icelandairwaves.is/\">Iceland Airwaves</a> festival is Icelandic hip-hop, an article in the Reykjavik Grapevine, amusingly titled <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://grapevine.is/culture/music/airwaves/2015/09/28/get-rich-or-freeze-tryin-7-airwaves-rap-acts-not-to-miss/\">Get Rich or Freeze Tryin</a>, lists some of the acts worth looking out for. It has also coined the acronym <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2015/12/11/meet-the-nwoihh/\">Nwoihh</a>, for the New Wave of Icelandic Hip-Hop.</p> <p>Day two kicks off with a variety of intriguing new rap acts, starting with Au\u00f0ur, who is said to perform \u201csmudged R&amp;B\u201d. He\u2019s the Icelandic Weeknd, basically, only blond, offering a slight spin on the genre by strumming an electric guitar as he croons sadly about the sorrowful travails of the high life, like Ed Sheeran shambling uninvited into <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI-zb_aP0So\">The Party &amp; the After Party</a>. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t quite have the charisma to pull off quiet depravity in the way Abel Tesfaye does, and he\u2019s too keen to telegraph his moral dissolution by saying \u201cfuck\u201d every other word over his slow, torturous soul. \u201cI wanna be alone tonight,\u201d he sings, and he probably will be. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBH_bhvn6I\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MRBH_bhvn6I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mantisfromdamudgang\">Lord Pu$$whip</a> keeps things dark and brooding, with his take on eerie, codeine-groggy, grinding hip-hop.

In a brightly lit skiwear store, the hyperactive pair perform their set of fun-size novelty ditties, one of them wearing red trousers, the other in a purple parka so tacky you\u2019d swear she was subversively trying to reclaim Icelandic white trash or something.

Still, the venue down by the sea is rammed for V\u00f6k, with their male/female configuration and pleasantly pallid xx/Poli\u00e7a-style pop.

Here, however, the high ceilings conspire against the generally excellent Holter in terms of acoustics. But her music is also let down by her supposed allies: the double bass and violin work, but the drums are plodding and the saxophone drowns out her light ululations. And her material, seemingly designed to take flight, is frustratingly tethered. </p> <p>Where Holter is experimental, Hannah Lou Clark is a husky alt-rocking throwback, in the nicest possible way: it\u2019s actually something of a relief to hear a musician and a band without any electronics. With a mainly female outfit (save for the token bloke drummer), she plays a set that flits between 80s AOR and the Breeders/Belly/Throwing Muses 90s college-rock axis. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo09--jnbZ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fo09--jnbZ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The penultimate place I visit tonight is like Heaven \u2013 the London club, not the abstract paradise.

  "<p>The Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">article 50 case</a>. And it has undermined our constitution in the process. The government appears to be fuelling this attack.

They do law. They are selected to be judges on their legal ability. Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection \u2013 which is not, for example, the case in the US. The judges of the American supreme court, when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election, which was contested in the courts, each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them. So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic. One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts. This attracts business to the UK, because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics.</p> <p>The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be: who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing people\u2019s rights on the prime minister\u2019s say-so, and undermining casually the authority of judges? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict: judges against the people.</p> <p>We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote. But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process. Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/gina-miller-brexit-victory-triumph-democracy-over-politics\">As Gina Miller\u2019s lawyers, we fought and won a victory for democracy | Emily Nicholson and Katy Colton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is very little doubt, when you read this judgment, that the judges have&#xa0;loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance with&#xa0;the law and the facts. The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were&#xa0;an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, weren\u2019t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should&#xa0;be&#xa0;delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not&#xa0;unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way.</p> <p>Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they can\u2019t defend themselves. That\u2019s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so.</p> <p>The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer.</p> <p>They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our&#xa0;country.</p> <p>There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome \u2013 which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging.</p> <p>The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">defend the judges</a>. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard.</p> <p>Truss\u2019s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn\u2019t care less about the constitution.</p>",

  "<p>Do you eat Nutella by the spoonful? Or just spread it on toast?</p> <p>The answer to that question might seem like an intensely private matter, but it is one that is currently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/02/2016-26407/reference-amount-customarily-consumed-for-flavored-nut-butter-spreads-and-products-that-can-be-used\">being studied by regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration</a>, which is asking consumers how much of the famous Italian nut-cocoa concoction they eat, in an attempt to determine whether Nutella is a \u201cspread\u201d or a \u201ctopping\u201d.</p> <p>The answer could lead to a change in how Nutella is labeled in the US \u2013 which in turn could make it more attractive to calorie-conscious consumers.</p> <p>Ferrero, the multibillion-euro behemoth Italian confectionery company behind Nutella, has launched an effort in Washington to change Nutella\u2019s current designation, which was established in 1993.</p> <p>Under current rules, Nutella is considered a \u201cdessert topping\u201d, along with fruits, syrups, spreads, marshmallow cream, nuts and dairy and non-dairy whipped toppings. Critically for Nutella, the designation, which the FDA said was based on a 1991 consumer survey that showed a \u201csignificant\u201d number of respondents used Nutella as a dessert topping for ice cream, meant that the average serving size was considered to be two tablespoons. </p> <p>The product\u2019s US label lists that this estimated serving size contains 11 grams of fat, or 17% of the daily recommended value, and 200 calories. </p> <p>If Ferrero gets its way, the FDA will soon change Nutella\u2019s designation so that the \u201cnut cocoa-based spread\u201d is regulated in the same way as honey, jams, jellies, fruit butter and molasses. The average portion size for those is one tablespoon. The change would therefore reduce by 50% the amount of fat and calories listed on Nutella\u2019s US nutritional label.</p> <p>The UK, France and Australia, among others, use the one tablespoon as an average serving size.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/31/nutella-fight-los-angeles\">Nutella feud led to shopper punching 78-year-old man, officials say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nutella, which is made with sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts and cocoa, has also provided the FDA with its own research suggesting that most people consumed about one tablespoon every time they ate Nutella, and that in about half of those occasions, it was eaten with bread. Ferrero cited a 2012 survey of 722 Nutella consumers that showed just 6% eat Nutella on its own.<br></p> <p>According to public documents listed on www.regulations.gov, Ferrero has been lobbying for the change since 2014 with the help of its attorneys, Washington law firm Hogan Lovells. A May letter from the law firm to the FDA requesting a meeting on the issue was signed by Joseph Levitt, a Hogan Lovells partner who previously served as the director of FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.</p> <p>In Italy, Nutella is ubiquitous, used both as a spread on bread, but also as a filling in flakey cornetti, <a href=\"https://www.google.it/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=cornetto%20italian\">Italy\u2019s version of croissants</a>, in cookies, cakes and ice cream.</p> <p>In its coverage of the news, <a href=\"http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2016/11/03/news/nutella-151208736/\">La Repubblica said a final decision would be made in two months</a> \u201cand the pounds gained, accordingly\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s fashionable to dismiss all politicians as equally disappointing, unprincipled or simply venal. Since the system is gridlocked and out of touch, surely that means they\u2019re all just as bad as each other.</p> <p>But amid the wreckage of the political class, Donald Trump is different \u2013 and not just because of his politics or his rhetoric. He is in a class of his own, taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/aug/23/donald-trump-psychopath-hitler\">narcissism and amorality</a> to a whole new level.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need a trove of leaked emails to understand just how different Donald is. You just need to get to know the Trump Foundation a little better.

It\u2019s not pretty reading. </p> <p>Trump and his supposedly charitable works are a grotesque distortion of philanthropy, a word whose roots come from the Greek for loving people. Judging from his philanthropy, Trump mostly loves one person, whose name just happens to be Donald.</p> <p>Instead of donating to a foundation with any meaningful purpose, Trump invested in his favorite pastime: inflating his self-image. This is his life\u2019s work, whether it\u2019s the Trump brand of business, politics or charity. The product is the same: an artificial version of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/nyregion/condemned-and-praised-by-trump.html\">1997 story</a> of when he was principal of a Bronx public school for a day. It was a cute program designed to boost struggling schools in New York City, and the supposedly wealthy property developer delighted in the scene.</p> <p>The school chess team was holding a bake sale to raise $5,000 to pay for travel to go to a tournament. Trump handed them a fake million-dollar bill. After making them the butt of his joke, Trump wrote them a real check for just $200.</p> <p>What kind of person mocks the students he is supposed to be helping?</p> <p>A man who shows up uninvited, a year earlier, to the opening of a nursery school for children with HIV/Aids. Trump sat on stage, pretending to be a donor, when he had given nothing. Not a penny. He posed for photos alongside then mayor Rudy Giuliani and the developer who actually donated generously to build the school. Then he simply drove away, having done nothing.</p> <p>That\u2019s Donald Trump. The man whose charitable foundation buys <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/painter-reveals-20-000-portrait-purchased-trump-foundation-article-1.2854613\">giant portraits of himself</a> to hang in his own golf resort.</p> <p>The Post called more than 400 charities with some connection to Trump. It found <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc7ZuJr4_QAhURHGMKHZkGB3wQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years%2F2016%2F06%2F28%2Fcbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH-MaRE_XKgY7kPJ0JO53KEVZKqA&amp;sig2=tcACPSGFjiIRo9n3uXXz8Q\">just one gift</a> from Trump in the past eight years: to the Police Athletic League of New York City, for less than $10,000.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s charity would not matter if he didn\u2019t brag about it so much. The scrutiny began when he skipped a primary debate as part of his petty feud with Fox News, staging a fundraiser for veterans instead. Trump promised to give $1m to the cause, but the money only materialized after months of media questions.</p> <p>For all his boasting about his foundation, most of the money came from outside donors, not from Trump himself.</p> <p>Normally you\u2019d say this kind of man has no shame. It\u2019s true: and that\u2019s exactly how Trump has managed to get to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America.</p> <p>Shameless is the way he won the primaries. Where other candidates were mildly restrained in their Muslim-baiting and nativist nightmares, Trump could always take things beyond the extreme. No previously elected official could trash Mexico and demand payment for a border wall. </p> <p>Shameless is the way he has conducted himself as a nominee. He has picked fights with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/30/donald-trump-muslim-father-khizr-khan-democratic-convention-speech\">Gold Star family</a> and promised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/debate-donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-hillary-clinton\">lock up his political rival</a> without due process. He has praised Russia while attacking his opponent for supposedly jeopardizing national security.</p> <p>And it turns out that a good chunk of Republicans like his shamelessness. They confuse his rule-breaking for the kind of free spirit that will reform a broken system.</p> <p>A real reform candidate could have won this election in a landslide. A self-disciplined extremist could have rallied the disaffected masses to his candidacy.</p> <p>But Trump is no reformer and he has no self-discipline. He abused the tax system to convert corporate losses into personal tax benefits. Then he accused his rival of failing to stop his tax avoidance, when she actually voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/donald-trump-tax-loophole-hillary-clinton-congress\">close</a> the very loophole that he has exploited.</p> <p>Like the scrutiny of his foundation, the long IRS audits he suffers are entirely of his own making. Trump will no doubt cast such investigations as political revenge, long after this election is over.</p> <p>For now, Trump is like the arch villain of a dozen superhero movies: the more he is attacked, the stronger he gets. The only solution is the kryptonite of election defeat, because with it comes the ultimate public rejection.</p> <p>No matter how much the national polls fluctuate, the state-by-state polls represent a disaster for Trump. States that he needs to win such as Virginia and Pennsylvania are out of reach. States he needs to defend, such as North Carolina, remain in jeopardy. States that Republicans haven\u2019t needed to defend in decades, such as Georgia and Utah, are vulnerable.</p> <p>There is only one refuge left for a man like Donald Trump: the shameless undermining of the democratic process itself.

  "<p>Every time I interview a Brexiteer, I come away more confused than I arrived. This week I thought I was going to meet the pub trade\u2019s real life Al Murray, for the parallels between Tim Martin\u2019s public image and the fictional Eurosceptic landlord appear disconcertingly close. In fact, on the train to JD Wetherspoon HQ in Watford I opened the Guardian to find a quiz inviting readers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/who-said-it-pub-landlord-al-murray-or-jd-wetherspoon-founder-tim-martin\">to guess which quotes to attribute</a> to each publican. When I run the quiz past Martin later, even he gets two answers wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/wetherspoon-boss-eu-leaders-brexit-talks-tim-martin\">Wetherspoon's boss: we could drop European brands over Brexit bullying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The founder of Wetherspoon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/jan/05/theeuro.europeanunion\">first entered the debate about Europe in 2002</a>, when he distributed 500,000 beer mats across his pub chain, urging Britain not to join the euro. Before this year\u2019s referendum he printed up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/wetherspoons-brexit-beer-mats-eu-referendum-imf\">another half a million mats</a>, encouraging his customers to back Brexit. One of Vote Leave\u2019s few high-profile businessmen, the multi-millionaire was back in the headlines this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/wetherspoon-boss-eu-leaders-brexit-talks-tim-martin\">attacking EU leaders for \u201chectoring\u201d the UK</a>. If Jean-Claude Juncker doesn\u2019t stop \u201cbullying\u201d us, he warned, Wetherspoon pubs might stop stocking European wines and lagers and buy its drinks elsewhere. \u201cBritons could BOYCOTT European booze if Juncker punishes UK, warns Wetherspoons boss,\u201d whooped a Daily Express headline.</p> <p>But Martin\u2019s vision of Brexit turns out to be very different to that of others on his side. During the referendum campaign, a diversity of reasons for leaving was one of the leave side\u2019s great strengths; amid the chorus of different arguments there was something for almost everyone. Now that they have won, however, their incompatibility is becoming overwhelmingly clear. In many respects, Martin\u2019s view of Europe is as unlike Nigel Farage\u2019s \u2013 or Al Murray\u2019s \u2013 as mine.</p> <p>We meet in his office, an unostentatious room cluttered with boxes of Mo\u00ebt champagne, which he gives to office staff when it\u2019s their birthday. At 6ft 6in, well built and ruddy-faced, he looks more like a farmer than a multi-millionaire chairman, and now that he has tamed his silver mullet into a more conventional haircut, the most striking thing about him is his voice. Martin grew up in Northern Ireland and New Zealand, and the accent meanders between the two, via the West Country, interrupted by endless eruptions of booming laughter. I can\u2019t remember meeting anyone who laughs so much, so I ask if he is enjoying his role as a political campaigner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46f1eb105d71677038ff59e373f177986c2f63de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46f1eb105d71677038ff59e373f177986c2f63de/0_167_1398_1745/801.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Martin pulling pints in 1999\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin pulling pints in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPPA Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s quite weird, actually,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause it was unplanned.\u201d In 2002, in the wake of the ERM debacle and with the prospect of Britain joining the euro, Martin made the \u201cbanal observation\u201d that \u201cevery other currency in the world has got a government. The euro can\u2019t work without a government. I kept waiting for a Harvard professor to come out of the woodwork and say, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard such ignorance in my life.\u2019 But they never did. So I just kept repeating it. I became someone on the national news, repeating the same phrase.\u201d He breaks into a cackle. \u201cAnd in the end, the point was true.\u201d</p> <p>Once Britain opted not to join the euro, Martin lost interest in Europe. \u201cI never said a word.\u201d Had we met even just a couple of years ago, would he even have described himself as fiercely Eurosceptic? \u201cNot in the way that a lot of fiercely Eurosceptic people were. I think I was probably just starting to become aware of the lack of democracy at the heart of the EU, and formed the amateur philosophical theory that for the future of humanity \u2013 for prosperity and peace \u2013 you must have democracy. Because if you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d and he starts to laugh again, \u201cyou always end up with a nutter in charge.\u201d (Does the same apply to businesses? \u201cYes! Even more so, only the customers are the electorate.\u201d) Martin wouldn\u2019t even have been too unhappy for us to remain in the EU. \u201cI just agreed with David Cameron that it needed fundamental reform.\u201d</p> <p>The 61-year-old is of the firm, if increasingly heretical, opinion that Britain has benefited enormously from EU migration, \u201cnot just economically but socially and culturally\u201d. His preferred Brexit model would continue to allow anyone from current EU member states to live and work here. \u201cIf you look around the world, successful economies and countries have had gradually rising populations, and that\u2019s needed for the UK as well.\u201d The only change he would make to the free movement of labour would be to exclude countries who join the EU in the future.</p> <p>How, then, did he feel when the leave campaign focused so heavily on immigration? He exhales uneasily, ums and ahs, and says: \u201cWell, you\u2019ll always get an element of xenophobia in any society, but I don\u2019t think Britain is generally xenophobic. There was one poster I didn\u2019t think should have been put there. But for me, I argued from the point of democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Martin doesn\u2019t even share <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\">most Brexiteers\u2019 fury</a> at the high court ruling requiring parliament\u2019s consent to trigger article 50. \u201cWell, it creates a bit more uncertainty,\u201d he offers, \u201cso I can\u2019t exactly welcome it. But I\u2019ll support the legal outcome, because I believe in the law, and I believe in parliament, and I believe in democracy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/wetherspoons-founder-tim-marting-blasts-establishment-over-brexit-vote\">Wetherspoon's founder rails at establishment over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The democratic deficit is Martin\u2019s sole objection to the EU project. \u201cThe thing I cannot understand is that when I said I think democracy is crucial for the future of the world, I\u2019d have thought people would pour out of the doors saying, \u2018Yes! Tim is right!\u2019 But people on the remain side just don\u2019t seem to think like that. The emotion of people who\u2019ve been to good universities, et cetera, is not that they owe everything to democracy, but that they owe everything to people like them, who are better able to run companies, the civil service, universities, societies in general.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cbetter able to run companies\u201d catches my attention. Martin studied law at university, and qualified as a barrister, but then at 24 bought a pub in north London. There was more than a touch of the maverick, plucky little guy about his business model as he expanded: when brewers refused to sell him their tied-lease pubs, he bought up old banks and shops, licensed the converted premises and set about selling affordable food and drink to the unfashionable masses. Famously scruffy, he drives an old Volvo \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t own a yacht\u201d \u2013 and is pointedly unimpressed by the pretensions of professional boardroom culture. It makes me wonder if his Euroscepticism is really another expression of his emotional rebellion against the blue-chip elite.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re driving at, but no.\u201d It\u2019s the remainers, he claims, who are motivated by emotion. \u201cSomeone from the Financial Times said I was a great amateur philosopher, which is an insult \u2013 and also probably true.\u201d He hoots with laughter. \u201cAnd I think modern people think because they don\u2019t go to church they\u2019re more sophisticated and don\u2019t have a religion. But I think what the EU became was a quasi-religion for that sector of society. And universities are the modern day seminaries.\u201d</p> <p>Although happy to be a philosopher, he is emphatically not a politician. The last time he voted in a general election was 1992; \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that fact. I just didn\u2019t feel strongly enough.\u201d The only other time he has ever voted was in the 80s, for Margaret Thatcher, because she was his local MP. He mispronounces Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart\u2019s names, and until recently Nigel Farage was the only Ukip politician he had even heard of. Were he American, he would vote for Hillary Clinton, and thinks Donald Trump is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d, but adds that \u201cI trust the American people to look into it in a bit more detail than me,\u201d so will defer to their judgment next week. \u201cI would never want to be a politician. I know my limitations, and I\u2019m sure politics is more difficult than it looks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"041e7cba40f974468c68580efeed2439e95d1fd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/041e7cba40f974468c68580efeed2439e95d1fd3/0_167_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin being interviewed prior to the EU referendum \u2013 in which he urged his customers to vote leave \u2013 in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Martin being interviewed prior to the EU referendum \u2013 in which he urged his customers to vote leave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin\u2019s indignation this week about EU leaders\u2019 hostility towards Britain did seem politically naive.

It was impossible to know how they would react.\u201d He was very cross with Juncker for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ba02b24-8c8a-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1\">telling EU business leaders to be \u201cintransigent\u201d</a> in their dealings with British companies. \u201cAnd after telling them to make sure the UK pays a price, he has to expect people from the UK who are fighting from the opposite economic position to make the opposite case!\u201d Well, yes, quite.

I haven\u2019t got a boycott. Absolutely not. I was just attempting to show that if European companies do what Juncker says and try to get heavy with us, inevitably we\u2019d go elsewhere.\u201d I don\u2019t know what \u201cget heavy\u201d means. \u201cWell, no one does!\u201d he hoots.</p> <p>Martin has said the UK doesn\u2019t need to sign a trade deal with the EU, because his pubs don\u2019t sign deals with suppliers. He can\u2019t think running the country is like running a pub, can he? \u201cWhat I was saying is that you can\u2019t go into negotiations with the EU insisting upon a particular outcome. If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do. We\u2019d like to trade with you. You want to trade with us. So what basis would you like to trade on? That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure this would resolve the impasse. Martin is banking on the EU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/eu-firms-higher-tariffs-export-to-uk-than-vice-versa-civitas\">aversion to tariffs</a> to overcome its impulse to impose terms that deter other members from leaving \u2013 and he may be right. But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more.</p> <p>We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon\">Wetherspoon\u2019s</a> is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">go out of business every week</a>, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing. With nearly 1,000 pubs, it turns over \u00a31.5bn a year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/jd-wetherspoon-sports-direct-zero-hours-contracts\">employs 35,000 staff</a>, and makes Martin, who owns between a quarter and a third of its shares, worth roughly \u00a3250m. But a sign on his office wall reads \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d \u2013 \u201cand I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Critics accuse the chain of corporate blandness, and he concedes that \u201cthere are instances where the design hasn\u2019t been good enough, and it has given too much of an impression of impersonality or airport lounge. Pubs need individuality.\u201d He spends three days a week visiting his pubs all over the country, and constantly worries about their future. \u201cYou lose a lot without pubs. They\u2019re an important part of the social and cultural life of the country.\u201d But whereas pubs must charge 20% VAT, supermarkets pay \u201cvirtually no VAT on food sales\u201d, allowing them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/supermarket-beer-sales-overtook-pub-sales-first-time-last-year\">subsidise drinks prices</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/who-said-it-pub-landlord-al-murray-or-jd-wetherspoon-founder-tim-martin\">Who said it: Pub Landlord Al Murray, or JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut most of the big companies say nothing about it. Because the people running them are taking too short-term an approach; they\u2019re there for five years, they\u2019re not looking 10 or 20 years down the line,\u201d Martin says. He worries about millennials binge-drinking cheap supermarket spirits at home, instead of learning \u201csocial drinking\u201d in pubs, which have \u201cmore or less become ghettos now for adults. Some sort of system that allowed 16-year-olds to have a beer or two in a pub would be good.\u201d</p> <p>Martin might not share all of Al Murray\u2019s views about Europe, but he is a big fan. He\u2019s sure it was Murray who assured an anxious post-referendum public: \u201cCrisps will remain at the current price,\u201d and named as his most extravagant possession: \u201cMy wife, and even she\u2019s a bit mean.\u201d In both instances, it was actually him \u2013 which, of course, only makes him laugh again. \u201cShould have got the crisps right.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a tendency to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Presidents_Blinder_Watson_Nov2013.pdf\">overendow political events with economic significance</a>. However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations.</p> <p>For the most part, the candidates\u2019 platforms are standard, partisan fare. Hillary Clinton argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.</p> <p>However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/04/us-adds-jobs-october-unemployment-rate-election\">US adds 161,000 new jobs as Americans head to the polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200565.htm\">\u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d</a>, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.</p> <p>Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/biography/hoover-campaigns-and-elections\">raise agricultural tariffs to protect them</a>. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/12798595\">intensified the Depression-era slump</a> in world trade.</p> <p>On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/04/14/Trump-says-he-will-revive-Pittsburgh-s-steel-industry/stories/201604140107\">Trump told audiences</a> that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/?_r=0\">45% on China</a> and <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/feed\">35% on Mexico</a>.

Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed.</p> <p>This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists <a href=\"http://economics.mit.edu/files/6613\">David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson</a> have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Electoral college maths</a> makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off.</p> <p>Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/public-uncertain-divided-over-americas-place-in-the-world/\">believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs</a> than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/feed\">Germany</a>, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/07/the-real-reason-the-u-k-voted-for-brexit-economics-not-identity\">lost most in trade with China</a>.</p> <p>Free trade has been a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/02/pdf/c2.pdf\">source of economic progress</a>. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards.</p> <p><em>Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest</em></p>",
  "<p>Every winter, people who have enjoyed outdoor summer swimming challenge themselves to continue through the colder, darker months. For those who manage to keep going through that first season, cold-water swimming often becomes a lifelong passion. If you have already taken the plunge, or are considering whether to embark on a winter season, three new short films, all showing at this month\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.mountainfest.co.uk/\">Kendal Mountain Festival</a>, will inspire you.

Vivienne stands at the water\u2019s edge, rubbing her red hands together before undressing. You almost hold your breath when she walks into the freezing mountain lake. Afterglow follows Vivienne as she sets off alone across the snowy landscape of Snowdonia to an isolated mountain lake. It\u2019s certainly at the more extreme end of winter swimming, but Rickman-Poole has been swimming outside since she was a child \u2013 and in Snowdonia\u2019s lakes for years \u2013 and is passionate about cold water. She might be standing in the snow shivering but inside she\u2019s glowing.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of being enveloped in freshness \u2013 it\u2019s almost a craving \u2013 and that\u2019s what you do it for.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of fresh water where Rickman-Poole lives in Snowdonia but she does have a favourite spot. \u201cThere is one particular lake \u2013 Llyn Du\u2019r Arddu \u2013 it\u2019s a 90-minute walk from my house; the cliffs around it are very dark and imposing (<em>arddu</em> means dark), but the water is the most incredible blue. It almost feels bottomless.\u201d</p> <p>In the film Rickman-Poole talks about the allure of deep water. \u201cI\u2019m always searching for that abyss. It gives you a real clarity of thought.\u201d It sounds alarming, but watching her floating in a huge dark body of water surrounded by mountains you start to see the appeal of being so immersed in nature.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/156957605\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/156957605\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As a photographer, she is as interested in the way the female body moves in water as she is the mental experience of it. She has photographed herself underwater but her current project is less intimate, more epic. Two years ago she embarked on <a href=\"http://www.viviennerickmanpoole.co.uk/swimsnowdonia\">Swim Snowdonia</a>, a project to explore every body of water in Snowdonia and record her experience of each one photographically, whether it\u2019s dipping her toes in or a full swim.</p> <p>She puts the surge in popularity of outdoor swimming down, in part, to austerity: \u201cWe want freedom but also to do things for free and anyone can get into water \u2013 we don\u2019t have to pay a huge amount of money.\u201d Her advice for people starting out is to listen to your body: \u201cStart off in a wetsuit to get used to it and then just do everything very slowly until you feel right. Get out when you start to feel cold, get to know your own body and its limitations.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/156957605\">Afterglow</a>,</strong><strong> by Eyes and Ears films, will be introduced by Vivienne Rickman-Poole at the Outdoor Swimming session on Sunday 20 November at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.mountainfest.co.uk/programme/event/the-outdoor-swimming-session\"><strong>Kendal Mountain Festival</strong></a></p> <h2>Kari Furre </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6916302b31a320f1baea993564adb05936d4938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6916302b31a320f1baea993564adb05936d4938/0_32_1022_613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kari Furre, outdoor swimmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kari Furre, outdoor swimmer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kari Furre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI started swimming outdoors when it was called \u2018going for a swim\u2019,\u201d says Kari Furre, an artist who is profiled in a <a href=\"https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/kari-furre-mountain-journal-short/\">new short film that is part of the Mountain Journal Short series</a> from outdoor brand Alpkit.<br></p> <p>\u201cI was having an annual mid-life crisis and I did one of the early <a href=\"https://www.swimtrek.com/\">Swimtrek</a> holidays in the Greek islands. Then it suddenly occurred to me that you could swim outside in England. It was crazy. All through the 1970s and 80s the water quality wasn\u2019t good. You were advised not to swim in rivers or reservoirs and you didn\u2019t question it. But I started to swim outside, and I met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katerew\">Kate Rew</a> on a Thames swim and together we set up the <a href=\"http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/\">Outdoor Swimming Society</a> (OSS).\u201d</p> <p>The film shows Furre swimming the length of Windermere, a 10.5-mile challenge that took her just over six hours. \u201cNot bad for a grandma,\u201d as she puts it (Furre is 67).

There\u2019s a meditative quality to it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI live in near Totnes in south Devon and am lucky to have some great swimming places nearby. There\u2019s Dartmoor with rivers falling off it all over the place and we\u2019ve got a really nice coastline. Thurlestone Rock is a lovely reef \u2013 you can see kelp and spider crabs \u2013 it\u2019s like swimming over a garden. At the estuary on the river Avon you get a fantastic current and there are lovely pools in the upper parts of the Dart.\u201d<br></p> <p>As for cold-water swimming, she\u2019s not as keen on it as others, and wears a wetsuit in winter (a no-no for more militant swimmers). But she certainly makes it look easy in the film, standing on the Sugary Cove beach, near Dartmouth Castle, in a wetsuit and woolly hat, before calmly walking into the chilly water and setting off around the cliffs.</p> <p>\u201cMy advice for anyone getting started is to just keep swimming [when the summer ends]. When you get into very cold water it takes 60-90 seconds for your body to give in so you have to go through that barrier: so it\u2019s horrible for 90 seconds then you feel fine. Afterwards, you\u2019ve got about five or 10 minutes and then the cool blood whooshes into your core and you get something called the \u2018after drop\u2019, so you need to get dressed warmly and have a hot drink before that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Furre will be introducing<a href=\"https://www.alpkit.com/screen-room\"> the Alpkit film</a> at the festival\u2019s Outdoor Swimming session on 20 November.

  "<p>French authorities have cleared nearly 4,000 people from Paris\u2019s biggest makeshift migrant camp, insisting those moved would be given shelter, food and support, and helped with asylum applications.</p> <p>In a pre-dawn operation, police sealed off the sprawling ad-hoc shanty town of tents and cardboard shelters that stretches for almost 1,000 metres (3,300ft) from under the arches of the Stalingrad M\u00e9tro bridge. A fleet of 80 buses took men, women, children and groups of unaccompanied minors out of the area.</p> <p>The operation was organised jointly by the state and Paris city authorities.

Andy Sparrow is off today, so my colleagues and I will be keeping you up to date with all the latest developments in the government\u2019s fight to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p> Yesterday, Theresa May suffered a massive setback in what was the most important development in the Brexit story since her election as prime minister, after a high court ruled that parliament should legislate on invoking article 50. That means there needs to be a proper bill, passed through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs given a chance to amend it. Up until now, May has refused to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit in order to retain as much control as possible.</p> <p> To jog your memory of A-level politics, power in a democratic state such as Britain is conventionally shared by three bodies: the executive, which rules and proposes laws; the legislature, which passes laws; and the judiciary, which determines whether laws are being obeyed. Yesterday\u2019s landmark ruling means MPs and peers have for the first time got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process.</p> <p> Some key things that you need to know:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The government plans to appeal against the ruling, but informed commentators believe it is likely to lose again.</strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of Brexit being overturned are still minimal, as most MPs and peers who voted to remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured. </strong></li> <li><strong> The chances of a soft Brexit have increased significantly. If there is a bill, parliament will have the chance to exercise leverage.</strong></li> <li><strong> There is a real possibility that May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March, as the need to legislate could cause a delay.</strong></li> <li><strong> We are more likely to see an early general election than we were this time yesterday - a vote some commentators have dubbed \u201cthe Brexit election\u201d.<strong><br></strong></strong></li> </ol> <p> Today, the prime minister is due to speak to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and tell him that she is going to press ahead with her plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen anything you think we ought to cover, I\u2019ll be reading your comments below the line, or you can reach me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadiakhomami\">@nadiakhomami</a>.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/ruling-on-brexit-opens-way-to-mps-revolt\">Article 50 ruling leaves Theresa May facing potential MP revolt</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-04T09:40:17.352Z\">at 9.40am GMT</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The Palace Hotel building has loomed over Manchester\u2019s Oxford Street since the 1890s, a glum, Gothic monument to late-Victorian commerce. There\u2019s no doubting the magnificence of the place: the former Refuge Assurance Company has soaring ceilings, ornate cupolas, acres of lugubrious, decorative tiling. But it always struck me as the hero of its own horror story, smelling for ever of ancient cabbage and gravy, and staffed by grey-skinned retainers in league with ghouls ready to pounce as you slept fitfully in your slightly mouldy bed.</p> <p>Brrr.

This felt wrong, all wrong. Their signature is small, friendly, slightly batty \u2013 no way would that work in this cavernous space. But I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong: it\u2019s a jaw-dropping, dazzling tour de force, from the glittering bar with its many on-tap ales and beers and truly fine cocktails, to the twinkling, fairylit Winter Garden. <a href=\"http://www.refugemcr.co.uk/\">The Refuge</a> is now less scary old crone and more dramatic, drop-dead glamourpuss. A vague echo of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Hotel#The_Shining.2C_by_Stephen_King\">the Overlook Hotel from the Shining</a> only adds to the vaguely spooky allure.</p> <p>Anyone who has eaten at the original will recognise the Volta style, careering all over the globe with decks in tow. They talk the local produce talk, but fling it about with the louchest abandon: South American ceviches, Middle Eastern mutabal, pak choi, chimichurri, preserved lemon \u2013 the whole polyglot shebang. Lamb shawarma, a Volta stalwart, brings a pile of meat with a massive thwack of flavour, some shreds pleasingly biltong-chewy, others moist and mutton-ripe, with a pool of harissa and thick, cooling yoghurt: no looker, but an appealing brute of a thing. Cooking fish for this size of operation is a brave move, but the kitchen nails it: whole sea bass is fragrant with lime, ginger and coriander, its belly pregnant with pine nuts, its cooking perfectly judged. A fat slab of flawless, crisp-skinned hake comes on a black \u201cdaal\u201d made not of lentils, but of black-eyed beans, all murky with masala and topped with shards of fresh ginger. Stout bruisers of salt cod croquettes are crisp outside and fluffy with emulsified fish and mash within, plus a properly pongy a\u00efoli flecked with parsley on the side.</p> <p>There are nods to the US: buttermilk chicken (not hugely crisp, but succulent, brined meat) comes with cast-iron pot of cornbread seething with fruity, fiery jalape\u00f1o butter. And pear and hazelnut tatin, its crisp edges tarred with caramelised fruit juices, is a clever rethinking of a classic, its deceptively soothing espresso custard a bullet straight to the cranium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/19/grafene-manchester-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\">Grafene, Manchester: It breathes \u2018massive, tumescent budget\u2019 with every tile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, there are teething issues: food seems to come from far, far away, occasionally turning up the wrong side of tepid; seasoning can be a little off.

But to do what they\u2019re doing on this scale, and still score hit after hit, is quite the achievement.

I hate to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but we remainers were always sceptical when the pro-leave side promised that a vote to leave the EU would mean <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brexit-backing-curry-industry-furious-9190224#ICID=sharebar_twitter\" title=\"\">subcontinental chefs would be welcomed with open arms</a>. Alas, the curry unions bought it.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21588077-future-curry-houses-looks-grim-giving-up-gosht\" title=\"\">Economist has observed \u201cThe curry house is a British institution</a>\u201d. At the high watermark of New Labour, Robin Cook declared chicken tikka masala was the national dish. Of course it is British Bangladeshis, not Indians, who are the main engine of the Indian restaurant industry, providing the UK\u2019s balti, jalfrezi and korma dishes among others. I\u2019m a product of the trade: my late father had two tandoori establishments at one time, and toiled tirelessly to support us. Even my mum did her share of unsociable hours for the Huqs\u2019 curry career.</p> <p>The contribution of the curry trade to the exchequer is substantial; it is estimated to be worth \u00a35bn to the British economy, and annually employs 200,000 people \u2013 but it has <a href=\"http://www.goldstarchefs.co.uk/recruitment/\" title=\"\">staffing problems</a>. The British Bangla population is now coming of age and branching out \u2013 the nation\u2019s most famous Bengali is probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/bake-off-nadiya-hussain-bbc-paul-hollywood-channel-4\" title=\"\">Nadiya Hussain, last year\u2019s Great British Bake Off winner</a>, a title attained not by making naan but cupcakes. My siblings and I didn\u2019t fancy working in the family business \u2013 one became a Blue Peter presenter, while I became a lecturer and am now an MP. Following a familiar immigrant trajectory, there\u2019s also been diasporic shift from the inner cities to the leafier suburbs.</p> <p>Back in 1971 George Harrison sang \u201cBangladesh, sure looks like a mess\u201d. This description now applies to the situation unleashed by the self-destructive decision to leave the EU following the monumental miscalculated gamble of the referendum. Government back-of-a-fag-packet immigration policy aiming to reduce immigration down to the tens of thousands is not only a flop but it\u2019s unworkable. Constrained by dogma, the Tories are intent on aping Ukip rather than addressing genuine skills shortages in our economy be it in fruit-picking, IT or curry cooking. Another unwelcome byproduct of a vote that centred on immigration is the attendant climate of emboldened xenophobia and rocketing hate-crime \u2013 and we haven\u2019t even left the EU yet.</p> <p>When I was growing up we were all Asians together. Now faith seems to be more clearly asserted, and those who are mixed race make up an ever-bigger demographic. No party can take Asian votes for granted. Perhaps it was for this reason that Priti Patel was chosen to woo the subcontinental chefs during the referendum campaign. On the Today programme and elsewhere curry leaders accordingly came out for Leave, believing this was the only way to save their industry from extinction. I doubt that the curry constituency could have swung the result, but it was sorely misled.</p> <p>This week, addressing the Commons from the opposition frontbench for the first time as newly promoted shadow home affairs minister, I asked about that promise. I wanted to know when we could expect the red carpet to be rolled out for curry cooks from the subcontinent. I got a big fat raspberry. Theresa May\u2019s immigration minister declared that there are no plans to deviate from the long-stated strategy to have our own home-grown curry chefs rather than to import them. Just as Osborne said 12 months ago. No change there then. The pledge had as much value as the NHS money promised on the side of that infamous bus.</p> <p>My office has also received an invitation to the glitzy British Curry awards. This year it promises the Right Hon Priti Patel at the event as chief guest. It\u2019s not made the pin-board, even if we so-called \u201cremoaners\u201d have had some wind in our sails after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/03/parliament-must-trigger-brexit-high-court-rules\" title=\"\">yesterday\u2019s high court judgement</a>.

Eighteen tests into it and he averages 24 with the the bat (good for a number 8), and 36 with the ball (good for a part-timer). The perfect all rounder would make the team with either skill, a good one with one or the other. But Marsh would make the team on neither.

Playing devil\u2019s advocate, Marsh is clearly prodigiously talented and at 25 he has time on his side. Plus, alternative all-rounders are hardly knocking the door down to be selected. In the modern era, can a four man attack be justified?

With Australia 156-0 at drinks, they had gotten through a rugged mini-session to begin against the experienced Proteas\u2019 pair Steyn and Philander, it looking a lock for Warner to notch a ton and Marsh to maybe follow suit. </p> <p>Instead? The hosts lost 4-for-25 in that second hour to legitimately open the door to the tourists finding a first innings lead. And all that without their spearhead Steyn, who has, according to South African team management here at the ground, \u201caggravated an old injury\u201d when leaving the field reaching for his right shoulder, since going to hospital for scans. </p> <p>The collapse began with Warner, who two balls after drinks guided Philander into the hands of Amla at first slip for 97. It was a brilliant hand for the most part, but he was gutted with the dismissal. Albeit one that Philander had very much earned after beating his bat more than once early on. </p> <p>Khawaja (6) came and went in the space of a couple of overs, beaten by a Rabada inducker from around the wicket that took his off stump out of the ground. Too quick, too good. Next was Smith (0), with the most controversial of those to fall in the match so far, Aleem Dar adjudging him lbw after dancing so far down the track he was in position to shake hands with the bowler Majarah. Alas, DRS confirmed that despite the journey he had made down the track the ball was going on to clip leg stump. What scenes, the young left arm spinner earning his first Test scalp in the process. </p> <p>And finally, Marsh (63) in the moments leading to lunch fell in similar fashion to Khawaja, Philander getting plenty of movement back into the left hander from around the wicket, a relatively easy leg before decision for Umpire Nigel Llong, Marsh not saved by DRS. It was a resilient innings from the local, surviving plenty, but he\u2019ll ultimately be disappointed to depart right when he did. </p> <p>Righto, that\u2019ll be it for me. A fantastic Test match shaping up here, especially if South Africa can find a way to get through Australia\u2019s vulnerable lower-middle order and get into the bowlers. It\u2019ll be JP Howcroft with you after the breather. Enjoy the rest of the day. I certainly will be.

He went on to basically throw it back to the on-field officials to make these judgments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOn-field banter is something that has always been part of the game but when that banter turns to abuse that crosses the line to something different.

  "<p>Anatomy of a Song is a \u201cjukebox oral history\u201d of 45 iconic pop, rock and R&amp;B hits - and a treasure trove of music trivia between hard covers. The book is an expansion of columns Marc Myers first wrote for the Wall Street Journal, each one taken from interviews with the writers, performers and producers of classics such as Light My Fire, My Girl, Please Mr Postman, London Calling and dozens more.</p> <p>These songs were the backbone of 60s youth culture, an era when friends still invited each other over to \u201cstare at the speakers\u201d, as Myers told me in an interview near his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. When he and his friends weren\u2019t listening to the latest hits at home, they all had transistor radios with \u201cflesh-colored ear-pieces\u201d jammed into their ears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/01/curly-putman-best-songs-dolly-parton-tammy-wynette\">Booze, murder and D-I-V-O-R-C-E: Curly Putman's finest songs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1968, Keith Richards told Myers that he realized that his generation was \u201cbursting at the seams\u201d and the one thing holding it together was that practically everyone under 30 was devoted to the music they listened to on the radio.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something religious to me about music,\u201d Myers says.</p> <p>Myers was born in 1956 in upper Manhattan and She Loves You by the Beatles was the first 45 he ever bought at Kappy\u2019s, his local record store. But he veered off into jazz at an early age. He blamed that on Billy Taylor, who came to his junior high school and gave out 45s of his infectious jazz instrumental, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brBtTluod_w\">I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free</a>.</p> <p>Myers discovered that jazz also gave him something to talk about with the adults his artist-parents invited to boisterous parties, including notable musicians like Burl Ives and Pete Seeger. </p> <p>\u201cI loved the Dave Clark Five and the Beatles,\u201d he says. \u201cBut by 1968, once the drug culture deliberately started entering the album consciousness, I just had this aversion. I just loved everything so much, that the thought of having to take something that would enhance it just didn\u2019t seem practical.\u201d After all, he was only 12. So he turned from rock to jazz.</p> <p>His new book gave him a chance to go \u201cback to finish what I had started as a kid. It\u2019s almost as if I abandoned a family of music when I went to jazz and then came back to revisit what I loved.\u201d</p> <p>Music was at the center of the lives of 70 million American baby boomers, partly because there were far fewer distractions in an era before smartphones and personal computers had been invented. \u201cYou heard it on the radio and you wanted to know more about it. So you went to the record store. You wanted to find out what your friends were listening to. There was more curiosity about it.\u201d</p> <p>Did the music shape the culture or the culture shape the music?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a two-way street,\u201d he says. \u201cThe culture changes but there are also external forces that changed the music. Over the course of five decades the music expressed the desires and anxieties of several generations. Wars, social upheaval, the civil rights movement, women\u2019s liberation, drugs, poverty, suburbia and even immigration all had an influence on pop music and the development of its many sub genres.\u201d At the same time, he said, \u201cmusic gave voice to many of these movements, providing them with confidence and hope, helping them set goals, and intensifying their drive to achieve them. Music energizes change\u201d.</p> <p>Myers\u2019 curiosity spurred him to many hours of research before every interview, so that he could always go beyond what was already known about a particular song. In most cases he only had 20 minutes on the phone with each subject. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not unlike defusing a bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, the little red digital ticker says 20 minutes and it starts ticking down. And I\u2019ve got a very short period of time to warm them up, make them trust me, and then open up before either their patience wears out or they literally have to go because they\u2019ve got obligations ... Three artists that stand out were Merle Haggard, Stevie Wonder and Joni Mitchell.\u201d </p> <p>He describes each as \u201ca wonderful storyteller with enormous passion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cStevie sang Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today on the phone to me to illustrate a point. And Joni surfaced all of her feelings during my two hours at her home in 2014. Carey [an early Mitchell song inspired by the island of Crete] was a tender, personal story, and she let me inside.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4NUZJMCJ20\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y4NUZJMCJ20?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Myers chose Dion\u2019s Runaround Sue because he thinks Dion \u201cis more significant than one realizes: he\u2019s the first of the vulnerable male swaggerers \u2013 in almost every song he\u2019s either jilted or he got double-timed, something happened to him\u201d.</p> <p>And while every 50s pop music aficionado knows that Dion and Waylon Jennings were the two singers who did not get on the plane that crashed and killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and JP \u201cThe Big Bopper\u201d Richardson, Myers found out exactly what it was that spooked Dion into staying off of that flight.</p> <p>\u201cDion\u2019s parents fought bitterly when he was a kid over the $36 rent \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you have the money? Why didn\u2019t you pay it on time?\u2019 was all he heard as a kid. And when Dion asked Buddy Holly how much a seat on the airplane was going to cost him, Holly replied: \u201c$36.\u201d The number shocked the singer from the Bronx, and he refused to pay it. \u201cIt was like the Queen of Diamonds in The Manchurian Candidate,\u201d says Myers. \u201cAnd Dion\u2019s like, \u2018Whoa!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI told him, \u2018Good thing it wasn\u2019t $35 or $37 bucks!\u201d</p> <p>What were the biggest surprises? \u201cEven the most charismatic artists like Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart and Stevie Wonder experience loneliness and anxiety, which they use to write great songs; many hit songs were accidents or last-minute additions to albums; and every great song was influenced by several other great songs recorded years ago.\u201d</p> <p>In the pre-digital age of analog recording, Myers discovered some remarkable examples of mechanical ingenuity. Two of my favorites: Kinks guitarist Dave Davies had just learned how to shave when he bought a new amp and decided to use a razor blade to slash the amp\u2019s speaker cone (\u201cWhen I plugged in the guitar, I was blown away by the raucous sound!\u201d). And when the Doors were told to shorten the seven-minute version of Light My Fire for a single that would get more radio play, their producer Paul Rothchild \u201cwrapped Scotch tape around the spindle holding the pickup reel, so the tape would turn a fraction faster. This made the pitch a little higher and brighter, and the song was more urgent\u201d.</p> <p>Myers is particularly good on the competition within bands and between them to produce the best possible songs. \u201cI guess the Beatles set sort of a Wizard of Oz level for everybody,\u201d said Myers. \u201c\u2018Wow, if we could go into Shea Stadium...\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Bob Dylan\u2019s influence on the Beatles (and vice versa) is very well known, but until I read Myers\u2019 book I never imagined Dylan\u2019s \u201ctalk-singing\u201d style had even influenced Motown classics. Legendary Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier told Myers that it did: \u201cDylan was <em>the</em> poet then ... a guy we looked up to.\u201d So when the Four Tops recorded Reach Out, Dozier told lead vocalist Levi Stubbs to \u201cshout-sing the lyrics\u2013as a shout-out to Dylan\u201d.</p> <p> That was the unlikely cross-pollination at the heart of so many of the classics which are so rightly celebrated in this splendid volume.</p>",
  "<p>For as long as David Olusoga has been writing and broadcasting on black British history (almost two decades), he has received infuriated letters from the public. Nowadays, there are tweets too, which employ the same fulminating tone.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of people who say, \u2018I\u2019m sick of hearing about slavery\u2019, or \u2018black people are always talking about slavery\u2019. My response to them is \u2018Name a British plantation. Name a slave trader. Name a British slave ship.\u2019 Normally they can\u2019t, because we don\u2019t know that much about slavery. It\u2019s not a central part of our national story.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga\u2019s new book, <em>Black and British: A Forgotten History</em>, is not about slavery as such, but it is a radical reappraisal of the parameters of history, exposing lacunae in the nation\u2019s version of its past. Domestic history cannot be separated from the vast former empire building, he argues, which was inextricably bound to the economics of global slavery. Joining up history at home and abroad makes it harder to gloss over Britain\u2019s part in the slave trade.</p> <p>It also becomes harder to ignore the legion of black Britons who have lived on the Sceptred Isle since Roman times, rarely acknowledged in mainstream textbooks, but whose presence proves that there was never a \u201cyear zero\u201d or a lost idyll of ethnic purity to which modern day nativists can hark back. \u201cBlack history is a series of missing chapters from British history,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to put those bits back in.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga, 46, who started out at the BBC in 1998 as a researcher on Radio 4, is surely a \u201ccelebrity historian\u201d in the making. He arrives in the hotel lobby for this interview fresh from Delhi, on his way to Mexico, in a sharp suit and with luggage in tow. He has an easy eloquence that is made for TV, speaking in perfectly formed, modulated sentences. His second book, <em>The World\u2019s War</em>, won a Political Book award for <a href=\"https://www.politicos.co.uk/posts/political-book-awards-winners\">\u201cWorld War One Book of the Year\u201d</a> in 2015, no mean feat for a book published in the previous, centenary year (his first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/04/kaisers-holocaust-olugosa-erichsen-review\"><em>The Kaiser\u2019s Holocaust</em></a>, looked at Germany\u2019s colonial rule in Namibia). Meanwhile, his BBC2 series,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/23/britains-forgotten-slave-owners-review\"> <em>Britain\u2019s Forgotten Slave Owners</em></a>, earned a Bafta this year. Having just finished book three, he has put the next one (about the global history of slavery) on hold in order to co-present <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/27/civilisations-mary-beard-simon-schame-david-olusoga-television\"><em>Civilisations</em></a> alongside Simon Schama and Mary Beard. It is a 10-part remake of Kenneth Clark\u2019s landmark documentary series on the history of western art and thought, due on our screens next autumn.</p> <p>There has not been much sleep in the past four months, the time it took to write <em>Black and British,</em> in between filming the tie-in TV series. It was first conceived two years ago, when former BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow approached Olusoga. He could not have known then how the national climate would change. \u201cIs the TV series and book being delivered in the same country that it was commissioned for?\u201d he wonders. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d</p> <p>It is, he agrees, a fortuitously timed post-Brexit vote book. In it, Olusoga lists the flash points in modern black British history, from the unrest in 1919 when thousands in the country\u2019s ports targeted local non-white communities, to the Cable Street riots attacking black sailors in London\u2019s docklands, to the Notting Hill riots of 1958, and beyond. On each occasion, white communities turned on their black minority counterparts. Are we heading towards another flare-up of this kind? \u201cI think we have the strength and the resourcefulness to confront parts of our history that are difficult and painful, but there\u2019s also a dark side to British history and there was a flash of it this summer. We don\u2019t know how deep or how serious it is yet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b5ff6460948ddcb7b7da9060dea4dcf1eac6a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78b5ff6460948ddcb7b7da9060dea4dcf1eac6a9/0_141_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Olusoga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Olusoga meeting school children in Cumbria during filming for <em>Black and British: A Forgotten History</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change in tone, and chill in the air towards people of colour, has certainly been felt by him. \u201cI\u2019ve received tweets that I suspect people wouldn\u2019t have sent in 2015. Is that a changed country or is that people who are unpleasant feeling emboldened to speak? We don\u2019t know at the moment. As a historian, I always think you know what a moment was 20 years later.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga was born in Lagos to a white British mother and a Nigerian father who met in Newcastle as students. His parents separated when he was two years old and his mother returned with him and his three siblings to her home<em> </em>town in the north-east, to work as a linguist. A mixed-race family was a rarity in Newcastle in the early 80s, and Olusoga felt under attack every day, at school, on the streets: \u201cPeople used to shout \u2018National Front\u2019 at us. And \u2018wogs out\u2019. It was routine, ubiquitous. There were men who would spit and shout. When we came out of school, we\u2019d go to the bus stop and if there wasn\u2019t a white person waiting, we\u2019d walk to the next one because we knew the buses wouldn\u2019t stop for black people. Sometimes we\u2019d end up walking all the way home.\u201d</p> <p>But one summer, when he was 14, the violence went off the scale. A brick was thrown into the family\u2019s home wrapped in a note telling them to go back to Africa. A police officer had to be stationed outside their door for protection, until the family was eventually rehoused. \u201cIt was the summer from hell,\u201d he says. \u201cAfterwards, I think we did that thing you do when you\u2019ve been through something together as a family \u2013 we stopped talking about it, because it was over, we\u2019d got through it.\u201d</p> <p>For this book, he opened up that conversation again and found some catharsis. It is heartening for him that his youngest siblings, born much later, can barely believe what it was like to be black and British then. \u201cAt my lowest moment, I wanted to leave the country. But it is no longer 1984. There has been too much integration. I was on a beach a few years ago, in the south of England, and I saw this guy who had bulldog tattoos, England flag tattoos \u2013 the sort of person I\u2019d be really frightened of as a child \u2013 and he was with this mixed-race child who was clearly his granddaughter. It was such an amazing sight.\u201d</p> <p>That summer didn\u2019t scar him, Olusoga reflects, because his was a strong, close family and his mother pushed them hard to succeed at school, and at life. They moved to another council estate (which appears briefly in the film <em>Get Carter</em> \u2013 \u201cI saw it many years later when I was a student, I was amazed to see Michael Caine wander past my bedroom window\u201d) and their lives returned to normality.</p> <p>He later realised how the study of world history could help him make sense of that personal experience. He had always loved \u201cgreat stories\u201d, but over the years history \u201cbegan to explain why things had happened to me and my family. It had answers. It made sense of the world and not just of my experiences but also why the north-east was the way it was, why those industries were there, why people felt the need to drive you out of your home, why some people could never accept the idea that I could be of this country, and be British.\u201d</p> <p>He went to Liverpool University and then to Leicester for a master\u2019s degree before rejecting the idea of a PhD \u2013 \u201cbecoming an academic, doing a PhD, felt to me like never leaving school\u201d. He joined the BBC instead, met his partner in the canteen (she is a producer at the Natural History Unit), and wound up in the job of his dreams.<strong> </strong>\u201cI only ever wanted to do history, and make documentaries.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Olusoga wants to do more than rehabilitate lost or forgotten individuals. \u201cI was trying to look at black British history beyond just biography,\u201d he says, arguing that historians in the past have focused on the lives of black \u201cheroes\u201d, who remain on the margins. These exhumed figures need to be incorporated into mainstream history.</p> <p>One excavation that resonates with him is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%27s_Column#/media/File:Nelson%27s_column_-_Death_of_Nelson_at_Trafalgar.JPG\">image of a black sailor</a>, on the south-facing bronze relief panel at the bottom of Nelson\u2019s column in Trafalgar Square. The panel shows Nelson mortally wounded and the sailor standing close by, musket in hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been there since the 1840s,\u201d says Olusoga. \u201cThink of all the things that have happened in Trafalgar Square since then \u2013 the mass union meetings, Keir Hardie\u2019s speech, the CND marches, the poll tax riots. He was there to witness all that history and he\u2019s there because he\u2019s a representation of a norm \u2013 black sailors in the British navy. I think about what he\u2019s witnessed, looking out at the changing world, watching Britain change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49bcf2fc83bfb27cc7dd4a0102c45eaf2320dd60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49bcf2fc83bfb27cc7dd4a0102c45eaf2320dd60/0_0_2979_4048/736.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Barber\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sketch of Francis Barber, a servant to Samuel Johnson, dating from around 1750</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is indelible proof for Olusoga \u2013 carved into a monument to heroic nationalism \u2013 that black Britons belong inside British history, not on its side-lines. There are other memorable figures, such as the third century\u2019s sub-Saharan African woman who grew up in East Sussex, and John Blanke, a trumpeter at Henry VIII\u2019s coronation. He hopes one day that TV dramas or documentaries on the court might incorporate, even incidentally, the black Tudors we know were there. As part of his TV series he places plaques in various locations to commemorate moments or figures in black British history, including a plaque at Bunce Island in Sierra Leone, which was used as a slave fortress, and in Samuel Johnson\u2019s home in honour of his Jamaican manservant, Francis Barber.</p> <p>The way that history is taught in schools and universities is telling half a story, Olusoga believes. What happened inside Britain cannot be separated from its global identity. \u201cWe were the biggest empire the world had ever seen. The idea that you can have a domestic history apart from it doesn\u2019t make sense. Take the industrial revolution: the stories about spinning jennys and water frames are all part of our heritage. But where does the cotton being spun in those machines come from? At school, we went to mills and factories and nobody at any point in my education pointed out that the cotton processed in those mills was made by enslaved black Americans. When we talk about the history of the industrial revolution, the missing people in that revolution are the 1.8 million enslaved people who made that cotton. It was our biggest export and almost all of it came from the American deep south.\u201d To fail to tell the story of these black Americans is, he thinks, \u201cto tell a lie\u201d.</p> <p>So should we talk about the historical guilt and shame of the coloniser and colonised, passed down through the generations? \u201cNo. I want to excise the words \u2018guilt\u2019 and \u2018shame\u2019 from the conversation. There is no one alive today who is a slave trader or a slave owner. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about people feeling guilt or shame. It\u2019s about acknowledgment, and it\u2019s about truth and reconciliation.

  "<p>For adults, the news can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/bad-news-media-misery\" title=\"\">be shocking</a>. But our life experience enables us to mentally file it away in the \u201cVery sad but doesn\u2019t affect me\u201d box or the \u201cNot this again!\u201d box. For children trying to make sense of the world, the news can be desperately alarming.

We are surrounded by news. There are 24/7 news channels, radio, newspapers, the internet and smartphones (the average age <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2386527/Children-mobile-age-seven-Youngsters-phone-years-earlier-decade-ago.html\" title=\"\">kids get their first phone</a> is seven and a half). The world is at their fingertips. Even if you have done a great job of activating all the parental controls (and your tech-savvy offspring hasn\u2019t simply switched them off again), chances are that bad stuff in the news will be the talk of the playground. As a parent, or grandparent, it is almost impossible to censor the stories that reach your child, or gauge how they are interpreted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/03/more-good-news-needed-yamato-tanooka-rescue-japan\">We need more good news stories, like Yamato Tanooka\u2019s rescue | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s misinformation that is the problem \u2013 be it half a story from a friend at school, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/12/john-oliver-journalism-danger-why-that-matters-accountability\" title=\"\">a sensationalised headline</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/19/three-newspapers-to-be-reported-to-ipso-over-inaccurate-eu-stories\" title=\"\">an inaccurate report</a>.

We don\u2019t shy away from reporting a story because we know children will have heard about it anyway. A note on this: be careful about your own casual conversations in front of children. A throwaway comment among adults in the car about how Donald Trump being elected as president could result in world war three, or that Brexit will bring Britain to its knees, could silently terrify those in the backseat for weeks. Far better to discuss these issues with your children and give them a chance to talk about their worries. That way you can reassure them.</p> <p>Last year we surveyed more than 2,000 children and they said that their single <a href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/uk/first-news/20151127/281934541860635\" title=\"\">biggest fear</a> was terrorism. It is desperately sad that they should be so troubled by the threat, even when the statistics show that it is highly unlikely to impact on most of our lives. We point out that kind of stuff.</p> <p>First News covers all the major headlines that we know children are hearing about. We have a <a href=\"http://live.firstnews.co.uk/\" title=\"\">daily bulletin on our new online channel</a> and two-minute explainer videos called I Don\u2019t Get It!, covering topics such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/02/answer-migration-crisis-refugees-europe\" title=\"\">migrant crisis</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/21/zika-virus-cdc-symptoms-mosquitos-united-states-pregnant-women-microcephaly\" title=\"\">Zika virus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/01/iraqi-troops-enter-mosul-first-time-since-2014\" title=\"\">Islamic State</a>.

  "<h2><strong>Citizen Khan </strong><br>8.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>A new series of the mirthless Citizen Khan lands with a thump. Mr Khan has been banished, made to sleep in his car after forgetting his own wedding anniversary. Resolving to make amends, he gets himself into a spot of bother at Edgbaston cricket ground. There are some impressive guest stars, mind you, including Test Match Special\u2019s Jonathan Agnew, former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan and the mayor of London himself, Sadiq Khan. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>Mobo Awards: Live </strong><br>8pm, ITV2</h2> <p>So, whose turn might it be to sweep the honours this year? Olly Murs? Jedward? While it\u2019s inspiring that white artists such as Anne-Marie can break the colour barrier and perform at a ceremony set up to celebrate black music, one hopes for no repeat of the 2014 Sam Smith fiasco. Rickie Haywood-Williams and Melvin Odoom introduce this evening\u2019s award ceremony, live from Glasgow, featuring performances by Tinie Tempah, Craig David and Laura Mvula, among others. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>The Level </strong><br>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Not quite the blazing, loose-end-torching finale a truly top-drawer crime thriller would deliver \u2013 mainly due to a lurching last scene that might as well feature the lead actors turning to the camera and saying: \u201cPlease give us a second series\u201d \u2013 but the saga of family secrets and dodgy deals on the Brighton sea front goes out with a sufficient bang. And there\u2019s enough action and suspense to stop us thinking for too long about whether any of the twists actually make sense. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Sisters In Country: Dolly, Linda And Emmylou </strong><br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>While Dolly Parton has long been recognised as a thoroughly country artist with an almost cartoonish image, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris were more introverted west coast folksters who weren\u2019t entirely sold on its charms. Even so, when the trio came together in the mid-70s to record an album, there was a special synergy between them. All three feature heavily in a lovely doc about an unlikely musical sisterhood. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Unreported World <br>7.30pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The image of unscrupulous fisherfolk saving themselves time and effort by tossing sticks of dynamite into the water has been a staple of hillbilly-baiting jokes for epochs, but \u2013 as this investigation demonstrates \u2013 it\u2019s no laughing matter. Blast fishing in Malaysian Borneo is wreaking possibly irreparable damage to marine habitats and, given that it is perpetrated by mobile marauders roaming remote coasts, is proving difficult to police. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>What\u2019s The Facts? <br>7.30pm, ITV2</h2> <p>It\u2019s six degrees of surreal separation in this faux-factual pilot fronted by Jason Lewis. What\u2019s The Facts (see what they did there?) is out to prove that everyone and everything is connected. A big premise, but Lewis and his investigators aim to do it in six steps. Is a line-dancing club in Suffolk linked to Little Mix? And what does Princess Diana\u2019s wedding dress have in common with Willy Wonka?

Dyson has committed to investing \u00a315m in the institute over the next five years and the degree has been developed in conjunction with the Warwick Manufacturing Group at the University of Warwick.</p> <p>The institute will open next September with an initial intake of at least 25 students. Dyson will fund the tuition fees of students and intends to offer them a full-time graduate position in the firm at the end of the four-year course. The project is designed to help Britain fill its growing shortfall of engineers, which is forecast to stand at one million engineers by 2020.</p> <p>\u201cI have complained to every secretary of state for education and every secretary of state for BIS [business, innovation and skills] for the last 20 years, saying there aren\u2019t enough engineering graduates,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cI went and complained to Jo Johnson [the universities minister], and he said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you do a university?\u2019 I had never thought of it and it was quite a bold suggestion.\u201d</p> <p>One reason Dyson said he supported Brexit was so that the UK can potentially bring in more engineers and scientists from outside the EU. He is pressing the government for an \u201cAustralian-style visa system\u201d under which engineers, scientists and university students studying these topics will receive automatic visas. Dyson will hold talks with Theresa May and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, next week.</p> <p>Dyson said the new institute will allow students to stay in the country at the end of their degree because of the prospect of a job at the company.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment we have to get visas that take about four months for anyone outside the EU, which is a painful process and probably puts some people off,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the university, that won\u2019t be an issue under the current rules, but they might change.
