  "<p>The IOC president, Thomas Bach, was present on a ribald, boozy and tremendously fun night at the Deodoro Stadium to see Australia\u2019s Chloe Esposito overcome a 45-second deficit to win gold in the women\u2019s modern pentathlon. The British representatives, Kate French and Samantha Murray, finished sixth and ninth respectively, the first time Team GB have failed to make the podium since the competition was introduced at Sydney in 2000.</p> <p>Both women had entertained faint hopes of a podium finish after three of the event\u2019s four phases and five disciplines. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, I couldn\u2019t have asked for any more after my fencing yesterday,\u201d said French. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t great but I kept moving up today, I finished 19th yesterday so I moved up a lot.\u201d</p> <p>French finished joint top in the showjumping round while Murray came fourth in the swimming and won an impressive eight consecutive contests before going out in the bonus round of the fencing. The 26-year-old from Preston won silver at London 2012 and became a pub quiz staple in the process, her medal being the final one of 65 in total won at those Games by British athletes. French started the final discipline 59 seconds after the Polish leader, Oktawia Nowacka. Murray was a further nine seconds behind as the field tackled a three kilometre run, pausing occasionally to shoot at targets with a laser pistol. Nowacka eventually finished third, behind Esposito and Eloudie Clouvel from France.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5va8e\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2664725\"            data-video-name=\"Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b573f1e4b062ce4d2246eb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/18/160821ModernPentathlon2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/18/rio-2016-olympics-modern-pentathlon-all-you-need-to-know-video-explainer\">Rio 2016 Olympics modern pentathlon: all you need to know</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Do not be fooled by the name: this sport is over a century old and was invented with the intention of glorifying manliness and militarism. While its exact history has been disputed since its conception in 1894, it is no more modern than many of that particular year\u2019s other landmark wheezes: Blackpool Tower, the Manchester Ship Canal and the Merseyside derby.</p> <p>Designed to incorporate the skills required by cavalry soldiers of the time, the modern pentathlon included all the hardships a military man behind enemy lines might expect to endure on a particularly bad day: swimming, running, riding an unfamiliar horse and taking on enemies with a pistol or sword: two ways to kill a man, as the Irish broadcaster Ciaran Murphy recently observed, with three more to get away.</p> <p>It is when the unfamiliar horse gets involved that matters stray beyond each athlete\u2019s control. In the wake of the swimming and fencing events, 18 horses were led into the showjumping arena, previously the home of rugby sevens. A well groomed and haughty selection of accomplished bay, chestnut and grey showjumpers ranging in age between eight and 16, they are assigned by ballot to competitors who have never sat on them, with often hilarious consequences. At the Mexico 1968 Olympics, the West German pentathlete Hans J\u00fcrgen Todt had to be separated from the uncooperative Ranchero, after frustration got the better of him and he began swinging haymakers at his steed.<br></p> <p>There was no such violence here and French could not have done better on Arnold Massangana. \u201cI always enjoy the riding but it\u2019s quite hit and miss whether you get on with your horse or not,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I rode really well and my horse was really good to me, so I had a really nice clear.\u201d</p> <p>Murray had to acquaint herself with Up Class Girl, whose biography suggested the eight-year-old mare might be a difficult customer. As the new partnership waited their turn to tackle the obstacles, the mount of Leydi Moya refused and unceremoniously catapulted her rider into a fence and the Cuban was subsequently carried from the arena in a neck brace and on a stretcher. Murray went round unharmed but picked up 21 faults.</p> <p>Previously, in the fencing bonus event, she had done a more than passable impression of Errol Flynn, swishing her \u00e9p\u00e9e with aplomb as she won eight consecutive duels to work her way up the leaderboard. Shrieking \u201cYes!\u201d repeatedly as she won one quick-fire round after another, she might also have been mistaken for Meg Ryan during the famous restaurant scene in When Harry Met Sally. Following the previous day\u2019s fencing ranking event, this new bonus round enabled those who had performed badly to make up ground.</p> <p>Fittingly, given the sport\u2019s origins, Rio 2016\u2019s modern pentathlon was staged on the grounds of the city\u2019s biggest army barracks, the occupants of which have been press-ganged into Olympic security duty. The sight of them at their temporary work suggests a more modern modern pentathlon might incorporate such disciplines as giving directions to lost journalists, posing for photos with foreign sports fans, looking slightly menacing while holding a machine gun and standing around being very bored.</p> <p>While parachute jumping and grenade throwing have long since been eliminated from the sport in favour of more ground-based, less lethal and spectator friendly activities, there have been some more recent innovations.</p> <p>Before 2009 shooting and running were separate events, until the two disciplines were merged to make the former more testing for athletes. It is in this event that the modern pentathlon is won or lost, with the disciplines that precede it dictating in what order the athletes take to the run-and-shoot course and with how much time to make up on the leader.</p> <p>Helping to make an occasionally complicated sport easier to follow, it could scarcely be more simple: everyone sets off at intervals but first past the finishing post wins gold.</p>",

Here\u2019s part of his report:</p> <p><strong>To gain clarity following yet another Trump campaign shakeup,</strong> I read Breitbart exclusively for two days, eschewing all other news sources. (The Guardian included. Apart from its soccer coverage.)</p> <p>It offered an insight into not just the popularity of Breitbart \u2013 the site boasted <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/08/07/blow-breitbart-news-sets-traffic-records-july-192-million-pageviews-31-million-uniques-89-million-visits/\">31 million unique visitors</a> in July \u2013 but also how it appeals to its readers. And it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.</p> <p>The first thing you notice when visiting Breitbart is its idiosyncratic presentation. Every headline is in capitals. It implies a sense of significance and dire urgency.</p> <p>It screams at you. \u201cTHIS IS IMPORTANT,\u201d is the effect. \u201cTHIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.\u201d \u201cTHIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO HELL IN A HANDCART.\u201d</p> <p>The last of those points is an example of how well Breitbart knows its audience.</p> <p>This doomsday approach makes it seem like Breitbart readers want to feel that everything is rotten. They want to feel irate. They want to feel that disaster is impending \u2013 unless their guys can fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are actually some jobs that foreigners will do that Americans won&#39;t. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamgabbatt\">@adamgabbatt</a> demonstrates for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianUS\">@GuardianUS</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN\">https://t.co/RMzSHy2LtN</a></p>&mdash; Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/766701818172743680\">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johntabin/status/766700215445454848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs\">@Bencjacobs</a> is &quot;soccer&quot; Guardian house style now?

Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin\u2019s talking points, the roster of advisers like Carter Page and Mike Flynn with deep ties to Russia, the recent Russian government hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party records, and reports that Breitbart published articles advocating pro-Kremlin positions on Ukraine.

Only one has agreed to resettlement in Cambodia. There are no other resettlement options even though Dutton seemed to suggest on ABC\u2019s 7.30 report this week that the refugees on Nauru had refused to go to New Zealand, Canada, the United States or Malaysia. </p> <p>After three years in detention, with no idea where, or when they might be able to rebuild their lives, Nauru is also a growing human rights disaster.</p> <p>Dutton has variously accused Guardian Australia of \u201chyping\u2019 and \u201ctrivialising\u201d the plight of those on Nauru with the publication of the Nauru Files.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble, frankly with the approach of the Guardian and the ABC has been to trivialise the very serious issues by trying to promote the 2,100 reports as somehow, all of those being serious when they\u2019re not. Many of those reports relate to corporal punishment by children by their own parents. They report about some minor assaults by detainees on detainees, refugees on refugees,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2016/s4521864.htm\">he said on ABC radio on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>But that is exactly what we reported. As we explained when we published the document cache, it contained incident reports \u2013 short summaries of events in the Nauru detention centre ranging from serious allegations of sexual assault, to observations of a threat of self-harm, to abuse of a child, or more mundane incidents such as a child falling over when playing soccer. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">In our data log</a> we record each incident under its official risk rating \u2013 minor, major or critical, and type, from sexual assault, suicide attempts and self-harm to property damage and lost items.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-the-lives-of-asylum-seekers-in-detention-detailed-in-a-unique-database-interactive\">The Nauru files: the lives of asylum seekers in detention detailed in a unique database \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dutton says he is investigating the allegations in the leak (bizarrely he also attacked Save the Children for not providing him with the unredacted documents, which Nauru service providers have confirmed his department already has) and insists the allegations of assault and sexual abuse will be taken seriously, while dismissing the trivial nature of other incidents.</p> <p>But that misses the point. All but a few carefully selected journalists are prohibited from visiting Nauru. One reason for publishing the Nauru Files was to provide a picture of the reality of life there through the everyday bureaucracy of the reports, the serious allegations and the minor daily indignities and humiliations. This isn\u2019t just about sexual abuse. It\u2019s about the sanity-sapping uncertainty, and tedium and tension of life under indefinite detention, which quickly amounts to systemic abuse. And Peter Dutton is in charge of the system.</p> <p>We\u2019ll continue to do what we can to document the consequences for the human beings whose lives are on hold because Australia\u2019s toxic political debate has turned a difficult policy problem into a stand-off without any obvious end point.</p> <p>Dutton says we in the media sit in the \u201ccheap seats\u201d with no responsibility for finding a solution. But our job is to hold power to account and that is what we are doing. We can report and discuss possible answers.

Posed so starkly, the price tag smacked of venality. So why am I still smiling? Because, more even than the London Games, these Olympics have cemented Britain\u2019s position as a first-rank sporting nation. Sporting excellence requires subsidy and patronage. How could it be otherwise? We can rail against this simple reality in ascetic fury, or join in the revelry.</p> <p>Since Orwell described international sport as \u201cmimic warfare\u201d and \u201cwar minus the shooting\u201d, it has been commonplace to dismiss the Olympics as a petri dish of nationalism.

I\u2019ve not actually been watching Rio 2016 so much as absorbing it through WhatsApp chat and live blog feeds. No medals for endurance on my part.

I remember this sick-making, skin-pricking fury, sitting next to an American journalist who was cheering after Victoria Pendleton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/victoria-pendleton-loses-anna-meares\">had to cede gold to that Australian bruiser</a> who squeezed her out of her lane.</p> <p>I have lost my patriotic fervour, and now mainly see the British cyclists as superb through some combination of talent born not made, incredibly hard work, a sublime intelligence at both the level of the muscle and the mind; and not because they are British and understand at some cellular, interconnected level why bulldogs are cute and the NHS is great and bikes matter.</p> <p>In the absence of obnoxious national pride, I now mainly enjoy the sports in which the difference between being the best in the world and being completely rubbish are naked to the untrained eye. There you are, watching judo. One minute they\u2019re just poking each other. The next, one has a hundred points and the other is crying. Rhythmic gymnastics is particularly piquant for this. Sometimes you can\u2019t tell for hours whether the tears are joy or loss. I love the things that don\u2019t look that hard - archery, the 50km walk \u2013 and things that look superhuman.</p>",
  "<p>One year ago, on 20 August 2015, Theresa May, on behalf of the UK government, and Bernard Cazeneuve, for the French government, signed a joint declaration promising protection of the most vulnerable in the camp in Calais and a joint safeguarding programme. This programme completely failed. By March, 129 children were unaccounted for in a monthly census. No alternative accommodation had been provided; no needs assessments made; no systems put in place to monitor or provide safeguarding; and no official registration system set up for the children, who now number 865, of whom 675 are without any family.</p> <p>There are 178 children with the right to be reunited with families in the UK under the three-year-old EU Dublin III Regulation to which the UK is a signatory. Our government has transferred fewer than 50. The Immigration Act passed in May provides that the secretary of state must, as soon as possible, make arrangements to relocate to the UK and support a specified number of unaccompanied refugee children from other countries in Europe. Not one has yet been relocated from Calais.

  "<p>The dramatic slide in sterling since the Brexit vote has given British holidaymakers enough pain already. But there was a further shock in store this week after some airports offered less than \u20ac1 to \u00a31 at two major airports.</p> <p>At Stansted and Luton, travellers found they could not even exchange \u00a31 for \u20ac1, which at least prepared them for the financial squeeze at their destinations. Those holidaying in Europe are finding that meals, coffees, drinks and other items are typically at least 22% more expensive than a year ago. </p> <p>There has, however, been a benefit for the British economy. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/uk-retail-sales-rise-july-shoppers-shrug-off-brexit-gloom\">official data showed</a> that retail sales leapt 1.4% in July following a drop in June \u2013 apparently helped by an influx of big-spending overseas tourists from the likes of the US, China and Hong Kong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-19T15:57:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"\u00a3 v \u20ac graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-19T15:57:01/embed.html\">\u00a3 v \u20ac graph</a> </figure>  <p>Here are some of the consequences of the pound\u2019s slump against the euro.</p> <h2>Foreign visitors to the UK</h2> <p>It\u2019s not just London experiencing a surge in visitors exploiting the cheap pound, according to Ryanair. It said there had been a surge in \u201cclose-in bookings\u201d \u2013 those made six weeks before flying \u2013 from southern European travellers heading to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Scotland, as well as the capital.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor so long it has been, \u2018I love going to London but it\u2019s so expensive.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so much cheaper, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in short-term bookings to London and regional UK,\u201d said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer.<br></p> <p>However, Ryanair\u2019s biggest increase in business has come from Americans and Chinese flying to Europe and then using its network to come to Britain and shop. \u201cWe are carrying 20% more Americans this summer, and have seen a 10% increase in the number of Chinese coming into places such as Rome and Berlin, then using Ryanair to get around Europe. It is absolutely linked to the weakness of sterling.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"496ed06d557edf1928f4b6bc9455228b827927b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/496ed06d557edf1928f4b6bc9455228b827927b4/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists are flocking to the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to this week\u2019s official retail sales data, purchases of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year, a rise largely attributed to foreign buyers. For European and Chinese visitors, prices in British stores are now roughly 18% and 13% below mid-August 2015. For Americans it is around 16%, while for Australians everything is now a fifth cheaper.</p> <p>Meanwhile, CAISSA Touristic, one of China\u2019s leading tour operators, said that over the past two months it had seen a 20% increase in inquiries and bookings involving travel to the UK.<br></p> <h2>British tourists abroad</h2> <p>The weak pound has added hundreds of pounds to the cost of many people\u2019s summer holidays. According to M&amp;S Bank, the typical cost of a one-week overseas summer holiday for a family of four, including flights, accommodation, meals and spending money, had risen by \u00a3429 compared to last year due to the fall in sterling.</p> <p>In Sorrento in southern Italy, the typical cost of a three-course evening meal for a British family of four, including a bottle of wine and soft drinks, has effectively risen by 22% in a year, with the bill around \u00a386 this year compared with just under \u00a371 a year ago, based on recent exchange rates. Corfu in Greece has recorded a similar percentage rise \u2013 from around \u00a342 to \u00a352.<br></p> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3639a6b9413cb376e626d0c2db255928bac57f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3639a6b9413cb376e626d0c2db255928bac57f56/0_132_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playa De Levante beach in Benidorm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playa De Levante beach in Benidorm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the typical cost of a glass of wine in a Sorrento bar has effectively leapt 53% in a year, from \u00a31.41 (\u20ac2) in August 2015 to \u00a32.16 (\u20ac2.50). These figures were provided by Post Office Travel Money, which publishes an annual family holiday report. It said bars and restaurants in several of the resorts surveyed had cut their prices to attract tourists.</p> <h2>The staycation</h2> <p>Are the British swapping the Balearic Islands for the Isle of Wight? According to tourist authorities on the Isle of Wight, there has been a \u201cvery significant leap\u201d in its website traffic, while Visit East Anglia said its enquiries had risen by a quarter. </p> <p>But talk of a staycation boom may be premature. Ryanair said that it carried a record number of British holidaymakers to Europe in July, the first full month after the referendum.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou are still getting a pint of lager for \u00a31 in parts of Spain and Portugal, while you\u2019ll struggle to find it anywhere under \u00a32.50 in Britain,\u201d said Jacobs at Ryanair. \u201cWhen people like Nigel Farage say that Brexit will encourage Brits to holiday at home, he\u2019s talking absolute nonsense. Since Brexit we\u2019ve not seen any drop-off in business. If money is tight next year, people won\u2019t stop going on holiday abroad \u2013 they will more likely drop down from a four-star hotel to a three-star.\u201d<br></p> <p>This may already be happening: the website TravelSupermarket said it was seeing a lot of interest in last-minute summer sun package holidays, particularly in the \u00a3300-\u00a3400 per person per week bracket. \u201cWe\u2019re currently seeing all-inclusive four-star holidays to Turkey in early September for as little as \u00a3230 per person,\u201d it added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ccfb0218c969f9ddf6bbf84caf0a33ceb020935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccfb0218c969f9ddf6bbf84caf0a33ceb020935/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forex screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound has fallen against the dollar and euro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bureaux de change </h2> <p>Researchers from currency specialist Caxton FX found that the Moneycorp exchange booth at Stansted airport was at one point offering just \u20ac0.9915 for each \u00a31 exchanged. The rate on offer at the ICE (International Currency Exchange) bureaux de change at Luton airport was even lower at \u20ac0.9900.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://sainsburysbankmedia.co.uk/holidaymakers-could-be-missing-out-on-best-currency-rates/\">One recent survey</a> suggested that holidaymakers travelling to Europe can expect to be around 7% better-off if they sort out their euros in advance rather than buying them at the airport. But checks carried out by the Guardian suggest the figure could be double that in some cases.</p> <h2>Northern Ireland</h2> <p>Northern Ireland, which voted to stay in the EU, has at least benefited from the post-Brexit plunge in the pound. At the Quays shopping centre in Newry, just four miles from the border with the Republic, the fall in the pound is a huge relief following several tough years after the Irish economy tanked. This week, a sizeable proportion of the vehicles in its car park belonged to bargain-hunting shoppers up from the south.<br></p> <p>Cathal Austin, the manager at Quays, said: \u201cWe have seen an increase since the pound has fallen, and we are expecting a much bigger increase for Halloween and Christmas.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Just a week after a scathing <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/e1606.pdf\">report</a> decrying the condition of private prisons in the US, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">phase out</a> their federal use by not renewing contracts for companies like GEO Group, Management of Training Corporation, and Correctional Corporations of America (CCA). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/private-prisons-closure-limited-impact-justice-department\">Federal decision to phase out private prisons has limited impact, activists say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As many advocates have pointed out, ending contracts for private prisons won\u2019t actually change much about the carceral landscape. The Federal Bureau of Prisons consists of less than 200,000 prisoners, and private prisons contain <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/e1606.pdf\">about</a> 22,660 of those inmates. But it is a big deal in term of policy setting. By admitting that there are problems inherent in profiting off of the welfare of people most of America doesn\u2019t seem to want to deal with, the DoJ is refusing a long-held narrative that the lives of these people don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Private companies cutting corners to profit from the poor isn\u2019t a new idea. Prisons here have a long history of privatization \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2014/12/unlocking-history-explore-san-quentin-the-states-oldest-prison/\">San Quentin</a>, now a state-run prison in California, was originally a for-profit prison in the 1850s. Not only did the inmates build the prison during the day and slept on a boat at night, one of the first lessees of the prison, a man named John F McCauley, decided to turn a profit by refusing to clothe and feed the inmates while administering extraordinarily hard punishments. </p> <p>Conditions were so dire that in the late 1850s, the state of California took over San Quentin by force and began running it. (It should be noted that McCauley sued and won compensation for his financial loss in the venture. Capitalism is a hard master to vanquish.)<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/08/super-bowl-sunday-san-quentin-prison-photos\">Watching the Super Bowl in San Quentin prison: 'It sort of hurts a little bit'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The operation of prisons and jails thus mostly became the domain of the government, until the prison population boom in the 1980s and 1990s, when the Federal Bureau of Prisons began outsourcing to companies that are both exchanged on the open market and hold a requirement to be profitable to shareholders. And they were immensely profitable. GEO and CCA had a combined annual <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.3dc8413c7846\">revenue</a> of $3.3bn as of last year and spent nearly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.3dc8413c7846\">$25m</a> on lobbying for laws in their favor. Most states and counties use some form of privatization to house, feed, care for, and monitor people. </p> <p>Their money hasn\u2019t hidden all their problems. The DoJ report cited problems like \u201cproperty damage, bodily injury and the death of a Correctional Officer\u201d, along with at least four riots, sexual assaults and deplorable medical care. The biggest riots \u2013 such as the one last year at <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/south-texas-prison-riot-willacy-county-economic-future/\">Willacy detention center</a> where inmates essentially took over the prison due to escalating concerns over conditions \u2013 have been in private prisons. And while prison guard unions in states like California wield great bargaining and lobbying power, guards for private prisons are hired with about as much aplomb and training (and pay) as a cashier at McDonald\u2019s. Guards matter because without adequate training and attractive pay and benefits, guards and inmates are in genuine danger.</p> <p>The focus on the bottom line has further ramifications. Some departments boast that they provide no basic services for inmates, not even air conditioning when it\u2019s over 100 degrees. <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3027877/Justice-Department-memo-announcing-announcing.pdf\">Sally Yates</a>, the deputy attorney general, declared that private prisons \u201csimply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources\u201d.</p> <p>The new policy may not change a lot of these problems in the country\u2019s multitude of prison systems. It doesn\u2019t affect halfway houses and transitional services nor the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities leased to private companies by the Department of Homeland Security, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/08/18/justice-department-done-with-private-prisons-will-ice-drop-them-too/\">which serve as immigrant detention centers for about 25,000 men, women and children</a>. (In fact, ICE just renewed its contract with CCA for a prison to house women and children.) CCA has responded to the policy announcement by saying the federal government is <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-says-it-will-stop-using-private-prisons-1471538386\">only 7%</a> of its businesses, although its stock prices plummeted <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/08/18/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-private-prison-phase-out#.YhRjYVLJS\">about</a> 40% after the announcement.</p> <p>But it\u2019s encouraging to see the government move toward admitting that privileging profits over people shortchanges one of society\u2019s most vulnerable demographics. In a system where each item must be litigated \u2013 how many packets of ramen, how many family photos, how many books, how many band aids \u2013 private prisons make money off of the worst of all human instincts: to benefit from the misfortune of other people without even knowing who those people are. </p> <p>To refuse to allow the wealthy to profit begins to pave the way for states and counties to do the same thing and end practices that are draining resources from already impoverished communities.</p>",

Even the apology he posted today is so extravagantly preposterous it can only have been written as a dare. \u201cIt is traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country,\u201d quoth Lochte of his trauma, \u201cwith a language barrier, and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave.\u201d Which is one way of describing the security guard telling them to pay for their vandalism.</p> <p>My only surprise is that Ryan didn\u2019t offer some kind of comic chaser to these antics \u2013 maybe claiming, Joker-style, to have been the one to turn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/why-has-the-olympic-pool-turned-green-the-good-news-is-its-not-urine\">diving pool green</a> in a daring midnight prank.

Sometimes you make decisions you later regret. They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on.\u201d (Apparently unsatiated by the exposure of Lochte\u2019s lie, one high-profile US commentator is calling for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/766302794773106688\">Andrada to resign</a>, which feels like a rather poor show.)</p> <p>I hardly presume to say that the antics of Lochte and his more junior swim team buddies is what white privilege looks like, being similarly blessed myself, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any possible other explanation.

To watch the outraged commentators attempting to lay a glove on him is to imagine them doggy-paddling in the wake of his best freestyle time.</p> <p>Before the Games began, Ryan Lochte\u2019s post-Olympics plans consisted of moving to Los Angeles to become a celebrity. \u201cI see me being a designer,\u201d he mused. \u201cI see me being a model, I see me being a TV star.\u201d</p> <p>However much some may wish it to be different, I see none of these things being very much affected by his actions in Rio. After all, the self-styled civilised first world is the place where almost innumerable professional idiots have whole lucrative TV shows devoted to the comings and goings of their lives. It\u2019s what sets us apart from the animals, as I understand it.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t the point about people like Lochte that they get away with it? No matter how satisfying this story may superficially feel to all those who have loathed Lochte\u2019s frat bro persona since for ever, and who feel that this is somehow a comeuppance or him being found out in some cathartic way \u2013 it isn\u2019t.

  "<p>If anyone needed a drink this week, it was Trump supporters. It was the tail end of a bad stretch in the press \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich\">Ukraine</a>!<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\"> Extreme Vetting!</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/roger-ailes-coaching-donald-trump-debate-denial\">Roger Ailes</a>! \u2013 but in many ways it wasn\u2019t anomalously bad; Donald Trump has been on a water slide since the convention. On Wednesday, after news of yet another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-stephen-bannon-breitbart-news-kellyanne-conway\">campaign shakeup</a>, I wondered if his supporters had started to see the beginning of the end. So I headed to Trump Bar, a rare refuge of Trumpism in liberal Manhattan, to find out if they were drowning their sorrows.<br></p> <p>Though the midtown sky was robin\u2019s egg blue, inside the dark bar on the ground floor of Trump Tower, near Central Park, a pair of polo-shirted tourists on barstools were watching dark clouds gather on the television screen tuned to the weather station. \u201cA storm\u2019s coming,\u201d one said to the other, sipping a whisky soda. The other man grunted. Happy hour at the Trump Bar, I discovered, was neither happy nor an hour. The daily promotion stretched from 4-7pm; the clientele was anxious.</p> <p>Andy, a young man who wore his black baseball cap backwards, polo shirt white and cargo shorts baggy, was staring into his phone. Andy was from Minnesota. This was his first time in New York. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the 9/11 [memorial] and then I came here.\u201d Beside him sat a half-empty bottle of Brooklyn Sorachi Ace, two camouflage Make America Great Again hats he had purchased from the Trump store, and a pile of Trump-Pence bumper stickers. \u201cYeah, I support Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e52fed0c8bbc8f7756619286ae14b60f2abef3/0_47_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey Heil and Marie Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey Heil and Marie Smith.

We\u2019re not here to talk. Tell him \u2018no comment\u2019.\u201d \u201cNo comment,\u201d said Andy. Trump supporters appeared to follow the same media strategy as their candidate: don\u2019t answer questions you don\u2019t like \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-calls-reporter-ewan-macaskill-a-nasty-nasty-guy-video\">shut them out</a> instead.</p> <p>During happy hour, wine is $6 a glass, draught beer is $5 and cocktails are $7. But none of the signature or classic cocktails (The Billionaire Martini, $20; the Boardroom, $17; and the \u201cYou\u2019re Fired\u201d, $15) are included.</p> <p>June Smith, 70, was content with her wine. Smith was visiting New York from State College, Pennsylvania \u2013 part of what she calls the \u201cRed T\u201d of the Keystone State. She was optimistic that Trump would defeat Clinton in the election, despite his week of bad press. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she told me. \u201cUsually Pennsylvania is blue but this election it\u2019s purple!\u201d (I refrained from informing her most polls find Clinton with a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_clinton-5633.html\">4- to 11-point lead over </a>Trump there.) I asked what she liked about Trump. \u201cHe gets it,\u201d she explained. But her gruff son-in-law, who told me his name was \u201cForget About Me\u201d, quickly interrupted. \u201cNo more talking,\u201d he said. Smith smiled apologetically and reached for the sandwich. I grabbed my beer and wandered off.</p> <p>I soon came across a a quartet of ladies from Savannah, Georgia, who had settled into four chairs opposite Andy and his friend. One, Honey Heil, 74, was a vivacious and vociferous Trump supporter. Andy gave her a campaign bumper sticker, which she proudly attached to her shirt. \u201cLook, Donald! We\u2019re here!\u201d she crowed enthusiastically.<br></p> <p>Heil, a retired school nurse, was undeterred by Trump\u2019s so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4447985/inside-donald-trump-meltdown/\">meltdown</a>\u201d. She excitedly laid out a strategy to bring women \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190403/seven-women-unfavorable-opinion-trump.aspx\">a demographic that has proven difficult</a> for him to win over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe girls are for Clinton! Put out the navy blue dress!\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll go ding-dong!\u201d Her friend, Marie Smith, was equally enthusiastic about the Trump-Pence ticket. \u201cWhat about Pence?\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he just look like a VP?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as Donald is president he\u2019ll be surrounded by the best and the brightest</p> <footer> <cite>Honey Heil</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their companion, a woman who wore all denim and asked not to be named, was voting for Trump for national security. \u201cGod wants us to be safe,\u201d she told me. \u201cDonald is the one who knows how to keep us safe.\u201d </p> <p>Smith said she was voting for Trump for economic reasons. \u201cI see Clinton\u2019s side of things but it\u2019s in my interest to vote Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should my husband, who owns a small business, have to pay for other people who don\u2019t even have jobs?\u201d But she thought some of Trump\u2019s more outrageous proposals were more smoke than fire.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever get a wall,\u201d she said. Heil, however, was more full-throated in her support. \u201cI want a wall that goes 6 feet down and 10 feet up! It\u2019ll get done!\u201d Asked how Trump could possibly execute such an ambitious project, she just shrugged: \u201cAs soon as Donald is president he\u2019ll be surrounded by the best and the brightest.\u201d</p> <p>Three hours into my visit, most of the bar had pretty much emptied and happy hour had ended \u2013 but the ladies from Savannah didn\u2019t seem to mind. There was nowhere else for them to go, anyway. Outside, Donald Trump was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/both-parties-expect-trump-loss_us_57b33954e4b0c75f49d86312\">looking</a> more and more like a loser.

Even some major supermarket chains, like Sainsbury\u2019s, which would have welcomed a ban on 2-for-1 junk food deals, have complained that Britain now needs compulsory targets for the reduction of sugar across the food and drinks industry. Its chief executive, Mike Coupe, says: \u201cNothing less will work.\u201d</p> <p>So why, confronted by her first big choice, has May gone with the lobbyists for big business, rather than the public health lobby? Is it because she privately agrees with the man she fired so robustly, Michael Gove, that Britain \u201chas had enough of experts\u201d?</p> <p>I\u2019m sure she would say certainly not, that it\u2019s all about jobs and the need for continued economic growth after Brexit. And certainly government ministers and officials were bombarded by industry predictions that interference with its God-given right to flog junk food to the lower orders would result in huge job losses and closures.

First, they say it\u2019s bad for business. In fact, obviously any action by government is by definition \u201cbad for business\u201d. Two, it is claimed that obesity isn\u2019t really caused by sugar or junk food, but something (anything) else \u2013 lack of investment in sport, too much television, you name it.

  "<p>This summer we are swapping the Mediterranean for Burgundy. The food and wine will be delicious where we are staying, but part of me longs for the sun-baked olive oil and vinegar-steeped flavours of southern Europe. There the fruit is full, heavy and sweet, the roads are lined with lavender and olive groves and the influences of Africa and the Middle East have long permeated the cuisine.</p> <p>The sweet-sour \u201cagrodolce\u201d flavours of Arabia are particularly felt in Sicily and Greece, where capers, olives and aubergines are in abundance and fig trees sag with the weight of ripe fruit dripping with sticky juices.</p> <p>This week I am cooking in homage to all these ingredients: the first recipe is a mouth-watering and deeply satisfying classic, and the second an invention inspired by idyllic holidays in Greece, with tahini, honey and those wonderful figs.

Serves four.</p> <p><strong>4 aubergines </strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>5 large vine tomatoes</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the final bake</strong><br><strong>1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br><strong>Large handful each of parsley and marjoram or thyme leaves, chopped</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp capers in brine, plus a little of the brine from the jar</strong><br><strong>Handful of kalamata or other juicy black olives, stoned and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp red-wine vinegar</strong><br><strong>\u00bd-1 tsp brown sugar, depending on sweetness of tomatoes</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp breadcrumbs, optional</strong><br><strong>3-4 tbsp finely grated parmesan </strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Slice the two largest aubergines in half lengthways and score them in a 0.5cm-deep criss-cross pattern, salt and leave to drain upside down over a wire rack for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, top and tail the other two aubergines, cut into 2-3cm rough cubes, salt and drain in a colander for 20 minutes. While they are draining, cover the tomatoes with boiling water, leave for 30 seconds, drain and peel. Roughly chop the flesh.</p> <p>Rinse and pat the aubergine dry. Scoop out the flesh of the four halves and place the boat-like skins on a baking tray. Drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 20-25 minutes until soft.</p> <p>Heat a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan over a high heat and add all the remaining aubergine flesh with the rest of the oil and some salt. Cook on a high heat for five to 10 minutes until turning golden, stirring every minute or so. Add the red onion, garlic and herbs and cook for a further five minutes, adding a splash more oil if needed. Add the capers and olives, followed by the tomatoes and vinegar. Season with salt, pepper and the sugar, and simmer for about 15 minutes, until thick and tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p> <p>Spoon a generous helping of caponata into the aubergine boats, sprinkle with the breadcrumbs and parmesan and drizzle with a little extra olive oil. Put back in the oven and roast until the breadcrumbs are golden and crunchy and the parmesan has melted.</p> <p>Serve with rice and a sprinkling of fresh parsley.</p> <h2><strong>Figs with tahini frozen yoghurt and sesame seeds</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d89851e8de1f6d677e5b9ef167c0ae223e6c1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d89851e8de1f6d677e5b9ef167c0ae223e6c1f3/0_92_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 figs with tahini frozen yoghurt and sesame seeds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 figs with tahini frozen yoghurt and sesame seeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Serves six.</p> <p><strong>500g full-fat greek yoghurt</strong><br><strong>2-3 tbsp clear honey</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp tahini</strong><br><strong>Juice of \u00bd lemon</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp fine sea salt</strong><br><strong>6-10 figs</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp maple syrup</strong><br>To serve<br><strong>2-3 tbsp runny honey</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</strong><br><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil, optional</strong></p> <p>Whisk together the yoghurt, honey, tahini, lemon juice and salt and taste. The yoghurt will taste less sweet when frozen, so you may want a little more honey if you have a sweet tooth. Pour into an ice-cream machine and churn for 45 minutes until softly frozen. When it is ready, transfer to a freezer-proof container and freeze for at least four hours. If you don\u2019t have an ice-cream machine, transfer to a freezer-proof container and freeze for an hour, then whisk it every hour for a further three hours then leave to freeze. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/12/courgette-recipes-frittata-couscous-salad-herbs-thomasina-miers\">The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 courgette recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heat the grill to its highest setting.

Drizzle with extra honey and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and, if you like, a tiny scrunch of extra sea salt and a drop or two of your finest olive oil. </p> <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong><br></h2> <p>You may not be able to cram all the aubergine filling into the boats. If not, keep it in the fridge and use to stuff tomatoes or courgettes at another sitting \u2013 it would be delicious with currants and pine nuts scattered through. The yoghurt is also delicious with roast grapes or grilled peaches and so low in sugar that it makes a fairly virtuous and refreshing addition to breakfast spooned on to hot porridge.</p>",
  "<p>Leo Tolstoy\u2019s novel Anna Karenina features passionate love, abject misery and a hundred emotions in between. The epic romantic saga does not, traditionally, involve any inline skating, but that will change when a new musical version hits the Moscow stage this autumn.<br></p> <p>Anna Karenina the musical will open at the Moscow Operetta theatre in October, with specially written music and a new libretto. The producers say that although the whole of Tolstoy\u2019s sprawling novel cannot fit into a two-hour show, they remain faithful to the text throughout. The cast will wear costumes that are \u201cof the period, but with elements of haute couture\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1c4e923038cebb15960cbfcc63541485950e70e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c4e923038cebb15960cbfcc63541485950e70e/0_93_2811_1686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greta Garbo in the 1935 film version of Anna Karenina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Garbo in the 1935 film version of Anna Karenina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all the musical takes place on inline skates, which are used in place of ice skates for winter scenes. At a rehearsal this week, the cast went through a scene set at a Moscow ice rink, in which wealthy landowner Levin proposes to Kitty. She turns him down as couples around them perform acrobatic skating routines. </p> <p>Tolstoy\u2019s novel has been adapted for screen and stage on numerous occasions. There have also been operatic and musical renditions, though none have become well known. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/anna-karenina-review-keira-knightley\">In a 2012 film version</a>, with a screenplay by Tom Stoppard and starring Keira Knightley in the title role, the whole action takes place inside a theatre.</p> <p>\u201cThe novel has everything. It\u2019s maybe the most detailed exploration of relations between men and women,\u201d said Vladimir Tartakovsky, the director of the Operetta theatre and one of the musical\u2019s producers.</p> <p>Tartakovsky said the character of Anna\u2019s husband, Karenin \u2013 who has been portrayed as an unsympathetic villain in some film versions \u2013 is closer to the original in their musical; he can be sympathised with as a victim of his social situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7dfcde97e6c6a028d1e0781abdf6ebc4bbbfc851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dfcde97e6c6a028d1e0781abdf6ebc4bbbfc851/0_0_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley in the 2012 film version of Anna Karenina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keira Knightley in the 2012 film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FOCUS FEATURES/PLANET PHOTOS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNone of the characters are simplistic \u2013 they make the viewer think, and people can empathise with parts of all the characters,\u201d said Alexei Bolonin, one of the co-producers of the musical.</p> <p>Bolonin and Tartakovsky have staged several musicals at the Operetta theatre, including Count Orlov, a semi-factual tale about one of Catherine the Great\u2019s nobles, which ran for four years and sold nearly 1m tickets.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/crime-and-punishment-musical-moscow-stage\">a musical version</a> of Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment also appeared on the Moscow stage. Attempts to launch western musicals, such as Chicago, have been less successful in Moscow.</p> <p>Until recently, there was little to fill the gap between pop music and high culture: there are four opera houses in Moscow but only three theatres that put on musicals. Bolonin said the popularity of musicals as a genre was growing in Russia. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/02/anna-karenina-tolstoy-five-writers\">Why Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina transcends the ages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen we started in 1999, we were the only people doing it and people would come from the street to auditions with no practice at all,\u201d he said. More than 1,000 people auditioned for Anna Karenina and most of them had some musical theatre experience.</p> <p>Rehearsals will continue until October, when the musical opens. The producers hope that, like their previous shows, this one will sell out for months, if not years.</p> <p>As for the best-known scene in the novel, in which Tolstoy\u2019s heroine ends her life by throwing herself under a train, the producers declined to elaborate on exactly how the tragedy would unfold on stage. </p> <p>\u201cIt will end in the same way as the novel. There will be a train. And it will be very emotional and very theatrical,\u201d said Tartakovsky.</p>",

He espouses views that are both potentially dangerous and demonstrably false. For example, as we reported in this story, Roberts continues to argue that Nasa has manipulated temperature data in collaboration with every other relevant science agency including the UK Met Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. <br></p> <p>Normally, these views would simply not be reported. But as an elected parliamentarian, it is important that he is scrutinised and understood by the public. The ABC put him on the panel, but had Brian Cox on as well, who was well-equipped to refute some of what Roberts said. <br></p> <p>In the future, as Roberts continues to make demonstrably false claims, the Guardian and other media outlets will need to think carefully about how much attention to give him. The outrageousness of what he says makes for entertaining and very highly read stories. But is it a mistake to give him more air time than sensible (and potentially boring) politicians, just because he says such outrageous things?</p> <p><em>What do you think of Cox\u2019s interjection?</em><br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T13:47:27.935Z\">at 2.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b7080de4b0c23bfed8b033\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T13:23:28.231Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More comments on the night tube and its implications.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81476735\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12972318\" title=\"View John O'Donnell\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12972318\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for John O'Donnell\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12972318\" title=\"View John O'Donnell\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">John O'Donnell</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/81476735\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">19 August 2016 2:17pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Shift workers will be pleased, no more sitting with nutters on the night bus.</p> <p>I got on a night bus at 4:00am once, early work start.

Everyone BTL was praising this whole series, and sad that this (excellent) one was the last. More of this kind of thing, please, Graun!</p> <p>And the picture essay, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2016/aug/15/growing-together-an-allotment-picture-essay\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>That's Yer Lot</b></a>, was wonderful too. </p> <p>It was much discussed at our allotments, where we were very impressed by their plots. Just a pity this wasn't a Guardian Witness thing, or even with a comment thread - the other times there have been articles on allotment sites, the comments have added hugely to the whole thing. </p> <p>And allotments brings me to sheds. I know this thread is about the news that has been already this week, but <a href=\"http://www.readersheds.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>the Shed of the Year </b></a>is on the allotment-friendly budget category on C4 tonight (8pm) and I think the winner is announced this evening as well.

  "<p>I lived in Syria until 2012, when I was 25. There was a lot of bombing in Damascus \u2013 most of the time it was hard for us to get to work as we couldn\u2019t get out of our houses. The company I was working for in aviation services opened a branch in Cairo, so I moved. Being gay was a factor in wanting to leave. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/flatmates-of-gay-syrian-refugee-beheaded-in-turkey-fear-they-will-be-next\">forbidden to be gay</a> in Syria.</p> <p>I was in Cairo for just under four years. I liked it at the beginning, but from the second half of 2013 there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/egypt-police-raid-cairo-bath-house\">crackdown</a> on the LGBT community \u2013 Egyptians were imprisoned and foreigners were deported. At the moment there are over 250 people in jail there because they are homosexual.</p> <p>I left my company because of a professional disagreement, and started working at a call centre, while waiting for my new work permit to come through. It was then I discovered I\u2019m HIV positive \u2013 to get a work permit in Egypt you need to prove you\u2019re HIV negative \u2013 so I was fired. I lived on savings, then started depending on friends and any jobs I was able to get; a translator, a tourist guide, whatever I could find.</p> <p>The oppression in Egypt made it impossible to meet people; you just couldn\u2019t trust that someone wasn\u2019t an informer. Mostly my LGBT friends and I stayed home. If we were meeting friends and someone was late, we would call and check reports to see if anyone had been picked up. I couldn\u2019t see a future there.</p> <p>I contacted <a href=\"http://rainbowrailroad.ca/\">Rainbow Railroad</a>, an organisation that helps LGBT people escape persecution, and they accepted my case. A little over a year after I first applied I opened my emails and saw the word \u201cCongratulations\u201d. I didn\u2019t believe it. I started jumping while sitting; it must have looked hilarious. My friend said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to Canada!\u201d</p> <p>I landed on 26 May, five days before <a href=\"http://www.pridetoronto.com/pride-month/\">Pride Month</a> started on 1 June. It felt significant, and overwhelming. I kept thinking: \u201cAm I allowed to do this?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/12/one-person-picket-fran-death-protests-greenham-common\">\u2018I made a one-person picket\u2019: Fran De\u2019Ath protests at Greenham Common</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I heard from Rainbow Railroad that Justin Trudeau would be at the march on 3 July. Early on, I realised there were only about 10 people between me and him. I thought, \u201cI need to reach him.\u201d I wanted to thank him for the opportunity to be here and be free. When I reached his side, I thought, \u201cNow what?\u201d Working up the courage to talk to him took an hour. I was thinking, \u201cShould I call him Mr Trudeau? Mr Prime Minister? Justin?\u201d In the end I said, \u201cUuuuh\u2026 I just want to thank you for everything. I\u2019m Syrian. I arrived here a month ago.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Canada asked me to do this.\u201d He didn\u2019t even try to take credit for it. For me, it was the perfect answer. I was about to cry.</p> <p>The first time I saw the picture was on TV. It spread from there, on social media and blogs, and soon it was everywhere.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently renting a room and looking for a job; I\u2019d love to work in human rights, in the LGBT field. I miss my mum, who still lives in Syria, but I don\u2019t miss living under fear of death. Canada is amazing, the weather is nice, the people are friendly; everything is amazing. I know I\u2019m repeating \u201camazing\u201d a lot, but it truly is. I already feel at home.</p> <ul> <li>Are you in a notable photograph?

  "<p>The Department of Justice announced Thursday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/us-government-private-prisons-use-justice-department\">it would begin \u201cphasing out\u201d the use of private prisons for federal prisoners</a> citing superior safety and rehabilitation outcomes at state-run facilities. Deputy attorney general Sally Yates wrote that private prisons \u201csimply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources\u201d, \u201cdo not save substantially on costs\u201d, and \u201cdo not maintain the same level of safety and security\u201d as the department\u2019s own sites.</p> <p> The move has been widely hailed by advocates as one that could signal positive change for about 22,000 federal inmates across 13 facilities, but many have also paused to note that the Justice Department decision only affects about a quarter of inmates and detainees held in US private facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the Justice Department\u2019s announcement is a step in the right direction, much more action is needed to scrub private prisons from our criminal justice system,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, <a href=\"http://www.colorofchange.org/about\">executive director of Color of Change</a>, an online racial justice organization.</p> <p>The decision, for example, does not apply to people held in Department of Homeland Security detention centers for immigration violations, which tally at about 34,000 on any given day, and about 400,000 over the course of a year. About 60% of those detainees are held in private facilities. By comparison, private prisons currently hold about 15% of federal prisoners and 6% of those in state corrections. </p> <p>\u201cRefugees, children, parents and everyday people seeking a better life are routinely locked up, abused and even killed by corporate-run immigrant detention facilities and despite the evidence, the Department of Homeland Security refuses to shut them down,\u201d said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream Action, an immigrant rights activist organization. She added that today\u2019s decision is \u201cyet more evidence of why Hillary Clinton must commit to use executive authority to provide relief to immigrants in her first 100 days, should she become president\u201d.</p> <p>Similar to other direct efforts the Obama administration has taken on prison and criminal justice reform issues recently, there is a limited impact because of how few of the nation\u2019s incarcerated people are under federal control at any given time. Federal prisoners make up just 14% of nearly 1.5 million prison inmates nationwide, while the vast majority are instead held in state correctional facilities. An additional 740,000 inmates are also detained in local jails at any given time.</p> <p>A similar dynamic was at work earlier this summer when the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/26/obama-bans-solitary-confinement-of-juveniles-in-federal-prisons\">banned the use of solitary confinement</a> in federal juvenile facilities. It was quickly noted that only 13 juvenile inmates had endured the practice the previous year. In that same action, the president also expanded treatment for the mentally ill and increased the amount of time adult inmates in solitary must be allowed to spend outside of their cells in federal facilities. Obama said at the time he hoped the changes would \u201cserve as a model for state and local corrections systems\u201d.</p> <p>In Texas, where more people are incarcerated than any other state, the state\u2019s ACLU called on local leaders to \u201cfollow the lead of the Justice Department and end their relationships with the for-profit prison industry\u201d in the wake of the announcement.</p> <p>Texas officials \u201ccould start by phasing out one or more private state jail contracts when they expire next year\u201d, said Rebecca L Robertson, legal and policy director for the ACLU of Texas. \u201cThe for-profit prison model creates perverse incentives to cut corners and lock up as many people as possible, all on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. The results have been predictable: over-criminalization, overcrowding, inhumane treatment, inadequate services and healthcare and routine abuse of detainees.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">scathing report released last week that found privately operated federal prisons drastically more unsafe and punitive</a> than other prisons in the system. The report found that inmate-on-inmate assaults were 28% higher in private federal prisons as compared to state ones, and that cost-saving intended cutbacks to medical care in these facilities was likely at fault for the deaths of inmates experiencing medical emergencies.<br></p> <p>Jonathan Burns, the director of public affairs for Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison company in the country downplayed any concern with the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s announcement relates only to [federal] BOP [Bureau of Prisons] correctional facilities, which make up 7% of our business,\u201d Burns said. </p> <p>The company\u2019s stock dipped to it\u2019s lowest point since 2010 after the news was announced, plunging by nearly 50% in about an hour, before rebounding slightly. </p> <p>Burns said the company continued to \u201cvalue our partners, and we will continue to work with them\u201d.</p>",

A spokesman for the organisation, however, said that the culprits had taken their humour too far.

Biros and crumpled pieces of paper are thrust into his hands. Baker, used to the attention, dutifully signed every scrap. In between signatures, he agreed to meet me at his hotel after the show \u2013 though for security reasons he wasn\u2019t allowed to tell me which one: \u201cIf the fans find out they\u2019ll be round there like a shot.\u201d Later that night he called me with the details.</p> <p>The following morning, Baker and his girfriend were already checking out when I arrived at their grand Regent\u2019s Park hotel.

Losing his driving licence after a drink-driving offence was a headache, and public transport is no longer usually feasible (\u201cfar too many steps\u201d). Baker wasn\u2019t too keen on hotels either. \u201cI used to tour the theatres and clubs with an 18-foot luxury caravan strapped to the back of my Roller \u2013 it was a damn site more comfortable than most hotels.\u201d</p> <p>Before R2-D2 transformed his career, Baker toured the working men\u2019s clubs, performing comedy song and dance routines.

The freak accident left him paralysed from the neck down, and he died a few years later. \u201cEverything went wrong for me in the 1990s,\u201d said Baker. \u201c<a href=\"http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/english-actors-kenny-baker-who-played-r2d2-in-the-film-star-wars-and-picture-id510800937\">My wife [fellow actor Eileen]</a> died of epilepsy soon after Jack\u2019s accident, and for a while I felt totally alone.\u201d </p> <p>He paused and gripped his girlfriend\u2019s hand. \u201cStar Wars has been a real lifesaver, although I\u2019m not a great fan of science fiction.

I think the storylines have suffered.\u201d </p> <p>Baker had good reason to fear CGI. The last couple of Star Wars prequels had seen his character become increasingly pixelated, meaning less work. \u201cBut there are certain closeup movements only I can do convincingly.

They assume we must be best buddies and are always disappointed when they find out we\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>He also had mixed feelings on the next round of conventions. \u201cI find them exhausting these days, but the fans still seem to enjoy coming. I guess it\u2019s a great way for them to make new friends, swap stories and compare merchandise. A fan recently brought a whole packet of Star Wars condoms to a convention. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d</p> <p>And although Baker appreciated the attention, he expressed scepticism at the pitch of devotion displayed by many Star Wars fans. \u201cThey live and breathe the franchise and hero-worship the actors. It can be disturbing. Some fans lack boundaries, and I don\u2019t appreciate it when they wait outside my house. It can be pretty intense at times, but I shouldn\u2019t complain: they\u2019ve provided me with a decent pension.

Among the most celebrated are the handful of footballers who seem able to float for longer than seems particularly fair, like a greedy uncle at an airborne buffet.

  "<p>Even though I\u2019ve lived in New Mexico for 27 years, I grew up in California and still refer to it as \u201chome\u201d. My siblings, their children, my publisher and many friends live in the Golden State, so I make the trip at least once a year.</p> <p>I drive. It takes two days, but as I always plan on bringing back a trunk full of goodies, it\u2019s entirely worthwhile. My brother\u2019s olive oil, my sister-in-law\u2019s jams, a friend\u2019s blackberry preserves, almonds, walnuts, pistachios and fat medjool dates from my hometown farmers\u2019 market \u2026 If it\u2019s winter, I\u2019ll have interesting citrus fruits, such as yuzu and bergamot oranges. If it\u2019s summer, stone fruit will be tucked safely in a cooler.</p> <p>When I first moved to New Mexico, Californian friends would bring egg cartons with ripe figs nestled in each cup, and suitcases full of quince: two more foods that mean California to me. It\u2019s been years since that\u2019s happened and I no longer mind, which tells me that maybe New Mexico has become my home for real. The moment I cross from Arizona, I start to feel a tingle of pleasure. There are still six hours of driving ahead, but I\u2019m back in the land of mesas and red cliffs and, mostly, chilli. It\u2019s what I long for, as hungrily and intensely as anything I can imagine,: a blue corn enchilada smothered with red chilli sauce \u2013 rich, smooth and hot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/05/castilian-chicken-pot-stew-apple-recipe-miriam-gonzalez-durantez-taste-of-home\">Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez\u2019s recipe for Castilian chicken pot stew | A taste of home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I get to Grants, a small town largely defined by uranium mining, I leave the freeway and drive down the main street in search of the Uranium Cafe, a great old place now called Nana\u2019s Home Cooking. I sit at the counter and order a stacked (not folded) enchilada with red chilli. \u201cIs that all?\u201d the waitress asks. \u201cNo beans? No rice? No posole? No fried egg on top?\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes I do go for the whole plate, but mostly it\u2019s just the enchilada and Nana\u2019s chilli that I want. Good chilli is rich, the colour of red bricks, and a little sweet. Its flavour is rounded, perfect with the nuttiness of tortillas made with blue corn. The cheese is not heavy and gloopy, but cooling. Usually it\u2019s cheddar, but it could be a goat\u2019s cheese or another good melting cheese. While others might prefer fresh green chilli, the red has absorbed all that extra sunshine as it dries in the fields. To me, it is the quintessential taste of New Mexico.</p> <p>As I wait, I have a glass of water, and gradually stop vibrating from the road. My plate arrives and the flavours meet in my mouth in a big way. They\u2019re so good. I exhale deeply. I\u2019m back. Just as the peaches in California have their familiar magic, this native food does too. It tells me where I am, where home is now. California might always be <em>a</em> home to me, but it will never be the land of blue corn and red chilli.</p> <h2><strong>Stacked blue corn tortillas with red chilli sauce</strong></h2> <p>You can use other corn tortillas, but blue corn tortillas have a rich, nutty flavour that is perfect with the sweet heat of the red chilli. I make my stack with two tortillas, but you can use three or four with extra cheese. This recipe makes enough for 4 enchiladas. Any left over will keep in the fridge for several days. Rice, beans or posole, and a fried egg are standard accompaniments.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2</strong><br>Oil, for frying<br>4 blue corn tortillas<br>4 tsp onion, minced<br>200g mild cheddar or monterey jack, grated</p> <p><strong>For the sauce</strong><br>1 tbsp oil<br>1 small onion, very finely diced<br>1 plump garlic clove, minced<br>40g red chilli powder<br>500ml water, or chicken or beef stock<br>\u00bd tsp dried oregano<br>\u00bd tsp salt<br>A few drops vinegar (optional)</p> <p>1 First, make the sauce. Warm the oil in a small, heavy saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, then stir in the chilli. Add the water in 2 or 3 portions, followed by the oregano and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the flavours aren\u2019t well integrated, add a few drops of vinegar and taste again.</p> <p>2 Preheat the grill. Pour about 1cm of oil into a pan large enough to hold a tortilla. When the oil is simmering, put a tortilla in it for few seconds, just long enough to soften; it should not go crisp. Repeat with the other tortillas.</p> <p>3 Lay a tortilla on a heatproof plate. Cover it with \u00bc of the onion, \u00bc of the chilli sauce and \u00bc of the cheese. Add a second tortilla and repeat. Do the same on a second plate.</p> <p>4 Grill the enchiladas until the cheese melts and serve immediately.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Deborah+Madison+&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\">Deborah Madison </a>is a cookbook author and an expert on vegetarian cooking.</em></p>",
  "<p>A man with joint British and Australian citizenship could spend a year in jail in Dubai after posting a link on his Facebook page to a US charity raising funds for blankets and socks for refugee children in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Scott Richards, an economic development adviser from Adelaide, was arrested on 28 July and held for 22 days at Al Muraqqabat police station before being charged on Friday under a new law banning \u201cfundraising without permission\u201d.</p> <p>The post he shared was a link to a campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/qxf9frx8\">Zwan Family Charity</a> to raise funds for new tarpaulins, blankets, warm clothes and socks and sleeping bags for children at the Charahi Qambar refugee camp on the outskirts of Kabul.

It\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster. Pretty much all volunteers struggle with the nature of the work we do. But for those who live in the camp, the loss of hope, lack of information, fear and uncertainty mean the smallest things come to matter a lot.</p> <p>The lack of showers, hot water for washing, and laundry facilities, the overcrowding and the monotonous, cheap food handed out in queues like in a prison \u2013 all make it tough.

When he\u2019s gone there will be no replacement, just a competing roster of normal scale humans beings. The Bolt persona above all will be missed; commercial catnip, but also an intriguing thing in itself. There is undoubtedly a real Bolt in there somewhere, some private part of himself that has remained discrete throughout the Bolt Supremacy, just as there is some clever misdirection in the party boy persona, the Swedish women\u2019s handball team schtick, the much-trumpeted chicken nuggets. The casual airs are an act of intimidation, a racing tactic. The playfulness with De Grasse in the semi-finals was a part of this, an invitation to blink first.</p> <p>Another odd thing: other sprinters like Bolt. No one resents him, or shows irritation at his theatrics. It isn\u2019t hard to see why. For a start Bolt makes them money. Tyson Gay has said his own revenues increased steadily as soon as Bolt started beating him, so profound was Bolt\u2019s effect on the entire sport. The wealth has been shared, if not the medals.</p> <p>Here he ran his last as an Olympic sprint finalist, although another world championships will follow. Some have even suggested that retirement will quickly pall, that his value is simply too great, his racing will too strong to depart even on a high. That remains to be seen. But in Rio this felt like the greatest of solo goodbyes for the greatest, and most fondly compelling of athletes.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f98fed244e592de791bffb30d3be5714490eacd/36_393_4551_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bolt takes a bow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bolt takes a bow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:29:41.703Z\">at 4.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67be0e4b062ce4d224c1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:25:00.960Z\">4.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brazil wins the first set in the men\u2019s beach volleyball final.</strong></p> <p>Alison and Bruno take it 21-19 from the Italian pair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31ffb3a382a422d429bc38701e21467ca64f7bac/0_0_3496_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil\u2019s Alison Cerutti celebrates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:26:39.934Z\">at 4.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b67b51e4b0178756b5e0cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:24:05.196Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China has WON the women\u2019s indoor volleyball semi-final, three sets to one against Netherlands. </strong>It was 25-23 in the fourth set.</p> <p>They\u2019ll play Serbia \u2013 who earlier knocked out the USA \u2013 in the final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b67ae6e4b0c23bfed8adca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T03:21:48.277Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Seriously, this is too close.

The official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak about an ongoing probe.</p> <p>He said that around 6 am on Sunday, Lochte, along with fellow swimmers Jack Conger, Gunnar Bentz and Jimmy Feigen, stopped at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, a suburb of Rio where many Olympic venues are located. One of the swimmers tried to open the door of an outside bathroom. It was locked. A few of the swimmers then pushed on the door and broke it. A security guard appeared and confronted them, the official said. The official says the guard was armed with a pistol, but he never took it out or pointed it at the swimmers. </p> <p>According to the official, the gas station manager then arrived. Using a customer to translate, the manager asked the swimmers to pay for the broken door. After a discussion, they did pay him an unknown amount of money and then left. The official says that swimmers Conger and Bentz, who were pulled off a plane going back to the United States late Wednesday, told police that the robbery story had been fabricated.</p> <p>A spokesman for Rio 2016 meanwhile, defended the swimmers whose accounts of an armed robbery, saying they were just kids who were having fun and made a mistake. </p> <p> \u201cThese kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities,\u201d Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told reporters said, without elaborating. \u201cThey competed under gigantic pressure.

My go at the long jump, and I\u2019m hurtling down my carefully-marked run-up when the teacher called out, in my final strides, \u201cYou look like a Sherman Tank, Williams!\u201d Completely put me off, but he wouldn\u2019t let me have another go, so my first and only recorded PB at the long jump was 8ft 6in\u2026.</p> <p> About a year later, playing volleyball in the gym (must have been raining), I managed, in the follow-through of an energetic smash attempt, to slap myself firmly in the danglers. Luckily no serious damage, just a fair bit of greenness about the gills and a lengthy time-out, during which the teacher (a different one) displayed his sympathy by remarking that at my age I ought to be completely familiar with my own tolerance for hard handling in that area\u2026.</p> <p> And later again, at rugby training, the teacher was demonstrating to the first-team pack some subtleties of track one and track two ball from the scrum, so installed himself as their hooker, and picked me to hook against him. This was a demo, so we non-first-teamers were really just there in place of the scrum machine that the school couldn\u2019t afford. Anyway, by chance, the first time the ball came in, I flicked my 1970s-budding-rock-bass-player long hair out of my eyes and caught the teacher full in the face (cheek-to-cheek, of course, in the scrum). I won the strike. Second time around, I did it on purpose and beat him again. Third time, the teacher got fed up \u2013 just before packing down, he did the old sniff and hawk and rolled a big green grolly out of the corner of his mouth into his beard, which he then rubbed up and down against my cheek as the scrum set. When I recoiled in disgust, he asked, \u2018Do we understand each other, Williams?\u2019. \u2018Perfectly, sir\u2026..\u2019 and the demonstration proceeded smoothly. The moral? Don\u2019t ever try to be clever with an old club player, even when he\u2019s a teacher\u2026.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be9fe4b0178756b5dd5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:57:22.696Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Three game points to GB in the badminton... but the first is quickly saved with a dipping service return backed up with a smash. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5be51e4b062ce4d2248ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/barneyronay\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:56:36.875Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cFurther to Sean\u2019s update on the Triathlon, I can confirm from my beachside seat that it is inhumanly hot on Copacabana.

Admittedly there has been a few bright sparks such as Dipa Karmarkar finishing fourth in the vault final being India\u2019s first ever gymnast to reach the final. Sadly even her story illustrates why India do so poorly at the Olympics as she was persistently underfunded as she relied on using the discarded gymnastic equipment from the 2010 Commonwealth Games to train with. Whilst in Rio her own physiotherapist was considered surplus to requirements by the Indian Olympic association thus she had no physio throughout the Olympics to help her. So just looking into her story alone illustrates how money can breed about success and Indian gymnastics is still very far behind what I assume is the well funded British team which won all those medals this year.\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b5b541e4b0c23bfed8aa4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-18T13:17:42.992Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cIn my humble opinion she should not be playing on,\u201d says the BC summariser, apparently more aware of the pain Li\u2019s in than Li herself.

So if ball pitched on the rubber mat in a spot that lay on top of a crumbling joint it would fly off in a random direction and with significant acceleration.

She gamely finished fourth after running the full race in the outside lane and was soundly beaten by her decidedly less fit best mate. The whole farce of the day was compounded by the same teacher ringing the bell a lap too early on the 1500 metres for boys.

It was fondly called \u2018The Plunge\u2019. Essentially, you had to dive in and see how far you could float without moving anything, or breathing.</p> <p>While this sounds like a recipe for drowning, and is probably outlawed on \u2018Elf &amp; Safety\u2019 grounds these days, it was incredibly entertaining to watch. It was also uniquely well suited to the fat kids who were otherwise absolutely abject at swimming, given their ballast and sheer momentum would allow them to float further than their smaller, more svelte peers. [N.B. I wasn\u2019t one of those fat kids, and so never had the pleasure of competing in it, having thrashed myself in the more traditional events previously].<br></p> <p>I reckon they should make it an Olympic sport.\u201d<br></p> <p>The sadism they used to get away with in school was quite something. In mine, the teacher would open the fire doors in the winter, so the breeze came in off the Camden town coast. She also refused to let anyone get out of the pool using the steps or even the corner, so you\u2019d have everyone shivering on the side while two or three kids struggled.

I suppose in a decade when the BBC is no longer the rights holder and we\u2019ve slashed funding he can go back to being happily miserable at four golds we see only on highlights.

  "<p>It\u2019s a perplexing question: why has so little changed since 2008? If your recall is a little hazy, 2008 was the year the world woke up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">a banking crisis of epic proportions</a>, a crisis borne of blind faith in market wisdom and an utter lack of public oversight. But in a bizarre twist, the parties who benefited from the bust were the conservatives (the people who glibly told voters it was all the government\u2019s fault) and the xenophobes (who blamed it all on terrorists and immigrants, who steal our jobs yet are too lazy to work).</p> <p>So why isn\u2019t the left coming up with some real alternatives? There are volumes to be written about this conundrum, but I\u2019d like to venture one simple explanation: the eternal return of underdog socialism.</p> <p>It\u2019s an international phenomenon, observable among legions of leftwing thinkers and movements, from trade unions to political parties, from columnists to professors. The world view of the underdog socialist is encapsulated in the notion that the establishment has mastered the game of reason, judgment and statistics, leaving the left with emotion. Its heart is in the right place. The underdog socialist always has his or her back against the wall. Warily they watch the neoliberals, the multinationals and the Eurocrats advance, but can\u2019t bring themselves to do much more than whimper: \u201cCome on guys, do we have to?\u201d</p> <p>An MP from the Flemish Green party recently asked me: \u201cYes, but isn\u2019t the government deficit too high?\u201d She stared in disbelief when I answered that the deficit was actually too low. Jeremy Corbyn still hasn\u2019t offered any convincing vision that resonates beyond his most devoted fans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems as if leftists like losing \u2013 as if all the doom and atrocities mainly serve to prove them right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the Socialist party in France and Germany\u2019s Social Democratic party are moving farther towards the middle of the road. In my own country, the Netherlands, the vacuous governing social democrat party seems to believe it will be able to inch its way up the polls if only economy shows some limited growth. \u201cThe left has failed to come up with ideas that are economically sound and politically popular beyond ameliorative policies such as income transfers,\u201d the economist <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/anti-globalization-backlash-from-right-by-dani-rodrik-2016-07\">Dani Rodrik recently wrote</a>.</p> <p>The underdog socialist has a surfeit of compassion and finds prevailing policies deeply unfair \u2013 seeing the achievements of the 20th century crumbling to dust, and rushing in to salvage what he can. But when push comes to shove, the underdog socialist caves in to the arguments of the opposition, always accepting the premise upon which the debate takes place. \u201cNational debt is out of control, but we can make more programmes income-dependent ... Fighting poverty is terribly expensive, but it\u2019s part of being a civilised nation ... Taxes are high \u2013 but each according to his ability.\u201d</p> <p>Reining in and restraining, that\u2019s the sole remaining mission of the underdog socialists. Anti-austerity, anti-privatisation, anti-establishment: one is left to wonder, what are underdog socialists actually for? Time and again, they side with society\u2019s unfortunates: poor people, dropouts, asylum seekers, disabled people and the discriminated. They decry Islamophobia, homophobia and racism. Meanwhile, they obsess over the proliferation of \u201crifts\u201d dividing the world into blue-collar and white-collar, poverty and wealth, ordinary people and the 1%, and vainly seek to \u201creconnect\u201d with a constituency that has long since packed its bags.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dca8e822b3abfb69d67bc361a670a1255cbf94ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca8e822b3abfb69d67bc361a670a1255cbf94ab/0_17_1390_1900/732.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Nathalie Lees\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But the underdog socialists\u2019 biggest problem isn\u2019t that they are wrong. They are not. Their biggest problem is that they\u2019re dull. Dull as a doorknob. They\u2019ve got no story to tell; nor even the language to convey it in. Having arrived at the conclusion that politics is a mere matter of identity, they have chosen an arena in which they will lose every time.</p> <p>And too often, it seems as if leftists actually like losing. As if all the failure, doom and atrocities mainly serve to prove they were right all along. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of activism,\u201d Rebecca Solnit remarks in her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/02/highereducation.globalisation\">Hope in the Dark</a>, \u201cthat\u2019s more about bolstering identity than achieving results.\u201d</p> <p>One thing Donald Trump understands very well is that most people prefer to be on the winning side (\u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much. You\u2019re going to get tired of winning.\u201d) They resent the pity and paternalism of the good Samaritan. The always-impending apocalypse \u2013 whether the next financial crash or unavoidable climate disaster \u2013 is not a great motivator.</p> <p>What the underdog socialist has forgotten is that the story of the left ought to be a narrative of hope and progress. By that I don\u2019t mean a narrative that only excites a few hipsters who get their kicks philosophising about \u201cpostcapitalism\u201d after reading some deadly dull tome. The greatest sin of the academic left is that it has become fundamentally aristocratic, writing in bizarre jargon that makes cliches seem abstruse. If you can\u2019t explain your ideal to a fairly intelligent 12-year-old, it\u2019s probably your own fault. What we need is a narrative that speaks to millions of ordinary people. It all starts with reclaiming the language of progress.</p> <p>Reforms? Hell, yes. Let\u2019s give the financial sector a real overhaul: hike those buffers, carve up those banks, and give those tax paradises a run for their money. And after that, let\u2019s reinvent the welfare state and <a href=\"https://decorrespondent.nl/10/waarom-we-iedereen-gratis-geld-moeten-geven/384450-0b1c02bd\">eradicate poverty</a> for good \u2013 now that\u2019s an investment <a href=\"https://medium.com/utopia-for-realists/why-do-the-poor-make-such-poor-decisions-f05d84c44f1a#.a20lg7kfw\">that will pay for itself</a>.</p> <p>Meritocracy? Bring it on. Let\u2019s finally pay people according to their real contributions. Waste collectors, nurses and teachers would get a <a href=\"https://decorrespondent.nl/1949/Waarom-vuilnismannen-meer-verdienen-dan-bankiers/74929305-f905ef8a\">substantial raise</a>, obviously, while quite a few lobbyists, lawyers and bankers would see their salaries dive into the negatives. If you want to do a job that hurts the public, go right ahead. But you\u2019ll have to pay for the privilege.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/18/solution-everything-working-less-work-pressure\">The solution to (nearly) everything: working less | Rutger Bregman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Innovation?

The reason was that the Howard government felt increasingly threatened by a far-right political grouping, the One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson, and saw a policy of hostility to refugees \u2013 a kind of \u201csoft Hansonism\u201d \u2013 as a way of recovering rightwing support.</p> <p>At this point, Nauru entered the picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/a-short-history-of-nauru-australias-dumping-ground-for-refugees\">A failed Pacific microstate</a> with an avaricious and unscrupulous leadership \u2013 Nauru in the late 1990s reportedly laundered more than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/magazine/the-billion-dollar-shack.html?pagewanted=all\">US$70bn for the Russian mafia</a> \u2013 it was the perfect partner for an Australian refugee dumping exercise. </p> <p>To nurture an arrangement for this to happen, Australia agreed to provide over A$1m to pay the unpaid debts owed by Nauruans to Australian hospitals, as blatant a bribe as one could imagine. And since then, Nauru has done very well as Australia\u2019s new friend. In the May 2015 Australian budget, Nauru, with an Australian detention centre, was slated to receive aid funding amounting to $2,120.00 per person per year in aid. By contrast, Afghanistan was slated to receive A$2.63 per person per year in aid.</p> <p>What made Nauru such a ideal partner? Two factors essentially came into play. The first was Nauru\u2019s nominal status as a \u201csovereign state\u201d. While Nauru in practice is best described as a \u201cmendicant\u201d or even \u201cprostitute\u201d state, its formal status has allowed Australia to put forward the legal fiction that the treatment of refugees on Nauru is a matter for Nauru, not Australia. This, of course, is pure fiction: the reality is that Australia pays the bills, and contractors to the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection act as \u201cservice\u201d providers. </p> <p>The other factor favouring Nauru is that accountability mechanisms can be avoided. Those on Nauru are beyond any protective jurisdiction of independent Australian courts, or the investigative capacity of the Australian Human Rights Commission. Even the media are constrained: potentially-critical journalists do not receive visas, and just to be on the safe side, Nauru imposes a non-refundable $8,000 visa fee for media applicants.</p> <p>It goes almost without saying that in Nauru itself, there are no independent sources of protection for refugees. Police investigations of complaints, even of serious crimes, are virtually non-existent, and the rule of law collapsed when the Melbourne-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/nauru-deports-its-only-magistrate-and-bars-chief-justice-from-entering-country\">chief justice was refused a visa to return, and the chief magistrate was deported</a> from the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may be that even as devastating a collection of materials as the Nauru files will do little to shift current Australian policy. The present prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, once seen as a moderate, was returned to office in the 2 July 2016 election with only 76 seats out of 150 in the House of Representatives. He is very much beholden to the right wing of his own Liberal party, including his Peter Dutton, his ultra-conservative minister for immigration and border protection. </p> <p>He may also feel dependent on Hanson, who through a quirk of the electoral system secured election to the Senate, along with three of her followers. In addition, he is hostage to his repeated claims that the harsh regime on Nauru is necessary to stop refugees from risking their lives by boarding boats \u2013 although deterrence without attention to root causes of movement does not save lives but simply shifts deaths to other parts of the world. (And <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=43xdUUx4ISsC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+more+boats+that+come+the+better%E2%80%9D+wikileaks+malcolm+turnbull&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-z3LXKk7Vm&amp;sig=UjII3OSzk2pjOknaS3NxdQQ6ZVg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5sYSDsMzOAhUBrJQKHaxuC9kQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cthe%20more%20boats%20that%20come%20the%20better%E2%80%9D%20wikileaks%20malcolm%20turnbull&amp;f=false\">we know from Wikileaks</a> that when he was opposition leader in 2009, one of his key strategists told the US Embassy that the issue of boats was \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cthe more boats that come the better\u201d because of the political embarrassment it caused the Labor government).</p> <p>Yet he may also care for his historical reputation. History tends to be unkind to those who embrace the evil practices of those they once denounced. Here, Turnbull would be well advised to recall the damning last sentence of George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm: \u201cThe creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.\u201d</p> <p><em>William Maley is a professor of diplomacy at the Australian National University, and author of <a href=\"http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/what-is-a-refugee/\">What is a Refugee?</a></em></p>"
