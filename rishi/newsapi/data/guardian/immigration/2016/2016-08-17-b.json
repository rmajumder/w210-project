  "<p>The Guardian can reveal that the offices of senior members of the Australian government \u2013 including prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull\">Malcolm Turnbull</a>, the attorney general, George Brandis, and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton \u2013 all received an extensive dossier in May 2016 that outlined the ongoing harm to children held on Nauru and the \u201cnumerous child rights violations\u201d that had occurred.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Letters to Peter Dutton\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/321431649/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-fIq5d7A5EfqdKq1nl3fn&show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7061128526645768\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_6671\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Save the Children to Dutton</h2> <p>Save the Children Australia<br>Office of the CEO<br>Paul Ronalds</p> <p>7 August 2015<br></p> <p>Hon Peter Dutton MP<br>Minister for Immigration<br>Parliament House<br></p> <p>Dear Minister<br></p> <p>I appreciate you making the time available to meet with me on Wednesday 12 August 2015 and write now to advise of three key matters which I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with you.<br></p> <p><strong>1. Data review \u2013 impact of detention on the welfare of children in Nauru RPC</strong><br></p> <p>SCA has undertaken a review of all the data that we hold in relation to the welfare of children in the Nauru RPC. The data review is a rigorous analysis of all of the incident reports and casework reviews which SCA has on record in relation to the 281 children who have been held in Nauru. It provides an evidence based case study to inform discussions about the impact that detention has on the welfare of children. A copy of the data review is attached for discussion at the meeting. We are obviously treating this material with the utmost confidentiality.<br></p> <p><strong>2. Child Safeguarding and Early Childhood Services on Nauru</strong><br></p> <p>Irrespective of the outcome of the current tender process, i would like to discuss with you opportunities for SCA to provide a broader suite of development programs on Nauru for asylum seekers, refugees and the Nauruan community. Such programs would respond to the significant unmet need that exists in Nauru in areas like child safeguarding and early childhood education.<br></p> <p><strong>3. Regional Engagement</strong><br></p> <p>We are keen to discuss the Government\u2019s current thinking on a regional solution, including building capacity in transit countries for timely refugee status determination, investment in improving access to basic services, and genuine cooperation across the region to share resettlement of UNHCR identified refugees.<br></p> <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to note how much we appreciate the dialogue with your office in relation to a range of matters, including asylum seeker welfare and family reunion issues.<br></p> <p>I look forward to meeting with you next week.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br></p> <p>Paul Ronalds<br>Chief Executive Officer<br></p> <h2>Dutton to Save the Children</h2> <p>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION<br></p> <p>Ref No: MC15-219710<br></p> <p>Mr Paul Ronalds<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Save the Children Australia</p> <p>Dear Mr Ronalds</p> <p>Thank you for your letter of 7 August 2015 concerning the welfare of children in Nauru, and regional engagement more broadly. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring these matters to my attention and for our recent meeting.<br></p> <p>I acknowledge Save the Children Australia\u2019s (SCA) desire to support the welfare of children and families accommodated at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre (RPC).</p> <p>With respect to the review of data held by SCA in relation to the welfare of children at the Nauru RPC, I reiterate that I take matters of child protection very seriously and the Department of immigration and Border Protection shares this attitude.<br></p> <p>The implementation of recommendations arising from the Moss Review has resulted in improvements to centre security and care for children and vulnerable persons in the Nauru RPC. The Department is working closely with the Government of Nauru to assist with the development and implementation of a child protection framework in Nauru. A Child Protection Panel was also established in May 2015 to identify where management of incidents in detention can be strengthened to better address any allegations of abuse, neglect or exploitation made in relation to a child.<br></p> <p>With regard to any potential opportunities for SCA to provide community development programmes on Nauru, raising these with the GoN is a matter for SCA.</p> <p>I also note that child protection within the Nauruan community, other than that of transferee children in the RPC, is a matter for the GoN.</p> <p>The integration of transferee children into local Nauruan schools is being undertaken in the best interests of the children and in support of their access to formal education opportunities. This includes integrating transferee children into early childhood education programmes conducted by the GoN.</p> <p>With regard to our discussion on regional engagement, note that the Australian<br>Government is committed to combatting people smuggling and trafficking of persons in the region and continues to work with regional partners through the Bali Process to identify engagement and capacity building opportunities. This forum has been very productive in building capacity to manage illegal migration throughout the region.</p> <p>The Governments of Australia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Nauru and Cambodia are committed to addressing people smuggling and illegal migration. Australia\u2019s regional processing and settlement policy has been pivotal in addressing this issue. Australia has also provided valuable capacity building to Nauru, PNG and Cambodia to tackle this issue and will continue this work.</p> <p>Thank you for raising these matters.</p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>PETER DUTTON 16/9/15</p> <h2>Save the Children to Turnbull: the same letter was sent to Dutton and Brandis </h2> <p>Save the Children Australia<br></p> <p>3 May 2016<br></p> <p>The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP<br>Prime Minister<br></p> <p>Dear Prime Minister,<br></p> <p>Save the Children Report on Child Asylum Seekers in Nauru<br></p> <p>As you are aware, Save the Children Australia was appointed by the Australian Government to provide a range of services to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru during the period August 2013 to October 2015. In the course of providing these services to relevant individuals, our staff gathered data concerning the background and experiences of individual children, adults and families residing in the Regional Processing Centre and developed well-informed impressions in relation to the operation of Australia\u2019s regional processing system in Nauru.</p> <p>Save the Children acknowledges that there are no easy solutions in balancing the need to act compassionately and humanely towards people fleeing persecution, while also developing effective policy responses to the increasing migration and refugee flows in the region. However, the challenges inherent in developing sound policies in this area are significantly compounded by laws and measures which impede transparency in relation to assessing the human cost of Australia\u2019s current approach to asylum seekers who arrive by boat.<br></p> <p>Accordingly, as the primary rights-based organisation working with asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru from 2013 to 2015, we consider it incumbent upon us to reflect and report on areas where the data that our staff collected, and the observations that they made, indicate that the rights of child asylum seekers may have been violated. In that sense, we seek to provide a snapshot (that goes beyond anecdotal reports) of some of the human consequences of Australia\u2019s policies in relation to asylum seekers who arrive by boat, and prompt consideration of whether such costs justify the perceived benefits.</p> <p>Using the evidence gathered through data analysis, staff observations and other credible sources, the enclosed report on \u2018Child Asylum Seekers in Nauru\u2019 identifies significant and numerous child rights violations in this context. Children were, among other things, detained for extraordinary periods of time, disproportionately negatively affected by the experience of detention, frequently exposed to harm, violence and abuse, and were often separated from their parents.<br></p> <p>The contents of this report ultimately support the position that when viewed through the lens of the experience of child asylum seekers, Australia\u2019s unyielding policies in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers who arrive by boat are not appropriate in their current form.<br></p> <p>Recognising existing policy objectives, this report makes a number of core recommendations to the Australian Government which entail ensuring that:<br></p> <ul> <li>child asylum seekers and their families are not transferred to, or forced to remain, in locations whether they are at serious risk of harm;<br></li> <li>the transfer and treatment of child asylum seekers and their families is subject to ongoing independent and transparent human rights monitoring; and<br></li> <li>individuals who have experienced human rights abuses in this context have access to an effective remedy.<br></li> </ul> <p>We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this report and its recommendations with you and your staff. Please contact [REDACTED], Head of Policy and Advocacy, at [REDACTED] if you have any queries or would like to arrange a meeting. Please note that have written in similar terms to the Attorney General and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br></p> <p>Mat Tinkler<br>Director of Policy and Public Affairs<br>Save the Children Australia<br></p> <h2>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to Save the Children</h2> <p>Australian Government<br></p> <p>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br></p> <p>Reference: MGM-050518</p> <p>Mr Mat Tinkler<br>Director, Save the Children Australia<br></p> <p>Dear Mr Tinkler<br></p> <p>Thank you for your letter dated 3 May 2016 to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull MP, regarding conditions at regional processing centres. I have been asked to reply on the Prime Minister\u2019s behalf.<br></p> <p>Your letter has been referred to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Peter Dutton, who has portfolio responsibility for this issue.<br></p> <p>Once again, thank you for your letter.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely<br></p> <p>Senior Adviser<br></p> <h2>Department of Immigration and Border Protection to Save the Children</h2> <p>Australian Government<br></p> <p>Department of Immigration and Border Protection<br></p> <p>Ref No: MC16-0011728<br></p> <p>Mr Mat Tinkler <br>Director of Policy and Public Affairs<br>Save the Children Australia<br></p> <p>Dear Mr Tinkler<br></p> <p>Thank you for your letter of 3 May 2016 to the Minister of Immigration and Border Protection. the Hon Peter Dutton MP, on behalf of the Save the Children concerning arrangements for transferees, particularly children, in Nauru. As the Australian Government is currently in caretaker mode due to the upcoming Federal election, I have been asked to reply on the Minister\u2019s behalf.<br></p> <p>The Department of Immigration and Border Protection appreciates the report attached to your letter, Child Asylum Seekers in Nauru of 3 May 2016, regarding the provision of services to children transferred to Nauru for processing and resettlement. It also notes the recommendations that have been made.</p> <p>As you would be aware, the Australian Government remains committed to the regional processing and settlement arrangements in place in Nauru. The Department continues to work with the Government of Nauru to support the implementation and management of these arrangements. This includes contracting service providers to deliver services to support transferees in the regional processing centre, as well as refugees living in the Nauruan community. The Government of Australia is working closely with the Government of Nauru to build its capacity and ability to manage child protection matters. Significant investment has been made by Australia to improve the Nauruan education and health systems.</p> <p>The Australian Parliament has scrutinised the operations of the Nauru regional processing arrangements on a number of occasions and continues to do so. A number of independent organisations, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the International Committee of the Red Cross, conduct regular monitoring visits. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also recently visited Nauru and will report to the Governments of Nauru and Australia on its findings.</p> <p>Thank you for bringing the concerns of Save the Children to the Minister\u2019s attention.<br></p> <p>Yours sincerely<br></p> <p>Acting Commander<br>Regional Processing and Settlement Branch<br>9 May 2016<br></p>",

She spoke with Kellyanne Conway, the pollster promoted to campaign manager in the overnight Trump campaign shake-up.</p> <p>\u201cNow we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump,\u201d Conway tells Lauren. <strong>And don\u2019t call it</strong><strong> a shake-up:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThis is an expansion at an incredibly busy time, the last 12-week homestretch for the campaign. We look at personnel as more as more. With Paul continuing as our chairman and Rick Gates as his deputy, Stephen Bannon and I have been added to what I would call the \u201ccore four\u201d of that senior team and we\u2019re going to divide responsibilities according to our best an highest uses.\u201d <br></p> <p>Q: How will she and Bannon work together?</p> <p>\u201cSteve Bannon and I have tremendous respect for each other as colleagues and as friends and we also have the trust of Donald Trump the candidate. You first of all have the trust of the candidate and the latitude \u2026 We have different styles but we have one vision.\u201d </p> <p>She said she expects to hit the campaign field and TV circuit while Bannon mans the HQ at Trump Tower. </p> <p>Q: Is the race over or just getting started?</p> <p>\u201cTwo or three things we\u2019ve all learned about Donald Trump is No 1: Don\u2019t underestimate him. No 2: You know he exceeds expectations and No 3: he also exceeds the metrics that are usually at play, meaning he over performed many of his polling averages in the primaries and the caucuses. But now we see a number of voters who are not coming clean about their support for Donald Trump. I can\u2019t find a single hidden Hilary Clinton voter in the country. I\u2019ve been looking for him or her. They all seem to be out, proudly saying that their voting for Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Mr. Trump, the race isn\u2019t over because August is not October let alone November.\u201d</p> <p>Q: How does Manafort fit in on the new team?:</p> <p>\u201cWe would hope and expect Paul continues to do many of things he\u2019s been doing. He\u2019s just been doing the job of three or four people.

Bannon also helped set up a spin-off thinktank called the <a href=\"http://www.g-a-i.org/\">Government Accountability Institute</a> that published a book alleging that the Clintons had pulled strings for foreign donors to their foundation.</p> <p>In recent months, it has become the ideological engine house of the Trump train, accused of stoking racial tensions and fueling the mood of nationalism with a slew of stories on subjects such as uncontrolled immigration at the US border and the threat of Islamic extremism.</p> <p>From its small headquarters in Washington DC, this scrappy challenger to the liberal media consensus has served as a rebel base for the assault on Capitol Hill and beyond \u2013 hosting Duck Dynasty stars and UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage on trips to Washington, and continuing Bannon\u2019s close ties to populist champions such as Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s new campaign chief executive is no stranger to the establishment himself. After four years in the US navy, he went to Harvard Business School and joined Goldman Sachs before setting up a boutique Wall Street advisory firm specialising in media deals.</p> <p>It was one such deal that left him with an unexpectedly lucrative share in the royalties from the hit comedy show Seinfeld. After selling the firm in 1998, he went on to be executive producer of everything from an Anthony Hopkins film to a documentary on Ronald Reagan that led him to be described as the \u201cLeni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/\">According to Bloomberg</a>, the source of that uncomfortable moniker was Andrew Breitbart, a new media revolutionary who helped launch Huffington Post and edited the Drudge Report before branching out with an eponymous website of his own that Bannon largely took over after Breitbart\u2019s death in 2012.</p> <p>But it is the kind of label that sticks fondly in Trump land, which quoted from the same Bloomberg profile in the <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-major-campaign-hires\">statement</a> confirming Bannon\u2019s appointment on Wednesday \u2013 referring to its headline description of him as the \u201cMost Dangerous Political Operative in America\u201d.</p> <p>The impetus for Bannon\u2019s swift ascent of Trump Tower appears to stem, as many things there do, from the candidate\u2019s family. Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump who also owns another supportive rightwing media outlet, the New York Observer, is reported to have rushed back to New York this week to convene an emergency meeting to consider how staff changes could reboot his father-in-law\u2019s flagging campaign.</p> <p>Ostensibly, it is plummeting poll numbers that have rattled the Trump inner circle. But Manafort\u2019s precarious position in charge of the day-to-day campaign cannot have been helped by recent revelations of his previous life as an adviser to despotic foreign leaders. The most <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c01989a47ee5421593ba1b301ec07813/ap-sources-manafort-tied-undisclosed-foreign-lobbying\">recent allegations</a> of underhand payments, though fiercely denied, threatened less to taint an often Teflon campaign than to risk upstaging a boss who likes to reserve mainstream media outrage for himself.</p> <p>Just as previous campaign chief Corey Lewandowski was jettisoned when his fracas with a Breitbart reporter threatened to dominate the Trump media cycle, Manafort has been sidelined before the messenger could become the message.</p> <p>However like Lewandowski, he remains in the Trump orbit, nominally in his old role as campaign chairman. A growing list of rightwing media moguls skilled in the dark arts will also be there as the campaign gears up for its last-ditch assault on Clinton in the crucial weeks after Labor Day.</p> <p>Disgraced Fox News chief Roger Ailes is said to be advising Trump on how to handle a series of television debates with Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/roger-ailes-coaching-donald-trump-debate-denial\">though the campaign has denied this</a>. Political consultant Roger Stone is also still a key confident.</p> <p>Whether the revolving list of shadowy characters can rescue a campaign that appears to be in freefall is another matter of course.

The employment rate, which measures the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are in work, was 74.5%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.</p> <p>The unemployment rate in the three months to the end of June was unchanged at 4.9%. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 2.3% over the same period, up from 2.2%.<br></p> <p>The number of people unemployed, defined as those not in work but seeking and available for employment, was 1.64 million for the three-month period, the lowest since March to May 2008. </p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said concerns about the economic impact of the Brexit vote were not supported by the data, at least in the short term.<br></p> <p>He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good.</p> <p>\u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded, maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d</p> <p>Recent surveys have shown that while many companies have shelved investment plans and industries such as construction have suffered a sudden loss of confidence, employers are reluctant to cut staff for what may prove to be a short lived period of uncertainty.<br></p> <p>A report by the Treasury collating the predictions to 2020 of independent economic forecasters found a consensus that economic growth would remain muted between now and the end of the decade. Predictions that growth will remain below 2% also meant unemployment would rise by about 350,000 to approximately 2 million people.</p> <p>Wages growth was likely to remain subdued, especially after being adjusted for inflation, which has begun to rise.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, said that with inflation up from below zero last year to 0.6% last month and expected to climb more steeply in the coming months, \u201cBritain\u2019s poor performance on pay is a major cause for concern\u201d.</p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added that the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, such as interest rates and a multibillion-pound bond-buying programme, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p>",

They could argue that an unexpected drop in unemployment proves the doommongers wrong, with widespread fears of job losses in the wake of an out vote not yet materialising.</p> <p>They could also suggest the rising rate of employment among non-UK nationals, with the number of eastern Europeans topping 1 million for the first time, shows the urgent need for Britain to reimpose controls on migration. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">UK unemployment claimant count falls after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the first point, it is early days. The UK is still years away from an actual exit from the EU, with the government yet to employ many of the staff who will be charged with steering the country through a complex set of negotiations. It is still too soon to dismiss the warnings over employment and recession when it comes to Brexit.</p> <p>Besides, it was not the economics that won out in the June referendum anyway. As we know, millions of voters shunned the heavy handed warnings from Downing Street and its remain campaign about the risk to 3m EU-linked jobs, tax rises and savage spending cuts.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>No, in this referendum battle, immigration was king.</p> <p>Leave campaigners successfully tapped into a countrywide anxiety about the numbers of people coming freely to Britain to work, and persuaded them that there was only one way to bring the trend to a halt.</p> <p>Those coming from countries in eastern Europe, such as Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, were top of the list when people raised their concerns.</p> <p>David Cameron knew about the sentiment, of course. That is why he first promised to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, at a time when his aides believed the numbers were on the right track.</p> <p>But in doing so, he simply made people more angry, as they witnessed the official statistics heading in the opposite direction of the then prime minister\u2019s words. Moreover, a promise to limit access to benefits for people coming to Britain was not enough, because the sentiment was simply about immigration, not whether or not those people came to work. </p> <p>I heard the anger time and again when travelling across the country in the run-up to the vote. It was particularly vociferous in Peterborough (72.3% out), where the city\u2019s high streets had morphed as a result of immigration, and its health centres and schools were feeling the pressure.</p> <p>But it was also the same in other areas of lower immigration, such as Blackpool (65.4% out), Wigan (69.2% out) and Knowsley (63.5% out). In those places, people feared what the impact might be on their livelihoods if the numbers kept on growing, and blamed migration for damage to their own prosperity stemming from the loss of solid employment and uncertainty around wages.</p> <p>Claims from politicians that immigration was an economic boost didn\u2019t chime with people\u2019s reality, and simply stirred up more angst. </p> <p>Latterly, Cameron tried to take the issue head-on, arguing that the growth in migration was linked to Britain\u2019s economic success and would settle down over time. He also explained that limiting immigration carried an economic cost, the balance that will now be at the heart of the work done by Cameron\u2019s successors.</p> <p>Statistics for July outline the position before any of the work has even begun.</p>",
  "<p>You\u2019ve found your place through Clearing and decided to defer for a year, or perhaps you have simply decided to apply next year. Either way, you are now in the enviable, and perhaps slightly scary, position of having a whole year to fill. <br></p> <p>Tens of thousands of young people from the UK will head overseas to work this summer \u2013 to bolster experience, earn money to travel, and widen their skill sets \u2013 and you could now be one of them. </p> <p>Although there is, of course, something to be said for going it alone in foreign lands, a gap year of purely backpacking is becoming less common; most young people are opting to do some kind of volunteering or work while abroad. </p> <p>Tim Fryer, STA Travel\u2019s UK country manager, says: \u201cToday\u2019s young people are under more pressure than ever to have broad work experience and an impressive CV to show future employers or university admissions boards.</p> <p>\u201cHeading overseas to work somewhere such as Australia or New Zealand on a Working Holiday Visa, teaching English abroad, doing an internship, or taking part in a volunteering or conservation project \u2013 these are all great ways of doing this.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that it\u2019s not just about boosting career prospects: \u201cThese sorts of experiences also boost life skills, confidence and maturity, as they completely immerse you in a community and place.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The volunteer route</strong></h2> <p>Jennie Mann spent her gap year volunteering in Costa Rica \u2013 \u201cliving in hammocks in the rainforest and chopping down bamboo with a machete to build footpaths\u201d \u2013 and in Nicaragua, helping build an aqueduct to provide homes with running water. Her top tip is to organise your gap year through an organisation such as <a href=\"https://raleighinternational.org/\">Raleigh International</a> or <a href=\"http://www.volunteerics.org/\">International Citizen Service (ICS)</a>, both of which provide bursaries. \u201cThey give structure and safety to young people as well as the freedom to explore countries and meet new friends,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get great leadership skills that look fantastic on your CV.\u201d </p> <p>Raleigh International\u2019s Mike Butcher says joining an expedition is a good way to make friends if you\u2019re travelling alone: \u201cYou\u2019ll be in a team of about 12 volunteers, from a diverse range of backgrounds, including volunteers from the country in which you\u2019re working. Each team then has a volunteer manager, who is there to facilitate the project and support you. </p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re considering some independent travel after your programmes, volunteering first might just give you the confidence to do it \u2013 and, in all likelihood, some travel buddies.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhatever you choose to do, make sure you are passionate about it.\u201d </p> <h2>My amazing gap year diary</h2> <p><strong>Emily Potter from Bristol has spent her gap year working, volunteering and backpacking. At the end of August she flies home to start studying at Leeds University</strong></p> <h2>Autumn 2015</h2> <p>Having had summer off after my A-levels, I\u2019m now saving money for travelling. I mainly do events waitressing and bartending. It is definitely not boring, but it is quite unpredictable, sometimes going from no shifts for a couple of days to three in one day.</p> <h2>Christmas 2015</h2> <p>In the new year, my adventure begins. My first stop is Morocco, where I\u2019ll be volunteering with <a href=\"http://www.efamorocco.org/get-involved/volunteer.html\">Education For All (EFA) </a>which helps girls in the very rural High Atlas mountains finish their education. My own school\u2019s been supporting the organisation for years so I\u2019d heard a lot about it. It seems like a great opportunity to get to know a country and a culture I\u2019m interested in. People keep asking if I\u2019m nervous to go away but I\u2019m too excited to be nervous.</p> <h2>January 2016</h2> <p>I\u2019ve arrived in Asni, Morocco. Everyone has been very welcoming and lovely, but it was a little daunting being introduced to about 35 girls in such a short space of time \u2013 and after so little sleep. </p> <h2>February 2016</h2> <p>My main job as a volunteer is helping the girls who live in EFA\u2019s boarding houses with their English and French. I help a lot with homework, and the group \u201clessons\u201d I lead consist mainly of games and debates, but any chance to practise is useful for them. There is also always some project on the go, like repainting all the plant pots on the roof, or redoing the displays. If there is nothing to do, then we go and play football.</p> <h2>March 2016</h2> <p>Being of a similar age to the girls has helped me make really good friends. A couple of them invited me to stay with their families for the weekend, which was so much fun. I have even been to an Amazigh (Berber) wedding. They dressed me in a Kaftan and we danced until 6am and then walked home half way up a mountain. It started snowing and we were all wearing heels, and we had one torch between the five of us but because we were all so tired, we thought it was the funniest thing. That was one of my best moments.</p> <h2>April 2016</h2> <p>After leaving Asni, I travelled through Morocco to Tangier, before getting the ferry to Spain and flying to Budapest to do some interrailing around Europe with my best friend. We\u2019re in Prague now. We spent the day wandering around and there\u2019s so much to see and the city is beautiful. We had no plan so we just got lost for a couple of hours and took every opportunity to eat interesting looking food. </p> <h2>May 2016</h2> <p>I flew home from Brussels and now I\u2019m getting ready for my next adventure \u2013 Nicaragua. I first went there when I was 16 and I really wanted to come back to explore it more. I\u2019m going to do an internship at a place called Casa Xalteva in Granada. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a non-profit Spanish school that funds an educational programme for underprivileged local children and adolescents.</p> <h2>June 2016</h2> <p>I usually have Spanish lessons in the morning and then spend the afternoons getting all my work done. My internship involves me doing all the admin, so my days are mainly spent emailing potential students and making sure everything is set up for their time studying here. </p> <h2>July 2016</h2> <p>In September, I\u2019m going to Leeds University to study French and Arabic. It\u2019s exciting, but at the moment I\u2019m more excited about being in Nicaragua and exploring Central America. Granada is close to a lot of really amazing places, including an enormous lake full of tiny islands, a crater lake, two volcanoes, the capital city Managua, and the Pacific coast. I have a lot of options for exploring so I just pick a place when I have time and visit. <br></p> <h2><strong>Gap year top tips</strong></h2> <ul> <li><strong>Do your research</strong>. If you want to volunteer, find out about the organisation, ask difficult questions, and make sure they\u2019re reputable.<br></li> <li>Go to a country where you can <strong>get a work visa</strong>. Combining work and backpacking is easy in countries such as Australia and New Zealand meaning you don\u2019t have to save quite as much. Plus working in a country is one of the best ways to get under its skin.<br></li> <li><strong>Think outside the box</strong>, initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.helpx.net/\">Help Exchange</a> enable you to help families or businesses in exchange for food and accommodation \u2013 a really cheap way to see the world. Just check the reviews from previous helpers first!<br></li> <li><strong>Consider staying in the UK</strong> and finding a meaningful opportunity here. <a href=\"https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/\">Volunteering Matters</a> has full-time opportunities for young people wishing to live away from home for six months or a year while making a difference in this country. <br></li> <li>Overall, <strong>think about the impact</strong> you want to make, and go out and do it.<br></li> </ul>",

You can never tell if Teleprompter Trump believes what he\u2019s saying \u2013 he has the demeanour of a drugged-up show-trial defendant \u2013 but his plan for an immigrant screening test for \u201cthose who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles\u201d would be but the latest addition to America\u2019s inglorious history of ideological exclusion. Efforts to deny non-right-thinking foreigners access to American soil goes as far back as the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, but the banning of immigrants harbouring a specific ideology dates to the Anarchist Exclusion Act of 1903, which for good measure also excluded people with epilepsy.</p> <p>As a preventive measure, the act wasn\u2019t terribly effective. History doesn\u2019t record how many epilepsy sufferers slipped through the net, but between 1903 and 1914 only 15 anarchists were denied entry to the US. The 1918 Immigration Act broadened the definition of anarchism with the hope of deporting more foreign troublemakers, but by then the idea of blaming anarchists for everything that was wrong with America was beginning to seem a little old hat.</p> <p>Communism was the fashionable ideology of exclusion by the time the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act was introduced to protect the American way of life from evil forces such as Doris Lessing, who was refused a visa after she joined the Communist party. McCarran-Walter, cited in a Trump press release footnote as a cold war precedent for exactly the kind of thing he\u2019s talking about, also prevented homosexuals from entering the US, a restriction that wasn\u2019t officially scrapped until 1990.</p> <p>Times have certainly changed \u2013 Trump specifically mentioned radical Islam\u2019s \u201coppression of gays\u201d to illustrate the need for extreme vetting \u2013 but if tolerance of alternative lifestyles is part of his proposed entrance exam, one wonders how many of his own supporters would pass the test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dd0ed1c923c8ac1c1cd437eaab70a706dd8255f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dd0ed1c923c8ac1c1cd437eaab70a706dd8255f/0_573_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sacotherapy retreat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018According to a new study, mindfulness is no more calming than lying around watching old TV documentaries.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fortune favours the inert</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Over many years certain benefits have accrued to me simply by virtue of my doing nothing.

Half took an online mindfulness course, and half watched re-runs of the BBC series Ancient Worlds. There were no significant differences between the two sets in sleeping, eating habits, smoking reduction or biochemical stress response.</p> <p>The study leaders cautioned against reading too much into the findings, not least because 28 of the participants \u2013 including a quarter of the mindfulness group \u2013 quit before the test was concluded.

  "<p>Who doesn\u2019t love the idea of a picnic? Now that I am a grown up with a proper job and council tax bills, I like to imagine my summers filled with healthy adult activities: civilised lunch spreads in the park with hampers and blankets, chilled drinks and good food. A recent reunion with old mates laid this fond image to waste. Our evening started with the best of intentions: preparations made for the following day\u2019s outing: the focaccia was baked, the vegetable skewers good to go. The drinks started flowing. I woke up at some point around lunchtime the following day, my head splitting, mouth dry and stomach rolling. For most of my 20s, I didn\u2019t get hangovers. How things have changed. My day was spent shuffling between the kitchen (for water) and bed, those picnic plans in tatters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"02b63f2c9798e334ce79e7d9a3e8ee1f12baf878\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02b63f2c9798e334ce79e7d9a3e8ee1f12baf878/451_763_1930_2412/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rural idyll: the traditional British picnic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rural idyll: the traditional British picnic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niels van Gijn/Getty Images/AWL Images RM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British summer being what it is, I probably only have a handful of chances left for that idyllic picnic before the autumn damp sets in. This time I will be a bit more wary of alcohol before packing my hamper. For picnic food, I tend to avoid meat. With the freedom to nibble over the course of an afternoon rather than eating everything in one go, food can end up out in the sun for a few hours. A coolbox can help keep things fresh to a degree, but I would rather avoid dealing with anxieties over potentially spoiled meat. That tarragon-infused roast chicken might have seemed irresistible when it was fresh from the oven, but after a few hours gently fermenting in the afternoon sunshine, it won\u2019t be quite as appealing. It\u2019s easier to stick with all the delicious fruit and veg that is around now.</p> <p>As a regular meat eater \u2013 albeit one who is trying to cut down \u2013 I try to cook vegetarian food that works as a decent substitute to all of that protein and fills me up. Aubergines have been a godsend. As a child I couldn\u2019t stand their slimy, greasy texture when fried but now I love them grilled or roasted. In a simple salad with bulgur wheat and peppers they make the perfect accompaniment to my filo, halloumi and kale mini pies. And to wash it all down there is nothing more refreshing than an icy glass of watermelon strawberry smoothie. If only I\u2019d had a glass for that hangover, maybe I would have made it to the park.</p> <h2><strong>Halloumi and kale pies</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d30429e67b08ad752659e090c3f3f2d59d9a7161\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30429e67b08ad752659e090c3f3f2d59d9a7161/0_10_5632_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parcelled up: Tamal Ray\u2019s halloumi and kale pies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parcelled up: Tamal Ray\u2019s halloumi and kale pies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><em>(Makes 12)</em></strong></p> <p><strong>175g kale, washed, chopped, stems discarded<br></strong><strong>250g halloumi<br></strong><strong>2 handfuls of rocket, finely chopped<br></strong><strong>1 tsp ground black pepper<br></strong><strong>1 tsp kashmiri chili powder<br></strong><strong>1 large onion, diced<br></strong><strong>2 cloves garlic, crushed<br></strong><strong>2 tbsp vegetable oil<br></strong><strong>2 large eggs<br></strong><strong>4 heaped tbsp Greek-style natural yoghurt<br></strong><strong>2 tbsp tahini<br></strong><strong>Juice of half a lemon<br></strong><strong>50g butter<br></strong><strong>1 pack (12 sheets) of filo pastry</strong></p> <p>Steam the kale until softened (about five minutes) and then add it to the rocket.</p> <p>Slice the halloumi to just over 1cm-thick pieces and brown in a frying pan on a medium heat for a couple of minutes on each side.

  "<p>A quarter century after the end of the cold war, Donald Trump has proposed restoring ideological tests for immigrants, a move that legal experts say raises a tangle of practical and even constitutional concerns.<br></p> <p>In a speech on Monday devoid of policy details or specifics, the Republican nominee called for the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/15/donald-trump-immigration-test-isis-islamic-state-foreign-policy\">extreme vetting</a>\u201d of immigrants, including a screening process to root out applicants who do not uphold \u201cAmerican values\u201d. </p> <p>Laurence Tribe, a liberal constitutional law professor at Harvard University, said Trump\u2019s proposal was \u201ca nonstarter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposal ... is very deeply un-American, is probably unconstitutional, would almost certainly fail in Congress and is another example of Trump having no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Restricting immigrants on the basis of ideology is anathema to American values, Tribe argues. Freedom of speech and religion are enshrined under the first amendment of the constitution and the enduring symbol of freedom is the Statue of Liberty welcoming weary immigrants to its shores. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/donald-trumps-extreme-vetting-plan-immigration\">McCarthyism redux: the long view of Trump's immigration plan  | James Nevius</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though immigrants outside the US would not receive the constitutional right to due process, Tribe said family members could bring challenges on their relatives\u2019 behalves. </p> <p>Trump has long called for tightening immigration controls as part of his plan to defeat Islamic State. In 2015, Trump vowed<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration\"> to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US</a>. In his speech on Monday, Trump appeared to revise that policy, calling for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries subject to terrorist attacks, though the original blanket ban on Muslims is still featured on his website. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s proposal is not unprecedented. America has a long history of extreme vetting \u2013 which includes ideological tests \u2013 dating back to its foundation, when the leaders of the young nation worried anarchists would arrive and undermine the fledgling democracy.<br></p> <p>One of the earliest and most flagrant immigration laws was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred Chinese workers from entering the US. The ban, which was passed amid anxiety over job scarcity and a depressed economy, was later extended at the turn of the 20th century to in effect deny entry to all Asian immigrants. </p> <p>But Trump\u2019s proposal draws from more recent history \u2013 the anti-communism measures employed during the cold war.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the cold war, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,\u201d he said during a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio. \u201cI call it extreme vetting.\u201d</p> <p>In 1952, Congress passed the McCarran\u2013Walter Act, authorizing the federal government to refuse admission to classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs in an effort to keep members, former members and sympathizers of the communist party from entering the US. As the cold war came to a close, Congress revisited the law and in 1990 voted to greatly narrow the president\u2019s ability to deny immigrant visas based on ideological grounds.</p> <p> Trump has claimed, citing the act, that he would have the authority as president to suspend entry to any class of person who would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d. While the law grants the executive branch broad discretion over matters of immigration, the president would not have \u201cabsolute\u201d authority \u2013 Congress could act to limit the president\u2019s power.</p> <p>And yet if Trump managed to clear the initial hurdles and his proposal either passed Congress or survived the legal challenges experts say would surely arise, he would then have to contend with the operational difficulties of implementing such a sweeping proposal. </p> <p>\u201cIf he does try to implement an ideological test, that leads to a question which came up early in the cold war: how do you administer that? Is that a questionnaire? Do you investigate the answers? And if you do, how do you do that? Who does that?\u201d said Carl Bon Tempo, author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War. </p> <p>\u201cEnforcing an ideological litmus test takes an incredible amount of manpower and historically the result has been that it greatly slows the process.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, is skeptical of Trump\u2019s promise to enhance a process that is already extensive and lengthy. Immigrants applying to come to the US are already asked to respond to a questionnaire and are subject to a background check that vets for, among other things, links to terrorist or extremist groups.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018American\u2019 in his or her thinking?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cImmigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is a consular officer or a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018American\u2019 in his or her thinking?\u201d</p> <p>Based on Trump\u2019s speech on Monday, Yale-Loehr speculated that the Republican might propose screening applicants\u2019 social media pages as part of the routine background check. Currently, officials only run social media checks in certain cases. He could also add requirements that family members be brought in for interviews as part of the application process. But he said it would be impossible to implement these changes, since they would require a vast mobilization of resources and manpower. <br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign has said it would expand on his immigration proposals in the coming weeks, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. <br></p> <p>Still, experts say that on its surface, the proposal poses major logistical and practical problems that agencies grappled with during the cold war in the 1950s and, more recently, in the post-9/11 years. </p> <p>In vilifying the immigrant, Trump is using a familiar playbook from American history, said Erika Lee, a professor of immigration history at the University of Minnesota. Throughout history, politicians exploited public anxiety over a scarcity of jobs and threats to national security to push through exclusionary laws. <br></p> <p>\u201cFor many Americans, when they think back to America\u2019s history, it\u2019s the Ellis Island story. This is the way our mythology works,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut that has created some rose-colored glasses and helped to obscure the other side of the story, the one where we exclude whole groups of people based on race, ethnicity or ideological belief.\u201d</p>",

Smith said he was against fees but favoured a graduate tax as a way of funding universities.</p> <p>Corbyn said he was opposed to both, and said he would scrap fees and increase public funding of universities via higher corporation taxation.</p> <h2>Economy </h2> <p>Corbyn\u2019s spending plans were vaguer than Smith\u2019s but the debate saw the former work and pensions secretary acknowledge borrowing would increase and the deficit rise for his proposed \u00a3200bn infrastructure investment, using long-term loans. He also said tax changes would lead to increased revenue of \u00a313bn.</p> <p>Asked about his spending and borrowing plans, Corbyn cites his policies of the national investment bank and transport policies which he said would help grow the economy, as well as tax rises. But he was unable to say what extent of economic growth would be required to fully fund his proposals.</p> <p>Handing over now to my colleague Haroon Siddique who will take you through the political reaction into the afternoon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:54:03.646Z\">at 11.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b436e9e4b0178756b5d79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:06:18.250Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s been a lively debate but I think this \u2013 as close as Corbyn gets to an angry voice \u2013 is one of the best bits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jeremy Corbyn telling Owen Smith to be quiet is my new jam <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VictoriaLIVE?src=hash\">#VictoriaLIVE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw\">https://t.co/GCLCo4PnRw</a></p>&mdash; Adam Bienkov (@AdamBienkov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamBienkov/status/765851927682883584\">August 17, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:11:17.568Z\">at 11.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b434cce4b062ce4d224296\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:59:40.812Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The debate is over now and large swaths of the undecided section of the audience have moved over to support Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>One said it was Corbyn\u2019s commitment to community activism that persuaded him and another by his arguments on child mental health which he stated at the end of the programme.</p> <p>Another, remaining in the middle, says she is still genuinely unconvinced, and has decided she will abstain. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T10:01:03.758Z\">at 11.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b43429e4b062ce4d224291\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-17T09:56:20.600Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smith\u2019s comments on Islamic State are creating a bit of a stir on social media.

The number of migrant workers from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia topped 1 million for the first time.

He said: \u201cAhead of the referendum, speculation was that the economy would grind to a halt, hiring would stall, and investment plans would be put on ice. The first two haven\u2019t happened; we will find out next week whether the third came good. </p> <p>\u201cBut this does provide a glimmer of hope that if fears of the pre-Brexit jitters proved unfounded. Maybe the post-referendum doom and gloom may equally prove to have been overcooked.\u201d</p> <p>But several economists warned that cutbacks over recent months by firms to their investment plans and a freeze on new hiring by many employers were early indicators of a worsening employment picture over the next year, dampening annual pay rises.</p> <p>Scott Bowman, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe vote to leave the EU should cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether, resulting in the unemployment rate drifting up over the coming quarters. This should contain any further rises in earnings growth and keep domestic cost pressures in check.\u201d</p> <p>He said the Bank of England should be able to follow through with more monetary easing to support the economy, without worrying about stoking domestically generated inflation too much.</p> <p>The unemployment announcement comes hot on the heels of Tuesday\u2019s inflation update, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/first-post-brexit-data-shows-uk-inflation-rose-to-06-in-july\">the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to a higher than expected 0.6% in July</a>. CPI was up from 0.5% in June, according to the ONS, with economists expecting the figure to be unchanged. </p> <p>But while there was no sign of the plunge in the value of the pound having an impact on CPI, the ONS said the producer prices index (PPI) showed that sterling\u2019s slump had pushed up the cost of imports for British manufacturers, which could fuel inflation down the line. </p> <p>Input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a drop of 0.5% in the year to June, as the PPI was affected by the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of imported metals and chemicals. </p>",

The Guardian joined the mission vessel Baseline Explorer in its survey off the coast of Bermuda, where various corals, sponges and sea slugs have been hauled up from the deep.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time we look in the deep sea, we find a lot of new species,\u201d said Alex Rogers, an Oxford University biologist who has previously found a new species of lobster in the deep Indian Ocean and huge hydrothermal vents off Antarctica. </p> <p>In Bermuda, the scientists have found fossilised beaches \u2013 a remnant of the last ice age when sea levels were much lower \u2013 and large black coral forests that the locals were unaware of. \u201cThere are probably three or four new species of coral here, and some of the critters on the corals may be new too,\u201d Rogers said. </p> <p>Rogers is leading the scientific effort during a month-long survey of the three underwater volcanoes, known as seamounts, that lie near Bermuda \u2013 itself a volcano that pokes out of the north-west Atlantic. The Nekton mission, which will also include analysis of the deep sea off Nova Scotia, is recording indicators such as temperature, salinity, currents and discarded plastics.</p> <p>Mapping via sonar has also provided new data on previously unknown depths. Peer-reviewed research from the trips will be accelerated and available, it\u2019s hoped, by early next year. Nekton\u2019s next mission will be to explore the Mediterranean.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to a get a big-picture understanding because no one knows the state of the deep ocean,\u201d said Oliver Steeds, cofounder and mission director of Nekton. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a point where the most important part of the planet is the least known, which isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Steeds, a former journalist, said he was inspired by the \u201cYuri Gagarins of the deep sea\u201d \u2013 William Beebe and Otis Barton. During the early 1930s, the duo plunged into the depths in the \u201cBathysphere\u201d, essentially a hollow steel ball, after realising that submarines of the time were useless for viewing marine creatures. The bathysphere, lowered by steel cables from a ship, surveyed sites around Bermuda and descended beyond 3,000ft.</p> <p>The Nekton mission is a far cry from this. The Guardian squeezed into an extremely cosy <a href=\"http://www.tritonsubs.com/products-services/all-subs/t10002/\">two-person Triton submersible</a> lowered from the Baseline Explorer to survey the sloping face of a Bermuda seamount. The 2.5-tonne Triton vessel, comprised of a tough goldfish-bowl-like pod with ballast and thrusters that control movement, is a nimble craft initially aimed at wealthy super-yacht owners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">Coral bleaching event now biggest in history \u2013 and about to get worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dragooned into the service of science, two Triton vessels \u2013 the Nemo and the Nomad \u2013 have been taking multiple dives down to 300m to assess this patch of the Atlantic. A mechanical grabbing arm picks up samples of sponge and coral, with tubes capturing water samples.</p> <p>The light blue of the surface turns a more navy hue as we descend further, with the sun becoming hazy as if it were obscured on a very smoggy day. The warmth disappears and the light fades the further you go \u2013 by 4,000m the temperature is a little above freezing and all is dark around. </p> <p>At 150m, however, it\u2019s still possible to see the enormous walls of the Bermuda volcano, formed more than 30m years ago and, even at this depth, dotted with life. Curly whip coral is strewn across the moon-like surface. Small fish flit across the surface. Depressingly, several lion fish, a voracious invasive species that has spread from Florida, can be seen. </p> <p>The experience is much like exploring another planet in a slightly claustrophobic air bubble. And given our lack of knowledge about the deep sea, the otherworldliness felt particularly apt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44b04090f72ce599be3b3ec734c468de235d0b20/0_122_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier reef, Australia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Conlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The state of the deep sea has been somewhat overshadowed by alarm at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/21/coral-bleaching-event-now-biggest-in-history-and-about-to-get-worse\">vast coral bleaching event</a>, which has decimated shallow water corals on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\">Great Barrier Reef</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/el-ni%C3%B1o-revs-coral-bleaching-threat-caribbean\">Caribbean</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/01/coral-bleaching-spreads-to-maldives-devastating-spectacular-reefs\">Maldives</a>.

While coral bleaching isn\u2019t an issue for deeper corals, the excess heat being sucked up by the ocean, as well as its increasing acidity, is altering the deep sea before we even know what we are changing.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is a significant problem because it affects the means of primary food production, so there is less food going to deep water,\u201d said Rogers. </p> <p>\u201cYou also start getting more zones without oxygen. This is a worry because the deep sea carries out important ecosystem services for us, such as food production, carbon sequestration, moderating the temperature of the planet and the gases around us. They do a number of critical things that are more or less invisible to the average person on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists are still thrashing out a theory about how coral, the building block for 25% of all marine life on the planet, is replenished. If, as thought, deep sea corals help spawn replacements for shallow water corals that bleach and die, then any deterioration of these hidden creatures could trigger even steeper declines than expected as bleaching events become more common. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/02/environment-climate-change-records-broken-international-report\">Environmental records shattered as climate change 'plays out before us'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Working this out will require ambitious scientific enquiry, something that has been sparse since the financial crash of 2008.

  "<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/octopuses-squid-cuttlefish-warming-oceans-climate-change\">apparent rise in the numbers of some cephalopod species</a> and perhaps with a disdain for human governance systems, many people are expressing their enthusiasm for <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-insect-overlords\">welcoming our new cephalopod overlords</a>. If we are to toil under our new suckered rulers, it may be prudent to examine where they came from, especially the octopuses who will likely make up the ruling class in the new mantled hierarchy. </p> <p>Living cephalopods include roughly 1000 species of octopuses, cuttlefish, nautiluses and various distinct groups of \u201csquid\u201d; ram\u2019s horn squid, bobtail squid, bottletail squid, teuthidian squid and the not-even-a-squid vampire squid. </p> <p>Cephalopods are molluscs, and weird ones at that when compared to the other mollusc groups: chitons, solenogastres, caudofoveatans, bivalves, scaphopods, gastropods and monoplacophorans. With the exception of nautiluses, living cephalopods lack an external shell. They are free-living active hunters, possess a well-developed brain and nervous system in addition to a famed reputation for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/26/paul-octopus-predict-own-death\">predicting the outcome of sporting events</a>. Their intelligence has earned them a level of protection under <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://cephalove.southernfriedscience.com/?p=626\">EU law as \u201chonorary vertebrates\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Just as cephalopods are weird molluscs, octopuses are likewise weird cephalopods. With the exception of the beak, small rod-like shells in some species and a toothed radula, they lack hard parts like the cuttlebone and guard found in cuttlefish and squid respectively. Despite what popular culture may have you believe, octopuses do not have tentacles (tentacles are appendages in addition to the eight arms that only have suckers at the tips). Their bodies are gelatinous and are famously versatile, allowing them to change in colour, texture and overall shape, making identification of living octopuses from morphology alone very difficult.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/jan/29/the-secret-colourful-and-dramatic-lives-of-octopuses-uncovered-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4g8kk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2447084\"            data-video-name=\"The secret, colourful and dramatic lives of octopuses uncovered \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Peter Godfrey-Smith\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56aaac2ee4b02808d5f289fe\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/29/1454025759937/KP_1534294_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/29/160129octopus_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/01/29/160129octopus_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/01/29/160129octopus.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/01/29/160129octopus_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/01/29/160129octopus_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>A small demonstration of how quickly octopuses can change shape, size and colour in the gloomy octopus <em>Octopus tetricus</em>. Source: Peter Godfrey-Smith</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So where did octopuses come from? How do they fit in with the rest of the cephalopods?</p> <p>Cephalopods have a long fossil record, the earliest certain cephalopod fossils are loosely coiled or straight shelled nautiloids found in the Cambrian of China 515 million years ago. It is hypothesised that all other cephalopods diverged from these ancestors. Nautilidan cephalopods, represented today by the six living species of nautilus are thought to have diverged from other nautiloids in the Devonian period. Around the same time as this split, geologically speaking, the straight-shelled cephalopods <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactritida\">Bactritida </a>diverged. Bactritidans are thought to be the ancestors of the ammonites, goniatites, ceratites, belemnites and all of today\u2019s major groups.</p> <p>Surprisingly, however, the palaeontology textbooks are silent when it comes to the appearance and evolution of the octopuses. My undergraduate text book, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution by E.N.K Clarkson, only mentions octopuses in passing. <em>The</em> work on invertebrate palaeontology, the 50 volume series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Invertebrate_Paleontology\">Treatise on Invertebrate Palaeontology</a> <em> </em>started in 1953, still doesn\u2019t have a complete octopus section. This is because fossils of soft-bodied octopuses are incredibly rare. So rare are octopus fossils that one of the few people to write an accessible history of fossil octopuses, Phil Eyden, suggested in 2004 that the entire fossil record of octopuses would fit inside a suitcase. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In almost three hundred million years of octopod existence ... our entire record would fit inside a suitcase!</p> <footer> <cite>Phil Eyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The oldest fossil octopus at 300 million years old is <em>Pohlsepia mazonensis </em>from Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois. Frustratingly, the only known specimen resembles modern octopuses with the exception of possessing eight arms and two tentacles (Kluessendorf and Doyle 2000). Until the discovery of this specimen, the oldest octopus fossils were from the Jurassic period. The discovery of a much older octopus with many features of modern octopuses indicates that they have an even longer history, albeit one that is fossil poor.</p> <p>From this isolated data point, the presence of tentacles in this specimen could mean that this was the ancestral state of the group (all octopuses derived from ancestors with tentacles). Alternatively, tentacles were lost or evolved multiple times in the group. </p> <p>The second oldest species is <em>Proteroctopus ribeti </em>a single specimen from the Jurassic of France was published in 1982. This specimen does not possess tentacles but does have clear fins leading to speculation that it may be related to deep sea species such as today\u2019s dumbo octopuses or alternatively, this is a member of the vampire squid group, Vampyromorphida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7392cccfb32a1033b217296aada240a36d98e79/0_312_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Living dumbo octopus Grimpoteuthis sp. with fins as the would be elephant ears.

These three species are differentiated by the position and shape of paired \u2018gladial vestiges\u2019 supposed to be vestigial remnants of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladius_(cephalopod)\">gladius</a> found in modern squids and which may have supported fins found in modern groups. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Fossil_Sites/Lebanese-Lagerstatt/Paleoctopus-newboldi/Paleoctopus.htm\"><em>Palaeoctopus newboldi</em></a><em> </em>from the same region in Lebanon was described in 1896, the first fossil octopus discovered, and slightly younger in geological age than the aforementioned Lebanese species. <em>Palaeoctopus </em><em>newboldi</em> is known from a number of specimens and was thought to be ancestral to modern octopuses until the 2009 Lebanese specimens showed there was already a diversity of octopus forms in the Cretaceous. A second species, <em>Palaeoctopus pelagicus</em> is known from a single gladius vestige from Mexico (Fuchs et al. 2008). </p> <p>Only one other genus of octopuses is known, two species of <em>Paleocirroteuthis </em>from the Upper Cretaceous of Canada and Japan have been described from fossil jaws alone (Tanabe et al. 2008). </p> <p>This material, alongside a few ambigious remains which defy classification and some tricky egg case trace fossils thought to made by extinct argonauts is the sum total of the palaeontological evidence of these groups. </p> <p>Returning to the original questions about where octopuses came from, this is one group where, to date, the fossil record raises more questions than it does provide answers. It\u2019s possible to dig through the (mostly freely accessible) entire literature in a day and be as informed as the experts. </p> <p>For groups of organisms like these, the lack of our knowledge about their evolutionary histories can be as interesting as what we do know about them from less than a suitcase full of fossils. At the borders of scientific knowledge, that\u2019s where the fun (educated) speculation has a part to play. Are octopuses distinct cephalopods or a weird kind of squid? What events in the past caused the extinction of most externally shelled cephalopods but lead to the modern diversity of squishier animals? Lastly, if we\u2019re not happy with life under the new cephalopod overlords, what tools might we use to bring them down? </p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Eyden, P. 2004 (2010) Fossil Octopuses. <em>The Octopus News Magazine Online</em> <a href=\"https://www.tonmo.com/pages/fossil-octopuses/\">https://www.tonmo.com/pages/fossil-octopuses/</a> Accessed 10/08/2016</p> <p>Fuchs, D., Bracchi, G. and Wies, R. 2009.

  "<p>In its prime, about four centuries before Columbus stumbled on to the western hemisphere, Cahokia was a prosperous pre-American city with a population similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_London\">London\u2019s</a>.<br></p> <p>Located in southern Illinois, eight miles from present-day St Louis, it was probably the <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/22737-cahokia.html\">largest North American city north of Mexico</a> at that time. It had been built by the Mississippians, a group of Native Americans who occupied much of the present-day south-eastern United States, from the Mississippi river to the shores of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Cahokia was a sophisticated and cosmopolitan city for its time. Yet its history is virtually unknown by most Americans and present-day Illinoisans. It is one of many stories that have been bypassed in favour of the shopworn narrative \u2013 reinforced in literature and a century of American cinema \u2013 of Native Americans as backward and primitive.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the world is still relating in terms of cowboys and Indians, and feathers and teepees,\u201d says Thomas Emerson, professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois. \u201cBut in AD1000, from the beginning, [a city is] laid on a specific plan. It doesn\u2019t grow into a plan, it <em>starts</em> as a plan. And they created the most massive earthen mound in North America. Where does that come from?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-12T12:55:59.html\" data-alt=\"Cahokia locator map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2016-08-12T12:55:59.html\">Cahokia locator map</a> </figure>  <p>Its mix of people made Cahokia like an early-day Manhattan, drawing residents from throughout the Mississippian-controlled region: the Natchez, the Pensacola, the Choctaw, the Ofo. Archaeologists conducting strontium tests on the teeth of buried remains have found a third of the population was \u201cnot from Cahokia, but somewhere else\u201d, according to Emerson, who is director of the <a href=\"https://isas.illinois.edu/\">Illinois State Archaeological Survey</a>. \u201cAnd that\u2019s throughout the entire sequence [of Cahokia\u2019s existence.]\u201d</p> <p>The Native Americans at Cahokia farmed, traded and hunted. They were also early urban planners, who used astronomical alignments to lay out a low-scale metropolis of 10-20,000 people, featuring a town centre with broad public plazas and key buildings set atop vast, hand-built earthen mounds. The largest of these mounds was 100 feet tall and covered 14 acres \u2013 and still exists today.</p> <p>But rather than developing, like London, into a modern metropolis, Cahokia is more like the fabled lost continent of Atlantis. Having become a major population centre around AD1050, by 1350 it was largely abandoned by its people \u2013 and no one is sure why. Neither war, disease, nor European conquest drove Cahokia\u2019s residents from their homes. Indeed, the first white man to reach these lands,<a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/de-soto-reaches-the-mississippi\"> Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto</a>, didn\u2019t do so until 1540.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2ea238ea5b347ed221dcf16d4a3b9c67f633d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2ea238ea5b347ed221dcf16d4a3b9c67f633d2d/0_0_4125_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people of Cahokia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"394\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrimage city: Cahokia is thought to have been dedicated to spiritual meetings and ceremonies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mound-building <a href=\"http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/pre/htmls/miss.html\">Mississippians</a> dominated a great portion of the eastern half of the present-day United States between 1000 and 1500. Many of their villages were established near trade routes or sources of water and food \u2013 but Cahokia was different.<br></p> <p>Though rich in timber, deer and fish from the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, the land was flood-prone \u2013 so why build there? According to Emerson, the most likely explanation is that Cahokia was planned and constructed to double as a \u201cpilgrimage city\u201d, where all Mississippians could gather for religious events.</p> <p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve been a good area to explore but not so good to live in,\u201d Emerson says. \u201cBut then something changed around AD1000, and it becomes this major centre. Most of the change has nothing to do with the economy, but what we broadly call religion.\u201d</p> <p>Not unlike postwar America suburbs such as <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/cities/2015/apr/28/levittown-america-prototypical-suburb-history-cities\">Levittown, Pennsylvania </a>or Park Forest, Illinois, the Mississippians planned and built Cahokia \u2013 having successfully predicted that a population would flock to it. They created a city that was between six and nine square miles in area, with 120 earthen mounds inside its rough borders. The mound-building would have been backbreaking work, with the Mississippians digging up, hauling and stacking 55 million cubic feet over the course of a few decades, using no more than woven baskets to transport all that earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ceb25fb72b2779ddfa0fc02fefe14a0f9b8714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ceb25fb72b2779ddfa0fc02fefe14a0f9b8714/0_189_2832_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arrowheads and other ancient Mississippian artefacts found at Cahokia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arrowheads and other ancient Mississippian artefacts found at Cahokia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cahokia\u2019s largest mound (later called Monk\u2019s Mound, after the French Trappists who tended to its terraced gardens in the 1800s) was the site of a sizeable building in which Cahokia\u2019s political and spiritual leaders met, according to archaeologists. Surrounded by a wooden palisade almost two miles in circumference, the town centre was where residents, pilgrims and leaders worshipped and held ceremonies.</p> <p>Most of the Mississippians lived on the other side of the palisade in rectangular, single-room homes about 15 ft long and 12 ft wide, with wooden-post walls covered with mats and a thatched roof. Far from being a collection of villages or campsites, the homes were linked by courtyards and pathways, forming shared physical connections not unlike contemporary streets. The habitants even plotted an east-west road that is essentially the route from the area to St Louis today.</p> <h2>\u2018Its decline is a mystery\u2019</h2> <p>During its prime, Cahokia would have bustled with activity. Men hunted, grew and stored corn, and cleared trees for construction. Women tended to the fields and homes, made pottery, wove mats and fabrics, often performing work and social activity in the small courtyards and gardens outside each grouping of homes.</p> <p>Sacred meetings and ceremonies \u2013 the city\u2019s purpose \u2013 took place on the plazas and in buildings inside the palisade. \u201cThere was a belief that what went on on Earth also went on in the spirit world, and vice versa,\u201d says James Brown, a professor emeritus of archaeology at Northwestern University. \u201cSo once you went inside these sacred protocols, everything had to be very precise.\u201d</p> <p>The Mississippians oriented Cahokia\u2019s centre in a true east-west fashion, using site lines and the positions of the sun, moon and stars to determine direction accurately. West of Monk\u2019s Mound, a circle of tall posts used the position of the rising sun to mark the summer and winter solstices and the spring and fall equinoxes. The posts were re-erected and dubbed <a href=\"http://scienceviews.com/indian/woodhenge.html\">Woodhenge</a> by archaeologists who began researching the area in 1961.</p> <p>Excavations since the 60s have yielded fascinating information about this ancient city. Scholars have found artistic stone and ceramic figurines; Brown was part of team that discovered a small copper workshop adjacent to the base of one of the mounds. \u201cInside was a fireplace with coals, where copper could be pounded out and annealed,\u201d he says. \u201cThey pounded it out, heated it to allow the crystals in the cooper to realign, and when they quenched this in water, you\u2019d have something that resembled an ornament, a bead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb4866fb6ebe05cc52ed99ec66531e25cbaf199b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4866fb6ebe05cc52ed99ec66531e25cbaf199b/0_351_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of Cahokia city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cahokia site covered an area of nine square miles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Archaeological work has also discovered a mound containing mass burials. While the extent of it is debated, it appears the Mississippians may have conducted ritual human sacrifices, judging by what appears to be hundreds of people, mostly young women, buried in these mass graves. Some were likely strangled; others possibly died of bloodletting. Four men were found with their heads and hands cut off; another burial pit had mostly males who had been clubbed to death.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Apparently what happened in Cahokia left a bad taste in people\u2019s minds</p> <footer> <cite>Thomas Emerson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The people of Cahokia themselves may have both doled out and received a lot of this violence, since researchers have found no specific evidence of warfare or invasion from outsiders. Emerson says he has excavated other Native American sites that were filled with arrowheads left behind by war; by comparison, at Cahokia there were almost none. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt Cahokia the danger is from the people on top; not other people [from other tribes or locations] attacking you.\u201d</p> <p>But William Iseminger, archaeologist and assistant manager at <a href=\"http://cahokiamounds.org/\">Cahokia Mounds</a>, points out there must have been some continuing threat to the city, whether from local or distant sources, that necessitated it being built and rebuilt four times between 1175 and 1275. \u201cPerhaps they never were attacked, but the threat was there and the leaders felt the need to expend a tremendous amount of time, labour and material to protect the central ceremonial precinct.\u201d</p> <p>The story of Cahokia\u2019s decline and eventual end is a mystery. After reaching its population height in about 1100, the population shrinks and then vanishes by 1350. Perhaps they had exhausted the land\u2019s resources, as some scholars theorise, or were the victims of political and social unrest, climate change, or extended droughts. Whatever, the Mississippians simply walked away and Cahokia gradually was abandoned.</p> <p>Tales of Cahokia don\u2019t even show up in Native American folklore and oral histories, Emerson says. \u201cApparently what happened in Cahokia left a bad taste in people\u2019s minds.\u201d The earth and the mounds provide the only narrative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/18/great-zimbabwe-medieval-lost-city-racism-ruins-plundering\">Lost cities #9: racism and ruins \u2013 the plundering of Great Zimbabwe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As archaeological studies here continue, Monk\u2019s Mound is now the centrepiece of the 3.5 square-mile <a href=\"http://cahokiamounds.org/\">Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site</a> (a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1982), which includes 2,200 acres of land, 72 surviving mounds, and a museum.

Despite this recent rise the rate of violent crime <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/dueling-claims-on-crime-trend/\">has in fact declined to historic lows</a> under the Obama administration.</p> <p>The Republican, who had earlier spent time meeting privately with law enforcement leaders in Milwaukee, proposed introducing more police into communities, appointing \u201cthe best\u201d prosecutors and judges and pursuing \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of federal laws.</p> <p>This combative approach, nakedly opposed to the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as Clinton herself, is perhaps unlikely to draw many more black supporters. The protest movement, which rose to prominence after unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, enjoys 65% support among African Americans, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/08/how-americans-view-the-black-lives-matter-movement/\">according to recent polling</a>; while a survey published in 2015 indicated that Americans\u2019 support for police <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183704/confidence-police-lowest-years.aspx\">was at a 22-year low</a> and especially weakened among the African American population.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s appeals to African American voters received a lukewarm response inside the Washington County Fair Conference Center on Tuesday evening. Many attendees stayed silent throughout much of speech, with some growing visibly bored. The confederate battle flag, to many a lasting symbol of America\u2019s slave-owning history, was on sale outside of the rally.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to a dozen rally attendees, all of whom were white, and all of whom lived within a 40-mile radius of the unrest in Milwaukee. Most expressed little if any sympathy for black residents of the city, one of America\u2019s most racially segregated metropolitan areas.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they (black people) are in that city,\u201d said Ken Schladweiler, a 61-year-old from the small rural town of Neosho. \u201cAll of that (unrest connected to Smith\u2019s death) was just a case so they could riot, loot buildings. They have no jobs. They\u2019re all on welfare. There are murders down there almost every night. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d</p> <p>His wife, Nancie, 62, agreed: \u201cAfter all this crap (unrest) happened, I went to work Monday and thought: don\u2019t they (black people) have work? They\u2019re just out there shooting people, blowing up buildings. Don\u2019t they have work?\u201d</p> <p>Julie Wanie, a 50-year-old healthcare professional who works in Milwaukee, said she simply didn\u2019t visit the Sherman Park neighborhood at all.</p> <p>\u201cI know it quite well. I know it enough to stay out of that area. Anybody that lives around here and goes to Milwaukee just knows that\u2019s a certain area you stay out of.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what she thought may have contributed to the rising tensions in the neighbourhood, Wanie replied: \u201cI think Obama has done a lot to incite race wars.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier interview with Fox News, Trump had indicated he believed the shooting of Smith on Saturday was a justified response by law enforcement despite no body camera footage of the incident being released.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 The gun was pointed at his (a police officer\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\u2019s what the narrative is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\u2019t be rioting.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump\u2019s hardline law and order stance enjoys support among certain sectors of conservative law enforcement, he has also been criticised by a growing number of progressive reformists.</p> <p>Just hours before Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, Ronal Serpas, the former New Orleans police chief and chairman of Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, issued a pre-emptive statement urging the Republican candidate to drop unfounded claims of a surge in crime.</p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever it\u2019s important to have level-headed conversations about crime and the vital relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Mr Trump\u2019s recent claims that our country is experiencing a crime wave are highly misleading,\u201d Serpas said.</p>",

They reported systemic physical and sexual abuses, humiliating treatment and harsh conditions, and widespread self-harm and suicide attempts.</p> <p>The incident reports in the Nauru files are written and filed not by asylum seekers or refugees but by people employed to work in the detention centre. The files show incident reports written by case workers, child protection specialists, guards and medical staff.<br></p> <p>Some of the more than 2000 incident reports in the files are complaints or allegations of improper or illegal behaviour. However, there are also firsthand reports of sexual or physical assaults, fights, problems with food, water or sanitation, acts of self-harm or suicide attempts witnessed by workers at the centre. Many have been corroborated by independent reporting, pictures and medical evidence.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve done our best to handle all the problems and I think the main thing is to process the asylum seekers,\u201d Waqa said.</p> <p>Waqa said despite foreign criticism and opposition to offshore processing, \u201cthe regional processing centre is a program that\u2019s been going on for quite some time and it\u2019s been going very very well\u201d.</p> <p>Waqa, recently re-elected as president to a second three-year term, said regional co-operation was needed to address the issue of irregular migration and that Australia\u2019s policy of offshore processing had been effective in stopping boat journeys.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to work together, everyone needs to try and address this problem with asylum seekers. It\u2019s a huge problem in Europe and elsewhere. We know that it will continue to escalate in Europe but we are more fortunate in this part of our world.

Or, even more unthinkably, whip gold out of the clutches of Simone Biles? Performing to the strains of Nessun Dorma\u2019s a good idea from where I\u2019m sitting. I\u2019d give her gold for that alone. The judges might not be so smitten, but it was a very experienced performance from a gymnast who\u2019s desperate to end her wait for an Olympic medal at the age of 25. It\u2019s going to be close. 14.933 is what she needs to beat to get bronze. And she\u2019s not done enough! She finishes with a score of 14.766! All of which means that Simone Biles is the Olympic champion in the floor exercise and it\u2019s an American one-two, with Aly Raisman in second. And how about Team GB\u2019s Amy Tinkler, the youngest British athlete in Rio? The 16-year-old\u2019s won a very impressive bronze medal with a score of 14.933! And she\u2019s the youngest British Olympic medalist in 32 years.

The consensus among other riders in the race who commented on the matter seemed to be that it was just one of those things that can happen in the pell-mell of race-riding, but I notice that Cavendish has been getting no end of abuse in the comments section under my report on the event and elsewhere from readers who clearly know far more about track cycling than the world\u2019s best track cyclists. <br></p> <p>Cavendish exchanged angry words with one Dutch journalist last night, who asked him if he thought he should have been disqualified from the race. The newsman in question claimed that Cavendish was getting an easy ride from British journalists who hadn\u2019t brought up the matter. They did bring up the matter, at which point the cyclist admitted the crash was entirely down to him and wished the stricken Park well.\u201d <br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/mark-cavendish-silver-rio-olympics-cycling-omnium?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Read Baz\u2019s report from last night here</a>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:20:08.726Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b32e35e4b0c23bfed8a0b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:16:56.725Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Qualification for the women\u2019s pole vault final is over - 4.60was the highest jump, and one of those who managed it was Holly Bradshaw of GB. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b32d19e4b062ce4d223ea4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T15:12:17.381Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ilia Zakharov, the defending champion, is out of the springboard diving.

It\u2019s not just sportspeople doing really well, such as with Van Niekerk, as that wasn\u2019t expected. It\u2019s the knowledge in advance that if you watch Biles you know basically all you need to for (all) gymnastics. Ditto Bolt and short distance running, Phelps and Ledecky for anything water. Farrah, and (not that I\u2019ve seen it) Rudisha too I guess.

We know that she is a specialist in the long, sustained, streamlined effort of the pursuit (having already won gold in the team pursuit); and sure enough she came first out of the 18 riders in that leg of the Omnium. She also won the elimination race, a sustained effort ramping up every two laps for a sprint. AND, she won the bunch sprint at the end of the points race to take second place (behind a rider who had already taken a lap over the field). Which other athletes, in any sport, consistently come out on top in disciplines with such different demands?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, agreed - I was lucky enough to be on the blog for that, and these ease with which she destroyed the field in that elimination race was awesome and bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62125afefe4d5bc6452746e1f7d73e0117ac3b0a/712_653_4480_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Trott: imperious in the omnium so far.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s tricky to find a similar kind of all-rounder because not much demands as much as the omnium.

Tunisian Oussama Mellouli won in the Serpentine last time around. This time, it\u2019s at the Copa, Copa Copacobana. American Jordan Wilimovsky is the one the smart people fancy. </li> <li>Wrestling! Greco Roman Wrestling. More on that in a tic with a nice little explainer for you. Flick between the velodrome and this to catch the men\u2019s 98kg div medal rounds. Armenian Artur Aleksanyan picked up bronze in London and has a couple of world champs since then. Iranian veteran Ghasem Rezaei won in London and he\u2019s there too.

The sun is through in Rio, twitter suggests. Good signs. </p> <p>Roger Kirby has some perspective on the whole topic: </p> <p>\u201cYou ask us to tell you about watching these games on tv but what about Olympics pre Internet? Depending on time zone you might have had to wait 2 days to find out results of certain events not covered on tv by buying a newspaper, your only reference was the Guinness book of records and apart from the big events, you only saw the event once, if you missed it, you had missed it forever. The difference is so vast, how far we have come in 20 years is truly amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Poses an interesting question about how we gather to watch events. Is it a more meaningful experience going through it together in places like this and social media? Or are we missing a trick by not having to be somewhere at a certain time to emphasise the importance of what we\u2019re tuning in for? Take that as a comment, like I said, forward looking from now. </p> <p>Oh, and Polly - a Londoner in Australia - says nice things about the blog like \u201cvery funny\u201d and \u201chighly informative\u201d (presumably in reference to Claire) before thinking about having a crack at the Australian TV but holding back.

Quite interesting, to those (like me, to be fair) who follow the sport once an Olympiad. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mistake that Armour and many others have made is assuming that men\u2019s and women\u2019s gymnastics are directly comparable, when they\u2019re barely the same sport. The men compete in six events, the women in four. There is only direct overlap on two apparatuses \u2013 the vault and the floor exercise \u2013 though in the latter, the women have dance requirements in addition to the tumbling. The uneven bars is similar to the high bar though not exactly the same, and the women don\u2019t perform on any apparatuses like the pommel horse or rings.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/16/mens-womens-gymnastics-comparison-olympics\">Comparing men's and women's gymnastics is futile: they're barely the same sport</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b2e447e4b0c23bfed89f43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-16T10:12:35.627Z\">11.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fair bit of feedback</strong> below the line on where GB might medal (it\u2019s a verb now, I know, I hate it too) by week\u2019s end.

A special moment from the stadium, documented for us by Sean Ingle. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was the night before the Olympic 800m final, and the world\u2019s greatest middle distance runner had a message for his nation. After three years of frustration and only occasional elation following keyhole surgery on a serious knee injury, that old unmistakable tingle had returned. And he was ready to show it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And some lovely words on this topic from reader Tom Cameron</strong> about the lot in life of the 800 metre runner:</p> <p>\u201cIs the 800m the most gut wrenching of the track events? It surely is. I can recall meeting a nice fella who was the Australian 800 meter champion back circa 1996. He was the strapping boyfriend of a mate\u2019s sister who I rowed first crew with back at Ballarat Grammar - so it goes. Anyway I\u2019ve long forgotten his name but I remember him telling me success in the 800 meters is really about \u201cthe deep dig\u201d because it\u2019s quite simply just flat out, all the way round, two laps. The 800 is rare in that sense isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s all turbo but you have to reach right down into the bowels of human fortitude to find it, especially in that second lap. Hope that now middle ageing champion is doing well anyway, and watching Rio in happy comfort.

This is precisely what I\u2019m talking about. </p> <p>Here\u2019s his (edited!) story:</p> <p>\u201cUp until 2012, the BBC was the only place I had ever watched the Olympics. I watched the London Olympics on TV in the USA and it has to be my single most disappointing sports viewing experience ever. Now I live in France and I have to say that I am rather taken by the way the French cover the Olympics on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Wall to wall coverage from getting up to going to bed, one never has to be without the Olympics. I have watched events I never even knew existed - the 25m rapid fire pistol final was gripping. And ones that I did, fencing, but had never watched - who knew you could do it as a team. </p> <p>And don\u2019t let anyone ever tell you that the French hate the British. They may call the athletes competing \u201cl\u2019anglais\u201d most of the time (although they did call Andy Murray \u201cl\u2019escosse\u201d) but they seemed to be genuinely happy when a British competitor wins, especially in the cycling, really caring about how \u201cle Cav\u201d was doing. They have seemed to be happy when Murray won the tennis, Rose won the Golf and Sir Bradley Wiggins (as they insist on calling him) won his gold. And we got a bi-lingiual interview with Mo Farrah after his win on Sunday morning, which he rather sweetly ended in French.</p> <p>Right, I\u2019m off to see how they have reacted to winning silver in the Mens Pole Vault and see what todays Brazilian \u201ccooking with the presenters\u201d recipe is (hey, its France).\u201d<br></p> <p>Where are you tuning in from? <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.freelance@theguardian.com\">Tell me</a> about your experience.

  "<p>I had the birds and the bees conversation with my daughter when she was around four years old. I told her that sex is an act that two consenting adults choose to do and I stressed that nobody should touch her body in any way that makes her uncomfortable. </p> <p>We have revisited this conversation over the years. I told her that her genitals are called a vagina, not fanny, nunnie, minnie or down there. I was sick and tired of the pervading belief that women and girls can\u2019t describe our body parts directly.<br></p> <p>Now nearly 10 years after that conversation (she\u2019s just turned 14) teenage hormones are in full swing, with eye rolling and tuning me out while listening to Rihanna. But I love the fact we have frank open conversations about most things and I truly treasure the times we don\u2019t agree. I love that she has her own views about the world.</p> <p>With that in mind, I want to share some thoughts about my work that made me think of my daughter and the pressure girls around the world face in relation to their sexuality.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/08/culpability-qandeel-baloch-death-pakistan\">Feminism is breaking through the rigid patriarchy in Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of my work with the <a href=\"http://www.manorgardenscentre.org/dahlia-support-fgm-survivors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dahlia Project</a>, a counselling service I founded for women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), I run sessions for refugee women where I talk about the cultures they grew up in. </p> <p>The discussion always leads to sex, and a recurring theme is virginity. Many of the women are educated and considered liberal in their way of thinking. They say their daughters are equal to their sons. However, they also say they want their daughters to remain virgins to protect them from harm and so that future husbands will respect them.</p> <p>What interests me about these conversations is that the women openly talked about being cheated on or beaten by their so-called respectful husbands. I nudged the women to reflect. \u201cDid remaining a virgin work for you?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid it prevent the violence and betrayal he had caused you?\u201d Many were baffled by my questions. By our second session some of the women were starting to realise that cultural patriarchy was alive and well in their homes, and they were complicit in committing the oppression they had endured against their own daughters. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly I only had two sessions with these women, and they left me questioning this universal obsession with virginity. I remember newspaper articles about Kate Middleton, being slut-shamed in newspaper articles for not being a virgin before marriage and rumour has it Diana had to prove her virginity before marrying Prince Charles. If a woman is sexually free or has multiple partners, society shames her and makes her feel bad about herself.</p> <p>While dating I\u2019ve been asked how many men I\u2019ve slept with. This idea of being judged based on the history of my vagina is absolutely ludicrous and another form of control of women\u2019s sexuality. My brother and all the men in my life are never asked such questions yet alone judged on them. Society high-fives men with multiple sexual partners. </p> <p>I had my first sexual experience at the age of 18 with my then husband (I\u2019m currently happily divorced). I didn\u2019t make the choice to stay a virgin. I did so for two reasons. Firstly, I wasn\u2019t the girl boys were lining up to date. I was a super nerd who didn\u2019t wear makeup or pluck her eyebrows. So, no temptation or struggle for me. Secondly, my mother told me sex was great and nothing to be ashamed about. As a teenager I wasn\u2019t keen to try something my mother enjoyed (remember that trick, parents). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/29/leyla-hussein-the-women-who-made-me\">Anti-FGM campaigner Leyla Hussein: the women who made me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remind my daughter that whenever the day comes that she wants to lose her virginity (why is it something you lose, like a precious possession?), it is no one\u2019s business but hers. If anyone tries to judge her based on her genitals, I tell her to just walk away. </p> <p>I tell her that our vaginas are very special and powerful, we bleed and give birth from them, and it\u2019s her right as a woman to enjoy sex one day. It\u2019s a beautiful and enjoyable act. Patriarchy tried to prevent me and over 200 million FGM survivors from living as sexual beings, but through therapy and a loving supportive partner many of these women can and are enjoying sex. There is hope. </p> <p>Dear world, women have sex and enjoy it, so get over the idea that virginity is something to protect. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

But that was a fantasy, unavailable in reality and hard to pitch to a mass audience.

She needs a broader agenda to discuss what we have to offer as a strategic partner to the European project. The UK\u2019s assets are denominated in power, hard and soft, from our capital city\u2019s role in global&#xa0;finance to our status as a nuclear-armed Nato member.</p> <p>But the pitch in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Warsaw must aspire to more than tariff elimination. It must include promises to engage with continental challenges: Isis-inspired terrorism, Russian territorial expansion, energy security.

That is the terrain on which the best deal is struck.</p> <p>Brussels-baiting Euroscepticism and the internal dynamics of the Tory party have for a generation set the terms of the debate about Britain\u2019s status as a European nation. Yet history, geography and global diplomacy dictate that we can be no other kind. A stark irony of the Brexit vote is that it demands of the prime minister a more thorough, ambitious and diligently applied vision of Britain\u2019s strategic relationship with the rest of the continent than has been possessed by any of her predecessors since Ted Heath. Leaving the EU will involve diplomacy as ardently and explicitly pro-European as that required for joining in the first place. In the intervening years we have spent a lot of energy arguing about what Europe means to Britain. It is time to consider what the rest of Europe might see in us.</p>",

In August of that year, the Norwegian freight ship Tampa rescued 438 asylum seekers on their way Australia. The government refused to allow the ship to dock, requesting it return them to Indonesia.<sup> </sup> </p> <p> Australia asked Nauru, a former protectorate, to accept the asylum seekers, triggering the \u201cPacific Solution\u201d. At the time, Nauru was not a signatory to the refugee convention. Under this policy, which lasted until 2008, asylum seekers bound for Australia were intercepted and detained on Nauru, or another Pacific country, Papua New Guinea, while their protection claims were processed.</p> <p> In 2012, Australia reopened detention centres in Nauru and on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island as a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d to stop relatively high number of asylum seekers arriving by boat and the accompanying deaths at sea. By this time, Nauru had signed the refugee convention.</p> <p> However, these offshore arrangements became permanent pillars of Australia\u2019s asylum policy, one based on deterring future asylum seekers through turning back boats and detention offshore. Under this policy, at least 28 boats have been turned back since 2013.</p> <p> When boats carrying asylum seekers cannot be turned back, Australia intercepts asylum seekers at sea and transfers them to Nauru and Papua New Guinea under bilateral agreements with both countries. Asylum seekers have been held in closed immigration detention for indefinite periods, though it is important to note that since October 2015 Nauru has operated as an open centre.</p> <h2><strong>Context to the Nauru files</strong></h2> <p> Even before the release of the Nauru files, significant evidence of human rights concerns had been reported in both offshore centres. Last year the UN Committee Against Torture reported conditions of \u201covercrowding, inadequate health care; and ill-treatment\u201d in Nauru and a report commissioned by the Australian government found evidence of sexual assault of asylum seekers in detention. Earlier this year, two refugees self-immolated in protest. In Papua New Guinea, there have been repeated demonstrations and rioting among the 900 all-male asylum seekers. In 2014, two staff at the detention centre <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/19/reza-barati-men-convicted-of-asylum-seekers-to-be-free-in-less-than-four-years\">murdered an asylum seeker</a> during one such protest.</p> <p> Secrecy is a large part of Australia\u2019s model. Operations that occur on the high seas or Australia\u2019s territorial waters are confidential. Nauru introduced a non-refundable visa fee for journalists of $8,000 dollars in 2014 and regularly refuses visa applications to foreign journalists. As a result, just two journalists have visited the detention centre in the past four years.</p> <p> Against this backdrop, the Nauru files can best be understood as another blow to the Australian offshore regime. The Australian government has repeatedly stated that while it will not tolerate abuse in detention, what occurs in Nauru is out of Australia\u2019s control.</p> <h2><strong>The beginning of the end?</strong></h2> <p> There are three factors that suggest Australia\u2019s offshore asylum model faces an existential threat: legal challenges; practical problems; and the question of responsibility. </p> <p>Firstly, the offshore regime is under legal pressure. As well as international criticism from UN human rights bodies, earlier this year the supreme court of Papua New Guinea found the detention of asylum seekers an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">unconstitutional violation of the right to liberty</a>. The court ordered both Australia and Papua New Guinea to \u201ctake all steps necessary to cease and prevent the continued unconstitutional and illegal detention.\u201d The Papua New Guinean government is currently working to find appropriate arrangements in accordance with this ruling. A second legal challenge to the Manus detention regime is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/08/asylum-seekers-manus-island-police-presence-stepped-up-as-second-challenge-heads-to-court\">currently underway</a>.</p> <p> Secondly, the current policy appears fundamentally unsustainable from a practical perspective. Neither Papua New Guinea nor Nauru can provide durable solutions to those asylum seekers found to be refugees. Under the bilateral agreements, refugees are in theory allowed to remain in these countries permanently. However, Papua New Guinea has already declared itself unable to resettle refugees on its territory. Those found to be refugees in Nauru are allowed to live in the community on five-year visas. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/australia-fails-the-same-lesson-every-time-the-nauru-files-show-how-secrecy-hides-abuse\">Australia fails the same lesson every time.

The deal has delivered little: just five people have been settled in Cambodia, of which four subsequently chose to return to their countries of origin. This leaves unanswered the question of what to with refugees left in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for years.</p> <p> Finally, the Nauru files highlight Australian responsibility for what happens offshore. Though the Australian the government denies jurisdiction over the detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, its indirect responsibility is increasingly clear. Australia instigated the opening of the centres, selected the contractors that run them, provide all funding, and choose who is transferred there. Hiding behind the sovereignty of another state is becoming increasingly untenable. </p> <p> These three factors, together with the realities portrayed in the Nauru files, should make it quite clear to European politicians that the \u201cAustralian Solution\u201d is no solution at all.</p> <p><em>Nikolas Feith Tan is a PhD fellow for the Danish Institute for Human Rights and advisor at the Danish Refugee Council.</em></p>",

Think of all the major policy discussions of the past few weeks: a banking royal commission; reports of abuse of asylum seekers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">Nauru</a>; the plebiscite on same sex marriage; repealing section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act; amending the constitution to recognise Indigenous people; and GST reform. Not one of these discussions is being proactively led by the Turnbull government.</p> <p>The only proactive steps the Turnbull government has taken since being returned to power is to mess up the census, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/census-2016-the-political-game-has-changed-and-coalition-failed-its-first-test\">to mess up the government\u2019s response</a> to the messing up of the census. Also, there was the messing up of the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/29/malcolm-turnbull-kevin-rudd-un-secretary-general-nomination\">not endorse</a> Kevin Rudd for UN secretary general (the process, not the outcome). And then there was the messing up of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/01/nt-juvenile-detention-brian-martin-stands-down-as-royal-commissioner\">appointing</a> a royal commissioner in the Northern Territory. Also, don\u2019t forget the messing up of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/12/ausgrid-electricity-sale-mike-baird-criticises-turnbull-for-last-minute-intervention\">Baird government\u2019s sale</a> of Ausgrid.</p> <p>You get my point. It\u2019s been messy.</p> <p>Has Turnbull gone into hiding? Is he sulking? Depressed? Is he working hard behind closed doors on a new economic narrative? Or, is he, like many of us, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm/status/764634301409341440\">just watching the Olympics</a> and planning to get serious about work again after the closing ceremony?</p> <p>One man offering a reassuring presence these days is Tony Abbott. Mind you, at this stage he\u2019s mainly reassuring his Liberal colleagues that he\u2019s still available, if needed, to lead. Abbott\u2019s <a href=\"http://tonyabbott.com.au/2016/08/transcript-of-the-hon-tony-abbott-mp-address-to-the-samuel-griffith-society-stamford-plaza-hotel-adelaide/\">speech</a> at the Samuel Griffith Society last week demonstrated key markers that he\u2019d have to display to make a comeback viable: self-reflection and a capacity to learn from mistakes; considered policy reflection and the beginning of an economic narrative; and an uncowering stance in the media glare.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As Karl Marx said, history repeats itself: first as tragedy, then as farce.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those who think it\u2019s inconceivable that Abbott could become prime minister again, may I remind you of Kevin Rudd? For those who say, yes, but Rudd was always popular with voters, and Abbott never was, I say, yes, but that\u2019s not the point. It isn\u2019t about whether Abbott was popular with voters back then, or is popular with them now: it is about whether Malcolm Turnbull can ever be popular again \u2013 with voters, or with his own colleagues.</p> <p>Ideally, a leader enjoys the support of caucus colleagues and the voters. Some, like Julia Gillard, get by with just the former. Others, like Kevin Rudd, seize office relying on the latter. Turnbull is losing in both groups, and without the support of the electorate or his party room, he can\u2019t survive.</p> <p>It\u2019s not difficult to imagine the pitch for Abbott 2.0 to disgruntled Liberal MPs: Tony won the election in 2013 convincingly, while Malcolm holds the slimmest of majorities. Tony never got his chance to contest as prime minister: that was stolen from him. Tony will campaign hard on border protection and union corruption. Tony would never have brought in these superannuation changes, and he will get rid of them. Yes, Tony made mistakes in the 2014 budget, but he tried to do a lot more for budget repair than just repeating \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. Tony\u2019s learned from the 2014 budget. Also, Tony stopped the boats. He repealed the carbon tax. Tony didn\u2019t waffle on about the most exciting time to be alive. Tony got stuff done.</p> <p>As Karl Marx said, history repeats itself: first as tragedy, then as farce.</p> <p>Rudd-Gillard-Rudd-Abbott-Turnbull-Abbott. It\u2019s a continuum of tragedy to farce.</p> <p>Marx made another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/18/karl-marx-men-make-history\">observation</a>, and frankly, I could not craft a more apt description of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s current predicament:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. </p> <p>And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honoured disguise and borrowed language.</p> </blockquote> <p>From the exciting overthrow of Tony Abbott last September to the limp across the electoral line last month, the Turnbull revolution has perfectly traversed this Marxian landscape. The \u201cadult conversations with the nation\u201d shrunk to three-word slogans. \u201cReclaiming the economic narrative\u201d collapsed into one idea: the hoary old chestnut of conservative economic policy, a business tax cut. The passion for marriage equality disappeared into a plebiscite.</p> <p>Turnbull can still make his own history, but only if he is willing to throw off the spirits of the past.</p> <p>Or, to put it less elegantly than Marx did, Malcolm needs to go for broke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/18c-wont-stop-mature-debate-on-race-but-small-mindedness-and-arrogance-might\">18C won\u2019t stop mature debate on race. But small mindedness and arrogance might | Dean Sherr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marriage equality and superannuation would be a good place to start. Turnbull needs to make a play for the electorate and stare down his party room: it\u2019s the only way to ensure his survival long-term. Going for broke \u2013 a real Turnbull revolution \u2013 carries the risk that, instead of succeeding, Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership dies fast. But at least Turnbull would die on his feet. At least he\u2019d make his own history.</p> <p>Otherwise, Malcolm\u2019s prime ministership is destined to die slowly. He can\u2019t go about wearing Tony Abbott\u2019s costumes, or using Tony Abbott\u2019s slogans. That approach nearly lost the 2016 election, and it only ends one way: perhaps it will take six months, a year, but eventually Turnbull\u2019s caucus colleagues will realise that if they are going to run an Abbott-esque government, they may as well resurrect Tony Abbott.</p> <p>For ever so long as Malcolm Turnbull stays missing from view, it seems likely that history will repeat itself. It\u2019s time for the PM to get back on the train, and get back to work.</p> <p>Otherwise, let the farce begin.</p>",

In 2011, Australia co-sponsored a UN Human Rights Council resolution that unanimously endorsed the UN g<a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">uiding principles</a> on business and human rights.</p> <p>The guiding principles represent the global standard for preventing and addressing the negative impacts of business on human rights. They provide a common global platform for action on corporate accountability. The principles require businesses to respect human rights and governments to protect individuals from corporate human rights abuses. </p> <p>Since 2011, the guiding principles have been widely adopted by both governments and businesses themselves, here and internationally. Their rapid and widespread uptake indicates a clear recognition that the corporate sector is, increasingly, expected to act responsibly. </p> <p>The development of business and human rights NAPs is a corresponding, UN-supported process. These policy statements are used by governments to translate the guiding principles into practice. In 2014, the Australian government supported a resolution of the UN Human Rights Council calling on countries to adopt<strong> </strong>NAPs as a vehicle for implementing the guiding principles.</p> <p>In backing these UN resolutions, the Australian government has voiced its support for international initiatives aimed at achieving greater corporate respect for human rights. </p> <p>Australia is also campaigning for a seat on the Human Rights Council \u2013 the powerhouse of the international human rights system \u2013 for its upcoming 2018-20 term.

It is time the government took concrete steps to hold itself to the standards that it claims to support and translate its rhetoric into reality.</p> <p>Despite co-sponsoring the original UN Human Rights Council resolution, in reality the Australian government has been slow to engage. It has yet to take steps integrating the principles into national law and policy. </p> <p>Unlike comparable global players, Australia remains without an implementation plan. Nearly forty such plans have either been launched or are under way in other countries around the world, including the UK, Germany and the US. </p> <p>This has created impetus for greater corporate responsibility in adopting countries. It has levelled the playing field for business by providing it with direction and guidance on how to respond to the guiding principles and incorporate them into business practices.</p> <p>While the Australian government has <a href=\"https://business-humanrights.org/en/australian-govt-announces-natl-consultation-on-business-human-rights\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced its intention</a> to hold public consultations in 2016 on implementing the guiding principles, it has yet to set dates for these talks.
