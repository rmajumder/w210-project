  "<p>Take back control, cried the Brexit campaigners, from the dark forces of the EU and open Britain up to a glorious future in which it can embrace the world. It was a seductive cry, but was a lie from top to bottom. The EU did not stop Britain\u2019s embrace of the world; instead, it was and is a crucial bridge to it. While Brexit campaigners\u2019 rhetoric may be of global openness, their actions betoken retreat. It is not from the left that we have to fear an Orwellian dystopia in which words are manipulated, never to mean what they purport to mean, but from rightwing Leavers.</p> <p>This is nowhere clearer than in the intense threat now facing British universities, one of the UK\u2019s great national and international assets. Universities, dedicated to learning, teaching and research, are indispensable building blocks of any civilisation. But they are also increasingly important economic institutions. A university in a 21st-century British city plays a similar role to a cathedral in a medieval city \u2013 as a magnet of economic and cultural activity. Universities are a source of employment, collaborators with companies and public agencies, and, by attracting so many young people, a mainspring of vitality and rich urban life. (Full declaration: I am principal of Hertford College, Oxford University.)</p> <p>For Brexiters and Ukippers, however, universities have a dark side. They involve themselves with \u2013 dread word \u2013 foreigners. Universities, in the right\u2019s universe, are anti-British fifth columnists. They will insist on welcoming students and researchers from the EU and the rest of the world, in part because they believe in the intellectual vitality that comes with having diverse student and research communities and in part because they need the cash. University tuition fees in 2013-14 totalled \u00a313.7bn. Because foreign students pay fees two or three times higher than the \u00a39,000 maximum set for English students, overseas students contribute more than a third of that total. On top, they spend on accommodation, leisure and sustenance. In every university town in Britain, they are a brilliant economic, social and cultural asset, indispensable to the viability and vitality of the university, while boosting local economies.</p> <p>Britain has been good at attracting international students because we have two priceless advantages. We have great universities and we teach courses and award degrees in our native tongue \u2013 English \u2013 which is now the lingua franca. Tens of thousands of Chinese students come to Britain every year not to settle here and steal British jobs, but because they want to learn to speak English and obtain the vital credential of a degree won in England \u2013 and then go home.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Home Office insists on counting foreign students as immigrants</a>. Part of the wide perception that immigration is out of control, from which Nigel Farage built his anti-EU case, is because of this statistical quirk. Thus, last year net migration totalled 336,000. But 169,000 of those were students (netting out incoming students from British students leaving to study abroad). Exclude them and suddenly the net migration total looks back in control \u2013 167,000. Toughen up the permit regime for non-EU migrants and David Cameron could have hit his target of net migration in the tens of thousands and Farage and co would have lost a crucial platform in their anti EU hyperbole.</p> <p>Home Office resistance to this statistical redefinition, led by Theresa May as home secretary and continuing now as prime minister, is because some students do stay in Britain after winning their degrees; on this view, higher education has become a backdoor means of avoiding immigration controls. Too few incoming students seem to be leaving, although nobody can know for certain whether this is true. EU students have the right to stay but they only constitute a quarter of all foreign students. Because Britain invests scant resources in policing its student visa regime, the only evidence on students\u2019 leaving is the hit-and-miss system of sampling travellers at British ports and airports. Of course there has been cheating and some bogus degree courses, but not an industrial scale and now largely closed down. I find it hard to believe that there is an army of up to half-a-million Asian ex-students in their mid to late 20s whose student visas have expired now working in Britain\u2019s black economy. But on that supposition the prime minister and Home Office refuse to budge. Students must count as immigrants and vital ammunition is given to xenophobes and Eurosceptics.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is concerned that for these dubious reasons universities are going to be required to cut their international student numbers dramatically with severe consequences for their viability, foreign exchange earnings and Britain\u2019s reputation for openness. He observed mildly 10 days ago that it would be good to test public opinion to see if public objections to foreign students were so ferocious as to justify the policy of counting them as immigrants. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/20/students-could-be-left-out-of-immigration-figures-ministers-hint\" title=\"\">Number 10 slapped him down</a>. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who, as London mayor, spoke out strongly in favour of international students, has gone mute as foreign secretary. He proclaims openness to the globe rather than Europe, but it is a conviction that does not involve risking his career and new reputation as Europhobe in chief. What he does is to enable closure.</p> <p>Britain cannot escape its history, its language or the opportunities and challenges afforded by globalisation. In our globalising times, <a href=\"http://institutions.ukcisa.org.uk//info-for-universities-colleges--schools/policy-research--statistics/research--statistics/international-students-in-uk-he/\" title=\"\">China sends approximately 90,000 students a year to Britain, India 18,500, Malaysia 17,000, Hong Kong 16,000 and Singapore, Thailand and Pakistan some 7,000 each.</a> We should be proud that such numbers of students from these seven countries alone want to study here. Australia, Canada and the US will jump at the chance to host them as we turn them away, terrified they are all wannabe immigrants. Really? It is a savage indictment of our new public culture. I have lost count of the number of international students worried if they are wanted, whether they should apply for graduate studies and scared of the way the atmosphere around them is becoming more hostile.</p> <p>Not one single Leave minister in the government speaks out for them, their cause or the international role of our universities despite their protestations of embracing the globe \u2013 that falls to Remainers such as Hammond or the universities minister, Jo Johnson. The Leavers are charlatans. I, for one, want my country back.</p>",
  "<p>The latest furore over Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009-2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying US presidential election into even greater confusion, with little more than a week to go before voting day.</p> <p>The FBI\u2019s unexpected and very public revelation that it is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html?emc=edit_th_20161029&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=53657756\" title=\"\">recommencing its investigation </a>into Clinton\u2019s conduct may not be politically motivated, but its timing certainly makes it appear that way. The row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged, principally by the unscrupulous Republican candidate, Donald Trump.</p> <p>Despite this new firestorm, stoked by Republicans and rightwing media, it remains likely that American voters will deliver a clear, possibly resounding, rejection of Trump on 8 November. Although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes, Clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters \u2013 and she is the sane and reasonable, if uninspiring, choice. A Trump defeat will be richly deserved. As we have noted previously, he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the White House. His behaviour during a long, raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/28/observer-view-donald-trump-ugly-truth\" title=\"\">made that abundantly plain</a>.</p> <p>Yet consigning \u201cthe Donald\u201d to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of Trumpism. This is likely to take a lot longer. Trump\u2019s platform was based not on thought-through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice, grievance, ignorance and fear, spiced with opportunism. His unexpected success in winning the nomination, despite the Republican establishment\u2019s hostility, reflected his close identification with mainly white, working-class and lower-middle-class voters who, like him, feel angry, undervalued and alienated. While public figures such as Barack Obama, Trump\u2019s failed Republican rival Jeb Bush and Clinton appear to this constituency to be remote, out of touch and uncaring, Trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is \u201con their side\u201d. Again and again, in Ohio, Florida and elsewhere, disaffected voters claimed that only Trump could be trusted to tell the \u201ctruth\u201d, only Trump would keep his promises, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/ds-2710-trump-rally\" title=\"\">only Trump</a> could make America great again.</p> <p>Oblivious to paradox, irony, history or facts, Trumpism projects a distorted vision of American greatness. The Trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants, that became the most powerful on Earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances\" title=\"\">2,000-mile wall with Mexico</a>. Trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against Muslims to keep itself safe.</p> <p>As general concepts, Trumpism makes an enemy of the \u201cother\u201d, equates nationality with homogeneity, calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten, jail or harm opponents. It says individualism outweighs state authority, as in the unfettered right to bear firearms, but not, perversely, in the case of a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion. Trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners. It believes free trade, international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off Americans. Paranoid Trumpism holds that long-term allies such as Germany and Japan get a free security ride at America\u2019s expense.</p> <p>Trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in Russia and China. Vladimir Putin is a strong leader standing up for his people, national beliefs and way of life. Any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other Trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious, part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens. And don\u2019t forget: Trumpism cannot be fairly defeated. If it loses, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34903577\" title=\"\">it was cheated</a> for sure.</p> <p>Trumpism appeals to the worst in people, cynically exploiting and fanning the anger, grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged, the embittered, uneducated and plain ignorant. It appeals to base instincts, to lowest common denominators. Its is political dumbing down writ large. It is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity, engendered across the west by post-2008 economic injustice and social division, the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent, unfeeling or corrupt governance.</p> <p>Fear is the common enemy, but fear is Trumpism\u2019s friend. This phenomenon is not confined to America. European countries, including Britain, experience variations on the theme. In Germany and France, concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of Syria. In Greece, Poland, Austria and Hungary, rightwing extremists\u2019 evil, dehumanising ideas about refugees, migrants and foreigners in general have become <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2016-06-03/rise-populism-europe\" title=\"\">a commonplace of political discussion</a>. In Britain, Ukip, provides a noisy echo-chamber for some of Trumpism\u2019s most divisive, chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains.</p> <p>If Trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence, it would be wise to look for a common remedy. But first, the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long-term effects should not be exaggerated. Much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in America and Europe is the direct result of continuing, negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash. Hard times, austerity cuts, high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root. But as history shows, they sometimes, yet rarely, lead to disaster. When economies improve, generally speaking, so too does the quality of political discourse. Ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics.</p> <p>While protest movements share characteristics and aims, it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other. Trumpism is an infection others can catch, yet it is also unique to America. Before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in Europe, commentators in Britain and elsewhere should remember that, when all is said and done, mainstream politicians such as Angela Merkel, Alain Jupp\u00e9, Mariano Rajoy and yes, Hillary Clinton do, on the whole, get elected or re-elected. Notwithstanding Greece\u2019s epic upheavals, the centre does mostly hold.</p> <p>More than anything else, Trumpism will fade and fail because, ultimately, it is a minority pastime, pandering to bigotry, which runs against the grain and spirit of the times, Brexit notwithstanding. Trumpism decries the impact of globalisation, yet globalisation, for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings, is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated, more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world.</p> <p>For good or bad, this clock cannot be turned back. Closed borders and closed minds, crude nationalism, trade barriers, xenophobia, religious, racial and sexual discrimination \u2013 these are old mistakes and old hatreds that, while still in evidence everywhere, belong to times past. The world is moving forward, not back. In the end, Trumpism and all its ghastly incarnations, dwelling in fear and darkness, will, like Trump himself, be exorcised.</p>",
  "<p>Lewis Hamilton exhibited the touch and confidence that defines a multiple Formula One world champion in Mexico City on Saturday night, amid the maelstrom of a tense championship fight with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.</p> <p>A consummate lap in Q3 topped a dominant session in which Hamilton pushed to the limit of the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez and claimed pole for the Mexican Grand Prix, beating Rosberg by two-tenths of a second.</p> <p>Hamilton had been faster than his team-mate in all three practice sessions and was so again through Q1 and Q2. His first run in the final shootout with a time of 1min 18.704sec confirmed that form and was enough. Rosberg pushed but he was more than five-tenths back on every lap but his last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/29/mercedes-f1-team-member-robbed-at-gunpoint-mexican-grand-prix\">Mercedes F1 team member robbed at gunpoint before Mexican Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hamilton, however, strung together a sequence of improving runs that came together on his penultimate hot lap, a performance which he acknowledged had been tricky. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough trying to pull out perfect laps when it matters,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely very challenging.\u201d</p> <p>The Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were in third and fourth and the two Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel were in sixth and seventh, with an impressive fifth for the Force India of Nico Hulkenberg.</p> <p>Hamilton\u2019s 10th pole of the season could not have been more timely as his battle with Rosberg reaches the endgame and he is now in a position to narrow the 26-point gap. Rosberg will still take the title should he finish second to a Hamilton win in the remaining three meetings but the world champion needs to force the fight to the wire. It is crucial he has a clean getaway, an issue that has compromised his season as much as mechanical problems.</p> <p>Should he hold the place on the 800m run, the longest of the season, to turn one, he will be able to dictate the race and crucially have the first call on pit-stop strategy. He will also be in clean air \u2013 the best place for the Mercedes \u2013 and where he needs to be, since he cannot afford a DNF. His retirement and a Rosberg victory would mean the German claims the title here.</p> <p>Confident following his win in Austin and having dialled-in the car, he did everything required of him but only the first part of the business of keeping his title hopes alive.</p> <p>The two Williams of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa were in eighth and ninth with Carlos Sainz Jr putting in a strong run to place his Toro Rosso in tenth.</p> <p>Rosberg had left it late to secure a front row place and there was, briefly, a real danger that the consistency and determination he has shown all season, during which he has put his car on the front row, before penalties, for every race, was going to come apart. He was five-tenths down on his team-mate in Q1, six-tenths in Q2 and five again on the first hot laps of the final session.</p> <p>His last run was hooked-up well however and it finally narrowed the gap. For the race though, Hamilton\u2019s control and obvious ease with the circuit is already to his advantage. His time in Q2 was second-fastest only to Verstappen despite having to slow when coming up behind a weaving Vettel on the exit of the Stadium.</p> <p>Rosberg had needed to push because the competition have found some speed in the thin air of Mexico City and both the Red Bulls and the Ferraris had shown good pace early in the session. Verstappen in particular had another confident run. He has mastered the single-lap discipline well this year, with this second-row slot adding to his third places at Silverstone and Malaysia, fourth at Hungary, Germany, Singapore, the US and Barcelona, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/max-verstappen-youngest-winner-f1-history-spanish-gran-prix\" title=\"\">the race he went on to win for his debut F1 victory</a>.</p> <p>Both Mercedes drivers have the advantage of starting on the more durable soft tyres having set their fastest time in Q2 on the harder compound. Hamilton noted that the track had rubbered-in considerably over the weekend and lap times, already well up on last year, are expected to drop further on Sunday, with top speeds going into the braking zone on the entrance to turn one likely to exceed 227mph.</p> <p>There was disappointment for the local fans when Sergio P\u00e9rez could put his Force India only into 12th, splitting the two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. The Renault of Kevin Magnussen was in 14th ahead of Sauber\u2019s Marcus Ericsson. Pascal Wehrlein had another creditable performance to put his Manor into Q2 and finish in 16th place, well ahead of his team-mate.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s second driver, Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez, span his Haas on his final quick lap and was knocked out of Q1 in 17th place. Toro Rosso\u2019s Daniil Kvyat was 18th, the Sauber of Felipe Nasr in 19th and the second Manor of Esteban Ocon in 20th. Romain Grosjean in the second Haas had a battery problem and will start from 21st. Britain\u2019s Jolyon Palmer will start his Renault from the pit lane after he cracked his chassis on one of the sausage kerbs in final practice and could not take part in qualifying.</p>",

  "<p><br>French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Saturday hit back at the UK as the row between the two countries over the fate of hundreds of unaccompanied children still living in the Calais migrant camp became increasingly acrimonious.</p> <p>Confirming that 5,000 people had so far been evacuated, Hollande said 1,500 remaining unaccompanied minors, housed in a camp made from shipping containers, would be transferred swiftly to reception centres around France. <br></p> <p>The announcement dismayed charities which warned the dispersal policy could mean that many children, frightened and distrustful of the move, might attempt to run away.<br></p> <p>It also appeared to be a marked change in policy to the one agreed with the UK. Home Office officials had expected to process the children\u2019s applications in Calais. However, a source said \u201cthe French have pulled the plug\u201d on the scheme. <br></p> <p>Volunteers at the camp said they had been told that Home Office officials who had been on site all week would be leaving the camp on Monday. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe had to rise to the challenge of the refugee issue,\u201d Hollande said during a visit to a reception centre in Dou\u00e9-la-Fontaine in western France. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe could not tolerate the camp and we will not tolerate any others. There are 1,500 unaccompanied minors left in Calais and they will be very quickly dispatched to other centres.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hollande said he had spoken with Theresa May to ensure that British officials would \u201caccompany these minors to these centres and would play their part in subsequently welcoming them to the United Kingdom\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cTheir transfer to Britain is urgent,\u201d he added. \u201cWe ask you to take your responsibilities and assume your moral duty by immediately organising their arrival.\u201d<br></p> <p>Ginny Howells, emergencies manager with Save the Children, who is at the camp, warned that transporting the unaccompanied children to reception centres around France could backfire. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe want children to be going to child-appropriate accommodation but our huge concern is that these children will become a massive flight risk. In the last eviction in March we had 129 children go missing. We know that more children have already run away. We know that if you bus a child to somewhere else in France the risk is that they lose faith that they can get to the UK.\u201d <br></p> <p>She added: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to children who say: \u2018I don\u2019t trust this bus I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going, I\u2019m going to jump on the back of a lorry, I\u2019m going to try the train tracks.\u2019<br></p> <p>\u201cWe say to them you can still do your family reunification application wherever you are in France. We\u2019ve managed to convince a few children but more have become so disillusioned they don\u2019t trust the French officials, so they run.\u201d<br></p> <p>Clare Moseley, founder of British charity <a href=\"http://care4calais.org/\">Care4Calais</a>, expressed concern for those children who had already been evacuated. \u201cWe are worried about what happens next \u2013 there will be a multitude of small camps where conditions are even worse than in the Jungle.\u201d<br></p> <p>Charities said the situation for those remaining in the camp was proving extremely difficult. Calais Action said at least 14 children were left on the site on Friday night with nowhere to go. Some children were having to be housed in makeshift accommodation outside the container camp which has now been bulldozed<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is horrific now,\u201d said Lally Mergler, a volunteer with the women and children\u2019s centre in the camp. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are burned-out gas canisters, rubbish every\u00adwhere, a lot of rats, and this is where the children are going in and out of the container camp. We would like Britain to step up to the plate and take the children it is supposed to take and the French to help out with the others, but neither side seems to want to do anything.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cWe had three Eritrean boys, two aged 13, one aged 14, and we could not identify any sort of official accommodation for them,\u201d Howells said. \u201cWe had to say to them, \u2018we can\u2019t find you a bed for the night\u2019. That\u2019s completely unacceptable.\u201d <br></p> <p>The problem of how to care for the children has become a source of bitter division between France and the UK. Last Monday home secretary Amber Rudd complained that her officials had been given access to the camp only in the previous week. Her claims were rejected by French officials.<br></p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAt the request of the French we have moved UK staff out of the Calais camp this weekend but we remain fully engaged and committed to working alongside the French authorities and NGOs to ensure we are able to continue transferring eligible children to the UK.\u201d<br></p>",

The portion of Gibb\u2019s answer that related to police requests was clearer on the point: data on 21 pupils had been shared with forces after 31 access requests, he said.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson later said: \u201dWithout evidence and data, we cannot have a clear picture of how the school system is working. We take privacy extremely seriously and access to sensitive data is strictly controlled.\u201d </p> <p>Officials have been at pains to stress that the nationality and country of birth data would not be shared with the Home Office, insisting that an interdepartmental agreement explicitly forbade it. However, the DfE has so far refused to reveal details of the agreement.</p> <p>In a bid to address privacy concerns, the school system minister, John Nash, said in a letter to peers, seen by <a href=\"http://schoolsweek.co.uk/nationality-data-wont-be-included-in-national-pupil-database-says-minister/\">Schools Week</a>, the new data would be held separately from the national pupil database, and claimed this would prevent other departments from accessing it. </p> <p>But Jen Persson, of <a href=\"http://defenddigitalme.com/\">defenddigitalme</a>, who has campaigned strongly for an end to the collection, said the move did not constitute a victory for campaigners. \u201cLord Nash only rightly confirms the fact that the database is not safe for the intensely sensitive data they already hold on 20 million people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DfE have already given and continue to give out children\u2019s home address collected in school census data. The Home Office has asked for nearly 2,500 people\u2019s data since July 2015 alone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else is it used for that we don\u2019t yet know? It doesn\u2019t matter what the DfE call where they store it; it\u2019s what they do with it that matters and what they are doing is shocking, without any intention of being publicly transparent or accountable.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, director of policy for <a href=\"https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a>, said: \u201cThe government is starting to face a serious backlash against its poisonous \u2018hostile environment\u2019 policies. First ministers had to pull their misguided plans for foreign worker lists \u2013 now their creation of a foreign national children list could be thwarted too.</p> <p>\u201cIn recent months we have seen migrant communities vilified and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/03/theresa-may-eu-migrants-pawn-brexit-talks-tory-leadership-race\">treated as bargaining chips</a>.

  "<p>Mezcal, tequila\u2019s stronger and smokier relative, has become a staple spirit in trendy bars across Mexico and the United States in recent years, and the agave-based drink has inevitably attracted the interest of global alcohol giants. In the process local growers are worried a unique spirit is under threat.<br></p> <p>Traditionally produced in small batches by farmers who use artisanal methods, including earth-covered oven pits and horse-driven mills, mezcal has struck a chord with the growing sector of consumers passionate about slow food, farmers\u2019 markets and craft drinks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Yet small distillers and industry insiders warn that mezcal\u2019s sudden popularity is fueling mass production that threatens to damage its reputation. Worse still the humble rural communities that produce the drink are left to deal with the resultant ecological damage while the newcomers leave with a greater share of the profits.<br></p> <p>Global investment has gathered pace as mezcal has established itself as North America\u2019s hippest new spirit. The Scotch whisky producer William Grant &amp; Sons launched the <a href=\"http://montelobos.com/\">Montelobos</a> brand in 2012 and the following year Bacardi bought the distribution rights for <a href=\"http://zignummezcal.com/eng/home.php\">Zignum</a>, an industrially produced mezcal owned by a subsidiary of the Mexican Coca-Cola bottler Femsa.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d496b8ebbddeddddc88d0ef979471fd19edb40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d496b8ebbddeddddc88d0ef979471fd19edb40/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crushing baked agave with a horse and a multi-ton stone wheel to make mezcal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crushing baked agave with a horse and a multi-ton stone wheel to make mezcal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mezcal Educational Tours</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The British multinational Diageo sealed a deal to distribute <a href=\"http://mezcalunion.com/\">Union</a>, another large brand, in February, and this summer the tequila giant Jos\u00e9 Cuervo launched <a href=\"http://mezcalcreyente.com/\">Creyente</a>, the second mezcal brand in its portfolio. Then the French conglomerate Pernod Ricard announced plans last month to launch a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-26/tequila-s-smoky-cousin-gets-push-from-world-s-biggest-distillers\">small-village brand</a>\u201d, promising that \u201csome of the value will be shared with the local community\u201d.</p> <p>These developments have raised concern among traditional distillers who want the industry to stay true to its rustic roots. Unlike tequila, which can only be made from blue agave and is typically produced using industrial techniques to enhance efficiency, mezcal is a more diverse spirit made from more than 40 species of the spiky plant using artisanal methods that differ across the country.<br></p> <p>Julian Saenger, who has partnered with artisan distillers in the south-western states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n for his <a href=\"http://www.domingomezcal.com/\">Legendario Domingo</a> brand, said the modern industrial methods favoured by tequila companies and a few mezcal producers kill off the earthy flavours and delicate aromas of roasted agave that vary enormously depending on when, where, how and with what the mezcal was made.<br></p> <p>\u201cEvery batch of mezcal should taste different, even if it\u2019s made by the same brand,\u201d Saenger said. \u201cI would have serious doubts about any mezcal that always tastes the same, because they must be using some kind of chemical to give it a specific taste.\u201d<br></p> <p>As well as taking off abroad, mezcal is enjoying a revival in Mexico\u2019s big cities, where it was once dismissed as cheap hooch for the working classes. However, Pedro Jim\u00e9nez, the owner of Guadalajara\u2019s hip mezcal bar <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pare-de-Sufrir-Tome-Mezcal-175385519212027/\">Pare de Sufrir</a>, warned that the spirit\u2019s popularity is fueling a production boom that threatens the very characteristics that have made it so trendy.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mezcal isn\u2019t a commodity, it\u2019s a cultural product.

There\u2019s no way that you can mass produce mezcal and do it well.\u201d<br></p> <p>Increased production has led to agave shortages and inflated prices, encouraging farmers to sell entire fields of crops before they are fully matured, Jim\u00e9nez said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis results in a drink of inferior quality. More and more mezcal producers are lowering their standards so they can produce in greater volume,\u201d he added. \u201cThey sell at low prices in order to sell more, but they\u2019re damaging the drink\u2019s reputation. This is very dangerous.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jim\u00e9nez also runs <a href=\"http://mezonte.com/\">Mezonte</a>, a civic organisation that helps artisanal distillers to promote their products and defend traditional mezcal culture. Although mezcal \u2013 like tequila, cognac and champagne \u2013 is protected by a denomination of origin (DO) that limits its production to certain parts of Mexico, Jim\u00e9nez described industry regulations as \u201ca slap in the face to people who make traditional mezcal\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ded52d21d4ab93878bd57ab3d213ec2764c7058b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ded52d21d4ab93878bd57ab3d213ec2764c7058b/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro Jim\u00e9nez at his Mezonte office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro Jim\u00e9nez at his Mezonte office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Duncan Tucker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mezcal has been made for centuries in 26 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, but the DO limits production to just nine states. Distillers from other areas have expressed outrage over <a href=\"http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5428197&amp;fecha=29/02/2016\">NOM-199</a>, a new regulation proposed by the government and industry giants including Diageo and Pernod Ricard, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/mezcal-producers-mexico-komil-liquor\">would have forced them</a> to label their products as \u201c<em>komil</em>\u201d \u2014 an obscure indigenous word meaning \u201cintoxicating drink\u201d understood by almost nobody in Mexico.<br></p> <p>A revised proposal would have them use \u201c<em>aguardiente de agave</em>\u201d \u2013 meaning agave firewater \u2013 instead of \u201c<em>destilado de agave</em>\u201d, the more literal name currently in use. Agave spirits expert Clayton Szczech said that while preferable to \u201c<em>komil</em>\u201d, the word \u201c<em>aguardiente</em>\u201d still has \u201ca pejorative connotation that makes people think of cheap rum and seems designed to taint these products in the marketplace.\u201d<br></p> <p>Another regulation awaiting final approval, <a href=\"http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5428710&amp;fecha=04/03/2016\">NOM-070</a>, would affect distillers within the DO by dividing mezcal into standard, artisanal and ancestral categories, depending on the methods of production. Szczech said having these labels on every bottle would help small-scale distillers from the latter two categories to justify their higher prices to consumers by distinguishing their products from the cheaper, mass-produced brands in the standard category.</p> <p>Small distillers are still not happy with the proposed regulation. Graciela \u00c1ngeles, the general manager of <a href=\"http://www.realminero.com.mx/index.html\">Real Minero</a>, noted that large corporations could bend the rules and mass-produce mezcal that meets the artisanal or ancestral standards by hiring vast numbers of distillers who use traditional techniques.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe multinationals don\u2019t come here to open up factories,\u201d explained \u00c1ngeles, whose family has produced mezcal in Oaxaca for over 100 years. \u201cThey\u2019re smarter than that. They sign agreements with people who can produce artisanal mezcals, which have a higher market value.\u201d</p> <p>Most distillers have seen no improvement in their standard of living and continue to work without health insurance or benefits, \u00c1ngeles said, while savvy businessmen from outside their communities enjoy the lion\u2019s share of profits from the mezcal boom.</p> <p>Warning that mass production is already causing shortages of wild agave, deforestation, a loss of biodiversity and the discharge of liquid waste on a damaging scale, \u00c1ngeles implored regulators to set annual production limits.</p> <p>\u201cThis is neocolonialism,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come here to extract a resource and once that resource runs out they leave. They don\u2019t have any social responsibility.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>The film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight</a> is extraordinary for many reasons, but to me it is most so for two. First, it considers black boys to be precious, at a time when news stories perpetually make it seem as if the United States considers them to be utterly expendable. Second, it acknowledges the effects that the stalking ghosts of premature death and incarceration have upon gay black masculinity \u2013 and it manages to do so without ever diminishing the lives full of complex humanity that black gay men still manage to have in America while navigating that reality.</p> <p>So often, gay lives in America are coded as white, and the forces that shape the lives of queer people of color \u2013 say, how immigration affects being Chicano and gay in Calfornia, or how police surveillance affects being black and gay in the New York \u2013 are ignored, as gay identity is usually swept up into whiteness. Moonlight eschews this reductivism entirely, brilliantly portraying in a lyrical story how love and connection attempt to take hold. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight review \u2013 devastating drama is vital portrait of black gay masculinity in America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that there are about <a href=\"https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2015%2F04%2F20%2Fupshot%2Fmissing-black-men.html%3F_r%3D1\">a million and a half black men disappeared</a> from American society by early death and incarceration is not a side issue to black gay men. It\u2019s certainly no side issue to Chiron, Moonlight\u2019s hero, who successfully seeks out a father figure, Juan (Mahershala Ali), only to lose him to an early death. And yet, Moonlight also shows how creative and brilliant black humanity is at being so much more than its pain. Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/15/why-i-love-barry-jenkins-bim-adewunmi\">Barry Jenkins </a>doesn\u2019t dwell on Juan\u2019s death as much as he does on the beauty of his embrace of Chiron in his arms in the sea, on his smile, on his joyful proclamation that you can find black people wherever you go in the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9NJj12tJzqc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another gift Jenkins gives not just to American cinema, but to American culture, is that he depicts black boyhood as something worthy of rooting for to succeed. It is not especially difficult to make white boyhood precious. In the 2014 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/boyhood-selma-american-sniper-race-part-one\">Boyhood</a>, director Richard Linklater encouraged the audience to hold as precious and unique Mason, a banal and totally average white American child who existed in an imaginary nearly all-white Texas. Mason and his friend engage in petty vandalism, and also drink and drive \u2013 and yet, Mason, \u201cno angel\u201d, was excused and held dear in a way a black child never would be. </p> <p>Lately, I have been thinking a lot about a <a href=\"http://news.yale.edu/2016/09/27/implicit-bias-may-help-explain-high-preschool-expulsion-rates-black-children\">Yale study</a> where pre-school teachers were asked to watch videos of very young children to look for signs of trouble, and eye-tracking software revealed their eyes went for the black boys first and watched them the most. And why wouldn\u2019t they? As consumers of non-fiction media in America, we are always being told that black boys are suspicious and that violence against them is justifiable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same week Moonlight opened, a sign commemorating <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/22/us/mississippi-emmett-till-sign-bullets/\">Emmett Till, murdered for whistling at a white woman,</a> was riddled with bullet holes \u2013 a 14-year-old still considered suspect, six decades after being lynched.

Jenkins and the actor who plays \u201cLittle\u201d Chiron, Alex R Hibbert, are extraordinarily effective at melting your heart. We root for Little Chiron and his watchful eyes, whether he is avoiding bullies or tepidly checking out his friends as they compare penises. When he poured boiling water into the tub, my heart was in my throat that he could be hurt.</p> <p>But what is more extraordinary, perhaps, is that Jenkins continues to retain our sympathies as Chiron develops into a less passive and more complex person </p> <p>The breadth of Moonlight\u2019s ambitions, and the deft way it deals with complexity is captured at the end of its second chapter, when something happens that chilled me both times I\u2019ve seen it. Chiron (now portrayed by Ashton Sanders) approaches Terrel, a bully who had ordered Chiron\u2019s friend Kevin to beat Chiron up, and smashes a chair over his head. The scene is stunning, not just as a surprise act of revenge from a character whom the audience has experienced as sensitive and sweet, but of how visually reminiscent it is of something that happened in real life. In 2015, a black man named <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://mic.com/articles/147556/what-bayna-el-amin-s-assault-case-says-about-racism-in-the-lgbtq-community#.gRCkNzilQ\">Bayna El-Amin </a>smashed a chair over a white gay couple in a BBQ restaurant in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.</p> <p>When a video of the attack went viral without context, it led to calls for an investigation into whether the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2015/06/report-accused-fugitive-in-chelsea.html\">\u201cthug\u201d</a> El-Amin had committed a hate crime against the white gay men. But the story was more complex. El-Amin identified as queer in some way, and claimed that the act was in retribution for a fight started by the white gay men he hit with the chair.</p> <p>Gay advocacy groups were interested in the case when it could have been about two white gay men hit by a straight black man, but lost interest when it turned out to be about a black queer man hitting back against white gay men who had started a fight. In different ways, the fictive, slight Chiron and the real life, brawny El-Amin show that it is possible to be black, gay and able to exact revenge against the person who is causing you pain by hitting them with a chair. These narratives muddle a clean victim-perpetrator narrative, do not go well for anyone involved, and are so human.</p> <p>The person I saw Moonlight with (another queer person of color) cheered aloud when Chiron hit Kevin, then sighed when the police showed up, because he knew Chiron\u2019s decision to defend himself was going to cost him dearly. (It also cost El-Amin, who was sentenced to <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/crime/2016/9/15/nine-year-sentence-man-convicted-chair-attack-nyc-restaurant\">nine years</a>.) By the end of the scene, we don\u2019t know for how long Chiron is going away for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ac7729663077f00fc54124c3a9497a6bbbc0d93/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chirone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heart-melting: Alex Hibbert as little Chiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Moonlight\u2019s third and final chapter, we do know that Chiron has gone away for some time (during which he meets someone who has now put him out on the block to sell drugs); that his friend Kevin was also incarcerated; that his father figure has died prematurely, and that his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris) lives under some kind of supervised control in a rehab center. When Chiron reconnects with Kevin, he is still on parole, and the experiences of confinement have heavily affected everyone \u2013 especially Paula, who is so broken by it she chooses to stay in the rehab center when she could leave because she can\u2019t survive outside.</p> <p>Even in the film\u2019s uplifting moments, it is depressing that everyone in Chiron\u2019s life is either dead or living under some form of state surveillance. Jenkins deals with this deftly, without being heavy-handed or dismissive, and makes the characters no less worthy of our support.</p> <p>The first time I saw Moonlight, I was worried that it could create a dangerous takeaway message: that if black gay men want to lead full lives, they should try to escape from the violence of other black men and into the arms of whiteness. A reading of the film to that point could be saying that Chiron\u2019s precious boyhood could not be trusted to other black boys and men and might better be nurtured elsewhere. </p> <p>As the 1989 film <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/tonguesuntied/\">Tongues Untied</a> \u2013 still so relevant today \u2013 points out, it is common for black gay men to internalize a fear of one another and to buy into a push that we ought to flee into the arms of a white gay man. Like worshipping a Brad Pitt-like portrait of Jesus Christ in church, it is easy for black gay men to internalize society\u2019s pressure to idealize white men and believe that salvation can be had by being closer to whiteness. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64a659145a70e5a7df73b5b480ca26f03db5b585/0_0_5640_3760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali as Juan: a model of gay acceptance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bornfriend, courtesy of A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the shootings of mostly Latino queer people at the Pulse nightclub, I have consciously been trying to spend time in queer communities of color, meeting likeminded folks who also desire queerness in skin that looks like theirs. But even among us, it has been sad to learn how often black gay men tell me that out in the world, those like them won\u2019t give them the acknowledging head nod on the street. Brothers have also shared their sadness that they think black gay men won\u2019t date them because they\u2019re waiting for a white boyfriend. So the first time I saw Moonlight, I worried the bullying Chiron received could fit into a flight towards white narrative.</p> <p>But on a second viewing, my fears were allayed for three main reasons. First and most obviously, Chiron doesn\u2019t flee into the arms of a white man, but to his friend Kevin. (Significantly though, like Juan\u2019s partner Teresa, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a>, Kevin is also light-skinned, teasingly calls Chiron \u201cblack\u201d and only acted under the orders of the dark-skinned Terrel.) Second, Juan, Chiron\u2019s father figure in the first chapter, lovingly deflects any sense of shame little Chiron could feel when he asks what a \u201cfaggot\u201d is and whether he is one. Juan embodies some of the hardest masculinity in the film and is also a model of gay acceptance, slaying the canard that black people are more homophobic than white people.</p> <p>Finally, Moonlight is an all-black world, devoid of respectability politics. While it tells the story of ambiguous sexuality, it does so with unambiguous blackness and without shame. When stories eschew the white gaze and exist entirely inside of blackness, the protagonists and antagonists are all black. When Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage faces oppression from other black opponents and not from white people, this is not a denial of white supremacy. Similarly, seeing black kids beat each other up in Moonlight is not a call to abandon black masculinity as insufficient to cope with black homosexuality, but to wrestle with the reality of black gay men in its totality.</p>",

  "<p>Earlier this month, NYC FC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/07/new-york-city-fc-mls-necaxa-mexico\">took a historic trip to Mexico</a> for a friendly against Club Necaxa at Estadio Victoria in Aguascalientes. Not only was this fixture the team\u2019s first ever game against a Liga MX side, but it was also a great opportunity for both leagues to strengthen their ties by learning more from each other.</p> <p>First-team players Mikey Lopez, Khiry Shelton and Ethan White decided to chronicle the experience for the Guardian by photographing their trip. The team might have gone down 2-1, but it certainly looked like a fun experience.

  "<p>Walk past the 110 electric guitars filed on shelves like a library archive, and the dozens of keyboards swaddled in dust, and the ancient amps that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/smiths\">the Smiths</a> used at their first gigs, and you eventually come to a toilet cubicle, slap bang in the middle of the room. It looks as if it has briefly parked itself there while waiting for a more suitable home.</p> <p>When you go in, things become even stranger \u2013 pop\u2019s equivalent of the Tardis. The walls are lined with a series of gold and silver discs: Mind Bomb by The The, Ignore the Ignorant by the Cribs, Talking With The Taxman About Poetry by Billy Bragg, all of them awarded to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnnymarr\">Johnny Marr</a>. In the corner of the loo, there is a trophy for <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/blogs/the-big-picture/johnny-marr-the-making-of-a-godlike-genius-774472\">\u201cgodlike genius\u201d</a>, presented to the guitarist in 2013 by the music magazine NME. It\u2019s a reminder that Marr\u2019s career didn\u2019t end with the Smiths.</p> <p>But 29 years since their demise, it\u2019s still the Smiths most people want to hear about. The band more or less invented indie, as Marr is quick to remind me. Their tunes (by Marr) were as delicate as their lyrics (by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey\">Morrissey</a>) were morose. They became known as pop\u2019s supreme miserabilists (not least because of songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now</a>) but it was a brand of miserabilism that was romantic and funny. (In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0\">There Is A Light That Never Goes Out</a>, Morrissey sings: \u201cAnd if a double-decker bus/Crashes into us/To die by your side/Is such a heavenly way to die.\u201d) Between 1983 and 1987, they had 15 hits. Songs such as This Charming Man, William It Was Really Nothing and Big Mouth Strikes Again weren\u2019t just classic pop, they were perfectly formed short stories.</p> <p>Ever since the Smiths split, Marr has been reluctant to talk about the band and his relationship with Morrissey. Like Paul McCartney and the Beatles, he was blamed for being the one to walk away, and felt he was never quite forgiven. But at the age of 52, enjoying a successful solo career, Marr has just written a memoir, Set The Boy Free. He thinks it\u2019s time to put the record straight.</p> <p>We meet in his studio, a converted warehouse just outside Manchester. Marr is in skinny jeans and a polka-dot shirt, looking fit and clear-eyed. He says he loves the title of his book because it sounds like a famous song. But it isn\u2019t \u2013 it just came to him. As a little boy (and he was tiny, growing up) it was music that set him free from the mundanities of everyday life. He was brought up in a working-class family in Ardwick Green, Manchester, by Irish Catholic parents who were also mad about music. His father, \u201ca strong, brooding presence\u201d, laid gas pipes in the road; his mother, one of 14 children, cleaned at a hospital.</p> <p>There was nothing unhappy about his childhood, but there was something stultifying about suburbia. \u201cI was looking for something \u2013 transcendence.\u201d He looks embarrassed. \u201cThat sounds a bit pretentious, but common transcendence that everybody can relate to. I really like the word free. It has a sense of energy, and idealism, which I\u2019ve always felt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef2bee5ce4763f387d432c7a376ee7d6eb7bd51/138_37_1247_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrissey and Johnny Marr of the Smiths standing by the side of a van in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"819\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the road with Morrissey in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a bright boy, and went to grammar school. Like all guitarists, he says, he was good at English and art. But beyond that he didn\u2019t care much for academic work. He was obsessed with music: girl groups the Shangri-Las and the Shirelles, glam rockers T-Rex and Roxy Music, and most of all with guitarists.</p> <p>By the age of 13, he was playing in bands with people four years older. \u201cFashion, culture, rebellion, drinking, girls: I was learning so much, doing 16-year-old stuff. It felt like an apprenticeship for the only thing I was going to do \u2013 be a rock guitar player.\u201d Marr was already a star in the making, obsessed with mod haircuts and Crombie coats, spending every spare minute perfecting his guitar technique. He was a talented footballer and had a trial with Manchester City, the team he supported. But nothing could compete with his passion for music. Football fell by the wayside.</p> <p>Marr says he couldn\u2019t stand the strutting braggadocio of \u201ccock rock\u201d. His guitar heroes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Gallagher\">Rory Gallagher</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards\">Keith Richards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers\">Nile Rodgers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clashmusic.com/features/the-stooges-james-williamson-interview\">James Williamson</a> from the Stooges) didn\u2019t want to steal the show. So, rather than playing lead guitar, he devised a new way of playing for himself \u2013 using the rhythm guitar to replicate a whole band or orchestra. The technique was influenced by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6467441.stm\">Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cwall of sound\u201d</a> and refined over the years in the studio. It often involved numerous guitar overdubs, and Marr referred to it as the Guitarchestra.</p> <p>When he got the idea for the Smiths, which he formed at 19, it was already his fifth serious band. This time he knew he didn\u2019t want to front it. \u201cThe few occasions I had to stand in front of a bunch of local kids at youth clubs, it was terrifying.\u201d As far as Marr was concerned, all the great bands were based on a partnership: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney\">Lennon and McCartney</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger/Richards\">Jagger and Richards</a>. That\u2019s where Steven Morrissey came in.</p> <p>Marr was looking for a singer for his new band. One night he watched a South Bank Show on the great songwriting team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Leiber_and_Mike_Stoller\">Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller</a>. Leiber said he had heard that Stoller wrote songs, liked the sound of him, found out where he lived and knocked on the stranger\u2019s door. Marr decided that that\u2019s what he would do; he had been told Morrissey was a good vocalist, so he would find out where he lived and knock on his door.</p> <p>They talked about music, and listened to Morrissey\u2019s rare Tamla 45s. Marr raved about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBRhh1wehN4\">Dusty Springfield\u2019s Little By Little</a>; Morrissey played him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RLcw2bpOoU&amp;list=RD2RLcw2bpOoU\">Sandie Shaw\u2019s Message Understood</a>. When Marr left, Morrissey gave him some of his typed lyrics. After that, they were inseparable. \u201cEverything that was obsessive, excessive and poetic, all the big visions I carried around inside me, were also in him. The love of pop culture, and the pure dedication, was mirrored in my partner. I\u2019ve never seen it in anyone else before, and never in exactly the same way since. And the desperation. He was looking for someone like me and I was looking for someone like him. And we liked each other straight away. We really liked each other.\u201d</p> <p>What was the desperation? \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us, all that unfulfilled ambition was a hell of a lot to carry around. We weren\u2019t the sort of people who at 28 were going to be able to say, \u2018I was in a band; it didn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working in an estate agent.\u2019 The two of us knew that we were too into it to survive that.\u201d</p> <p>Were they as intense as each other? \u201cIn different ways, yeah. Mine comes out in physicality, exuberance. My mother used to say I\u2019m a cross between really intense and really laid-back.\u201d</p> <p>Marr says his relationship with Morrissey was as close as is possible without being lovers. Was he in love with Morrissey? \u201cNo, because I was in love with Angie [his then girlfriend, now wife], but we definitely loved each other. I think we all did.\u201d His old school friend <a href=\"http://www.andyrourke.com/\">Andy Rourke</a> (who had played in his first band, the Paris Valentinos) joined on bass, and <a href=\"http://www.mikejoyce.com/\">Mike Joyce</a> became their drummer. The four became good friends, but Marr says it was always clear that he and Morrissey were the leaders.</p> <p>The second Morrissey lyric Marr put to music was the ghoulish <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c\">Suffer Little Children</a>, about the victims of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady (\u201cLesley Ann, with your pretty white beads/Oh John, you\u2019ll never be a man/And you\u2019ll never see your home again/Oh Manchester, so much to answer for\u201d). Didn\u2019t the words spook him? Well, at the time, he says, they were so besotted with each other, the lyrics were secondary. \u201cIt was, \u2018We like each other. You look good, I look good. I write music, you write lyrics. We\u2019re gonna do this.\u2019\u201d He smiles. \u201cWhen I saw, in the first songwriting session, my new group had a song about the Moors murderers, it was very much, <em>\u2018Fucking hell!</em>\u2019 But I went on instinct.\u201d</p> <p>Did he always think of the Smiths as his? \u201cIn a way that is protective, I did, yes. I wasn\u2019t old enough to be paternal, but it was kind of paternal.\u201d Marr looked like a young Keith Richards \u2013 and had the swagger. Morrissey was famously introverted, so Marr was marketed as the arrogant one. While he says he was 90% true to that image, there was always 10% that was terrified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe6cce46732369d82b07579cfa7576483db7653/302_0_4138_5820/711.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr playing his guitar\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The only thing I was going to do was be a rock guitar player\u2019: Marr in his studio.

Growing up in working-class Manchester, Marr says, being political was instinctive. \u201cIt was just part of your mindset, because you felt you were up against it, and the right wing was the minority but controlling everything. Somebody gave me <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/the-canon-arguments-for-socialism-by-tony-benn/414356.article\">Arguments For Socialism</a> by Tony Benn, and I discovered that what I just thought was decency was a political position. You look after people who are less fortunate, and anyone who does otherwise is just fucking ghastly. By definition, being an alternative musician back then, you were political.\u201d</p> <p>Did he and Morrissey have similar politics? \u201cYeah, we did back then.\u201d And now? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect so. Probably not.\u201d In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-china-subspecies-racism\">Morrissey has made headlines</a> for suggesting that immigration is compromising British identity; he sued the NME (successfully) for defamation, releasing a statement that \u201cracism has no place in our society\u201d. In a 2010 interview with this magazine, he described the Chinese as a \u201csubspecies\u201d when it came to their treatment of animals. Marr prefers to talk about the days when Morrissey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">reserved his bile for Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> <p>Success soon began to take its toll on the Smiths. Rourke had a heroin habit; Marr survived on a diet of cocaine and booze. His weight dropped to seven stone, but he didn\u2019t worry because all his heroes had been slight. \u201cGeorge Best was small, Marc Bolan was small, Bruce Lee was small. And they were cocky and hyper, so I related to that, and played up to it. When it got really unhealthy it was just part and parcel of being in the Smiths in 1986. I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u2018This is great.\u2019 I just never ate.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Marr looks fantastically healthy \u2013 slim but not skeletal. He is vegan, teetotal and has been drug-free for many years. Now he gets his high from long-distance running. We meet at lunch, and he\u2019s already been out for eight miles. The only thing that gives away his age is the mandatory jet-black rock star dyed hair. His eternal boyishness is reflected not only in the book\u2019s title, but also in his passion (for new guitars, new bands, new experiences), his nomadic sense of adventure (he recently spent five years living in Portland with Angie, while playing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/modestmouse\">Modest Mouse</a>), his curiosity (about everything).</p> <p>That optimism did briefly desert Marr when the Smiths split in 1987. In Set The Boy Free, he writes that the official version of him walking out on the band isn\u2019t quite right. Morrissey\u2019s behaviour was becoming more and more unreliable. Things came to a head, he says, when Morrissey refused to show up for the video shoot of the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJRN76hxFz0\">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>, and ordered him to sack their latest manager, Ken Friedman (who had been introduced to the band by the singer and who Marr considered to be doing a good job). Marr says Morrissey assumed the guitarist would take on the role of unofficial manager, as he had for most of the band\u2019s existence. Even when the Smiths became successful, Marr acted as manager, booking vans and sorting all the finer detail. At the same time, he was being dictated to in the studio. Drummer Mike Joyce, who appeared to have taken on the role of spokesman for the other three, told Marr their next single would be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETJ-kOJrRow\">a cover</a> of Cilla Black\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQWxFv_8_g\">Work Is A Four-Letter Word</a>. Marr wasn\u2019t pleased \u2013 but still, he insists, he didn\u2019t walk out. He stayed at home, making instrumental tracks in his recording studio.</p> <p>In July 1987 a story appeared in the press that Marr had left, accompanied by a new photo of the band taken by their press officer in which Marr was scowling while the other three Smiths smiled away. At that point, he felt he had no option but to walk.</p> <p>It sounds horribly stressful, I say. Yes, he says \u2013 not least the presumption that he would be the one to step in and manage the Smiths. \u201cIt\u2019s what split the band up. To this day I haven\u2019t met anyone who thinks a major rock group should be managed by the 23-year-old guitar player.\u201d So why did he agree to manage them in the first place? \u201cWell, because we were deemed unmanageable. When we fired managers, I always had to deal with it. When we got to the end of the band\u2019s life, it was put to me by my partner that he wouldn\u2019t work with the current manager and we had to go back to how it was. I wasn\u2019t prepared to do it, and so it became untenable. There was no way forward.\u201d For a moment, those tensions sound as raw as they did three decades ago. \u201cI was waiting for someone to fix it, and make it so it didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100ac098727a6e8d9b171871dfb8210c5cd3ef91/0_9_845_1114/759.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr with Angie, his wife, soon after they met in the late 70s\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr with his wife Angie in the late 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why were they so resistant to having a manager? \u201cA lot of it was to do with control.\u201d Does he feel he was\u2026? Marr finishes the sentence for me. \u201cForced out? Yes, that was the tangible public manifestation of all that.\u201d He stops, embarrassed by his words. \u201cWow! Check me out! It was the feeling of being tested, and my role in the band being untenable.\u201d He stops again. \u201cJust like any break-up, bad shit goes on.\u201d</p> <p>The day that he confirmed he was leaving, the other band members issued a statement wishing him luck and saying: \u201cOther guitarists are being considered to replace him.\u201d How did that make him feel? \u201cI literally thought it was a joke. It was the final nail in the coffin and it took me a long time to forgive them. It was pretty callous. But I don\u2019t hold it against anybody now. I absolutely don\u2019t.\u201d Within a week, the Smiths were in the studio with a new guitarist. They never completed any new material, though: by the time their final album, Strangeways Here We Come, was released in September 1987, they had announced their split.</p> <p>Angie was the constant throughout this time. They started going out at the age of 15, and <a href=\"http://www.johnnymarrplaysguitar.com/a-long-list-2/angie-marr/\">are still together</a>, with two grownup children. Did she ever fear she would lose him to Morrissey? \u201cNo, it was me and Angie first. We all had these very unusual, intense relationships that worked and brought great things.\u201d I say that Angie seems to be the glue in his story. \u201cWell, she\u2019s the person who\u2019s enabled me to be who I am and vice versa. She\u2019s completed me, and I\u2019ve completed her.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>What struck Marr most when writing his book is how young he was when the Smiths split. He wasn\u2019t yet 24, and his career with one of Britain\u2019s biggest bands was over. Looking back now, he says, there was an inevitability about it all. Even without the tensions, and even though he didn\u2019t want to leave, he was never going to be a lifer in a single band. For a while he became the most illustrious hired hand in the business, playing with Paul McCartney, the Pretenders and U2. He went on to have long-term relationships with a number of bands, including Matt Johnson\u2019s eternally innovative <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-the-mn0000566918\">The The</a> (the critically acclaimed album Dusk reached number two in the UK charts), alternative dance band <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_(band)\">Electronic</a> with Bernard Sumner (a handful of hit singles, including Getting Away With It and Get The Message), American rockers Modest Mouse (whose album We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank went into the US charts at number one), and English indie punks <a href=\"https://www.thecribs.com/\">the Cribs</a>. Marr says these collaborations all led to great friendships.</p> <p>Which band did he enjoy playing with most? \u201cModest Mouse,\u201d he says without a beat. More than the Smiths? \u201cYeah. People don\u2019t believe it when I say that. I love Modest Mouse so much because the chemistry of those guys was a real brotherhood. They were a great American band, and I really wanted to be in a great American band.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t see the rest of the Smiths for years after the split. In March 1989, Joyce and Rourke started legal proceedings against Marr and Morrissey, arguing they were equal partners in the band and each entitled to 25% of recording and performance royalties rather than the 10% they were getting (Marr and Morrissey each took 40%). Rourke settled out of court, but Joyce continued and in 1996 his case was heard. Joyce\u2019s barrister argued that Marr and Morrissey treated the drummer and bassist as \u201cmere session musicians, as readily replaceable as the parts in a lawnmower\u201d. After a bruising seven days in court, Judge Weeks found in Joyce\u2019s favour, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/devious-truculent-and-unreliable-1314122.html\">describing Morrissey as \u201cdevious, truculent and unreliable\u201d</a> and Marr as \u201cwilling to embroider his evidence to a point where he became less credible\u201d. He also described Marr as \u201cprobably the more intelligent of the four\u201d, while Rourke and Joyce were \u201cunintellectual\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy. We might even be better than before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Was Joyce justified in bringing the court case? \u201cMike had a right to do it. I don\u2019t think he should have done because we had an agreement. Looking back, I would have done things differently. I\u2019d make sure you don\u2019t move a muscle without a contract \u2013 for everybody\u2019s benefit. Young people aren\u2019t good at doing that kind of thing, and we had to pay the price for it.\u201d Would he still regard the 10% Joyce and Rourke were paid as a fair deal? \u201cI would be more generous,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a band of equals. Thirty-odd years later I think anyone can see that.\u201d What would be a fair percentage? He laughs. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d wind up in court if I answered that.\u201d The question he most dislikes being asked is whether the Smiths will re-form. But it emerges that he and Morrissey were asking themselves the same question decades after the split, and that it almost did come to pass. In 2008, they met for the first time since the court case in a pub in south Manchester. \u201cThe conversation about re-forming came out of the blue. I didn\u2019t go there with that in mind. But there had been quite a few rumours about it, so naturally we discussed it. \u2018It could happen\u2026\u2019 \u2018How d\u2019you feel about it?\u2019 \u2018What if?\u2019 And off we went.\u201d Who was more keen? \u201cI think we were both as keen as each other.\u201d</p> <p>Had Morrissey changed \u2013 lost it, as people have suggested? Marr bursts out laughing. \u201cHahaha! Well, he hadn\u2019t <em>changed</em>. Joke! I felt I\u2019d changed when we met. I was teetotal, vegan and I\u2019d just run 10 miles \u2013 that\u2019s quite different from the person I was when I was last in the Smiths.\u201d Did Morrissey see a difference? \u201cI would think so, because I was in the pub not drinking. And he was knocking back the pints. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that he likes a drink; he\u2019s very pro-drinking. But I\u2019d changed quite a lot. I\u2019ve got about nine tattooos for a start.\u201d</p> <p>He shows me his favourite \u2013 a tattoo that says 45rpm. Why 45rpm rather than 33rpm? \u201cFaster, mate. Faster, shorter, better energy. I had my T-shirt on, so I think Morrissey noticed them, and he likes tattoos. So I was different, and I was fitter.\u201d</p> <p>Was Morrissey different? \u201cHe was more outgoing, more sure of himself. I\u2019m pleased for him. It was great \u2013 a really nice meeting.\u201d</p> <p>They left the pub, contemplating a Smiths reunion, spoke a few more times, then Marr went on tour with the Cribs, and didn\u2019t hear from Morrissey again.</p> <p>Does he thinks their friendship could be rekindled? \u201cI don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s run its course. I don\u2019t feel unfriendly in any way towards Morrissey \u2013 there\u2019s just no need for it. One of the things we had in common was that we lived for work, and we\u2019re too busy doing what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p> <p>So many people publish memoirs when they are on their uppers or want to settle scores, Marr says. But he has never been more content. He has made two solo albums in the past three years, and is enjoying learning the skills of being a frontman. His son Nile, 24, is a singer-songwriter who has performed with him; his 22-year-old daughter Sonny, who works in publishing, has sung backing vocals with him. Hearing them sing, he says, is the only thing that makes him \u201cblub like an idiot\u201d.</p> <p>He hopes the book will be cathartic, but he\u2019s not sure how exactly. Just talking to him, though, he already seems liberated. He recently remastered the Smiths back catalogue \u2013 the first time he\u2019d listened to it as a body of work. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0BOK0EDFE\">Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me</a> is his favourite song.) He had always known it was good, but now he became fully aware of what they had achieved. Alongside his new solo work, he has started performing old Smiths songs for the first time since the band split up \u2013 occasionally joined on stage by bassist Rourke. He had always resisted the idea that he did his best work so young, but now accepts the Smiths will be his legacy.</p> <p>And it is a legacy he has become increasingly determined to defend. In 2010, then prime minister David Cameron chose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRP3LRcUFg\">This Charming Man</a> on Desert Island Discs, proclaiming himself a fan of the Smiths. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnny_marr/status/10237162679177216?lang=en-gb\">Marr responded on Twitter</a>: \u201cStop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Was he genuinely offended? \u201cYeah, I was pissed off by it, by the gall of thinking that me and my band were up for grabs. So I responded on behalf of all of us.\u201d Were the others offended as well? \u201cI think they just probably looked at it and went, \u2018Johnny\u2019s taken care of that.\u2019\u201d He pauses and grins. \u201cSo nothing changes very much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fada264dda953bf9aec248d7315ef44e231be/78_55_2811_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnny Marr and Morrissey of the Smiths in a bathroom before going onstage in Belgium in 1984\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marr and Morrissey about to go onstage in Belgium in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Johnny Marr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> \u2018For four days re-forming the Smiths was a very real prospect\u2019: <br></h2> <h2>an exclusive extract from Johnny Marr\u2019s new memoir</h2> <p>Unfortunately for the Smiths, I wasn\u2019t consulted when our catalogue was remastered for CDs in the 1990s. The albums sounded wrong, and I was determined to put things right. After a lot of struggle, I reached an agreement with Morrissey and Warners. I would master all the records again with a top engineer so our catalogue would be as it should be, once and for all. <br>When I analysed the records, I was struck by how good the band were, and how young. I recalled the exact intention and emotion that went into every note and word, and I texted Morrissey and Andy Rourke and said, \u201cYou can really hear the love in it.\u201d I got a nice reply from both of them.</p> <p>The negotiations with Warners meant that Morrissey and I were in a rare period of communication. One day in September 2008 we were only a couple of miles apart in south Manchester and arranged to meet up in a pub nearby. I was happy to see him \u2013 it was 10 years or more since we\u2019d last met. We caught up with personal news and family and reminisced a bit.</p> <p>Then our conversation turned to deeper things. Morrissey started to talk about how our relationship had become owned by the outside world, usually in a negative way. We had been defined by each other in most areas of our professional life. I appreciated him mentioning it, because it was true. <br></p> <p>The drinks kept coming and we sat talking for hours. We chatted, as we always did, about the records we loved, and eventually we moved on to \u201cthat subject\u201d. There had been rumours for years that the Smiths were about to re-form, and they were always untrue. I had never pursued any offer. <br></p> <p>Suddenly we were talking about the possibility of the band re-forming, and in that moment it seemed that with the right intention it could actually be done and might even be great. I would still work with the Cribs on our album, and Morrissey also had an album due out. We hung out for a while longer, and after even more orange juice (for me) and even more beer (for him) we hugged and said our goodbyes.</p> <p>I was genuinely pleased to be back in touch with Morrissey, and the Cribs and I talked about the possibility of me playing some shows with the Smiths. For four days it was a very real prospect. We would have to get someone new on drums, but if the Smiths wanted to re-form it would make a hell of a lot of people very happy, and with all our experience we might even be better than before. <br></p> <p>Morrissey and I continued our dialogue and planned to meet up again. I went to Mexico with the Cribs, and then suddenly there was radio silence. Our communication ended, and things went back to how they were and how I expect they always will be.</p> <p>I started working in the studio at unusual hours, around five or six in the morning. One day in 2010, on the way back from driving my daughter Sonny to school, I was thinking about how David Cameron had been saying that he was a fan of the Smiths. Anyone who was a fan would know we were against everything he and the Conservative party stood for. But if he wanted to say that he liked the Smiths, what could I do about it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/376fb2384d553d23e698643a5ae38c76917d2892/68_0_1266_2000/633.jpg\" alt=\"A student in a Smiths T-shirt, protesting against tuition fee rises, in Parliament Square, London, in 2010\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A student protester in a Smiths T-shirt in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without thinking too much about it, I picked up my phone and tweeted, \u201cDavid Cameron, stop saying that you like the Smiths. No you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d Satisfied that I\u2019d made my protest, I went to take a nap.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, I was woken up by a call from Joe, my manager. \u201cThe Cameron thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Twitter business. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d While I\u2019d been asleep my tweet had been retweeted by thousands of people and picked up by the press all over the world. Cameron himself was called on to comment during prime minister\u2019s questions. With the government planning to increase university tuition fees, Labour MP Kerry McCarthy <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-smiths-appear-at-prime-ministers-questions\">stood up and said</a>: \u201cThe Smiths are, of course, the archetypal student band. If he wins tomorrow night\u2019s vote, what songs does he think the students will be listening to? Miserable Lie, I Don\u2019t Owe You Anything or Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now?\u201d</p> <p>Cameron took the opportunity to show his true indie cred: \u201cI expect that if I turned up, I probably wouldn\u2019t get This Charming Man.\u201d</p> <p>Good one. It was all very jolly and totally bizarre.</p> <p>When 50,000 demonstrators marched through London, I was proud to see the students call the politicians to account for their broken promises. Things came to a head in Parliament Square on the day the new laws were passed. The next day I was sent a photograph of a protester called Ellen Wood who was confronting the police in a Smiths T-shirt (pictured page 23). I stared at the photograph, her stance, the Houses of Parliament. The significance of her wearing the Smiths shirt made quite an impact on me. It occurred to me that, aside from the music we made, that picture could be the most powerful testament to the Smiths\u2019 legacy. <br></p> <p>The only other person I knew who might comprehend it the same way was Morrissey, and so I emailed him the picture. There\u2019d been no contact between us for a long time, but I got a reply within minutes. He hadn\u2019t seen the picture, and he was equally surprised and impressed. Our communication continued for a day or so, but although I felt I\u2019d created a moment of friendship, an air of disaffection and distrust remained between us. It was a shame.</p> <p> \u2022 This is an edited extract from Set The Boy Free by Johnny Marr, published by Century at \u00a320.

  "<p>When I moved to Britain in 1990, I was pretty happy with my new home. But there were two things I couldn\u2019t understand: first, why there were only four channels on TV (four! It was like living in a third-world country); second, why Britons were so obsessed with the second world war (that\u2019s right, it\u2019s not just the Germans who notice this). Britain and I have since compromised on the TV issue, because while you can still count the number of channels on one hand, at least we\u2019re united in the international language of streaming.</p> <p>But I have long since fathomed the war obsession. Countries forge their self-image on what they deem to be their greatest hour, and all who come after it live in its shadow. For more than 70 years, Britain has been able to think of itself as the plucky country that refused to betray the continent\u2019s neediest citizens, who fought against its basest sentiments and, in doing so, saved Europe. I\u2019ve occasionally wondered how different the national character would be if Britain had given into appeasement: would people be even more self-deprecating? Or would they instead try to style out their collective shame with arrogance and affected rudeness, comme les Fran\u00e7ais?</p> <p>These are merely hypothetical musings, of course, but I am fascinated by how a country\u2019s self-image affects the national character, particularly when this self-image starts to corrode. Perhaps that\u2019s not surprising, given that I come from America, a country that so prides itself on self-reliance that the prospect of more affordable healthcare is still viewed by many of those who need it most as a gateway to reds under the bed.</p> <p>One of my favourite novels is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/06/kazuo-ishiguro-the-remains-of-the-day-guardian-book-club\">The Remains Of The Day</a>, again unsurprisingly, given that it consists of an outsider\u2019s take on the British character (the author, Kazuo Ishiguro, was born in Japan). The turning point in that book comes when the British aristocrat, Lord Darlington, instructs his butler, Stevens, to fire two young Jewish maids, because, well, you know. This, Ishiguro shows but never says, is an example of how the British character can go so wrong, thinking it is upholding national values but in the process betraying morality.</p> <p>How different Lord Darlington was from one of my favourite film characters, Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066817/\">Bedknobs And Broomsticks</a>, who pluckily takes in three child evacuees, even though she\u2019d only gone into town to collect her post. When I moved to Britain, Miss Price \u2013 singing her way up Portobello Road with three grubby kids in tow \u2013 pretty much summed up the British character for me. And given that my local train station for many years was Paddington, the landing spot of Britain\u2019s most famous refugee \u2013 welcomed in by the Brown family with only jars of marmalade to recommend him \u2013 this, for a long time, seemed pretty accurate. After all, as that book\u2019s author, Michael Bond, has said many times, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/jan/13/paddington-through-the-ages-michael-bond\">inspiration for his bear</a> came from his memory of child refugees during the war.</p> <p>A certain amount of idealisation is involved when it comes to defining a national character. Still, I think we can all agree that Britain\u2019s self-image is going to need some updating, because \u201cstout-hearted saviour of those in need\u201d just doesn\u2019t seem quite right for a country that completely flips its wig over the prospect of 70 child refugees. \u201cResidents of picturesque Devon village tell of their fury at \u2018bizarre\u2019 decision to send 70 young migrants there,\u201d bellowed <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3865588/Residents-picturesque-Devon-village-tell-fury-bizarre-decision-send-70-young-migrants-arrived-UK-jungle.html\">one recent headline</a>, suggesting the decision would be&#xa0;less bizarre if the \u201cyoung migrants\u201d \u2013 AKA child refugees \u2013 were sent somewhere less picturesque.

The Sun, David Davies and everyone else seeking adult faces among the child refugees claim they are merely trying to keep Britain \u201csafe\u201d for future generations; but if we\u2019re going to engage in this long-view thinking, how about looking at what kind of Britain we want our children to be defined by. There seems to be a lot of concern about the bad hombres exploiting \u201cthat famous British hospitality\u201d. I don\u2019t think we need worry about that for much longer.</p>",

Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Charles Michel, said \u201cnot a comma had changed\u201d in the 1,598-page trade treaty with Canada.<br></p> <p>After days of negotiations, Belgian representatives from the federal government and the country\u2019s five regional parliaments agreed on a four-page text to interpret the treaty. A <a href=\"http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_voici-le-texte-de-l-accord-intra-belge-sur-le-ceta?id=9441568\">leaked draft</a> shows what the Belgians agreed: for instance, the trade treaty would not change EU law, which restricts cultivation of most genetically modified crops.</p> <p>Belgian authorities have pledged to monitor socio-economic and environmental impacts of Ceta. \u201cThere are no substantial changes,\u201d said Guillaume van der Loo, a trade expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies, although he did single out one point. Belgium will ask the European court of justice to deliver a verdict on whether a new system of specially created investor courts proposed under Ceta is compatible with EU law.</p> <p>The fact that senior EU diplomats approved the Belgian text in a hastily convened meeting on Thursday suggests that national governments do not see important changes to a treaty that was seven years in the making.</p> <p>However, Kathleen van Brempt, a Belgian socialist MEP, argues that the important change is political not technical. \u201cWhat we might call a small crisis in Belgium relates very much to the way the European Union works and the way we deal with these sort of treaties.\u201d She is convinced that the EU will change how it does trade policy, leading to greater openness and transparency.<br></p> <p>In some ways, Ceta was a typical EU story: a tortuous \u201cwill they won\u2019t they\u201d wrangle that ends with a feverish round of meetings and a legal document.<br></p> <p>It was also a very Belgian story.

German judges and Austrian MPs have raised concerns about Ceta in recent months; Romania and Bulgaria threatened to veto the treaty to secure visa-free travel to Canada for their citizens. The Dutch government warned on Friday that it may have to veto a trade deal with Ukraine following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/dutch-gear-up-for-the-other-eu-vote-giving-brussels-a-headache\">referendum that was seen as a vote against Europe</a>, rather than the specifics of the bilateral treaty.<br></p> <p>The drawn-out cliffhanger over Ceta and the Dutch problem over Ukraine have prompted recriminations about how the EU manages trade negotiations.

That would mean negotiating a trade agreement in parallel with the separate article 50 divorce procedure to disentangle the UK from the EU institutions. </p> <p>Such a rapid timetable leaves legal experts wincing. \u201cNegotiating both the withdrawal agreement and the framework is a herculean task,\u201d said Catrain. \u201cOn the withdrawal agreement [alone], even two years is very tight.\u201d<br></p> <p>She advises the British government to engage with EU member states and regional parliaments if they want a trade deal.</p> <p>The British government is wary of parallels with Canada, although a government source acknowledged that Ceta showed \u201cif we do end up in a world of an FTA [free trade agreement] outside the EU it isn\u2019t going to be terribly easy\u201d. But the source rejected \u201cslightly spurious analogies\u201d with Canada. \u201cFar from a free trade deal demolishing existing barriers, as with Canada, [the UK would be] in some ways erecting barriers that used not to be there, so it is a very different process.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, any trade deal with the UK would be closely watched by EU governments. During the Canadian negotiations, the commission had free rein to negotiate the fine points on protection of Roquefort cheese or competition for maritime services, with relatively little oversight from governments. Any Brexit trade deal will be political from day one. Each member state will fight for its own interests.</p> <p>The UK will need to meet the concerns of all EU countries, stresses Van der Loo. \u201cMember states are no longer reluctant to put their foot in the door and stop an agreement in order to gain what they want.\u201d </p>",

This unusual cast is joined by three young outsiders who, each in their own way, upsets Teo\u2019s routine: Juliette\u2019s granddaughter, the sweet, innocent Dorotea; an undercover Maoist predictably called Mao; and Wilhelm (pronounced Willem), a Mormon from Utah who insists on bringing to Teo the word of the Lord.

Their stay passed well. But at a village meeting, some locals had voiced their opposition, complaining that having refugees in Chardonnay was a security risk, that they would scare children waiting for the school bus in the morning, prove damaging to the village or that house-prices would drop. One local alleged that migrants had once taken a bunch of grapes from a vine.

He said: \u201cI tell people: \u2018If my son or daughter was far away, needed help and had nothing, I would hope that someone helped them.\u2019 That often changes the way people think about it.\u201d </p> <p>He said Chardonnay had a track-record of social involvement going back to the second world war, in the French resistance and in setting up local wine co-operatives to help poverty-stricken families.

She isn\u2019t even the oddest contender in the party\u2019s current leadership race. Not by a long way. One candidate <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/10/man-who-accused-gay-donkey-trying-rape-his-horse-runs-ukip-leader\">who joined the race this week</a> was filmed in 2014 replying to an eye-wateringly homophobic question with an anecdote about the time he saw a donkey try to rape his horse. Deleted tweets by another rival <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/raheem-kassam-ukip-leadership-election-twitter-deleted_uk_580cf387e4b056572d82f392\">also surfaced this week</a>, including one in which he wished that someone would \u201ctape Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s mouth shut \u2026 and her legs, so she can\u2019t reproduce\u201d. All things being relative, it is therefore not unreasonable of Evans to cast herself as Ukip\u2019s poster girl for normality \u2013 the sage and sane choice to succeed Nigel Farage.</p> <p>So it feels fair to begin with her strong points. She was game enough to give her first big press interview to the Guardian, when the safer bet would have been a more obviously sympathetic paper. Most politicians are too wary of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/12/kitchen-miliband-photo-backfires-bbc-labour\">Ed \u201ctwo kitchens\u201d Miliband</a>-style debacle to allow an interview in their own home, so Evans\u2019 invitation to her flat in a south London suburb feels similarly spirited. But we are here on her sofa, I soon see, because even Ukip\u2019s most professional candidate does not have either the office facilities, or tactical training, of a backbench MP.</p> <p>A former BBC radio journalist who runs her own PR company, Evans looks and sounds a lot like middle England \u2013 or, as Andrew Marr put it to her on his show, Penelope Keith in The Good Life \u2013 and wants to reposition her party in that centre ground. She is, as she says many times, the \u201cmoderate, sensible\u201d face of Ukip. To date, Ukip\u2019s only unifying vision, beyond getting out of Europe, has been of a world without \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d, but anti-PC reforms Farage regarded as \u201ccommon sense\u201d are briskly ruled out by Evans.</p> <p>\u201cI actually really like the smoking ban!\u201d she exclaims with a tinkly laugh. \u201cSo I definitely disagree with Nigel on that one.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t dream of relaxing the drink-driving laws (\u201cNo, good God no, absolutely not\u201d) nor wage war on speed cameras (\u201cI am passionately anti-speeding\u201d). Not keen on gay marriage at first, she now finds it \u201ccharming\u201d, approves of gay couples adopting (\u201cGood parenting is what counts\u201d) and is delighted that bed-and-breakfast owners can no longer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/09/bed-and-breakfast-gay-couple-appeal\">turn away guests out of prejudice</a>. She did have a golliwog as a child, which she \u201cabsolutely loved,\u201d but later in life a black boyfriend \u201copened my eyes\u201d to this \u201cunacceptable stereotype\u201d, and now \u201cI totally see his point\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/suzanne-evans-declares-right-person-lead-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58zhk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2832644\"            data-video-name=\"Suzanne Evans declares herself \u2018the right person to lead Ukip\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580cc763e4b0582b9a8d5e1b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/23/161023EvansMarr_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/23/suzanne-evans-declares-right-person-lead-ukip-video\">Suzanne Evans declares herself \u2018the right person to lead Ukip\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her father died when she was six, leaving her penniless, working-class mother to raise her alone. Evans became a working single mother herself, after her brief and only marriage broke down, and raised her own daughter alone. There is nothing abstract or contrived about her emphatic feminism, and when she frames the case against multicultural Britain as a moral duty to protect ethnic-minority women from oppression, for once this argument doesn\u2019t sound like xenophobia disguised as feminism, but rings true. \u201cI will not stand by and see women in ethnic-minority communities treated worse than I am as a white, middle-class woman simply because they\u2019re in a different religion to me. It\u2019s unacceptable. Women\u2019s rights are women\u2019s rights.

Unlike most, however, she appears genuinely disgusted, not just embarrassed, by ugly comments periodically reported in the press. \u201cThere have been times when I\u2019ve cringed, it\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s not nice, being out campaigning and being called a racist in the street. Or being spat on, or being abused. Changing that unfair reputation of Ukip is vital.\u201d</p> <p>Under her leadership, Evans would make the party \u201cfriendlier, more approachable, broaden our appeal \u2026 Do we want to trot along getting one MP into parliament every general election? Or do we want to put ourselves right at the heart of British politics, and do we want to succeed? If we want to be a party that actually wins elections, we need to do better. We can\u2019t have continuity Ukip. We need to have a big change that will bring in not just 4 million but 8 million voters. I\u2019m the candidate that will expand the party, and broaden our appeal, particularly to women, and make us dramatically more electable. With me as leader of Ukip, we can have a really strong alternative to the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>If I were a Labour MP in a deprived, northern, pro-Brexit town, I\u2019d be worried by now. Only Evans\u2019 leadership rivals may be as relieved to learn that her dangerously persuasive pitch begins to fall apart once she has delivered all her pre-prepared soundbites, but still cannot stop talking.</p> <p>At first the gaffes are fairly trivial; she designates a policy to the department of trade, which ceased to exist nearly 10 years ago. She might have meant the Department for International Trade, of course, but the error is only the least bizarre element of the whole proposal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f30d19cac02284173e36ac9d915fa3f04286b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f30d19cac02284173e36ac9d915fa3f04286b1/214_0_3882_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage with Evans in April 2015, with the Ukip manifesto she helped to write.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage with Evans in April 2015, presenting the Ukip manifesto she helped to write.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we fail to agree a trade deal with the EU, and WTO tariffs are the only solution, she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll be the ones that are quids in.\u201d Everyone agrees that tariffs would damage the EU more than us, because the EU sells more to us than it buys, so has more to lose when higher prices make everything harder to sell. But Evans must have confused this relative advantage with a notion that tariffs will actually make us better off. Because she goes on, \u201cWe can use that net benefit \u2013 that net profit, if you like \u2013 to support any businesses which find that the imposition of external tariffs is causing them a problem.

You\u2019d just have to, you\u2019d just have to refund \u2013 they could make an application for support and it would come out of this pot. You\u2019d set up a pot.

You just \u2013 there would \u2013 we would have a net balance of payments, the country would be better off as a result of \u2013 it\u2019s not us that\u2019s going to lose out, it\u2019s the EU who\u2019s going to lose out. So we would have a greater income on the import tariffs that we put on the European Union. So you take those import tariffs and then you give them back to any business that\u2019s struggling and could prove there was any hardship as a result of being forced to adopt the WTO external tariff. Then I think there would arguably be a pot of money there that they could fall back on, if needs be. I don\u2019t see why that shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p> <p>There is a very simple reason why it would not be possible: it is illegal under WTO rules. But even if it weren\u2019t, the logic of her scheme is baffling. If tariffs depress sales, it\u2019s difficult to see how they can simultaneously generate a big pot of new profit. If somehow they can, it\u2019s even harder to see how we can sell less than the EU yet be the side that\u2019s \u201cquids in\u201d, and harder still to see how so much money would be allowed to bypass the treasury for the department of business. \u201cSorry, I mean it would be the department of trade.\u201d She gives a shrill, uneasy laugh. \u201cYes, sorry! Department of trade, yes. I would have thought so, yeah.\u201d By now she looks almost as embarrassed as I do. \u201cSorry.

But she carries on talking, sabotaging any impression of compassion as her tone hardens, speculating that \u201cunaccompanied\u201d minors couldn\u2019t have got to Calais alone, so must have been left there by parents who would miraculously \u201cpop up\u201d and demand to be reunited once their child had made it to Britain. As for Calais\u2019 adults, \u201cYou try and break the rules, travel across six countries to get here, because you\u2019re trying your luck, and try to knock a few lorry drivers on the head and try to burst into Britain? That\u2019s criminal behaviour, and the way these so-called refugees have behaved in Calais, and treated our truckers, is absolutely disgusting.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/18/steven-woolfe-quits-ukip-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/582tq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2816639\"            data-video-name=\"Steven Woolfe quits Ukip \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5805ea27e4b005f21833a9b8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/18/161018Woolfe_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/18/steven-woolfe-quits-ukip-video\">Steven Woolfe quits Ukip</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If elected, her first priority will be to get parliament to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, after which we can forget all about Article 50, a timewasting \u201ccon job\u201d quite unnecessary for leaving the EU.

  "<p>My beloved British friends! It has been 25 years since I threw that goodbye party in Brixton, complete with saffron-laden rice dishes, to bid you farewell before I returned to Iran. You were the cast of my life from the day I arrived as a homesick 12-year-old. From schoolgirl, to undergraduate, to Londoner, you were at my side.</p> <p>Yet, in a quarter-century, none of you has accepted my offer of coming to visit me here. The image of Iran is so calcified by its politics that not even one of your own could persuade you to come and explore for yourself. This is my last-ditch invitation: maybe you\u2019ll get over that psychological hurdle and catch the six-hour flight to Tehran.</p> <p>You will need to organise a visa and travel through a tour operator though, since Britons can\u2019t get a visa at the door, unlike many other nationalities. But that is easily done, so many Britons and Americans are visiting these days \u2013 and from Monday <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/destinations/tehran/flights-to-tehran\">British Airways has daily flights to Tehran</a> from London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/travel_iran_web/giv-14066to6i6c8mJaU/\" data-alt=\"Iran holiday guide map.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/travel_iran_web/giv-14066to6i6c8mJaU/\">Iran holiday guide map.</a> <figcaption>Map for Haleh\u2019s journey (and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/29/iran-food-tour-yasmin-khan-stews-kebabs-desserts\">Yasmin Khan\u2019s foodie tour</a>).</figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can\u2019t possibly see everything Iran has to offer in one visit, but let me take you south to the cities of central Iran, veering off the tourist map here and there.

But women visitors will need a mid-length coat, and a light cotton scarf to hang loosely over their hair.

This is where you\u2019ll get a chance to see, first-hand, the Iran you know from news bulletins. The wall murals often seen in stock media images are a great way to step into the recent history of the place. They lionise revolutionary leaders and, more poignantly, memorialise martyrs of the eight-year war with Iraq. Almost every street is named after someone lost in that war. The murals provide an insight into the country\u2019s priorities: from the zeal of early revolution and war to the contemporary penchant for the decorative. The walls of the US embassy, now officially referred to as \u201cthe nest of spies\u201d, will provide selfie backdrops to shake your Instagram feed.</p> <p>Having explored the political veneer of the city, we\u2019ll head to <a href=\"http://www.golestanpalace.ir/en/history.html\">Golestan Palace</a> in the heart of old Tehran.

There are significant historical sites in Natanz, Naeen and Ardestan, the latter home to a mosque built on the remains of a Zoroastrian fire temple dating from 1158. There\u2019s also the <a href=\"http://www.thecivilengineer.org/online-historical-database-of-civil-infrastructure/item/446-qanat-of-mun-moon-qanat\">Moon Qanat</a>, an ancient double-tier aqueduct. The underground irrigation system associated with it dates from 1,000BC, and is an early technological wonder that brought water to Persia\u2019s many arid cities, employing a system of underground wells and canals.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long journey, so we\u2019ll stop for the night at Aghda, famous for its pomegranates, where the old town has been abandoned in favour of modern housing. The mainly uninhabited neighbourhood makes for an evocative stroll. One of the larger houses has been restored as the cosy <a href=\"http://www.khaloomirzahotel.com/Uk/\">Khaloo Mirza hotel</a> (doubles from \u00a325). Here, we\u2019ll sleep on floor mats in shared rooms, traditional Iranian style.

We\u2019ll help dig the car out of soft sand as we traverse the dunes, and pitch camp ourselves \u2013 it\u2019s tents and sleeping bags here. Travellers report that they feel a surge of energy under the desert skies. Walking barefoot in the sand exfoliates your feet but it also cleanses the soul. You certainly come out of the desert feeling lighter. Maybe it\u2019s to do with the salt in the sand; these deserts were once seas. Maybe the feminine curves of the dunes suggest a softer place.

Sadly they didn\u2019t deter Alexander the Macedonian (who does not go by the title of \u201cGreat\u201d in this country) from burning the place down.</p> <p>Next morning, on our way to Isfahan, we\u2019ll stop at Pasargad, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/22/iran.worlddispatch\">Tomb of Cyrus the Great</a>, the founder of the Persian empire and the first king of Iranians. His sarcophagus stands without pomp on a windswept plain. In 1971, Mohammad Reza Shah held a huge ceremony to mark 2,500 years of monarchy in Iran. His famous words \u2013 \u201cCyrus sleep easy for we are awake\u201d \u2013 became the words of the last Iranian king to its first.

OK, I\u2019m biased (it is my home town) but this truly is the jewel in the crown. Most of what we\u2019ll see was built by Shah Abbas in the 17th century, when his capital was established here. The magnificent <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/115\">Naghshe Jahan Square</a>, with its turquoise domes, and palace of Alighapou, positioned around an old polo field, are wondrous and you\u2019ll want to see them again and again.</p> <p>This is a living and working neighbourhood: Isfahanis still come to procure spices and jewellery in the old Gheisariyeh bazaar, and the surrounding passageways bustle with artisans making handicrafts. My favourite is the coppersmiths\u2019 passage, where the cacophony of beating hammers is a centuries-old sound. Another joy is the ceiling of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Lotfollah_Mosque\">Lotfollah mosque</a>. Here, the design of the tiles creates the same sensation as watching a starry night, drawing you upwards as if falling into the sky. Not far away is the Jameh mosque, one of the oldest in the country, rebuilt in the 11th century. No colourful tiles here: the wonder is in the patterns and craftsmanship of the brickworks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23385dc00bd4b32b7c3ba2a54a60dfab83f2d315\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23385dc00bd4b32b7c3ba2a54a60dfab83f2d315/261_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fine dining \u2026 the restaurant at the Abbasi hotel, Isfahan, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fine dining \u2026 the restaurant at the Abbasi hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abassi Hotel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, a major feature of Isfahan is the river, along the banks of which Isfahanis go to take the air. There are a number of old bridges here, from the plain-brick Si-o-se pol with its 33 arches, to the Khaju bridge with its decorative motifs and tiles, where the king would sit to enjoy the sound of water falling over specially designed steps. Nowadays, the river runs dry most of the year, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Isfahanis continuing to use its banks in their leisure time.</p> <p>Staying in the <a href=\"http://abbasihotel.ir/\">Abbasi hotel</a> (doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B) is a must. The old <em>caravanserai</em> has been converted into possibly the most beautiful hotel Iran has to offer.

  "<p>Imagine a verdant, landscape filled with rice paddies, tea plantations and olive groves. A land where you can hike up mountains in the thick mist of the morning and picnic by waterfalls on sun-weathered rocks in the afternoon. A land filled with golden apricots that taste like honey, peaches so succulent you barely notice the sweet juice that runs down your chin, and small black figs, firm and velvety to the touch, that erupt with jammy stickiness as you tear them open. I enjoyed all of these delights and more when I travelled through Iran in search of the secrets of the Persian kitchen.</p> <p>On my journey, I cooked and feasted with Iranians of all walks of life who welcomed me into their homes to share their favourite recipes. In a country most commonly viewed through the narrow prism of its politics, food is a wonderful vehicle for discovery. A really good meal is something everyone can relate to.</p> <p>Those unfamiliar with Iranian food often assume that it is fiery or spicy, perhaps befitting the country\u2019s climate or politics. But it is, in fact, gentle and soothing, a poetic balance of subtle spices such as dried limes, saffron and rosewater. Slow-cooked stews, known as <em>khoresh</em>, and elaborate rice dishes layered with herbs, vegetables, nuts and dried fruit are the bedrocks of Persian cuisine, creating a dazzling mosaic of scents, textures and colours at the dining table. Regional and seasonal delicacies are plentiful, making the most of Iran\u2019s bountiful produce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21d7f404a03a76ea4d0c024551e1b49362200822\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21d7f404a03a76ea4d0c024551e1b49362200822/0_196_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional dizi stew in 2 pots with flatbread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional dizi stew is made to an ancient recipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kaveh Kazemi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My journey started in Tabriz, in north-west Iran, a place of culinary connection for centuries, a trading crossroads connecting the Caucasus, the Middle East and Europe. Tabriz was one of the capitals of the old Persian empire, famed for its bazaar, where spices from India and China were sold alongside delicate silks and intricately patterned carpets.</p> <p>Today, the bazaar is a Unesco world heritage site and nearby is one of the best places in town to sample to city\u2019s signature dish, <em>kofte tabrizi.</em> Shariar Traditional Restaurant (corner of Tarbiyat Street, +98 41 554 0057) is converted from one of the city\u2019s old hammams, and the lamb meatballs are the size of your fist, stuffed with hard-boiled eggs, walnuts and dried plums. They are served in a tomato and saffron sauce that\u2019s mopped up with warm flatbreads.</p> <p>Tabriz also has some of Iran\u2019s most comforting street food. I was shown around town by psychology student Yasamin Bahmani, who took me on a stroll around El Goli park with its famed Persian garden, insisting every few hundred metres that we stop at one of the street stalls that line the paths. We feasted on mashed potato and hard boiled eggs, smothered in thick slabs of melting butter, sprinkled with dried mint and wrapped in a warm flatbread, and tender steamed purple and yellow beetroot that we sprinkled generously with sumac.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"909a02805184b1100b2b2c2256c849318809c20a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/909a02805184b1100b2b2c2256c849318809c20a/0_5_507_304/500.jpg\" alt=\"A man roasting corn at a street stall in Darband.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man roasting corn at a street stall in Darband.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amos Chapple/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heading south, I hit the coast of the Caspian Sea and the rolling green hills of the Gilan province, famed for its river fish and caviar. The cuisine of Gilan is as green as its landscapes, making it the best place in Iran for vegetarians. Aubergines and garlic appeared at every meal, alongside the mounds of fresh coriander, parsley and dill that are used to create fragrant bases for stews and emerald-green <em>kuku</em> (a type of frittata).</p> <p>I spent an afternoon with farmer Roya Baighi, who taught me how to cook <em>torshi-tareh,</em> an elegant green stew made from herbs we picked from her garden. It was bursting with flavour and virtuosity. Gilan is also home to one of Iran\u2019s most famous dishes: <em>fesenjoon</em>, chicken poached in an earthy sweet-and-sour sauce of ground walnuts and pomegranates. I enjoyed it at Mahtab restaurant in Lahijan (Golestan Square, +98 141 422 2963), with white rice and crisp, buttery <em>tahdig,</em> the golden saffron-infused rice crust that Iranians prize so much.</p> <p>This atmospheric restaurant celebrates Gilaki culture with a menu of regional dishes, and live folk music in the evenings. It is adjacent to one of Gilan\u2019s most popular tourist attractions, Lahijan lake and promenade, which are a perfect spot to walk off any overindulgence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2dfa8b359e4a0c2de849b33a81cb363684fe9ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2dfa8b359e4a0c2de849b33a81cb363684fe9ed/0_41_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Koohpayeh restaurant in Darband.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Koohpayeh restaurant in Darband.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koohpaye Restaurant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No trip to the region would be complete without sampling <em>koloocheh</em>, small pastries stuffed with ground walnuts, cinnamon and cardamom which are the speciality of Fuman, a small town in the south-west of the province. Stalls all over town sell these baked treats and they were particularly welcome, washed down with dainty glasses of black tea, after a rigorous hike in the surrounding hills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I visited saffron farms, rosewater festivals and pomegranate orchards \u2013 finding the history behind evocative ingredients</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tehran is filled with upscale restaurants serving dishes ranging from sushi and frozen yoghurt to <em>dizi</em>, a lamb, chickpea and potato stew made to a centuries-old recipe, cooked in a clay pot for several hours until the meat is so tender it can be mashed into a paste with a fork. The best local feasting, though, is in Darband, a neighbourhood in the north of the city at the foot of the Alborz mountains. It\u2019s a district of narrow winding mountain paths lined with trees adorned with fairy lights. <a href=\"http://www.koohpayeh.com/\">Koohpayeh</a> restaurant is about a 10-minute walk up the Darband hill and provides a scenic backdrop for sampling some of the city\u2019s finest juicy lamb kebabs. Finish the night by relaxing on faded Persian carpets in one of the many small wooden pavilions up and down the road and join the locals in smoking some apple-flavoured shishas.</p> <p>In central Iran, I visited saffron farms, rosewater festivals and pomegranate orchards, discovering the history and horticulture behind Iran\u2019s most evocative ingredients. The pomegranate is indigenous to Iran and, in ancient Persian mythology, the hero warrior Isfandiar is said to have eaten its seeds and become invincible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e46b3be2999cfaf50d6955b3e080858d263efaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e46b3be2999cfaf50d6955b3e080858d263efaf/0_134_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmin Khan choosing pomegranates, the nation\u2019s favourite fruit, at an Iranian market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasmin Khan choosing pomegranates, the nation\u2019s favourite fruit, at an Iranian market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shahrzad Darafsheh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, pomegranates retain their near-mythical status and are revered as the nation\u2019s favourite fruit.

Roses are indigenous to Iran and it was here that the petals were first distilled into rosewater, over 2,500 years ago. Today, this is mainly used in desserts such as<em> faloodeh</em>, an aromatic and refreshing rosewater and lime sorbet with frozen vermicelli. The Hafez garden is one of the best places to sample this local speciality and I was taken there by Shahin Hojabrafkan, a handsome and charming secondhand car salesman. We sat overlooking Hafez\u2019s shrine, squeezing wedges of lime into our fragrant rosewater-infused sorbets and watching a steady stream of Iranians pay reverence to their most cherished poet.</p> <p>Central Iran is also home to the country\u2019s finest pistachios, which feature in both sweet and savoury dishes. My favourite way to enjoy their creamy texture is at one of the many ice-cream parlours in the ancient city of Isfahan at night, such as Mahfal ice-cream on Makineh Khajoo. One of the most moreish is <em>bastani akbar mashti</em>, a saffron and rosewater custard ice-cream flecked with toasted pistachios.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ad71215c70b4b75504081829291e21e9341bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ad71215c70b4b75504081829291e21e9341bb6/0_19_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Waiter serving lunch, Iranian style, pouring dizi stew into a bowl.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waiter serving lunch, Iranian style.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Edwards/National Geographic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final stop on my travels was the southern port town of Bandar Abbas, on the Persian Gulf. Bandar, as it is known, is a town of scorching sunshine, warm blue waters and towering palms, and was once an important post on the spice route from India to Europe. By contrast with the rest of Iranian cuisine, the food of this region is an assault on the senses \u2013 a thrilling mix of Persian, Indian and Arabian flavours. Tropical fruits, such as mangos, pineapples and guavas, are picked green and used for Indian-style pickles, and seafood from the warm Persian Gulf is stewed, grilled as kebabs, or fermented, dried and ground into powders and pastes.</p> <p>The best place to sample the day\u2019s catch is at the fish market, where burly men shout their deals of the day and women crouch on the floor next to them, deftly shelling prawns. Next to the market, a row of fish restaurants serve specialities including <em>ghaleyeh maygoo</em> \u2013 a prawn, fresh coriander and tamarind stew \u2013 and small spicy fishcakes called <em>kuku-ye mahi</em>, .</p> <p>Travellers in Iran are always met with warmth and hospitality: it is not uncommon to be invited to an Iranian home for dinner after just exchanging a few pleasantries. For those wishing to expand their culinary knowledge, or simply enjoy one of the most sophisticated cuisines in the world, Iran offers a wealth of culinary delights.

  "<h2>Snapshot: My ancestors of the \u2018lost generation\u2019</h2> <p>A simple wedding party in West Ham, London\u2019s East End, in 1923. To me, my great-grandmother and great-grandfather are easily identifiable, though they are not the bride and groom \u2013 they weren\u2019t even married when the photo was taken.</p> <p>The wedding was that of my great-grandfather\u2019s sister, Beatrice Munro, and William Ponder, a soldier who had survived all four years on the frontline of the first world war.</p> <p>My great-grandmother, Gertrude Cossey (left end of the front row), was&#xa0;a&#xa0;bridesmaid. Two year later, in 1925 she would marry the bride\u2019s brother, David Munro (middle row, fourth from right).</p> <p>After the photographer\u2019s flashbulb ignited and the picture was taken, the bride, groom and their guests were free to enjoy the day\u2019s revelry \u2013 which I have no doubt ended in an old fashioned \u201cknees-up\u201d.</p> <p>This was a single moment captured on film before they left to celebrate, wonder and plan all the things yet to come in life. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve done myself at the weddings of family and friends \u2013 and particularly at my own wedding this year.</p> <p>I\u2019m struck, looking at this wedding party across the gulf of time, that I have the privilege of knowing all the joys and sorrows that lay ahead for Gertrude, David, Beatrice and William&#xa0;in the decades that followed this snapshot.</p> <p>David died at the outbreak of the second world war, and Beatrice just after it ended. In 1950 my great-grandmother was married again \u2013 to the groom in this picture. Gertrude and William (known affectionately by my grandmother as Uncle Willie, and by my mother as a kind, gentle grandfather called Farbie) remained great companions until William died in 1968.</p> <p>Not long afterwards, Gertrude received a third marriage proposal from Daniel Munro, brother to David and Beatrice (back row, third from right), which she, well into her 70s, politely declined.</p> <p>I love this picture partly because it captures young survivors of the \u201clost generation\u201d far enough away from the&#xa0;horrors of their first war to enjoy all&#xa0;that life had to offer, before the strife and struggles of the second world war arrived.</p> <p>Yet more than that, I\u2019m drawn to the picture because this group of intertwined ancestors reminds me that we all sit, even on our most momentous days with heads full of plans, unknowing the great twists and turns that the world, and our own lives, will take in the years ahead.</p> <p><em>Lucy Williams </em></p> <h2>Playlist: A surreal sound on the beach when I was two </h2> <p><strong>Trailing Around in a Trailer by George Formby</strong></p> <p><em>\u201cI love the fresh air, it\u2019s great I declare, wide open spaces for me / With trailer and car I set out afar, a rover I meant to be / Over the hills and dales / Over the slugs and snails\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abAy3oZaWhE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/abAy3oZaWhE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It was one of those golden, still days of early summer.

  "<p>Ali Alvarez does not have many memories of her mother\u2019s death but one distressingly vivid snapshot stayed with her for years. She was 11 and attending her mom\u2019s funeral when she gazed, horrified, at her mother\u2019s body as it lay in an open casket. It was only when Ali was in her 20s and mentioned it to her dad that he corrected her: there had been no open casket and she had never seen her body. In fact, she and her brother had refused to attend the ceremony.</p> <p>More memories have resurfaced in recent years for Ali, who is 38, but they have not come through conversations with her family, or therapy, but by striking up a relationship with an insect \u2013 a monarch butterfly.</p> <p>Ali was born in Mexico, to Mexican parents who moved to Los Angeles, along with her and her older brother, when she was six. A couple of years later, her mother became ill. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it was but I knew it was cancer.\u201d She has few memories of her mother being well. \u201cMy childhood memories are mostly of her sick,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was sick for what felt a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Only a few images stayed with her: \u201cI remember her being in pain and really sick, really frail with chemo. I remember her being carried upstairs and downstairs, and I remember her puking quite a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Her dad, a rather shy civil engineer, dealt with the tragedy of her premature death by rarely mentioning it. \u201cHe never talked about my mom. There weren\u2019t pictures around the house. The good thing he did was let me throw myself into horse-riding.\u201d Ali was \u201cthe poor kid\u201d who mucked out the stables and tacked up the horses for wealthier children. She exercised horses for a showjump trainer and in return was given lessons. \u201cI was brought up by horses. I spent every hour at the stables. I\u2019d go there after school until sunset every day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34eb8d35e68db32da0de561efecc674061f58cbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34eb8d35e68db32da0de561efecc674061f58cbe/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monarch butterflies at a sanctuary in Michoacan state, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monarch butterflies at a sanctuary in Michoacan state, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alianza-WWF-Telcel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After art college, she talked herself into an internship with a big ad agency&#xa0;in London and settled there, working all hours in the high-octane advertising industry. On a rare&#xa0;sabbatical, she returned to Mexico for a month. A friend picked up a guidebook that mentioned tours to see&#xa0;monarch butterflies, which fly between North America and Mexico every year and gather in forests in huge swarms. They climbed a mountain and in a sunlit glade found thousands of brilliant orange monarchs; migrants like her.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, how come nobody\u2019s ever told me about this? My family said, \u2018Oh&#xa0;yes, we\u2019ve heard of them and know it\u2019s wonderful.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t wonderful, it totally, completely floored me. I was in awe.\u201d</p> <p>She was fascinated by this spectacular migration and its impact on those who regularly witness it. She began researching it, and discovered stories of people seeing monarchs when a loved one passed away. Ali had stumbled on a fascinating piece of symbolism that recurs in many societies, ancient and modern: the belief that butterflies represent the human soul or spirit set free.</p> <p>Late-medieval butterfly lovers in Britain saw a Christian morality tale in the lifecycle of the insect: we were industrious, greedy caterpillars, doomed to toil on this earth but each with a chance to transform ourselves into a butterfly, a soul ascending into heaven. In 17th-century Ireland, white butterflies were regarded as the souls of children. In 20th-century China, butterflies were found in the cells of executed convicts who had recently converted to Buddhism.</p> <p>Ali read some startling tales of butterflies appearing during times of mourning, including a detective who saw monarch butterflies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/18/september11.usa1\" title=\"\">rising from the dusty rubble of Ground Zero</a> after the 9/11 attacks. She also spotted how it all connected through Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead, which occurs every autumn at the time migrating monarchs return from North America to their ancestral homeland. Traditionally, the butterflies are viewed as the returning souls of the dead.</p> <p>She dreamed of making a film about this remarkable butterfly but it looked like fate would stop her. On the day she made a video to crowd-source the money for a documentary, she fell off a horse while riding through Epping forest, near London, and suffered a severe brain injury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b85b48da2cd72d5b8ad7dfcac8f9f9dce7987c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b85b48da2cd72d5b8ad7dfcac8f9f9dce7987c09/0_0_3408_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Alvarez as a baby with her mother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Alvarez as a baby with her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Ali Alvarez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Ali woke, she had no short-term memory. But one recent recollection floated into her mind \u2013<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alialvarez/the-journey-a-film-about-butterflies-people-and-ho\" title=\"\"> the Kickstarter video she\u2019d just made</a>. \u201cIt was the one thing my body held on to that day, so I placed a lot of importance on it,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018I have to make this film because some weird part of my brain remembered it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>First, she had to recover from her brain injury. For six months, she mostly slept. Her dad and his partner, Joan, moved from California to London to help look after her and she had to teach herself to walk and write again. While she was still in hospital, her dad told Ali it was 1 October and asked her if she knew its significance. She suddenly remembered it was her partner Verity\u2019s birthday. When Verity arrived for her daily visit, Ali sang happy birthday as she walked into the hospital room \u201cand I remembered everything from that moment on. Doctors say sometimes you just need a trigger in your brain to make you snap back into it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/99648728\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/99648728\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Muerte Es Vida.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After her injury, she could not return to full-time work and, at her second attempt, raised enough money on Kickstarter to make her documentary. She also got on a horse again because she needed to ride one up the Mexican mountains to film the butterflies. When she first got back on a horse, with her former riding trainer in California, \u201cthere, suddenly, in the riding arena was a monarch butterfly. I\u2019d never seen one there before. They are pretty mystical creatures.\u201d</p> <p>When Ali travelled to rural Mexico to film the monarchs, she was not immediately welcomed: people were suspicious of the cameras, and didn\u2019t believe she was Mexican because her Spanish sounded so North American. She chatted to a woman from the conservation charity <a href=\"http://www.alternare.org/\" title=\"\">alternare.org</a> who was putting her up for the night and mentioned her mother originally came from San Juan de los Lagos, a renowned place of pilgrimage. Her conservationist friend suggested Ali tell local people that fact when she tried filming the next day. \u201cThe moment I said it, local people literally opened their doors and said, \u2018Come in.\u2019 We had the best day filming.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/monarch-butterflies-migration-mexico-declines\">Monarch butterfly migration to Mexico jumps after years of decline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a small example of how Ali feels that the film, and her own life, has been touched by her mother. \u201cWhat is this weird confidence that I have?\u201d she says. \u201cI just seem to have this luck and spirit of trying stuff and succeeding.\u201d She spoke to her aunty, who told her: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re just finishing off what your mom didn\u2019t have time to do.\u2019 I do kind of feel that in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Without meaning to, Ali\u2019s film about the wondrous migration of the monarchs metamorphosed into an exploration of bereavement and recovery: <a href=\"http://muerteesvida.com/\" title=\"\">Muerte Es Vida (Death is Life)</a>. \u201cI thought I was making a film about butterflies and it ended up being a documentary about death, in a really beautiful, gentle way,\u201d she says. \u201cThis film was 100% made because of the loss of my mom.

Their mom considered the gift a bit silly but the children enjoyed watching the caterpillars grow and create its chrysalis. Sam passed away and the whole family found themselves anxiously waiting to see if the butterfly would emerge. On the day of Sam\u2019s funeral, the monarch flew free from its&#xa0;chrysalis.</p> <p>In rural Mexico, Ali was struck by the degree of comfort provided by the Day of the Dead celebrations. \u201cIt\u2019s a really amazing tradition \u2013 one day of the year that you talk about people who passed away, build an altar, bring up stories. You\u2019re not left alone in your grief and in your memory of a person. Everyone in your neighbourhood comes together to tend to the graves and you\u2019d see little kids and dogs and aunties running around the cemetery. We never did that. We have such an isolated way of dealing with death. I\u2019m really proud of the way Mexico deals with death traditionally \u2013 I want to share that with people.\u201d</p> <p>Her dad has watched Muerte Es Vida&#xa0;twice, and it encouraged them to talk about their loss a little more. For this story, Ali was asked for old photos&#xa0;of her and her mom. She didn\u2019t&#xa0;think any existed, but she emailed her dad in California and he sent her 50. \u201cMy memories were of her&#xa0;really sick, hospitals and doctors but the pictures&#xa0;were typical happy family pictures \u2013 camping trips, walking the dog. There were really happy times and we did normal things and we were&#xa0;in the sunshine, like everybody else. I cried. It was like looking at someone else \u2013 that little girl who lost her mum.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, Ali sees how the act of making Muerte Es Vida has drawn her closer to the biggest bereavement in her life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t uncomfortable with it before but I feel really at peace with it now,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing the people in this film and their way of dealing with it, they are so positive about things, it\u2019s been really healing for me.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Watch the trailer and sign up for the latest screening information for Muerte Es Vida at </em><a href=\"http://muerteesvida.com/\" title=\"\"><em>muerteesvida.com</em></a></p>",

  "<p>The upheaval in Syria unfolded fast. It left Abd al-Rahman\u2019s entire family dead.

In Spain the young man found his Berber and Syrian kin, and with their support in AD756 he established himself as governor of the frontier state of C\u00f3rdoba.</p> <p>A political refugee, Abd al-Rahman founded the great European caliphate of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Abd-Al-Rahman-Makers-Muslim-World/dp/185168509X\">al-Andalus</a>. The Christians of C\u00f3rdoba embraced every aspect of Arabic style, from philosophy to mosque architecture.

Abd al-Rahman\u2019s new Andalusian estate was a replica of the one in Syria. He turned to poetry \u2013 another Arab practice from pre-Islamic times. He wrote an ode to a palm tree in his garden in Cordoba: <em>How like me you are, far away and in exile; in long separation from family and friends. You have sprung from soil in which you are a stranger; and I, like you, am far from home</em>.</p> <p>In 1991 \u2013 unaware of exile literature and barely capable of reading and writing in English \u2013 I wrote in my diary: \u201cThere are people all around me; curious faces talking. They want to hear me speak. I, in my language; they, in theirs! The sound of my prose, alien in their books, speaks of the strangeness of all I see. They listen and nod, without understanding. The dialect of my past negates their articulation of everything present.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, we were the only Afghan family in the Canadian maritime province of New Brunswick. Host families, classmates and new neighbours in the city of Moncton took a great interest in welcoming us, but it all seemed unreal. People living for generations in stability and relative prosperity could know precious little about what used to be our life \u2013 sleeping amid the sound of rockets and Stinger missiles and the fear of death in our Afghan streets. For me, at the time, poetry was not an escape from reality; it was a link between the past and present. The familiar rhythm and sound of my mother\u2019s tongue eased the pain of separation; language became one way of keeping in direct contact with that past and the memories of the world I had left behind.</p> <p>We had fled Kabul in 1989, aware of the risks in making the journey on foot through the villages and mountains of Afghanistan. Fear of death was at every step, but it was the hope of a life in front of us that kept us walking. When living conditions become unbearable and when dying is what is left of life \u2013 as it is for Syrians, Libyans, Iraqis, Afghans and so many others who are on the move today \u2013 then taking the risk to walk, to swim, to get on a boat, even knowing it\u2019s not seaworthy, seems less dangerous. At least there is a chance to survive and reach a place of safety.</p> <p>As horrifying as the hardship and danger involved in this voyage to a new life may be, from a refugee\u2019s perspective the inner journey of realisation of the loss of one\u2019s home is almost as difficult and painful. The perils of the physical journey are visible, but the inner turmoil of loss is hard to express. A few words \u2013 \u201cexile\u201d, \u201crefugee\u201d, \u201cmigrant\u201d \u2013 are supposed to symbolise a whole range of experiences.</p> <p>When we gave up our home, left relatives and friends behind and took to the road to reach Pakistan, so many psychological borders had already been crossed. When today I see columns of people leaving homes, towns and cities, I hear the demand that these refugees respect the west\u2019s geographical borders. What this fails to understand is that those borders have already been crossed in the refugee\u2019s mind. By the time the refugee reaches a frontier, national boundaries have already become irrelevant \u2013 except in the form of another obstacle to overcome. What is the power of a barbed-wire fence or a concrete wall in the face of all the risks taken to find peace and safety?</p> <p>For the refugee, the feeling of loss is not just about physical place; it is about the shift in one\u2019s sense of identity. Turning from an individual with a recognised name and address, family ties and community connections, into a category \u2013 the \u201crefugee\u201d, the \u201cmigrant\u201d \u2013 is unsettling. You start to feel a stranger to yourself.</p> <p>And in order not to lose a grip on one\u2019s identity, the refugee begins to hold on to memories, as painful as they may be, or to tangible things: items of clothing, pictures, from \u201cback home\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc8b45afe0ada6ae915f3389ced95a0d0ca70c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc8b45afe0ada6ae915f3389ced95a0d0ca70c1f/388_93_2487_1492/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees in the Mediterranean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When dying is what is left of life, ttaking the risk to walk, to swim, to get on a boat, even knowing it\u2019s not seaworthy, seems less dangerous.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father carried a suit all the way from Kabul to Moncton, via Pakistan. It hung in his closet in Canada, neatly covered by clear plastic sheets. He didn\u2019t wear it, but he still put it on or often held the suit in front of him just to see himself in the mirror. \u201cI look the same,\u201d he used to say. He could no longer practice medicine \u2013 in Afghanistan, he was a proud pediatrician \u2013 but each time he looked at his image in that simple suit, it became a marker of his existence, his education, his dignity.</p> <p>Unlike Abd al-Rahman, my father did go back to his house after the fall of the Taliban government in Kabul. But after six weeks he quietly abandoned the thought of living and working in Afghanistan again. The world he\u2019d returned to was now even more alien to him than the \u201cstrange\u201d one he had come to experience in Canada. The brutality of the civil war had defaced Kabul, and the curtain of darkness the Taliban had left behind was too much to bear. A man who had tried to remain the same through the years of exile, protecting and preserving what was considered Afghan, was now shocked by the changes in his native home.</p> <p>When I went back to Kabul after 13 years and found the city of my childhood shattered and destroyed, populated by men with guns and women shrouded in burqas, I felt uneasy; not just because they were troubling things to see, but because of the pain of not being able to understand it. It was then that I realised what displacement meant: an abiding anguish, a feeling of eternal dissolution and non-belonging. Displacement is a horrible experience. Once you have been uprooted, it is difficult to find that place of inclusion or acceptance. The degradation one suffers is often silent. It\u2019s justified on the basis of desperation, and tolerated because of the hope that displacement is temporary. For the hundreds of thousands of last year\u2019s refugees into Europe \u2013 most rotting away in centres \u2013 hope diminishes faster.</p> <p>My cousins \u2013 three young men in their early 20s \u2013 finished high school in Kabul. Lack of hope for their future and increased insecurity, and the return of the Taliban, forced them to flee to Turkey, survive a boat journey into Greece, and walk with the cortege of the displaced across a number of European borders, dependent on the mercy of strangers who gave them water and food. They finally arrived in Germany last autumn. Now in a refugee camp they fill their days with waiting, posting selfies on social media, and memories of their sad lives; they too speak of fear, questions and forebodings. Most refugees today are fully aware of the economic problems facing Europe and America. But what the west used to represent was respect for humanity and justice, value for human life and dignity. The so-called refugee crisis of the past year has changed that, exposing an uglier face. In the loud nationalistic chatter and the almost unspoken rejection of Muslims landing in Europe, the main concern of political leaders has been either the protection of their parties, their own positions, or Europe\u2019s \u201cChristian\u201d identity and its economic interests.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I went back to Kabul and found the city of my childhood shattered, I realised what displacement meant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My father still has his suit: before he used to lament the loss of his old life, now he is in mourning for all humans who are forced to flee their homes. At home in Ottawa, he watches the news, his own compatriots made refugees again and again over three generations; he sees the plundering of Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen \u2013 and says he has no words to describe how it feels for him, as a refugee.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t take his suit out any more. In the wisdom of his late 70s, the symbolism of that garment has lost its importance, but the significance of his identity as a refugee has become more relevant. \u201cWe were lucky to escape when we did,\u201d he tells me. \u201cPeople were more open-minded, Muslims weren\u2019t terrorists, and we were fortunate to come to Canada.\u201d</p> <p>His gratitude shames me, a western-educated woman. I wanted to be part of a better world, one that could inspire another al-Andalus \u2013 where people of diverse faiths, cultures and histories could live as one community in justice and equality. But I\u2019m struggling these days to fight to protect a recent past that allowed me to do what I do now \u2013 because I see it is dissipating fast into dogmatism and prejudice, where the translation of \u201cnever again\u201d has been lost to intolerance, fear and insecurity.</p> <p>\u2022 A longer version of this article will appear in the December issue of the Dutch journal Nexus</p>",

Like [this] whole thing is fucking insane.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for Clinton, in July the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a> eventually decided to let this potentially illegal evasion of security protocol pass with a sharp wrap on the knuckles.</p> <p>There was an audible intake of breath among campaign followers in the summer, when Comey criticised her for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/fbi-no-charges-hillary-clinton-email-investigation\">decision not to recommend criminal charges</a>brought to an end the one threat deemed capable of preventing her from becoming president.</p> <p>That was, at least, until Comey dropped a fresh bombshell. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juddzeez/status/792051041399439360\">three-paragraph letter</a> he released to Congress on Friday revealing the existence of potentially significant new evidence may or not have any legal bearing on whether charges are again possible. It certainly had a political impact.</p> <p>Clinton was in the air when the letter leaked. An onboard Wi-Fi outage meant she may not have discovered its existence at all until her plane landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just down the road from her very first event as a candidate on 14 April 2015.<br></p> <p>There was a long delay in her leaving the plane as aides urgently gathered onboard to discuss the issue. A planned photoshoot with Annie Leibowitz had to be cut short. Her opponent wasted no time pointing out that it is never a good look for a presidential candidate to be under criminal investigation by the FBI.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,\u201d was Donald Trump\u2019s predictable hyperbole at a rally minutes later in New Hampshire. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats rushed to downplay its significance on Friday, as campaign chairman John Podesta suggested Comey may have been \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d by aggressive Republicans into announcing a relatively minor wrinkle for the sake of transparency.</p> <p>The investigation had still not officially been closed, so it is also oversimplifying to say, as many initially did, that it has been \u201creopened\u201d. The fact that the evidence in question reportedly comes from separate investigation into a sex scandal engulfing Anthony Weiner, the estranged of husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s key aides, should make it less relevant to her security case, not more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-election-voters\">Hillary Clinton's email woes refuse to go away \u2013 what does this latest twist mean?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5813bd27e4b08d944ba4bbfc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-28T21:04:40.151Z\">10.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Lisbon, Maine, nearly an hour after he was scheduled to appear - there was an issue with the stairs on his plane - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told a room full of supporters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers when she served as secretary of state is \u201cthe biggest political scandal since Watergate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe FBI, after discovering new emails, is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said, inaccurately. \u201cI have great respect for the FBI for righting this wrong.

But it\u2019s a great relief that Pence is going anywhere, after what happened to his plane last night.</p> <h2>Pence plane overshoots runway</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/mike-pences-unharmed-after-plane-slides-off-runway-at-new-york-airport-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59tdc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2847837\"            data-video-name=\"Mike Pence's unharmed after plane slides off runway at New York airport \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5812a0bde4b08d944ba4b729\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/28/161028pence_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/28/161028pence.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/28/161028pence_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/28/mike-pences-unharmed-after-plane-slides-off-runway-at-new-york-airport-video\">The aftermath: Pence plane slides off runway at New York airport</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Pence</a> emerged unscathed after his plane skidded off the runway while landing at LaGuardia airport in New York in heavy rain.</p> <p>The Boeing 737 carrying Trump\u2019s running mate came in for a landing and went off the runway at about 7.40pm local time.
