Unless the authorities do the right thing, it is likely many children will now go missing or attempt more dangerous crossings to reach family in the UK.\u201d<br></p> <p>Help Refugees\u2019 legal action, which could trigger a judicial review, argues that Rudd has failed in urgent \u201crelocation duties to unaccompanied children in Europe\u201d, particularly under the so-called Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Under this amendment, introduced by Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who arrived in the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee, the government pledged \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to \u201cmake arrangements to relocate to the UK\u201d a number of unaccompanied refugee children. Since the act was passed it appears that no children have arrived in the UK under its provisions.</p> <p>In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/04/amber-rudd-comes-down-on-immigration-and-foreign-workers-video\">speech to the Conservative party conference</a> earlier this week, Rudd set out a commitment to help some of the children in Calais. \u201cThere are vulnerable, unaccompanied children in Calais at risk of people-trafficking and abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere those children have a relative in the UK, or it is in their best interests to come to the UK, we are doing all we can to bring them over here.\u201d</p> <p>But Lord Dubs said he was disappointed that the government was muddling its obligation to reunite refugee families. His broader campaign is to persuade the government to take its share of the 80,000 estimated unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Europe, regardless of whether they have relatives in the UK. \u201cI think it is a real cheat,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">\u2018It is a disgrace to Europe\u2019: former child refugee Lord Dubs on the Calais camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has tabled an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/call-to-bring-child-refugees-in-calais-under-uk-safeguarding-rules\">amendment to the government\u2019s child welfare bill</a>, aiming to give young refugees in Calais protection under British safeguarding rules, said she was worried by the slowness of the government\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cTime is running out. Unless we step into the breach it will be a disaster. We haven\u2019t got any more time for saying it is complicated. We need a process now. The government can\u2019t just wait it out and hope the problem goes away,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, has called for Britain and France to take half the unaccompanied children in Calais each. \u201cThe foot-dragging and the buck-passing between the French and British governments over the children in Calais is a disgrace. It is quite incredible that there is only a week to go before the camp is cleared but still no plan for the children who are there alone.\u201d</p> <p>But concern about the fate of the unaccompanied children in Calais is increasingly cross-party. This week 10 Conservative MPs wrote to Rudd urging her to speed up her response to the crisis. Damian Collins, MP for Folkestone and Hythe, who did not sign the letter but visited the camp last week, said he was shocked by what he saw.</p> <p>\u201cWalking around it you have to remind yourself that you are still in Europe and not on the edge of a warzone,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.damiancollins.com/blog/2016/10/my-visit-to-the-calais-jungle/\">wrote in a blogpost</a>. \u201cIt is clear that no concerted effort has yet been made to find alternative places for the migrants, or to ensure that their asylum claims have been processed.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said it was working with the French government to speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to the UK, \u201cwhere this is in their best interests\u201d. It said a UK expert has been seconded to the French interior ministry in Paris, to help with the process.</p>",

But the only instruction the British people gave on 23 June was to leave the European Union. They did not issue an edict demanding the most extreme rupture possible, one bound to imperil our economy and rip away at the fabric of our society.</p> <p>Yet that\u2019s what our politicians seem bent on. Right now, the government could have been devoting itself to a diplomatic offensive aimed at persuading the EU\u2019s 27 other members to grant us a Norway-plus arrangement, allowing us to enjoy the benefits of single market membership with a degree of flexibility on how free movement is implemented. (Bear in mind that not all the four core freedoms are applied absolutely: there are exceptions to the free movement of services, for example. Recall too that what Europe originally enshrined in treaty was free movement of labour, not people: that too could allow for some British leeway.) Yes, it would have been a big ask. But with the moral mandate of the referendum behind her, Theresa May would have been hard for the EU 27 to refuse outright.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56cdg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2784418\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f78d10e4b0e4aaeaa8ce42\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/07/161007HollandeBrexit_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733801&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/07/francois-hollande-uk-must-pay-price-for-brexit-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: UK must pay price for Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, the government keeps slamming its fist on the table and insisting on the worst possible deal for Britain. No to the single market, says May. Liam Fox wants to go further, exiting the European customs union as well. Economists warn that if we do that, it won\u2019t just be jobs, investment and people that will steer clear of Britain the day after we leave: basic food imports won\u2019t be allowed in either. We currently lack the basic trade agreements we\u2019d need on day one outside the EU. They will not fall into our lap automatically, and will take a lot longer than two years to negotiate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we are methodically trashing our brand, the very international reputation that has made us an attractive place to invest, visit or live. Most countries long to bring in the best and the brightest. We seem determined to turn them away. This week the government signalled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/jeremy-hunt-accused-devaluing-contribution-foreign-doctors-to-uk\">foreign-born doctors and students</a> that they are no longer wanted here, as well as warning diverse, global companies they will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\">named and shamed</a> for the crime of drawing on a wide, international pool of talent. On Friday the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/lse-brexit-non-uk-experts-foreign-academics\">London School of Economics claimed</a> the government had told its non-British experts on Europe that their wisdom was not wanted. The Foreign Office rejected that claim. But a desire to purge ourselves of foreigners does seem to be turning into a fever: hot, irrational and ugly.</p> <p>And all this while telling EU residents who have made their homes in Britain that they are to be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/liam-fox-refuses-to-guarantee-right-of-eu-citizens-to-remain-in-uk\">one of our main cards</a>\u201d in future negotiations with the EU \u2013 as if, should Britain not get what it wants, it <a href=\"http://reaction.life/may-government-making-big-mistake-eu-immigration/\">might actually deport</a> up to 3 million people who came here legally and in good faith. It\u2019s one thing to listen respectfully to those millions of leave voters who want a say over how future migration works. It is quite another to demonise, and terrify, those who are already here.</p> <p>To do all this, May has had to rewrite the history of 23 June. No longer the winner in a fairly narrow vote of 52% to 48%, leave was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37563510\">recast in the PM\u2019s conference speech</a> as a mass consensus, the unambiguous stance of the great British public. All that had ever stood in their way was a liberal, monied elite, the Davos set of footloose globetrotters devoid of national allegiance, citizens of the world and therefore citizens of nowhere. Before our very eyes the 48% are being rebranded as the 1%.</p> <p>What\u2019s so odd about this is that it is former remainers who are doing it. Recall that May stood \u2013 not very visibly, it\u2019s true \u2013 alongside those who wanted to stay in the EU. Amber Rudd, she of the foreigners\u2019 lists, confronted Boris Johnson in a TV debate. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary now eager to denude the NHS of the world\u2019s best medical talent, was a remainer too. They are engaged in a collective act of over-compensation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">frantically mouthing</a> the prayers of the new religion now that the old one has been banished as heresy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jul/07/the-far-right-are-coming-brexit-has-helped-them-along-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4zxz3\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2599536\"            data-video-name=\"The far right are coming: Brexit has helped them along \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-577d2105e4b07cec9883d16a\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11675407&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11675407&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11675407&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/06/160706RandeepRameshCiF_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11675407&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jul/07/the-far-right-are-coming-brexit-has-helped-them-along-video\">The far right are coming: Brexit has helped them along</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So who will speak for the 48%? They \u2013 we \u2013 are not looking for a champion who will pretend that the referendum never happened, but one who will fight for a Brexit that does not deprive us of all we cherished in our relationship with Europe. It means arguing for a sane, practical deal that serves, rather than harms, our national interest \u2013 and that could then be put to the British people in an election or even, if that\u2019s what it takes, another referendum. It means challenging, for instance, Fox\u2019s ludicrous, dogmatic search for commerce with every far-flung corner of the planet except the 500 million-strong market on our doorstep with whom we currently do nearly half our trade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2016/oct/04/the-pound-is-worth-less-but-what-does-it-mean-for-brits\">The pound is worth less \u2013 but what does it mean for Brits?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key arena for this battle will be parliament.

The Lib Dems are too few, though <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/clegg_free_trade_deal_with_the_eu_isn_t_possible_in_two_years\">on this</a> Nick Clegg is a serious asset. Tory remainers still outnumber leavers in the Commons, but they\u2019ve gone quiet, with a few laudable exceptions. They need to rediscover their voice \u2013 not least because, as our politics currently stands, it is the challenge from within that threatens May most.</p> <p>Those MPs, of all parties, have a solemn responsibility. But it cannot fall on them alone. We the 48% have to speak for ourselves \u2013 and halt this march into madness.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 October 2016.

Rosie and I were keen to continue these negotiations this week and tried to arrange meetings with the leader\u2019s office to come to an agreement as soon as possible.</p> <p>However, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was underway, which had not been discussed or mentioned.</p> <p>It now seems to me that the party\u2019s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.</p> <p>Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events.

Even so, many prominent City figures believe computerised trading was behind the fall, with programs called Cowpox and Triple Threat mentioned as possible instigators of the slide.</p> <p>Earlier there had been speculation that the fall was due to a \u201cfat finger\u201d trade, where a dealer types an incorrect figure into their terminal, which could also have set off the computerised sell programmes. Dealers pointed out, however, that such trades would have since been cancelled if that were the case.</p> <p>Others said the fall may have been linked to a technicality, the expiry of foreign exchange options on Friday, with banks hedging their exposure to anticipated currency movements. On top of that, major institutions often have instructions in place to sell investments if they fall below a certain level, and some of these so-called stop-losses could have been triggered by the sudden plunge in the pound.</p> <p>A definitive answer may never emerge, because the foreign exchange market has no central trading system, which makes it difficult to track deals. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/confusion-as-pound-falls-10-in-insane-asian-trading-and-no-one-knows-why\">The Bank of England</a>, which had already been on alert for the impact of computer trading on markets, is investigating. It said: \u201cWe are looking at the causes of the sharp falls overnight,\u201d and later added it had asked the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 which represents the world\u2019s central banks \u2013 to look into what prompted the flash crash.</p> <p>Sterling struggled to regain ground during the day, but recovered to $1.2461 after worse than expected US employment figures hit the dollar. Analysts expect the currency to remain under pressure thanks to the uncertainty around Brexit \u2013 and they said another sudden drop was not out of the question.</p> <p>Brooks said: \u201cThis highlights the drawback of machines making trading decisions. However, it is the reality, and it is only getting more popular. Thus, another flash crash is possible. If there is , the pound is vulnerable because such unstable forces are driving it.\u201d</p> <p>Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac, said that sterling had been on a precipice since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/mays-conservative-party-conference-speech-key-points-analysed\">May\u2019s speech at the Conservative party conference</a>. \u201cI think we\u2019ve underestimated how many people had money positions for a very wishy-washy Brexit, or even none,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/06/theresa-may-has-ditched-osborneomics-but-what-will-she-replace-it-with\">Theresa May has ditched Osbornomics, but what will she replace it with?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking in Washington, the British chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: ,\u201cIt has taken us a little while to persuade the markets and investors that Brexit will happen. This week the final foot dropped. Those who thought it is not going to happen have taken on board that it is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said he did not expect market turbulence to drive the pound consistently lower. Accepting that there would be \u201cbumps in the road\u201d during the negotiations, he said the currency would have ups and downs as people weighed up the opportunities as well as the costs of leaving the EU.</p> <p>The HSBC strategist David Bloom said he expected the pound to fall to $1.10 and to parity with the euro by the end of 2017. Analysts at the Japanese financial group Daiwa were more pessimistic: \u201cSterling\u2019s all-time low against the dollar was $1.05. If the government keeps careering headlong into a hard Brexit, a return to those lows is not unimaginable.\u201d</p> <p>So bad news for sterling, and holidaymakers, with or without another flash crash.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump faces a must-win presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states.<br></p> <p>With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">has seen his September polling gains wiped out</a> and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House.</p> <p>A live debate always raises the prospect of the ill-disciplined Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters.</p> <p>Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union vice-president Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: \u201cImmigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected ... so they can go ahead and vote before the election.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig statement, fellas,\u201d Trump said, motioning to reporters. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to write it. That\u2019s huge. But they\u2019re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate. Both candidates face a test of stagecraft on Sunday in what has become popularly known as a \u201ctown hall\u201d format for their second showdown in St Louis, Missouri, moving around a stage with handheld microphones as they field questions from voters.</p> <p>The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election. As a voter stood to ask George H W Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch, an image that seemed to reinforce criticism that he lacked empathy. Clinton\u2019s husband Bill won the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/us-presidential-debates-famous-moments\">Make or break: the defining moments of presidential debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2000 George W Bush was answering a question on leadership during such a forum when Vice-President Al Gore rose from his chair and walked peculiarly close to his Republican rival. Bush turned and gave Gore a nod and a smile, prompting audience laughter. </p> <p>Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesperson for Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz, said of Trump: \u201cFrom what I can tell from the polls, his prospects in the election are bleak. He\u2019s going to need a game-changing win in the debate if he\u2019s going to stand any chance in November.\u201d </p> <p>But the town hall format will not necessarily suit him. \u201cHe\u2019s just not an impressive performer when it comes to answering people\u2019s questions,\u201d Tyler added. \u201cHe\u2019s not grounded in policy, foreign or domestic. He doesn\u2019t give a lot of thought to issues. He\u2019s missing empathy; when someone asks a question, he has trouble connecting at their level.</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll win it. She has so much more experience at this. She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does.\u201d</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">Real Clear Politics polling average</a>, Clinton is currently 4.5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a two-way race, a poll position that would <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html\">translate to</a> at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for. </p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact.</p> <p>A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a 46-41% lead over Trump in Florida, 46-43% in North Carolina and 45-41% in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by 47-42% in Ohio.</p> <p>Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: \u201cDebates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have election-changing influence. Right now it\u2019s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people\u2019s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally.</p> <p>\u201cIn some of the swing states, there\u2019s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race.\u201d</p> <p>The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than two-to-one that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: \u201cThe poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate.\u201d</p> <p>Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to early-voting provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton\u2019s momentum.</p> <p>Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-the-clear-winner-in-town-hall-debate-featuring-only-himself\">a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire</a> but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator.</p> <p>Trump told the small crowd: \u201cThis isn\u2019t practice; this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn\u2019t practice, we just wanted to be here.\u201d<br></p> <p>And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. \u201cI said, \u2018Forget debate prep.\u2019 I mean, give me a break. She\u2019s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That\u2019s fine. But the narrative is so foolish.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who performed well in the town hall format during his failed presidential campaign and is helping the nominee get ready.</p> <p>The Clinton camp has said it expects Trump to have done more homework this time. \u201cBut even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get a second chance to make a first impression,\u201d Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said.</p>",

I am worried that we'll become an isolated island and the world will move forward while we struggle to keep up in terms of diplomacy, science, economic and culture. What good is it to speak of global trade when shutting the doors at the same time. Why cut ties with the largest market in the world where we export 50%, half of our trade to and to pay for visas to travel only 20 odd miles across the channel. That doesn't make sense. Our NHS will crash and companies and farms relying on migrant workers because we don't want to do those kind of jobs any more will suffer. The pound is tumbling.

First, the contrast with Labour\u2019s conference the preceding week. The Tories judge that their main opponents are out of commission \u2013 desperately divided and culturally remote from the voters who swing marginal seats. Second, Theresa May has embraced Brexit with sufficient gusto, despite her quiet endorsement of the remain campaign, that Conservative pro-Europeanism has been almost entirely marginalised. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The political landscape as viewed from Downing Street is now a subset of Tory internal politics.

Mindful of that problem, May used her main conference speech to appropriate the referendum result for her own project. It was a shrewd rhetorical strategy. She set out the causes of support for the Leave campaign in broad cultural terms \u2013 a sense of dislocation, resentment of liberal elites, economic insecurity \u2013 so that she might then present herself and her government as the solution. It was, in essence, a mandate-grab to obviate the charge that she is somehow obliged to simply continue on the basis of David Cameron\u2019s manifesto. <br></p> <p>Whether it works will depend on how smoothly she can navigate Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. It is likely to dominate everything, cause great economic turbulence and crowd out almost every other government ambition.

She didn't rose tint things, but she talked about how her interactions with people with Down Syndrome had positively impacted on her, and how it's now the best time ever to be a person with Down Syndrome. I'll never forget her opening words: &quot;Nothing I'm about to say will change the fact that this is a beautiful baby girl&quot;. If only she could have told us how amazing our daughter would be. Not only is she a spunky and determined wee lady, but cognitive testing shows she has no intellectual disability. She is in the 50th percentile for all children. I'm absolutely for a women's right to choose, but I honestly don't know what we would have done if we'd known before her birth. I do know that from time to time when she does something so typical of a child her age, I get an overwhelming wave of guilt that we might have prevented her from being because of our own fears and sense of being unable to cope.

  "<p>A ground assault on Mosul, the last major Islamic State stronghold in Iraq, is due to be launched by the end of the month, with Iraqi troops moving into their final staging positions to the south of the city.</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad expect the push to begin around 15 October, although US officials who have trained and advised Iraqi forces for the past two years are understood to be less focused on a fixed date and are making plans for the battle to start up to 10 days later.</p> <p>But, while victory over the terror group appears very likely, gnawing doubts remain over what comes next.</p> <p>While military moves are at an advanced stage, the questions of how to provide for up to 1.3 million refugees, or how to re-establish governance in a city brutalised by two years of tyranny is increasingly consuming aid agencies and regional officials, some of whom believe that whatever emerges from Mosul will determine the fate of Iraq.</p> <p>Sectarian concerns have dominated pre-battle planning, with Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces who have played vital roles in the war against Isis not slated to enter the largely Sunni Muslim city. The Iraqi military, which is largely made up of Shia soldiers and officers, will take the lead in the battle, with up to three divisions \u2013 roughly 45,000 men \u2013 advancing from positions near the Qaiyara airbase 30 miles south.</p> <p>Isis is thought to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members prepared to defend their last redoubt in Iraq, where in June 2014 the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, used the city\u2019s Nouri mosque to declare the establishment of a caliphate and himself as leader. Since then, Mosul has been central to the group\u2019s ambitions to spread its ruthless interpretation of Islamic law throughout the Arab world and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/iraqi-kurdish-peshmerga-fear-isis-chemical-attack-mosul\">Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga ask UK for help against Isis chemical attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An Iraqi security source said: \u201cWhen you have one million people you have to be precise with each attack; it requires really good intelligence that will slow things down. Anyone who says it is going to take two weeks or two months does not know. We will see early on when the process has started, but we do not want to end up like Ramadi with 80% of the city destroyed, and then mass unemployment, because that is a breeding ground for terrorism. You could just end up with a more brutal version of [Isis].\u201d</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad, Washington and Erbil expect a long and difficult fight, complicated by the deployment of mines and explosives on a much larger scale than seen in other cities that Isis seized and then lost, such as Tikrit, Ramadi and Falluja.</p> <p>More pressing, though, is how to cater for what will potentially be the largest single refugee exodus at any point since mid-2014. Up to 500,000 residents are expected to move into Kurdish-controlled areas to the east, while at least 500,000 more could flee to areas controlled by the Iraqi military to the south or west.</p> <p>Unicef says more than 213,000 people have fled Mosul since May this year, and more than 3.3 million people have been displaced across Iraq since early 2014.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 700,000 people are likely to require shelter and other life-saving assistance,\u201d said Unicef Middle East and North Africa spokesperson, Farah Dakhlallah. \u201cFamilies are undertaking terrifying journeys through active conflict zones littered with unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive devices, often at night, sometimes walking up to 60km to escape to safety.\u201d</p> <p>Unicef says its aid efforts are $13m (\u00a310.4m) underfunded. Other agencies report similar shortfalls. Kurdish officials have prepared 20 refugee camps near the town of Makhmour, south-east of Mosul.</p> <p>Iraq\u2019s counter-terrorism forces, which performed well in the four-week battle to retake Falluja in June, are expected to lead the fight. Peshmerga units are planning to take up blocking positions to the north and east, where they will also receive and screen refugees. The Popular Mobilisation Units, known in Iraq as Hashd al-Shabi, have been confined to a blocking role to the west of Mosul, over concerns their presence could amplify sectarian tensions that had remained high throughout the post-Saddam years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/mosul-the-city-that-will-define-not-just-iraqs-war-but-its-future\">Mosul: suspicion and hostility cloud fight to recapture Iraqi city from Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those tensions had peaked before Isis swept into the city in June 2014. As the terror group arrived, Iraqi forces who were mostly Shia and had alienated the local population, quickly surrendered the city. Restoring trust with Baghdad and re-establishing basic governance loom as the biggest challenge of the post-Isis period.</p> <p>Iraq\u2019s central government remains weak and has little influence in Sunni areas of the country. The US, which maintained a presence in Mosul until 2010, no longer has an occupying presence in Iraq. Barack Obama has made clear that the 6,000 troops his administration has re-deployed are there only to fight Isis and not to provide military muscle in support of a diplomatic push to hold the country together.</p> <p>The Iraqi intelligence official said: \u201cThere is an agreement about the structure, and the order in which [forces] come in. This is the last battle in Iraq and everyone wants to be included. It was a wise move to let the Shia militia be involved but in designated areas, and under control. I don\u2019t think after two years fighting Isis you can keep out the Shia in the last battle of Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cIf we cannot reassure Sunnis they will fight to the death. There are small elements trying to assassinate [Isis], and trying to make them feel uncomfortable, but it largely depends on the tribes. We are trying to tell the Sunnis inside this is coming, and people reaching out to them and saying they have a second chance.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>TELL HIM HE\u2019S PELL\u00c8</h2> <p>It\u2019s not easy being beautiful. The constant, superficial attention. The glare of so many flashbulbs. The number of moisturising products that must be applied thrice-daily in order to maintain such a flawless visage. The feeling of guilt that everyone cannot be so visually wonderful. The sense of disgust at all these hideous trolls scampering around your feet. Not easy at all.</p> <p>Of course, The Fiver wouldn\u2019t have a clue about any of that, as we try to cope with our own lack of aesthetic pleasantness by hiding under a tarp and belching out Tin gas. Graziano Pell\u00e8 would, though. The former Southampton striker, who paused for about two seconds before wisely taking the massive sacks of coin on offer from Chinese side Shandong Luneng in the summer, is almost cartoonishly handsome, a man who would challenge darts player Steve Beaton\u2019s title as \u201cnot A-donis, he\u2019s THE Donis\u201d (c.

Secondly, and perhaps most damningly, HSBC issued a pretty bleak statement claiming that, as the \u2018defacto official opposition to the government\u2019s [Brexit] policies\u2019, the pound could well find itself circling $1.10 by the end of next year.</p> \n   <p> As has been the trend this week the pound\u2019s plight has proven to be catnip for the FTSE, with the UK index climbing 58 points to tickle 7070.

They explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system. In normal market conditions, this makes little if any difference.

Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began.</p> \n   <p>That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window. This low was $1.15 and happened \u201caround the same time as the absolute low.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Good luck to the traders trying to work this one out.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-57f7746de4b03258bcac53ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-07T10:30:15.839Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Juncker: EU must be firm with UK on Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1c45a2f103356033974fa0ba7094d3e04153e85c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c45a2f103356033974fa0ba7094d3e04153e85c/0_123_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Claude Juncker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>The message is coming in loud and clear from the EU now: we will be tough with the UK on Brexit.</strong></p> \n  <p>The latest comments come from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.</p> \n  <p>Speaking in Paris on Friday, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> It should be obvious that if the United Kingdom wants to have free access to the [EU\u2019s] internal market all the rules and all the liberties...need to be fully respected.<br></p> \n   <p>You can\u2019t have one foot in and one foot out.

  "<p>Junk food and sugary drinks are taking an enormous toll on children around the world, with soaring numbers who are obese and millions developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure previously seen only in adults, data has revealed.</p> <p>Children were facing crippling illnesses and shortened lives because of the spread of the heavily marketed fast-food culture, experts said, and health services around the world would struggle to cope. They predicted that the UN target to stop the rise of childhood obesity by 2025 would be missed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/egypt-obesity-battle-calories-overweight\">Egypt's obesity battle: 'No one cares about calories here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The three countries with the highest child obesity rates were the South Pacific island nations of Kiribati, Samoa and Micronesia. Among the more populous countries facing the worst scenarios were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/egypt-obesity-battle-calories-overweight\">Egypt</a> \u2013 where more than a third (35.5%) of children aged five to 17 were overweight or obese in 2013 \u2013 Greece (31.4%), Saudi Arabia (30.5%), the United States (29.3%), Mexico (28.9%) and the UK (27.7%).</p> <p>More than 3.5 million children now had type 2 diabetes, which was once unknown in this age group and can lead to horrible complications in later life, such as amputations and blindness. The World Obesity Federation, which compiled the data, predicted that number would rise to 4.1 million by 2025.</p> <p>About 13.5 million children have impaired glucose tolerance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Around 24 million have high blood pressure and more than 33 million have fatty liver disease as a result of obesity, which is more often associated with alcoholism and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p> <p>If anything, the experts said, the figures were an under-estimate because they were based on the numbers of obese children, and some who were classified as overweight would also have the diseases.</p> <p>The figures are alarming for rich and poor countries alike, signalling soaring medical bills to treat the coming epidemic of disease. But the WOF experts who compiled the data said that, while rich countries were struggling, poorer countries were ill-equipped to cope.</p> <p>\u201cThese forecasts should sound an alarm bell for health service managers and health professionals,\u201d said Tim Lobstein, the policy director of the WOF. \u201cThey will have to deal with this rising tide of ill health following the obesity epidemic. </p> <p>\u201cIn a sense, we hope these forecasts are wrong: they assume current trends continue, but we are urging governments to take strong measures to reduce childhood obesity, and meet their agreed target of getting the levels of childhood obesity down to 2010 levels before we get to 2025.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-07T14:33:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Childhood obesity incidences\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-07T14:33:39/embed.html\">Childhood obesity incidences</a> </figure>  <p>The experts, whose findings were published <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijpo.12185/full\">in the Pediatric Obesity journal</a>, said that by 2025, 49 million more children would be obese or overweight than in 2010 \u2013 a total of 268 million, of which 91 million alone would be obese.</p> <p>Lobstein, one of the authors of the paper published ahead of World Obesity Day next Tuesday, said the food children were eating was at the heart of the problem and that in poor countries, obesity and stunting went hand in hand.</p> <p>\u201cWe find that the large majority of children suffering excess bodyweight are in low- and middle-income countries. Following the recent evidence from the World Bank on the continuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/30/world-bank-name-and-shame-countries-fail-stunted-children\">high levels of stunting in children in underdeveloped regions</a> of the world, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the way our food supplies are developing,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou cannot replace contaminated water with Coca-Cola or Chocolate Nesquik, or a lack of good meals with a pack of fortified noodles, and still expect children to grow healthily. Breastfeeding is rapidly giving way to infant formula in large areas of Asia where markets have tripled in value in a decade \u2013 an area where we have seen some of the most rapid increases in overweight and obesity.</p> <p>\u201cStunting and obesity are part of a continuum of poor nutrition, and can be found together in the same communities, the same families, and even the same individual children. Health is a key factor in sustainable development, and healthy food supplies are essential for economic development. Healthy food supplies are also a basic human right for this and the next generation.\u201d<br></p> <p>The WOF president, Prof Ian Caterson, called for governments to take tough regulatory action to stop junk food companies targeting children. </p> <p>\u201cThe obesity epidemic has reached virtually every country in the world, and overweight and obesity levels are continuing to rise in most places,\u201d he said. \u201cCommon risk factors, such as soft drink consumption and sedentary environments, have increased. Fast food advertising continues to really influence food choices and what is eaten, and increasing numbers of families live in urban environments without access to space to exercise or time to exercise.\u201d</p> <p>In the last 10 years, consumption of sugary drinks worldwide increased by a third. More than half of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas, and 80% of young people aged 11-17 fail to get sufficient physical activity.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments hope to achieve the WHO target of keeping child obesity at 2010 levels, then the time to act is now. Governments can take a number of actions to help prevent obesity, including introducing tough regulations to protect children from the marketing of unhealthy food, ensuring schools promote healthy eating and physical activity, strengthening planning and building rules to provide safe neighbourhoods, and monitoring the impact of these policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Pamela Duncan</em><br></p>",
  "<p>My flight touched down at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport without any problems, at about midnight on 5 October. I had been invited to share my experiences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">Hong Kong\u2019s umbrella movement</a> at two universities in Bangkok and to talk about becoming a young politician. </p> <p>But as I left the plane, I started to feel paranoid that officials at the immigration counter might take me away and deport me back to Hong Kong on the very same flight. A strange feeling came over me. I could see more staff than usual ahead of me. But there was nowhere else to go. When I stepped on to the bridge leading off the plane, I saw a crowd of immigration police. I knew something was wrong.</p> <p>What surprised me was that, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/hong-kong-pro-democracy-student-activist-refused-entry-malaysia\">when I was refused entry to Malaysia</a> \u2013 in May 2015, this time I didn\u2019t have to go to the counter to be taken away. This time the officials came to meet me. </p> <p>They asked if I was Joshua Wong. I told them I was. </p> <p>And as soon as I had acknowledged my identity, they announced the order from Thai authorities to detain me and asked me to hand over my passport. I was very nervous. I never would have expected this to happen having barely stepped off the plane. </p> <p>The unfamiliar environment knocked me off balance. The last time I felt this sensation \u2013 that my heart was about to leap out from my chest \u2013 had been two years ago, in 2014, when I was arrested during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/hong-kong-democracy-activists-ask-what-protest-achieved-umbrella\">umbrella movement protests</a>. <br></p> <p>Had this been happening in Hong Kong, I would at least have been able to contact lawyers or the media to buy some time. But Bangkok airport was a foreign place to me, and my phone wouldn\u2019t connect to the airport Wi-Fi. I couldn\u2019t reach anyone for help. I had no choice but to surrender my passport. </p> <p>The customs officer told me I had been blacklisted by the Thai government and would not be permitted to enter the country. After handing over my passport, I was made to follow more than 20 customs and police officers to an unknown location. My heartbeat quickened and I was filled with a feeling of helplessness. We had been walking all over the place since my arrival and the only word I had been able to understand from them was \u201cblacklist\u201d. </p> <p>After they took me to the detention cell, I couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. I asked which articles of their law allowed them to put a foreign citizen in a detention cell without good reason. I asked to be allowed to contact my family, or even just a local lawyer. <br></p> <p>But my passport had been taken away, and I had been forbidden to use my phones or computers, so I could not contact anyone. They could do as they pleased. My two requests \u2013 to contact a lawyer and for them to explain the legality of their action \u2013 were both rejected with a simple \u201cNo\u201d. <br></p> <p>I criticised them for detaining me without any legal basis as something that was a violation of human rights and they replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you why once we have you detained.\u201d I continued to point out that they were violating proper police procedure, but they simply replied: \u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>I repeated those words to myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou know this is Thailand, it\u2019s like China. Not like Hong Kong!\u201d </p> <p>He was right, I thought. It is like China \u2013 not like Hong Kong. After all, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">Hong Kong publisher Gui Minhai was kidnapped in Thailand</a> last year and was eventually sent to mainland China. </p> <p>My discussion with the police officer ended with him making the assertion: \u201cYou know we can treat you nicely like we are now. But we can also make it hard for you. We believe you understand how far we can go.\u201d I was fully aware of this. In fact, everyone in Hong Kong is fully aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/china-behaving-like-gangster-state-with-bookseller-kidnap-say-hong-kong-politicians\">bookseller scandal</a>, which saw five local booksellers taken away to mainland China. </p> <p>At about two o\u2019clock in the morning I was put in a cell at the airport. </p> <p>At first I thought the worst that could happen would be that the 20 police officers would \u201ckeep me company\u201d in the airport waiting room before putting me on a flight back to Hong Kong. </p> <p>What I never expected was that I was about to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-detained-thailand-china-deportation\">locked up in a foreign country</a> merely for agreeing to speak at the top university there. </p> <p>Detention cells in Hong Kong are not pleasant. In Thailand they are even worse. In Hong Kong you are at least allowed to see your lawyers. Two years ago <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theapjournalist/status/515533206721150976\">I was arrested in Hong Kong</a> for storming the Civic Square two days before the umbrella movement erupted and I was able to seek release by filing a habeas corpus petition in court. </p> <p>In Thailand detention centres are far more unpleasant. The lack of hygiene and the language barrier were not even the main problems. The worst thing was being cut off from the outside world in this tightly sealed cell. You can\u2019t see the light and you don\u2019t know what time it is. You don\u2019t know how long you will have to wait. But you do know that you won\u2019t have the chance to help yourself through any legal means \u2013 because there is no rule of law.</p> <p>In this 50sq ft cell, my mind was troubled; I felt terrified and uneasy. I wondered if my friends and colleagues from my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/hong-kongs-umbrella-movement-spawns-new-political-party-demosisto\">political party Demosisto</a> would be worried, seeing that I had not appeared online; I wondered what my family and girlfriend might be thinking, having heard nothing from me; I wondered if my friends from Thai student movements might be able to get me out having not seen me at the airport; I wondered how the Hong Kong government might respond to this, or if it would simply ignore it as if it never happened. I felt frightened. I wanted to cry. </p> <p>Being cut off from the outside world is scary. But I told myself not to cry. No matter what happened, I should not cry. I could not let the police \u2013 the tools of the government \u2013 feel like they had defeated me. Looking at the walls of the cell, I kept thinking about when I might be able to go home. Would it be tomorrow morning? At noon? Or perhaps a day later? </p> <p>It sounds crazy, but I was truly worried that the Thai government might take me off to one of its courts, under some national security article, and wait a couple of weeks before deporting me home. Or perhaps worse, they might find me guilty and keep me in jail for years. The worst that I imagined could happen \u2013 although just for an instant \u2013 was that they might deport me to mainland China, as they had done to the five Hong Kong booksellers who went missing last year. </p> <p>You may think I was overreacting by thinking that I would never be able to go home. When I started having these negative thoughts, I tried to remind myself that \u2013 even in the worst-case scenario \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be jailed in Thailand, let alone deported to mainland China. My voice of reason told me such scenarios were far-fetched. </p> <p>But you know what? When the physical conditions are so hostile, and you can\u2019t breathe because of the repressive atmosphere around you, this kind of fear grows inside you. Because the reality was that I was detained in a foreign country, with no access to legal assistance or the media, and I was not even sure I would be permitted to return home. </p> <p>My mind became so troubled that I wasn\u2019t able to sleep. Finally I realised what \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d actually means. This detention experience was 100 times more terrifying than the five previous times I was arrested in Hong Kong.<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>By noon the following day I was told I would be put on the next flight home. A huge load was lifted off my shoulders. Just before I left I was given a document from the immigration office, declaring that they had rejected my entry into the country according to Sections 19, 22 and 54 of the Immigration Act B.E. 2522.</p> <p>So after China, Macau and Malaysia, there is now another territory I know I cannot enter. In fact, I still don\u2019t understand why. I have never criticised the Thai government. I was only invited there to share my experiences of being a young man who took part in the umbrella movement. And this led to me being detained as soon as I stepped off the plane and being treated in a way that goes completely against human rights and the law. I spent almost 12 hours in detention and was deprived of my passport and of contact with others. </p> <p>I am absolutely certain that my unlawful detention by the Thai authorities was motivated by their fear of youth movements around the world.</p> <p>Indeed, young people right across the globe will only become more united and engaged as our collective yearning for democracy, civil liberties and other universal values strengthens. So too will our commitment to street activism. Our hopes and dreams transcend culture, language, country and political realities. <br></p> <p>My political party and I will continue to work with civic groups in the region to chart a new path towards liberty and justice. <br></p> <ul> <li>Translation by Y.M Wong, Jason Y Ng and Christy Yao <br></li> </ul>",

The event is prominently billed as \u201cpresented by Land Rover\u201d, but no cars appear in the show, which is essentially a vehicle for Grylls, although there are a couple of extras who, for example, put on parkas and drag a sledge to suggest an Antarctic expedition, during a sequence that puts the camp into base camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62cb343724083f4e79317a57f4a59d74e5bad211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62cb343724083f4e79317a57f4a59d74e5bad211/0_0_4064_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Too bonkers to be boring \u2026 Grylls and his son Huckleberry space walk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Too bonkers to be boring \u2026 Grylls and his son Huckleberry space walk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While various tests of the human spirit \u2013 in ice, sea, jungle or space \u2013 are dramatised on stage, Grylls, from his hoist in the gods, provides a running commentary, sometimes literally (\u201cSurges of foul diarrhoea were pouring out of his body\u201d), although the performers, perhaps thankfully, suggest this gastric calamity through mime.</p> <p>The piece seems largely aimed at children.

Both sides of the river host natural and urban parks, trails, golf courses, pools, lakes and activities, making it a huge draw for anything from walking a dog to competing in triathlons. When I run down there it feels like I\u2019m the only person around even though there are close to a million people just over the ridge. </p> <p>Okay, it\u2019s true. I am jealous that Edmonton is the capital. They have the grand legislative buildings that I love visiting. Taking tours of the Ledge is a must-do for any Albertan, but it\u2019s also a great place for visitors to get a quick history of Alberta.

This shopping mall is so big it easily holds an amusement park with rollercoasters, the world\u2019s largest indoor wave pool and water park, a regulation size hockey rink and mini golf.

  "<p>More than 100 women have contacted the Guardian with accounts of sexual harassment and gender violence by university staff, including verbal bullying, serial harassment, assault, sexual assault and rape. Their stories, which span a period of decades, describe how victims of sexual harassment by senior male academics have been failed by UK universities. Here are some of their stories.</p> <h2>\u2018Everyone in the field knows he is a serial sexual predator\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, university professor<br tabindex=\"-1\"></h2> <p>My institution banned a lecturer from meeting students outside his office or at night for groping graduate students. I know this because he also harassed me for a decade and I have had to choose whether to add my own complaint to that of one student. I have not, I\u2019m just not that brave. You are accused of being a hysterical liar, the man gets \u201ccensured\u201d and then they are free to take it out on you in myriad professional and personal ways \u2026 What amazes me is that a UK university hired this academic, because everyone in the field knows he is a serial sexual predator. Apparently that was less important than his list of publications. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/07/scale-of-sexual-abuse-in-uk-universities-likened-to-savile-and-catholic-scandals\">Scale of sexual abuse in UK universities likened to Savile and Catholic scandals</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>\u2018Nasty behaviour has left me feeling extremely depressed\u2019 \u2013 a</strong><strong>nonymous, former student</strong></h2> <p>When I was a master\u2019s student a few years ago, two lecturers flirted with me. Stares, sidelong looks, peeping out from behind columns, that kind of thing. One of them also made physical contact, on one occasion pushing his body past me so forcefully that he nearly knocked me off my feet. At the master\u2019s graduation, instead of a chaste peck on the cheek, he dragged his cheek across mine. Throughout my final year he made me feel like a favourite and I did not want to risk losing his apparently high regard as I thought it would help in my career. For this reason, after the course I kept in contact via email. </p> <p>I am middle-aged and married with children, so thought I could handle it but keeping this all quiet for a year made me feel guilty and complicit and lose sleep and much of my appetite. To cut a long story short, another master\u2019s student more or less guessed and shouted about it. Since then it seems that this lecturer has been spreading rumours presenting himself as the victim. He has a huge amount of influence, so a lot of other lecturers in this city, who I was previously friendly with, now treat me with suspicion and disdain and have even been known to completely blank me. I don\u2019t know exactly what has been said, but I have put up with a lot of very nasty behaviour which has left me feeling extremely depressed and demoralised. It has taken me three years to get over it. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018The harassment was always when others were not around or aware\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, postdoctoral researcher</strong></h2> <p>I was a postgraduate student and then a postdoctoral researcher and had an ongoing problem with my supervisor, who would grab my arm but touch the side of my breast surreptitiously. He also refused me my full contract for three years as a postdoc as he said no woman was going to get maternity pay out of him again. I challenged and resolved the contract issue by going through the funders, but the sexual harassment case was thrown out by the university and then they made me sign not to disclose that or to sue for stress to get a settlement. I couldn\u2019t refuse as it was a very vulnerable time in my life.</p> <p>This professor was a serial abuser and everyone was scared to speak up as they would be pushed out of their jobs. I was told by my union rep that they [the university] wouldn\u2019t get rid of him as he pulled in research grants. The technical and administrative staff who were victims of his harassment as well were not willing to speak out in the climate of the department. The grievance was dismissed as he got several of his peers whom he had not harassed and two of his research team to say they had not been abused by him or witnessed me being abused.</p> <p>My problem was that the harassment was always when others were not around or aware, and I knew he would lie and deny it whether challenged directly or reported. </p> <h2>\u2018Women warn each other about him\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, postdoctoral researcher</h2> <p>There was a notorious young lecturer in our department while I was doing my MA and PhD. He openly talked about sexually transmitted diseases, sex, etc. In his lectures he always found a way to make it about sex. </p> <p>He was an oddball, sexually aggressive and flirty, yet because he was married with a young family, no one really thought anything would happen. He did kiss a student, which everyone knows about at this institution, but it had no effect. He was off on (paid) research leave the next year, but I think that was scheduled. Now he\u2019s moved on to another top institution and my colleagues tell me nothing\u2019s changed. Women warn each other about him, but younger students may fall prey. I still feel odd about it. He didn\u2019t try anything with me, and I didn\u2019t report what I observed. </p> <p>The university just shushed it down. I know for a fact that the head of department called a meeting between the lecturer and the girl he tried to touch. Then he [the lecturer] got research leave and is today in a good job. The girl dropped out. </p> <h2>\u2018I was young and naive and a soft target\u2019 \u2013 Siobhain, former student</h2> <p>I was harassed by an obsessive and delusional lecturer at university. I felt like I should protect the clearly unhappy, vulnerable lecturer, because I was young and naive and a soft target. The insistent but slightly subtle way I raised the issue with the head of studies fell on deaf ears. I had to sacrifice the one-to-one teaching I was entitled to for that course as there was no way I could be alone with the man again. I suffered academically as a result, for that paper. I felt violated and threatened and didn\u2019t tell anyone for years.</p> <p>I wish I\u2019d been more aware of procedures so I knew what to do when it happened to me, and didn\u2019t feel guilty about landing the man in it. </p> <h2>\u2018He waited until I was 18 and \u201clegal\u201d before making a pass at me\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, lecturer</h2> <p>Sexual harassment and transactional sexual liaisons involving significant power differentials between staff (always male, in my experience) and students (both sexes, but more often female) seem to be especially prolific and damaging in performing arts disciplines. Here one-to-one training creates the ideal breeding ground for sexual exploitation of students. </p> <p>Performing arts students are particularly vulnerable because teachers of music, drama, etc are revered as \u201cgurus\u201d whom their starry-eyed charges believe to be godlike and all-powerful. My own teacher, when I was an undergraduate, at least waited until I was 18 and \u201clegal\u201d before making a pass at me \u2013 he was notorious for his affairs with other performers, both colleagues and students \u2013 and thankfully took \u201cno\u201d for an answer. </p> <p>I now teach in a university where such \u201copportunities\u201d are much reduced. But I\u2019m not sure anything has changed for the better. Not that universities have anything to be proud of on this front \u2013 all my colleagues were delighted when the serial bedder of female undergraduates in our department retired. He was universally reviled by his colleagues, and students were warned to avoid close proximity, but the attitude was that the \u201crelationships\u201d, however sordid and asymmetrical, were technically legal, so nothing could be done about them institutionally. </p> <h2>\u2018As I was on a visa, I knew I could not complain\u2019 \u2013 Sue, lecturer</h2> <p>My line manager groped me daily for almost two years, and there was nothing I could do. He would come into my office, shut the door and put his hands on me. The worst was when he grabbed my crotch area one day. As I was on a visa, I knew I could not complain. Even if I did, it would have been my word against his and I would have been the one to be retaliated against. The whole experience was just so humiliating and there was no one to turn to.</p> <p>The university will do absolutely nothing to help the victim. If anything, they will go out of their way to protect the perpetrator, especially if it\u2019s a male. Our HR department has no backbone to take care of problems like this, they would rather stick their heads in the sand. We had a situation recently and the female ended up stepping down from her position due to the lack of HR support. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/26/have-you-been-affected-by-sexual-harassment-at-university\">Have you been affected by sexual harassment at university?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Senior academics routinely get away with appalling behaviour\u2019 \u2013 Jane, lecturer</h2> <p>I work in an academic department where one of the senior members of staff behaves appallingly towards female students and staff. He called two female students \u201cslappers\u201d in public, expressed disbelief towards a disclosure of sexual assault (\u201cgirls these days, with their short skirts\u201d) and routinely undermines his female colleagues with sexist and dismissive language in formal settings. </p> <p>I have no confidence that heads of academic departments can be relied upon to act properly when complaints or reports are made to them; and I have plenty of experience of seeing senior academics routinely get away with appalling behaviour (not limited to sexual harassment) because they are effectively beyond the reach of institutions which need their research income or prestige. </p> <h2>\u2018I felt terribly awkward but powerless\u2019 \u2013 Anna, former student</h2> <p>When I was at university, one lecturer would focus on me intently during our classes in first year. He would ask me to stay behind, and wanted to know all about me. As a naive, working class student, I was flattered. I was vulnerable, felt out of my depth and would do anything to please. It went further. He would start to touch and grope me in private. In front of other students, he would comment on the perfume I wore. Afterwards he would say: \u2018Please, always wear that perfume to seminars. I want to breathe you in.\u2019 He would also make comments about my body. </p> <p>I felt terribly awkward, but powerless. When it came to choosing second-year options, he persuaded me to choose his course, telling me he would provide all the books, and that I would be sure of doing well. I felt like I had nowhere to turn. He kept asking me to dinner, was keeping me behind, and would stroke my face, bottom, etc. Thankfully, I was contacted by the department soon after starting second year, and told that I had selected too many options, so without any confrontation I dropped his course. He ignored me afterwards. </p> <h2>\u2018He was allowed to prey on vulnerable male students knowing he was protected by senior staff\u2019 \u2013 Maeve, former student</h2> <p>I and many other students were made aware that a former professor repeatedly preyed on male students, often bringing groups out for drinks and then back to his house before picking off the women and attempting to force himself on the male victims. </p> <p>This male lecturer was allowed to prey on vulnerable male students all the while knowing that he was completely protected by senior staff within the university. Yes, several of the students were made to sign [non- disclosure agreements] as a result of the man\u2019s behaviour, but he kept his job while the students were left vulnerable and scared and disgusted. It was only when one refused to sign an NDA and declared he would go to the newspapers that anything was done. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018I was so traumatised and ashamed, not only by the assault but by having to give the details to two men\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, lecturer</strong></h2> <p>I am a lecturer who has had her career ruined by a sexual assault carried out by a colleague who was also my former PhD supervisor. After I made a complaint to HR, I was then interviewed by two academic male members of staff. I was so traumatised and ashamed, not only by the assault but by having to give the details of the assault to two men (one of whom seemed to regard me as being a waste of space) that I did not take my complaint to the next formal level.</p> <p>The professor who attacked me continued his employment as though nothing happened. He continues to supervise PhD students. I soon learned that it was more important to protect the reputation of my attacker than it was to protect me and fellow female members of staff and students. I discovered later that this man had attacked one of his PhD students before he assaulted me. As a result of the attack, I got quite depressed and retired early. I still worry that I might see him. </p> <h2>\u2018As far as I know he has never been exposed\u2019 \u2013 Andrea, former student</h2> <p>As a graduate student I was sexually harassed by my thesis supervisor. When I showed that I was not interested, he wrote me very poor references for a college research fellowship for which I was well in the running. This completely changed the course of my career as an academic in my early days. I enlisted the support of male members of my college, but the damage had been done since I had lost the fellowship. </p> <p>I had no recourse because if I had tried to complain the charges would have been denied and my failure to obtain the fellowship attributed to my own academic inadequacy. I sought to change supervisor officially but nobody would entertain this notion because sexual harassment was too embarrassing to be spoken of in public. Having had a successful career subsequently, it is clear that the quality of my work was not the problem. The man in question subsequently developed a record as a sexual predator, since he tried to sleep with most female members of the faculty. His own behaviour did in the end make him very unpopular, and he subsequently left his post to go to another country. As far as I know he has never been exposed. </p> <h2>\u2018He would tell me that harassment was a joke\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, student</h2> <p>I was sexually harassed by a member of faculty multiple times. He would tell me that said harassment was a \u201cjoke\u201d when I would reject his advances, and frame each instance as me blowing things out of proportion.</p> <p>Even if reporting procedures were robust, there is the question of reports being followed up on. I do not believe that the leaders in many academic institutions have the political will to do what they need to do to protect their students \u2013 namely, risk losing a member of staff with a good publication record or reputation. </p> <h2> \u2018I knew it would probably only affect me and not him\u2019 \u2013 anonymous, lecturer</h2> <p>The professor in charge of the postgraduate research programme in the university where I did my PhD pursued me for several years, including propositioning me both in his office and at social events. It had a detrimental effect on my personal, academic and professional life, including effectively preventing me from pursuing a post in the department.</p> <p>I did not report him. I did seek counselling and I was offered advice on how to report the facts, but I did not. First, I felt guilty. Second, I knew it would probably only affect me and not him. In the event, the negative repercussions still took place. I would feel awful if other students were to be victims of his behaviour and I had done nothing to prevent it. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018T</strong>here\u2019s nothing to stop harassment occurring outside university structures\u2019 \u2013 V, lecturer</h2> <p>Harassment is something my colleagues and I talk about quite a lot, at least in terms of what we believe to be appropriate/inappropriate behaviour, so I suppose we have a support network of sorts at least. The issue from my personal experience is that even if internal institutional procedures are strong and well administered, there\u2019s nothing to stop harassment occurring outside university structures, especially since so much contact for academics happens at conferences and beyond the parameters of institutional affiliations generally. This leaves the victims with a genuine sense of helplessness: not only are they being harassed, but there aren\u2019t any obvious institutional channels to raise the issue. </p> <p>I can\u2019t imagine that a student or academic from another institution would be given much credence if they were to complain to a second place about one of its academics: the institution is very likely to say that it\u2019s not its problem, given that contact was extramural, as it were. </p> <h2>\u2018They were scared of repercussions for their careers\u2019 \u2013 Chris, lecturer<br></h2> <p>I twice reported male colleagues for sexual harassment of female colleagues at work. Both times this was at the request of the female colleagues who had been harassed (I am male). They were scared of repercussions for their careers and asked me to report their experiences to human resources. Both times I was told that nothing could be done unless the victims came forward. I explained that they were scared, but this made no difference. </p> <p>I suggested that HR interview all women working in my department so that specific whistleblowers could not be identified, but this was rejected. The perpetrators were not dealt with by HR. I personally dealt with one of them by threatening to make his harassment public knowledge if I heard of any more instances. I have now retired from that university. </p> <h2><strong>\u2018T</strong>he person who had carried out the acts had been known to have done similar things several years ago\u2019 \u2013 Susan, lecturer</h2> <p>Individual staff with the department in which I worked and the university\u2019s HR department were immensely supportive and helpful. However, in the UK, standard procedure is that if a formal complaint is made to HR, the person accused is allowed to see the complaint, know the identity of the person who made it, and respond. On one level this is quite just, as everyone has the right to defend themselves, but in cases of sexual harassment it does nothing to protect vulnerable people or to encourage them to come forward. </p> <p> What was infuriating is in my particular case the person who had carried out the acts had been known to have done similar things several years ago, but no official record of this was kept. People who carry out these acts appear to be allowed to retain their anonymity, whereas those who decide to stand up and say something lose theirs. This cannot be the right balance. It seems pointless and hypocritical to me that the same universities that have policies that make complaining about harassment so difficult can also strive to obtain <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/\">Athena Swan</a> awards for inclusivity. </p> <h2>\u2018She had to go through a very challenging and upsetting complaints procedure\u2019 \u2013 David, lecturer</h2> <p>A young female academic whom I was line managing had been subject to harassment in another institution. The harassment then extended beyond that institution and was potentially going to continue. I feel guilt that I accepted that old male pests were known in the past, but when faced with a situation where it was clear she was potentially going to be subject to further harassment I said she should not accept it, and should complain. </p> <p>I tried to support her (working alongside others, male and female, including HR). The upshot was that she had to go through a very challenging and upsetting complaints procedure over many, many months, even though the outcome was sanction of the old male academic in question. I feel considerable guilt that she took my advice and subjected herself to such a long and difficult time, but the alternative was worse.</p> <p>I understand how pervasive and potentially career-destroying the effects are. My colleague is still very reticent at attending the very international conferences she should be going to in order to become a successful academic. </p> <h2>\u2018Universities are shown time and time again to be incapable of policing themselves\u2019 \u2013 Sophie, lecturer</h2> <p>I\u2019ve not been trained in awareness of what the procedures would be. I do strongly feel that universities are shown time and time again to be incapable of policing themselves, be it sexual harassment or bullying. I think one thing would be for teaching staff to have to go through DBS [Disclosure and Barring Service] clearances, because although we do not specifically work with vulnerable adults, it remains the case that the psychological impact of university, the distance from home, the radical changes are immense for students and on many occasions this makes them vulnerable. </p> <p><em>All names, where given, have been changed to protect individuals\u2019 identities. </em></p>",
  "<p>On 3 July 1789, in the middle of the night, the Marquis de Sade was dragged from his cell in the ironically named Liberty tower of the Bastille. Earlier that day he had been caught shouting to the crowd gathered outside the prison walls that the inmates\u2019 throats were being cut. He was transferred to an asylum outside Paris, and forced to leave many of his most precious possessions behind, including a copper cylinder kept hidden in a crevice in the wall. When his wife set off for the Bastille to fetch his belongings on 14 July, it was already too late: the Revolution had beaten her to it, and she had to turn back empty-handed.</p> <p>Sade wept \u201ctears of blood\u201d over the loss. Inside the cylinder was a scroll, 12m long and 11cm wide, covered in minute handwriting: the manuscript of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/03/marquis-de-sade-scroll-120-days-sodom-paris\">unfinished novel called <em>The 120 Days of Sodom</em></a>, or <em>The School of Libertinage</em>.</p> <p>Though Sade never saw his scroll again, its story was far from over. Somehow it escaped the storming of the Bastille in the hands of a young man called Arnoux de Saint-Maximin, who then sold it to a Proven\u00e7al aristocrat, the Marquis de Villeneuve-Trans. His family held on to it for more than a 100 years before eventually selling it to a German collector, who allowed the pioneering sexologist Iwan Bloch to publish the novel for the first time in 1904. Sade\u2019s descendants, the Nouailles family, bought the scroll back in 1929 and kept it until 1982, when they entrusted the publisher, Jean Grouet, with its valuation. But he smuggled it over the border to Switzerland, and sold it to a leading collector of erotica, G\u00e9rard Nordmann. Decades of legal wrangling ensued between the Nouailles and the Nordmanns, only resolved in 2014 when a private foundation acquired the scroll for \u20ac7m and placed it on display in Paris. The exhibition was cut short when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/06/frances-king-of-manuscripts-held-over-suspected-pyramid-scheme\"> the director of the foundation was charged with fraud</a>. The scroll, which started its life in prison, is thus under lock and key once again, waiting for the courts to decide its future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c08de18b708c47bd27811a89ba5b452aa3450329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08de18b708c47bd27811a89ba5b452aa3450329/0_63_1163_1453/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Marquis De Sade spent 32 years in prison or in mental hospitals.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marquis De Sade spent 32 years in prison or in mental hospitals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of the scroll, complete with Proven\u00e7al noblemen, prison-breaks, and shadowy booksellers, reads rather like the life of the man who created it. By the time Sade wrote <em>The 120 Days</em> he had spent eight years in prison, first in Vincennes then the Bastille. He had also been shot at, burnt in effigy and forced to live on the run \u2013 on one occasion escaping to Italy with his sister-in-law, and lover, Anne-Prosp\u00e8re. Though the Surrealists would eventually cast him as a martyr to freedom, Sade was in prison not for his words but for his deeds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/quiz/2014/dec/02/marquis-de-sade-200-years-quiz\">He was a notorious libertine </a>even by the standards of his age. His 20s and 30s had been marked by a series of public scandals: a sexual assault on a young woman named Rose Keller; an orgy in Marseille which led to four prostitutes falling ill after consuming chocolate-coated Spanish fly (an aphrodisiac); and, most disturbingly, a winter spent in his chateau with his wife and several freshly recruited servants aged around 15 \u2013 the so-called \u201clittle girls affair\u201d. After years of covering up her son-in-law\u2019s behaviour, Madame de Montreuil had finally had enough: she had the king sign a <em>lettre de cachet</em>, a royal warrant that meant Sade could be incarcerated indefinitely. He was arrested in February 1777 and remained in prison for the next 13 years.</p> <p>Sade began drafting his novel in earnest on 22 October 1785, working from seven to 10 each evening over 37 consecutive days. The novel is not complete, however, as only the introduction and the first of its four parts are written in full. The remainder are very detailed summaries but no more. Though he had ample opportunity over the next four years, Sade never completed his first \u2013 and most extreme \u2013 novelistic enterprise. Perhaps he realised it was unpublishable \u2013 a conclusion that censors and courts around the world would repeatedly endorse over the course of the 20th century. He described his novel as \u201cthe most impure tale ever written since the world began\u201d and, for all the hyperbole, his description still holds true even now.</p> <p><em>The 120 Days</em> tells the tale of four libertines \u2013 a duke, a bishop, a judge and a banker \u2013 who lock themselves away in a castle in the Black Forest with an entourage that includes two harems of teenage boys and girls specially abducted for the occasion. Four ageing brothel madams are appointed as storytellers for each of the four months, and their brief is to weave a 150 \u201cpassions\u201d or perversions into the story of their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some books that are not fit for all people and some people who are not fit for all books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The libertines, surrounded by their victims, listen and enact the passions described, and as the passions become more brutal, so do the libertines: the novel builds to a violent climax with the \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurderous\u201d passions of Parts Three and Four. These are presented as long, numbered lists, interspersed with brief accounts of the scenes they inspire. Sade\u2019s tortures range from the cartoonish (\u201cHe vigorously flattens a foot with a hammer\u201d) to the clinical (\u201cHer air supply is turned off and on at whim inside a pneumatic machine\u201d); and from the surreal (\u201cThey make her swallow a serpent which in turn will devour her\u201d) to the mundane (\u201cHe dislocates a wrist\u201d). But the vast majority are simply too obscene and too violent to be quoted, as one nameless victim after another is subjected to increasingly elaborate and frenzied torments.</p> <p>These relentless lists read like a series of nightmarish diary entries, or a set of instructions for an apprentice torturer. <em>The 120 Days</em> is not a work that seduces its readers: it assaults them. Reading it is, thankfully perhaps, a unique experience.</p> <p>Sade\u2019s once unpublishable novel has now joined the ranks of Penguin\u2019s Classics for the first time, and its author will take his place alongside the great figures of world literature \u2013 many of whom would no doubt turn in their graves at the news that their club now counted Sade among its members. It is a significant cultural moment for a work that was for so long the preserve of a privileged few. Indeed, ever since Sade began work on his draft, <em>The 120 Days</em> has been a hidden text \u2013 hidden first by its author and later by its subsequent owners.</p> <p>For much of the 20th century, even those who published the novel did their best to keep it away from the prying eyes of the authorities. These early editions were published \u2013 pseudonymously or anonymously in some cases \u2013 in very small numbers for private and wealthy subscribers, and thus remained inaccessible to the general public. It is no coincidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/30/biography.artsandhumanities\">Jean-Jacques Pauvert \u2013 the first publisher to put his own name to an edition of Sade\u2019s major works</a>, and the first to attempt a larger print run \u2013 was prosecuted by the French government in 1956 for committing an outrage against public morals.</p> <p>Pauvert argued that Sade\u2019s works were \u201cmedico-legal documents\u201d of great scientific value, and that his editions were in any case too expensive for ordinary members of the public to buy. Most of his sales, he insisted, had been to doctors and medical faculties \u2013 Sade was, in other words, in safe hands. The judge disagreed, but his verdict was overturned on appeal, and a little over a decade later, Sade\u2019s works were available in France in mass-market paperbacks. Sade is now firmly established as part of the French literary canon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0166afafa563a573cd690d146e20cbf88ae8ee8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0166afafa563a573cd690d146e20cbf88ae8ee8d/0_339_2465_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s 1975 film of Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s 1975 film of <em>Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This concern about the wider circulation of the works was as revealing of class anxieties as it was about attitudes towards Sade. To say that his works posed a risk to the public was really to say that a public able to read Sade was itself a risky prospect. These same anxieties resurfaced a few years later across the Channel, just when it looked as if Sade was beginning to gain a foothold in British culture.</p> <p>Though the translations published by the Olympia Press in Paris were banned from the UK throughout the 1950s, British publishers such as Peter Owen were able to produce (very careful) selections from Sade\u2019s writings without running into trouble. In the wake of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial\"> the <em>Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover</em> trial in 1960</a>, a test case for the Obscene Publications Act passed a year before, more publishing houses were emboldened to publish Sade. But all this came to a halt with the Moors murders trial of 1966, and with the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/28/ian-brady-learned-moors-murderer\">Ian Brady </a>had owned a paperback Corgi edition of Sade\u2019s <em>Justine</em>.</p> <p>Brady\u2019s taste in books was widely reported in the tabloid press, and fired the public imagination \u2013 a fire stoked by commentators who saw his reading of Sade in \u201cfairly recent paperback\u201d and his crimes as a matter of cause and effect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/14/comment.stephenmoss\">George Steiner </a>alluded to the \u201chigh probability\u201d that Brady\u2019s reading of <em>Justine</em> was a \u201csignificant factor\u201d in the case. Pamela Hansford Johnson fretted about the threat posed by the rise of \u201ca semi-literate reading public\u201d: \u201cThere are some books that are not fit for all people and some people who are not fit for all books.\u201d</p> <p>It did not seem to matter that the copy of <em>Justine</em> that Brady owned had only appeared in print after he had committed all but one of his murders. A ban on the publication and importation of Sade\u2019s works swiftly followed the trial and remained in effect for more than 20 years. When a British publisher, Arrow Books, finally tested the ban by reprinting Sade\u2019s major novels in the late 1980s and early 90s, Ann Winterton MP led calls for the DPP to act, condemning <em>Juliette</em> as \u201cfilth of a particularly ugly and dangerous kind\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Publishing The 120 Days as a classic changes it still further and makes Sade a little more respectable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is hard to imagine a work of fiction prompting calls for prosecution in Britain today. The written word no longer seems to frighten people in the same way any more. The fear that novels used to inspire has shifted instead to more recent \u2013 and visual \u2013 forms of fiction and fantasy such as video games, horror movies, and internet pornography.</p> <p>It is telling that the controversial section relating to \u201cextreme pornography\u201d in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2009 deals only with images, and makes no mention of the written word. But is this because words now seem safe, or because they are just too slippery for the law?</p> <p>In 2003, MPs debated whether \u201cpaedophile pornography\u201d could be textual as well as visual. A young George Osborne advised his fellow MPS against delving into the \u201cquagmire\u201d of words: \u201cIn previous generations, people have been dragged into debates about works of literature, such as <em>Lolita</em>, or works that do not quite qualify as literature, such as those by the Marquis de Sade, and parliament should not be drawn down that avenue again.\u201d Even works that are \u201cnot quite\u201d literature have words in them \u2013 reason enough, Osborne suggests, for politicians and lawyers to steer clear of them.</p> <p>Do Sade\u2019s novels now qualify as great literature? That a novel as extreme as <em>The</em> <em>120 Days</em> is part of a \u201cclassics\u201d collection tells us just how much our sense of literature has changed over the past few decades. And publishing <em>The</em> <em>120 Days</em> as a classic changes it still further: if it makes Sade a little more respectable, it also makes literature a little more dangerous than it was before.</p> <p>\u2022 Will McMorran is a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London.

Sterling is probably about where it should be. We\u2019re just going through a relatively short period of volatility.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve probably found stability at this level.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s industrial output fell in August and the trade deficit widened, according to official figures that break a run of upbeat reports on the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy.</p> <p>The reports were weaker than economists had been predicting but they said the UK economy remained on course to avoid a downturn in the Brexit vote\u2019s aftermath by a significant margin.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/aug2016\">industrial production fell 0.4% in August</a> after a 0.1% increase in July. That compared economists\u2019 forecasts of another 0.1% increase, in a Reuters poll. But there was evidence that exports were helped by the weak pound, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/confusion-as-pound-falls-10-in-insane-asian-trading-and-no-one-knows-why\">touched new 31-year lows against the dollar on Friday</a> amid worries over the UK\u2019s prospects outside the EU.<br></p> <p>Within the industrial sector, manufacturers raised output by 0.2% on the month, boosted by car production. But output fell in other parts of the industrial sector in August.<br></p> <p>\u201cManufacturing output was up slightly in August with more cars built, with limited evidence suggesting the lower pound boosted exports,\u201d said the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, Kate Davies. \u201cNevertheless, this was offset by a fall in oil and gas production, with some field shutdowns contributing to the fall, meaning UK production as a whole was down.\u201d </p> <p>Following the figures, the thinktank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), estimated economic growth slowed in the third quarter to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the second quarter.</p> <p>\u201cWhile retail sales have been buoyant in recent months, the production sector has acted as a drag on economic growth,\u201d said James Warren, research fellow at NIESR.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/aug2016\">Separate figures</a> showed the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in August as exports continued to rise but imports grew at a faster rate.<br></p> <p>Concerns about the UK\u2019s trading prospects have risen this week after comments from ministers suggested the government could pursue a hard Brexit deal that limits immigration but leaves Britain shut out from the single market. Those fears have helped knock the pound sharply lower on foreign exchanges.</p> <p>Liam Fox, international trade secretary, insisted the government was \u201cworking hard to ensure the UK remains an attractive place with which to trade and to help UK companies take advantage of the global demand for British goods and services\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile some sectors continue to perform well, there is still some way to go to ensure that we are exporting as much as we could and should do, so the government will continue to encourage and support the wider range of exporting we require to boost our national prosperity,\u201d Fox said.<br></p> <p>But businesses and lobby groups say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-exports-small-medium-sized-business-sme\">the government should do more</a> if it wants to come anywhere close to a goal to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/21/budget-osborne-exports-target-manufacturers\">almost double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020</a> \u2013 a target it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/17/uk-miss-2020-export-target-warn-mps\">widely expected to miss</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s autumn statement needs to include measures that support businesses looking to access new export markets, including expanding support for trade fairs and missions, to at least match that provided by our competitors,\u201d said Mike Spicer, director of research and economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.</p> <p>The ONS estimated <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/aug2016\">the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services at \u00a34.7bn</a> in August, a widening of \u00a32.5bn from July. Exports increased by \u00a30.1bn and imports increased by \u00a32.6bn.<br></p> <p>The deficit on trade in goods alone was \u00a312.1bn, widening by \u00a32.6bn from July and worse than the \u00a311.3bn gap forecast by economists in the Reuters poll. The deficit on trade in goods with EU countries hit a record high of \u00a38.4bn as imports from the bloc rose 5.1% and exports fell 0.6%.</p> <p>The two reports on trade and industrial production follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/services-sector-growth-brexit-vote-uk\">signs in surveys that businesses had rebounded from the initial shock of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU</a>. Statisticians caution against over-interpreting any one month\u2019s figures, however.</p> <p>The data will give Bank of England policymakers more to chew over when they meet next month to decide whether to cut interest rates further from the already record low of 0.25%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee reduced borrowing costs and expanded an electronic money-printing scheme in August to shore up confidence after the Brexit vote. <br></p> <p>Commenting on the latest official figures, Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cWhile these figures break the recent run of positive data for activity in the third quarter, the overall strength of recent data has probably lowered the chance of further monetary easing from the MPC.</p> <p>\u201cBut committee members have previously warned against over-interpreting incoming data \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/bank-of-england-too-pessimistic-brexit-vote-deputy-governor-ben-broadbent\">including Ben Broadbent in his speech this week</a> \u2013 so we still think that there is a decent chance that the bank rate will be cut to 0.10% in November.\u201d </p>",

The word \u2018drum\u2019 in Kirundi is <em>ingoma</em>, which also means \u2018government\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>Traditionally, the Burundian ritual dance of the royal drum was performed at important feasts and festivals to invoke the power of their monarchy.

Their current home at Dzaleka was opened in 1994 to provide sanctuary for those fleeing wars in Burundi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, and is now home to around 25,000 people. </p> <p>\u201cLife in refugee camps is very, very hard,\u201d says Nzigamasabo. \u201cI say that from experience \u2013 I was born in one and now I\u2019m 30! I believe it takes courage to be a refugee. Thanks to that courage, we\u2019re not here at this festival as refugees but as Amahoro.\u201d<br></p> <p>The drummers\u2019 performance was one of the highlights of a weekend that sought to bring together musicians from Europe and Africa and included performances from South African Afro-fusion band Freshlyground, Zambian rapper Roberto, and German progressive house DJ Timo Maas, enjoying a change of scenery from Ibiza.</p> <p>Norwegian jazz-pop band <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mooyh\">Mooyh</a> travelled from Oslo to play at Lake of Stars. Guitarist Bernt Isak W\u00e6rstad says that the location of the festival site on Lake Malawi more than made up for its remoteness. \u201cThe scenery is really beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cOur bus may have broken down, but if you\u2019re coming to a festival like this you have to take it as a bit of a trip and just enjoy the ride.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87e35b5567a4208eec3e1236880829bb7789f713\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87e35b5567a4208eec3e1236880829bb7789f713/0_316_1921_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying the ride \u2026 Norwegian jazz-pop band Mooyh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enjoying the ride \u2026 Norwegian jazz-pop band Mooyh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in stark contrast to their country-hopping fellow performers, the Amahoro Drummers rushed back to Dzaleka after their performance in order to sign back in, knowing a missed deadline could mean sanctions or deportation. As refugees they are prohibited from holding jobs or living outside of the camp or travelling outside of the country. Nzigamasabo himself says he supports himself with only a \u201cvery, very small\u201d tomato patch, so the shows they can find around Malawi \u2013 and the tip bowl they pass around during performances \u2013 are crucial. \u201cWe have a big challenge,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe cannot get permission to perform outside Malawi, despite being offered many opportunities to promote ourselves. I believe we are stars, but being stars cannot take us out of Dzaleka.\u201d </p> <p>The Amahoro Drummers have become widely known throughout the country in part due to the work of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-7nKdX3KtE\">Menes La Plume</a>, a Congolese rapper and refugee who has lived in Dzaleka since 2008. For the last four years he has been working to promote the cultural talents of those living in the camp, arranging events as a way of giving his fellow refugees a platform for their art: since 2014 he has run the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/malawi-tumaini-music-festival-refugee-residents\">Tumaini festival</a> inside the camp itself. This year\u2019s takes place on 5 November, a sister festival to Lake of Stars itself.</p> <p>La Plume believes working with the country\u2019s largest festival has helped raise both the profile of artists from the camp and the subject of refugee rights. \u201cLake of Stars is a platform to talk to people about refugees in Malawi,\u201d he says, referencing the success of acts who have formed in Dzaleka, including the Amahoro Drummers, modern dance group Salama Africa and the band Etoile de la Paix, who mix rumba, hip-hop and <em>zouk</em>. </p> <p>Organisers estimate that about 60% of this year\u2019s 2,500 Lake of Stars attendees were Malawian, with others coming from surrounding countries and many travelling from Europe or drawn from the region\u2019s large contingent of NGO workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107de90c2187ee7e6852e5594a86ab9126edd3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107de90c2187ee7e6852e5594a86ab9126edd3bc/0_0_3400_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lake of Stars attracts a big local crowd, as well as travellers from Europe and beyond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"777\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake of Stars attracts a big local crowd, as well as travellers from Europe and beyond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not just about throwing a big party.

Speakers including La Plume appeared among talks on gender and leadership and networking opportunities for local students to learn about jobs. \u201cWe always intended Lake of Stars to be a platform for tourism and culture but also development,\u201d says festival founder Will Jameson. \u201cThat\u2019s come into its own in the last couple of years.

However, he says challenges have increased in the 12 years since he started the event. \u201cI think it\u2019s got harder,\u201d he says. \u201cMalawi\u2019s economy is in a bad way. We haven\u2019t increased our ticket prices. It\u2019s 32,000 Kwacha [roughly \u00a335/$44] for three days \u2013 if we\u2019d followed the devaluation it should be about 48,000 Kwacha. Times are tough, but we\u2019re still very passionate.\u201d <br></p> <p>Having succeeded in bringing British acts including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/may/05/bombay-bicycle-clubs-feel-video-premiere\">Bombay Bicycle Club</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/09/maccabees-split-british-guitar-rock-indie-future\">the Maccabees</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/08/best-albums-of-2015-no-9-white-men-are-black-men-too-young-fathers\">Young Fathers</a> to the festival in recent years, Jameson is now looking into flipping the model and bringing artists to Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re considering doing Lake of Stars in London and either Glasgow or Edinburgh and reversing it by trying to get Malawian artists over to the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the profile of the event is there. It\u2019s big enough that it carries some weight.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s an idea that would turn the long journey to Lake of Stars on its head, and one that excites La Plume \u2013 although he more than anyone is aware of the hurdles he will have to overcome to tour internationally. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to festivals around the world \u2013 three in Europe this year \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t go because of papers,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a refugee it\u2019s difficult, but I know there is a demand for what I\u2019m doing and for me as an artist.

This is a temporary reprieve for the Bight \u2013 an area of exceptional marine significance on the coastline of South and Western Australia, where 85% of the species in the shallows can be found nowhere else in the world. The region\u2019s unique biodiversity means that the impact of a major oil spill would likely be particularly harmful with a nearly 100% chance of oil reaching the shore of the Bight national park, according to BP\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/bp-modelling-great-australian-bight-oil-spill-new-south-wales\">modeling</a>. </p> <p>Concerns are exacerbated by a lack of transparency. The regulator has declined to provide reasons for knocking back three versions of BP\u2019s applications. The paltry documents which have been made available provide grossly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/bp-drilling-plan-great-australian-bight-lacks-detail-on-managing-oil-spills\">inadequate information</a> to assess spill response capability. </p> <p>Shareholders haunted by the lack of contractor oversight in Deepwater Horizon should be worried by recent revelations that Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc, the BP drilling subcontractor for the Bight, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/call-to-halt-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-amid-faulty-equipment-fears?CMP=share_btn_tw\">linked </a>to a problem with subsea bolts \u2013 resulting in equipment failures, notably in the Gulf of Mexico. The <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060041053/feed\">regulator</a> in the US has asked for help from a number of agencies, including <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060041053/feed\">Nasa</a>.

Serious questions remain as to how the high-risk, high-cost, and controversial Bight has risen to the top of the list. More broadly, BP\u2019s and its peers\u2019 reliance on frontier oil projects signals structural problems for their business models. To satisfy shareholders, the company needs to find more oil to maintain its share price in increasingly risky, dangerous and remote places such as the Bight, the deep waters off Brazil and the tar sands of Canada. However, a low oil price, flattening demand, and global economic uncertainty make these projects financially unjustifiable in the short term. And increasingly ambitious action on climate change could choke off their future viability. </p> <p>BP\u2019s inadequate response to an accident in the North Sea and its push to the Bight merely underline how poorly equipped they are to manage both an oil spill and the future energy needs of a world turning away from oil. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",

  "<p>For the first time in their short history, New York City FC are in Mexico. On Friday night, they face Club Necaxa from Liga MX at Estadio Victoria in Aguascalientes. This also marks NYC FC\u2019s first ever mid-season friendly: the blue side of New York still have two games of the regular season, against DC United and Columbus Crew. After a five-year absence, Necaxa are back in the Mexico\u2019s top division and are currently sitting in fifth place thanks to a solid run that has seen them go undefeated in their last seven matches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ClubNecaxa/status/783418179003428865\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00a1<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Guaje7Villa\">@Guaje7Villa</a> con un mensaje para la afici\u00f3n de los Rayos!

From a soccer standpoint, it is a great opportunity for both managers to take advantage of what other fringe players can offer their team, especially those who have impressed in training but haven\u2019t seen much of league action. \u201cIt will be a mix of players who have been playing really well, and I don\u2019t want to break that momentum, and they need to play every week,\u201d said Vieira during their last training session before they left for Mexico. \u201cBut we will also want to give a chance to some of the players who have been working really well in the last few weeks and they deserve to play some games.\u201d</p> <p>He mentioned players such as Diego Martinez, Mehdi Ballouchy and Freder\u00edco Bravo, who have not seen much action in recent matches.</p> <p>But the trip represents another chance where both leagues can solidify their ties by learning from each other and their supporters. Vieira admits he doesn\u2019t know much about Necaxa or the relationship between MLS and Liga MX, but he knows this will come with time as it\u2019s a vital relationship, mainly founded by the Mexican and Hispanic fanbase in both countries.</p> <p>\u201cI think when you look at our squad, staff and how many Spanish speakers we have, and the fans we have in this country, going to Mexico is really important for the brand and the relationships we can have with each other. I am really looking forward to it.\u201d</p> <p>He is also honest about his own Spanish and admits he has to work on it. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really, bad,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A perfect example of this relationship is the 23-year-old NYC FC playmaker, Mikey Lopez. For the Mexican-American playmaker, being in Mexico and playing against Necaxa as a professional f\u00fatbol player is a joyous, personal achievement. Born in Dallas, Lopez has a deep connection with Mexico: his father Miguel is from Reynosa, and his mother Martha is from Monterrey. He grew up in Mission, Texas, five miles from the border in Hidalgo County, where he casually supported Tigres as a kid before his attention veered towards the European leagues and MLS.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really special, really cool that we\u2019re in country close to me, my family and our Mexican roots,\u201d said Lopez earlier this week.<br></p> <p>Club Necaxa\u2019s history goes even further than Mexico. Much like NYC FC, owes its existence to foreign ownership. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Los Electricistas</em> (the Electricians) were founded in 1923 by an Englishman, William H Frasser, an engineer and owner of the electrical plant, Luz y Fuerza (Light and Power) in Mexico City. The team was originally called after the company but had to change it as the national federation did not allow teams to be named after private enterprises. Eventually, Luz y Fuerza became Necaxa, named after the river close to the plant.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47d6ff11ba8158663c8e0ef9945a67cc8116ee83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d6ff11ba8158663c8e0ef9945a67cc8116ee83/0_0_720_485/500.jpg\" alt=\"Necaxa founder William H Frasser\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William H Frasser (top row, fourth from left) with Club Necaxa in 1936.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another Englishman who has been making an impact on his own team is 19-year-old Jack Harrison.

Harrison, however, won\u2019t be traveling with the team as Vieira has decided for the teenager to stay back in New York and rest as the number one priority is a healthy squad as they look to maintain momentum heading into the playoffs.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t lose our competitiveness and stay on our toes,\u201d he told Guardian US on Wednesday. \u201cThese last two games are important as we want to have the highest seed, so we just have to keep working hard and do what we have been doing.

He was in the special care baby unit, surrounded by wires and lying in a tiny pod. Lots of doctors surrounded him and, young as I was, I realised that he was not a healthy child, but to me he was just my new little brother and was perfect. I did not understand, then, the overwhelming distress and horror that faced my family.</p> <p>There were many big words flying around that I did not understand. Tetralogy of Fallot \u2026 atrial septal defect \u2026 open-heart surgery \u2026 My parents were alarmed, panicked; I had not seen them like this and I felt afraid too.

He can be tricky, perplexing and sometimes outrageous, but his sense of fun and love outweighs all else. There are adults with the condition who have learned to drive cars, are performing in drama groups and are holding down jobs.</p> <p>My great uncle had the same condition and he was born exactly 100 years before Sebbie, in 1903. Thankfully times have changed since he was alive \u2013 he spent his life in an institution. Now disabled children have huge opportunities open to them and are achieving more than was ever thought possible. With our help I hope that Sebbie will grasp these opportunities. Who knows what he might achieve?

  "<p>Following the Conservative party conference this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/young-people-does-theresa-mays-politics-speak-to-you\">we asked younger readers</a> whether Theresa May\u2019s politics spoke to them, and what issues they felt mattered to their generation. Here is a selection of responses.</p> <h2>Yes, she spoke to me</h2> <p><strong>Celine Kart, 18, from Calderdale: \u2018A lot of young women like me look up to Theresa May as she\u2019s strong and compassionate\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd980aed7d920ddcaa546e8d403466e2538768f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd980aed7d920ddcaa546e8d403466e2538768f9/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Celine\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Kart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On BBC Radio 4 yesterday morning, Theresa May was asked what made her angry. She replied: \u201cInjustice, modern slavery, child sexual assault.\u201d She appeared compassionate and she\u2019s reminding us that women can stand out, be strong and compassionate at the same time. She is making a difference, and is reminding me that I can do all these things too. </p> <p>The political issues that matter to me are Brexit, human rights and international relations. I am very passionate about human rights as it\u2019s a basic necessity for everyone. I am also worried about Brexit as a young person, and I didn\u2019t vote to leave the EU. I think May is handling the situation as well as she can because we are in a limbo, waiting for article 50 to be triggered. She is trying to support people and give as much information as possible.</p> <p>Although I think May\u2019s speech and performance at the Conservative party conference was effective, and strong (necessary to prove herself as a new leader), it would\u2019ve been rewarding to have seen her discuss issues beyond Brexit. Obviously it\u2019s important but why not focus on other areas of concern, such as the humanitarian crisis, as well? <br></p> <p>I find May appealing because she is a woman in a patriarchal world and I know a lot of young women like me look up to her. When she was first elected I had my reservations but I think she\u2019s done a lot. I am not a Conservative voter normally \u2013 up until now I\u2019ve supported Labour \u2013 but May has changed all that. She has offered a good alternative to Corbyn who is not assertive enough.<br></p> <p><strong>James, 27, from London: \u2018May\u2019s policies speak to me in a way other politicians\u2019 have not\u2019</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t know. May\u2019s policies have spoken to me in a way that the current rhetoric from the Labour and Lib Dem parties have not \u2013 it\u2019s strange because I have been a lifetime opponent of the Tories. Labour are too far to the left, and I can\u2019t stomach Jeremy Corbyn or Momentum. The previously centre-leaning Labour politicians seem lost at sea, and don\u2019t really seem to be speaking to anyone right now.</p> <p>May\u2019s performance was very strong. I would like a strong condemnation of the current anti-immigrant sentiment, however. May\u2019s remarks on immigration are a cheap shot and can only vindicate the racist behaviour that has increased since the referendum. I believe it\u2019s possible to be anti-immigration and not racist, but I fear May\u2019s speech may well have added fuel to the fire. </p> <p><strong>Molly Rose, 21, from Dundee: Theresa May has a brain and shows common sense, unlike other politicians</strong></p> <p>Theresa May has taken a strong stance with Brexit by repealing the European Communities Act. She also may be enforcing a strict immigration policy and looks set to repeal the Human Rights Act. She is a powerful and driven women, a a role model to everyone. What\u2019s more, unlike the other idiots in politics she actually seems to have half a brain and shows some common sense. </p> <p>The big issues that matter to me are Brexit, because if it is done clumsily then Britain will not be better off. However, if we get it right then the country could thrive. I am a huge fan of May. She has had a hugely successful week. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/565ge\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2779394\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come\u2019 \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57f51072e4b08ebe3d557166\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/05/161005Mayhighlightsagain2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-tory-party-conference-video-highlights\">Theresa May\u2019s speech to Tory conference: \u2018Change has got to come - video highlights </a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>No, she didn\u2019t speak to me<br></h2> <p><strong>Ben Jones, 22, from London: \u2018I would have liked May to talk less about Brexit and more about building houses\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec366ab5db514253a6a8b594cc8764c298edd5f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec366ab5db514253a6a8b594cc8764c298edd5f5/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Ben Jones\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Jones</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theresa May seems to think migration has caused the supposed decline in life chances for the English working classes, but young people don\u2019t see it like this. We are European, if not global, in outlook, and value our cultural and historic connection with Europe. We don\u2019t blame migration for poor social mobility. After all, most areas of significant white working-class deprivation also have a smaller population of immigrants. </p> <p>As a young person living in London, the big issue for me is housing. As mayor, Boris Johnson made little difference to my chances of owning a home, and most people my age have accepted that in a few years we might not even be able to rent, let alone buy, in the capital. I want a government that will prioritise creating more affordable housing. High rents impact on my life in many ways: I have no financial security and cannot plan for the future. If I had a medical emergency, for example, I would have to turn to my parents for help.</p> <p>The politician I am more inclined to support is Jeremy Corbyn, but more because he is the best out of a bad bunch. I agree with a lot of his policies, such as the funding of a national education service, but also think that he puts a lot of people off as he is seen as stubborn.</p> <p>In her speech, I would like May to have given less weight to hard Brexiteers and talked about about committing money to housebuilding and ringfencing school and health budgets. She does, however, come across as very determined and more measured than David Cameron. I think that this is appealing to a wider section of society and she does seem more honest. </p> <p><strong>Michael Claro, 26, Glasgow: \u2018The Conservatives do not care about working people\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5168eb9e898d3e84549b55972f3b555409198fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5168eb9e898d3e84549b55972f3b555409198fe8/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Michael Claro\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Claro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I do not believe that Theresa May or the newest incarnation of the Tory party care about working people. It is very difficult to believe that the party that only favours the very rich, and crafts its policies around the financial interests of the elite, now suddenly stands for working people. Ultimately I have little confidence that Theresa May will represent anyone but the wealthy. She is too out of touch with the state of the world today, and will likely ignore forward-thinking ideas in favour of paradigms she is accustomed to. </p> <p>I want a government that prioritises protecting the environment. There seems to be no real effort to conserve and preserve Britain\u2019s natural heritage. As well as this, protecting workers\u2019 rights is important \u2013 everyone has a part to play in society, not just the wealthy and those who work full-time should enjoy a decent quality of life. I also believe in promoting universal education and innovation: the UK should be modelling its policies on the Scandinavian countries, who provide free university education to their citizens.</p> <p>Much of Theresa May\u2019s speech was an overture to the disgruntled Ukip voters who the Tory party attempt to capture. She suggested that Britain would now become a real economic player on the world stage, but what exactly does that mean? I would have liked her to delineate specific proposals for promoting innovation, creativity, and sustainability for Britain\u2019s economy. These are the qualities that will make Britain stronger, not reverting to an outdated, obsolete economic ideology.</p> <p><strong>Sophia Gore, 24, Brighton: \u2018The future of the UK is very uncertain in her hands\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51a1f3c1161ec62e06b8eda5657d3645e62e42dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51a1f3c1161ec62e06b8eda5657d3645e62e42dc/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Sophia Gore\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophia Gore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I find her prioritisation of immigration alarming and quite terrifying. She is steadily isolating Britain and alienating us from the EU. She is not recognising that while, yes, 52% of the population voted for Brexit, the remaining 48% voted in. I am confused with her ideological positioning. She claims to want to provide equal opportunities but is forcing through the academy bill, which to me is absurd and contrary to her public stance.</p> <p>I am also terrified that she has kept Jeremy Hunt as health secretary. The NHS is tragically crumbling before our eyes and steadily moving steps closer to privatisation. I also wish that she would take a greater stance on environmental issues, the elephant in the room.</p> <p>I prefer her to David Cameron, but to be honest I feel the future of the UK is very uncertain in her hands, especially in terms of maintaining positive relations with the EU. I am just very sad that we are in this position of Brexit and that she is evidently now campaigning for a \u201chard\u201d exit.

  "<p>Compare and contrast two speeches: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s to the Labour party conference in Liverpool, and the prime minister\u2019s to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham.

Corbyn stated that Labour will build more than 1m new homes \u2013 at least half of them council houses \u2013 \u201cand we will control private rents, so we can give every British family that basic human right: a decent home.\u201d For Labour, fairness means everyone having the same access to basic needs, and housing is truly one of the most basic but often denied needs, regardless of their position in society.</p> <p>For May, fairness means \u201cmeritocracy\u201d, a theme she returned to throughout her speech.

In many areas immigration has lowered local rents, and since one of Britain\u2019s big problems is the lack of a skilled workforce, without migrant workers house-building would falter significantly.

  "<p>Theresa May has been urged to do more to improve conditions for young people and reduce growing intergenerational inequality in Britain.</p> <p>Campaign groups have urged the prime minister to do more than the previous government, including rolling back some of its policies, if she was serious in her speech to the Conservative party conference about ending the \u201cdivision and unfairness\u201d that exists in British society, including that \u201cbetween a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation\u201d.</p> <p>Angus Hanton, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/\">Intergenerational Foundation</a>, said: \u201cAt the very least, she should roll back the exclusion of under-25s from the national living wage and housing benefit; protect young people from being excluded from in-work protections and benefits enjoyed by older colleagues; say goodbye to high interest charged in student loans; and better protect young people forced to pay high rents to rogue landlords and high fees to unscrupulous lettings\u2019 agents,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income\">A Guardian investigation earlier this year</a> revealed that British young adults suffer from an unprecedented inequality between generations due to a combination of debt, joblessness, globalisation, demographics and rising house prices.</p> <p>Sorana Vieru, vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said the policies for universities outlined by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, on Monday \u2013 which included a promise to cut the number of international students from outside the EU to reduce immigration \u2013 would be \u201cabsolutely disastrous\u201d for Britain\u2019s universities.</p> <p>She added that if there were a reduction in the number of international students, who tend to pay significantly higher university fees than local students, universities would see a reduction in income of about 15% to 20%, a loss of funding that local students would most likely have to plug.</p> <p>Vieru also said that May\u2019s talk of eliminating generational inequality was \u201cjust rhetoric\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s to blame for [the inequality]?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s Tory policies such as tripling tuition fees, turning maintenance grants into loans, whereas older generations have gone to university for free and had living grants as well. Who\u2019s to blame for the fact we\u2019re the generation with the largest student debt? It hasn\u2019t happened on its own; it\u2019s a result of austerity measures.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the prime minister\u2019s speech offered \u201cnothing of substance for the next generation\u201d on many important issues, including childcare and apprenticeships.</p> <p> \u201cIf we want a long-term, sustainable economy, these issues have to be addressed now, not simply swept under the carpet. Yet, instead, young people are seeing less opportunity, less security and a Britain closing itself off from the world,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about pitting one generation against the next, but we cannot as a country continue to focus entirely on the oldest generations because of short-term political considerations. What the Tories seem to have forgotten is that this generation of older people are parents and grandparents, too. They want opportunities for their children and grandchildren, and they don\u2019t want their own financial comfort to be at their children and grandchildren\u2019s expense,\u201d said Farron.</p> <p>One area where May might offer hope to younger people is home ownership, which is out of reach for most young people as a result of sky-rocketing house prices in the past few decades.</p> <p>Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said it was encouraging that May put housing at the centre of her speech. </p> <p>\u201cOur research shows how much housing contributes to poverty. She has highlighted the right issue. For us, what we now want to see is what are the concrete policies she\u2019s going to put in place to achieve it,\u201d said Barnard.</p> <p>During her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister said that high housing costs and the gap between those who own property and those who don\u2019t \u201clie at the heart of falling social mobility, falling savings and low productivity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an honest truth we need to address: we simply need to build more homes,\u201d said May.</p> <p>Duncan Stott, director of Priced Out, which campaigns for affordable homes, said that, in terms of her approach to housing, May seemed to be heading \u201cbroadly in the right direction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see more of an emphasis on building, rather than an emphasis on subsidies for ownership, which just push up house prices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing some steps in the right direction, she at least gets the issue, but it\u2019s whether she\u2019s going to come up with any policies that will do what we need to genuinely tackle the housing crisis.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>\u201cI am ready to die for conserving the rhino,\u201d says Wisdom Makhubele. But the brave young ranger now has another weapon in the war against rhino poaching: the extraordinary nose of tracking hounds.<br></p> <p>The trained dogs can run poachers to ground far faster than people, sometimes even being set free in packs and followed from helicopters. The new canine training unit at the Southern African Wildlife College (SAWC), near Acornhoek, opened earlier this year and dogs have already brought armed poachers to heel in Kruger national park, the epicentre of the rhino poaching crisis.</p> <p>At least 6,000 African rhinos have been slaughtered by poachers since 2008, to fuel the soaring demand for its horn in Asia, where it is highly valued as a supposed tonic and status symbol. The rhino poaching epidemic across Africa has exploded in recent years, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/record-number-of-african-rhinos-killed-in-2015\">annual increases in killings every year since 2009</a>: 1,338 were slaughtered in 2015. </p> <p>It was a hot topic at the major wildlife trade summit in Johannesburg this week, where an attempt by Swaziland to legalise rhino horn trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/03/bid-for-stronger-protection-for-all-african-elephants-defeated-at-wildlife-summit\">was defeated</a>.</p> <p>South Africa hosts more than 90% of the 20,000 surviving white rhinos and almost half the 4,800 remaining black rhinos and saw a slight dip in the slaughter in 2015, the first decrease in nine years. Over 70% of the rhino kills occur in Kruger and a sign on the way into the park reads \u201cPoachers will be poached\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19e82392a0162073bb3e271170ca0d50b758707a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e82392a0162073bb3e271170ca0d50b758707a/0_0_5100_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airforce helmet with an anti-poaching slogan on the back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airforce helmet with an anti-poaching slogan on the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Edwards/NG/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dogs have been used for camp security for years, but the escalating poaching crisis has found them a new role. \u201cThey are awesome \u2013 they are instinctive to tracking,\u201d says Johan van Straaten, manager of the dog unit, which has been funded by <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.za/what_we_do/wwf_nedbank_green_trust/?18801/Using-Community-Based-Natural-Resource-Managment-to-benefit-Rhino\">WWF Nedbank Green Trust</a>. \u201cAll these dogs can track, it\u2019s in their genes. But we train them to track the scent we want. These dogs are imprinted on human scent, like narcotics dogs are on drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Two dozen dogs are in training at the camp, protected from predators by an 8,000-volt electric fence. Most are cross-breeds of English foxhounds and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetick_Coonhound\">blueticks</a>, although beagles are being tested too. They are trained to detect poached horns and weapons as well as track. The rest of the pack are Belgian Malinois, a slightly smaller, more agile German shepherd, which are used for \u201cbite work\u201d \u2013 apprehending poachers.</p> <p>Sophie, a seven-month-old hound, is first out of the kennels to start training today. It\u2019s only her third outing, but she criss-crosses the ground and picks up the scent left by Makhubele in seconds and bounds off in pursuit. She leads van Straaten like an arrow to the hollow 500m away where Makhubele is hiding. If the dog loses the scent on older trails, the handler helps out, looking for footprints or flattened grass. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork,\u201d says Makhubele.</p> <p>Next out is Belgian Malinois, Dozer, this time chasing Makhubele who has donned a thick padded jacket. Makhubele runs off screaming and shouting and Dozer is given the order \u201cbring him!\u201d. The dog latches on to Makhubele\u2019s arm and refuses to let go, even when swung from the ground.</p> <p>The dogs are first trained to bite the arm, says Makhubele: \u201cBut later we train them to bite everywhere.\u201d After Dozer is stood down, he pads around looking for strokes and praise. \u201cIt\u2019s controlled aggression,\u201d says van Straaten. </p> <p>Currently, about a third of Kruger\u2019s 22 ranger stations have a trained dog but the aim is to have four dogs per station, so all of the day\u2019s patrols can use them. <a href=\"https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=55353\">South African National Parks have trained</a> and <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Rhino-poachers-get-14-years-in-prison-thanks-to-tracking-dog-20151027\">used their own tracker dogs</a> for a few years and in Kenya, <a href=\"http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/12/tracker-dogs-are-an-elephants-best-friend/\">bloodhounds are now tracking elephant poachers</a>. But the independent SAWC now provides the dogs for any park at 100,000 rand (\u00a35,500) each to cover training costs.</p> <p>Van Straaten says the dogs have helped him catch many poachers, most of whom come quietly once surrounded, but he has been involved in shootouts. \u201cI like it,\u201d he says with a careful smile. \u201cIt\u2019s adrenaline, and being afraid makes you sharp.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad278f722d664a72563c69f433237c627b73bb77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad278f722d664a72563c69f433237c627b73bb77/0_0_5112_3516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracker hounds in Kruger national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018These dogs are imprinted on human scent, like narcotics dogs are on drugs.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Farrell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being a ranger in the war on poaching can be deadly \u2013 more than <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/content/rising-murder-toll-park-rangers-calls-tougher-laws\">1,000 rangers were killed </a>around the world in the last decade and many more injured.

The 128 trainee rangers currently at SAWC live in tents, with inspection drill every morning and severe physical training. Their enemy are often ex-military too, frequently coming across the border from <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/negotiations-between-frelimo-renamo-suspended-mozambique-war-escalates-1573691\">troubled Mozambique</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA ranger\u2019s life in South Africa used to be all about conservation but now it is all about anti-poaching and that is sad,\u201d said Theresa Sowry, SAWC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut they are fully aware of the risks, which is why we have had to up the training.\u201d</p> <p>Self defence is a critical part of this, she says: \u201cIf you have a weapon pointed at you, you have the right to shoot.

  "<h2><strong>Unreported World </strong><br>7.30pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Two episodes into its 32nd series, Unreported World has lost none of its knack for spotting those stories that are engaging in and of themselves, and also reflective of wider trends. Tonight\u2019s documentary sees Marcel Theroux, accompanied by director Daniel Bogado, travel to India to report on the matchmaking enterprises being established by people who have a disability \u2013 an added pressure in a marriage&#xa0;market already warped by a&#xa0;combination of caste, faith and parental expectations. <em>Andrew&#xa0;Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Have I Got News for You </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Arriving for a 52nd series, HIGNFY has rarely been more welcome. Over the next 11 weeks, Ian Hislop and Paul Merton will, as ever, captain the teams skewering the increasing ludicrousness of world affairs. They\u2019ll be running over the US presidential election, too, which is likely to provide ample quarry for some terrifying hilarity. Nick&#xa0;Clegg has a go in the host\u2019s chair, while Kevin Bridges is one of the week\u2019s&#xa0;guest panellists. <em>Ben&#xa0;Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>People\u2019s History of Pop </strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Pop didn\u2019t hang about in the old days: as host Pauline Black recalls, the Selecter had been away just six weeks on their 1980 US tour, but on their return the new romantics were already in full swing. Tribalism is the watchword for this episode, looking at 1976 to 1985. We meet Clash fans, Durannies&#xa0;and a young girl whose destiny was changed by the Smiths. It\u2019s followed by a documentary on the making of the Wailers\u2019 classic Catch a Fire. <em>Ali&#xa0;Catterall</em></p> <h2>Bob\u2019s Burgers <br>9pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>Loren Bouchard\u2019s animated sitcom continues to balance snark with sensitivity as the sixth season continues. The first episode of this double-bill concentrates on that childhood staple, the shopping mall Santa.

In the second episode, the family unite, fall apart and then just about unite again during an eventful dinner. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Aquarius <br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Tonight\u2019s double-bill begins with episode seven, in which the tension is eminently bearable following the buildup to a 1969 murder we know David Duchovny\u2019s Sam has no chance of thwarting. Rewind to a year earlier, however, and there\u2019s a needlessly unpleasant scene involving his interrogation of a black maid he suspects of murder. Meanwhile, the Family has a new arrival: Sadie is pregnant. And in episode eight, Sam is confronted by Manson.<em> David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Still Game </strong><br>9.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Another of the recent zombie sitcoms, which is to say a comedy genre looking surprisingly lively after being thought long dead. Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill reprise their roles as Scottish pensioners Jack and Victor, two elderly gents occupying themselves with pub and newspaper and Summer Wine-style farce.

And if that looks confusing and contradictory from the outside, imagine how it feels on the inside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This week has revealed a government still interestingly unsure of its ground</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>May was right to point out this week how many politicians and journalists were wrong about Brexit. But her attack on the dreaded leftie liberal elite disguises the fact that they certainly weren\u2019t alone in getting it wrong. Plenty of outers didn\u2019t see victory coming either, judging by private conversations in the run-up to the referendum, and nor did many of May\u2019s current cabinet.</p> <p>Not long ago the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was earnestly telling us how Brexit would hurt the NHS, and Amber Rudd was socking it to leavers in the TV debate. What a difference a referendum makes. This week Hunt, an instinctive internationalist whose wife is Chinese, was trumpeting plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/telling-nhs-doctors-go-home-self-harming-madness\" title=\"\">train more British-born doctors instead of importing them</a> \u2013 prompting a furious row over whether foreign doctors are being tacitly encouraged to leave.</p> <p>Rudd, a socially liberal ex-journalist, meanwhile suggested companies be forced to publish data about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\" title=\"\">how many foreign staff they employ</a>. In a country happily relaxed about immigration, that might have sounded more pointless than sinister. In the current climate, she was accused of being one step away from handing out yellow stars.</p> <p>And yes, it\u2019s scary stuff. But it also falls apart surprisingly quickly when prodded, and therein lies the ray of hope: this isn\u2019t a cabinet of racists. It\u2019s a cabinet peppered with people terrified of being exposed as closet liberal elitists, clumsily second-guessing what people they\u2019d once have regarded as racists think, only without the instinctive feel that true believers often have for when they\u2019re going too far. Push back hard enough, and they give surprisingly fast.</p> <p>Within hours, May was clarifying that she didn\u2019t actually want to send any foreign-born doctors back, while Rudd was on radio explaining that her plan wasn\u2019t necessarily going to happen \u2013 and the odds, given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\">instant backlash from business</a>, are certainly against it. (When ministers asked firms to publish minimal and anonymised data about male and female salaries as part of its equality strategy, the furious complaints about red tape and unfair bad publicity nearly killed the plan. If they\u2019re that afraid of a little light feminist critique, imagine how chief executives feel about ending up on some far-right hit list of supposedly \u201cunpatriotic\u201d businesses reliant on Romanians.)</p> <p>If Rudd wants to see how divisive this idea might prove in the workplace, meanwhile, she could simply look down the cabinet table. Boris Johnson was born in New York, lived there until he was five, and until last year held dual American and British passports. Should May have hired a homegrown foreign secretary? Or should we be embarrassed to live in the sort of country where anyone would raise that question?</p> <p>The damage is done now, of course. Some people will have heard the dog whistle all right, but missed the dogs being called off later. Sadly, those who have felt unwelcome here since June may simply feel more so. But the whole episode reveals a government still interestingly unsure of its ground, precisely because much of this isn\u2019t naturally its ground; it\u2019s still feeling its way in circumstances most ministers didn\u2019t anticipate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/birmingham-witnessing-tory-reformation-conservative-conference-brexit\">We are witnessing nothing less than a Tory reformation  | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That means it can be shamed, it can be reasoned with, and now its defences have been tested properly its weak spots are more obvious \u2013 as are the places where arrows ping helplessly off its armour. And Labour ought to know, because it\u2019s been there.</p> <p>There was more than a whiff of Blue Labour \u2013 the economically leftwing, socially rightwing, heavily nostalgic movement that was fashionable for a while under Ed Miliband \u2013 about May\u2019s agenda this week, and that provides some interesting clues as to where it might get unstuck. Team Miliband liked Blue Labour\u2019s ideas on economic justice but balked at their awkward, uncomfortable messages on immigration (with the arguable exception of Balls, who was raising concerns over freedom of movement back in 2010).</p> <p>Judging by the wild applause for every mention of Brexit in Birmingham, and the silence when May promised to protect workers\u2019 rights, Red Toryism has a similar problem in reverse. But if the 2015 election result is anything to go by, cherrypicking the easy bits and ignoring the harder ones doesn\u2019t work; like trying to dance a waltz without a partner, people can see something\u2019s missing.</p> <p>Trying to keep both ideologically warring halves of the package together, however, is like trying to waltz with someone who\u2019s trying to make you dance the Charleston. Blue Labour excelled at capturing what angry voters thought, but could never quite turn it into coherent policy. Judging by last week, the Red Tories are about to find out how that feels.</p>",

Vote-by-mail requests among Hispanics in Florida, for example, were up 77% since this juncture four years ago, Mook said. </p> <p>The trend of more vote-by-mail requests extended to other demographics who have increasingly voted Democrat and might feel alienated by Trump, such as Asian Americans. Changes to strict voter ID laws in some battlegrounds, enacted by Republicans and found to disproportionately target minorities, would also help to boost Clinton\u2019s campaign, Mook said.</p> <p>\u201cWe think we have a superior turnout operation than Donald Trump does and early voting is the time when we can really put that to use and exploit that advantage that we have,\u201d Mook said.</p> <p>Republicans have historically dominated the process of voting early by mail.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a> has been in the eye of many storms this year. The state of emergency declared by Governor Pat McCrory ahead of the expected arrival of Hurricane Matthew this weekend follows similar civil measures in September when the police killing of a black man set off a wave of angry protests on the streets of the state\u2019s largest city, Charlotte.</p> <p>Few of the tempests to sweep by in 2016 have defined the national mood quite as much, though, as the political maelstrom battering this state. A vital battleground in the presidential election, North Carolina could determine whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> manages to assemble enough angry white voters to make it all the way to the White House. A \u201cbathroom ban\u201d preventing transgender students from using toilets not matching the gender on their birth certificates has reopened the wounds of America\u2019s culture wars, leading to a boycott by college sport authorities and protests from leading employers such as Apple, American Airlines and Bank of America.</p> <p>But the conservative wave that allowed Republicans to take control of all layers of local government in the state is now threatening to drown the party itself. The fervour stoked by battles over gay rights, voter registration laws, and immigration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-nascar-north-carolina-republicans\">putting off many moderates</a> and could yet see Democrats win presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races here in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/06/battleground-states-north-carolina-trump-clinton-sharp-divisions\">Battleground states: North Carolina's sharp divides put election on knife-edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has made such controversies so shocking to many outsiders is that the Tar Heel state had long since stopped conforming to any easy stereotypes of a politically conservative southern backwater. The recent protests against the killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte took place among gleaming downtown high-rises of the New South \u2013 race riots shattering the calm of what otherwise appears a diverse and progressive boomtown at the heart of one of America\u2019s major transport and financial hubs.</p> <p>Pride in North Carolina\u2019s modern and open economy is still visible, despite the high-profile battles over sexual and racial equality. Drive into the state from the north, and road signs quickly herald its repeated ability to win Nobel prizes, celebrating last year\u2019s award of the chemistry prize to a Turkish American biochemist, Aziz Sancar, based at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill.

He casts his guests in a burlesque he scripts for them, and cattle-prods them into playing their parts, first fawning over them until they feel like celebrities, then bringing down the hammer of humiliation. He\u2019s a diabolically domineering scene partner. No interviewer has ever been as adroit with treacherous leading questions in the vein of \u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d Stern, in other words, gets people to publicly embrace their worst selves\u2014and say things they live to regret.</p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened with Trump. Today, as the Republican nominee, he may fashion himself as a boss and a master of the universe. But what comes across in old tapes of the show, resurfaced recently by BuzzFeed and other outlets, is that Trump, like many of Stern\u2019s guests, was often the one being played. By nailing him as a buffoon and then\u2014unkindest cut\u2014forcing him to kiss the Howard Stern ring, Stern and his co-anchor, Robin Quivers, created a series of broadcasts that today showcase not just Trump\u2019s misogyny but his ready submission to sharper minds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/howard-stern-donald-trump-2016-214322#ixzz4MK5DCjOP\">full piece here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f674cae4b03b0685c083de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T16:06:40.025Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul Ryan to campaign with Donald Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So much for every Republican running away from Trump.

If you\u2019re on the east coast from Palm Beach northwards you\u2019re likely to see wind from 100-150 mph. Just think about that. These catastrophic levels can completely wipe out well-built homes and destroy neighbourhoods.\u201d</p> <p>He said more than 6,000 national guard troops were activated or on standby to assist with evacuations and rescue efforts.<br></p> <p>Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center (NHC), confirmed Scott\u2019s assessment on Thursday evening. \u201cThe worst of the conditions will be north of Palm Beach, northward from there all the way up through the Georgia and South Carolina coast later tonight, through Friday and into Saturday,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Weather.com reported that no category 4 storm had struck anywhere in northern Florida or Georgia since 1898.

Effects such as these ranging from the coast to well inland have not been experienced in central Florida for decades.\u201d</p> <p>More than 1.5 million Floridians living along the coast and in vulnerable low-lying areas, and another half million residents of Georgia and South Carolina, were ordered to evacuate ahead of the storm\u2019s arrival. Florida Power and Light, the state\u2019s largest electricity supplier, reported Thursday afternoon that more than 13,000 customers lost power in southern Florida as Matthew\u2019s outer rain and wind bands came ashore and weather conditions deteriorated quickly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/oct/06/hurricane-matthew-preparations-and-aftermath-in-pictures\">Hurricane Matthew: preparations and aftermath \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThere are no excuses, you need to leave.

If you are in a hotel and you feel safe stay there, if you\u2019re going to one of our shelters, go there and if you have family and friends go there. Now is the time to hunker down for the storm and get off the roads,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Although earlier fears of a direct hit to southern Florida failed to materialize, Matthew\u2019s projected path north over the next 36 hours continued to hug the eastern Florida coast towards Georgia, and in its 5pm advisory the NHC extended hurricane warnings north to South Santee River, South Carolina.<br></p> <p>South Carolina governor Nikki Haley ordered residents of Horry and Georgetown counties, close to the North Carolina border to evacuate, and the NWS warned that flooding in downtown Charleston could be even worse than the historic flooding of October 2015.</p> <p>Pat McCrory, the North Carolina governor, meanwhile extended an existing emergency declaration to all 100 counties in the state.</p> <p>In the longer term, Matthew was expected to weaken to a category 2 hurricane during Saturday, and eventually downgrade to a tropical storm early next week before making a south-easterly loop back for another assault on Florida.</p>"
