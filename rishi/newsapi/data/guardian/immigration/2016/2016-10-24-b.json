At 23, he is five years too old to be taken in under the Dublin regulation.</p> <p>\u201cI am six months here in the camp. My whole family, my brothers and sisters are living in the UK, and my nephews. I have no one in my country. So what I have to do, I have to join my family. But they say \u2018no, no\u2019 you are not a teenager. You should go back to your country.</p> <p>\u201cThey said I should apply for asylum. I am allowed to apply for asylum in France but I don\u2019t want, I want to rejoin my family in UK. My brother, sisters, sisters-in-law have been there for 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cI am an educated person. How can I live here?,\u201d he asks pointing to the camp. \u201c[The Taliban] said \u2018you are not muslim, you are working for government officials\u2019,\u201d he says to explain why he fled his country.</p> <p>\u201cOfficials say I have no reason to be here. But why would I be here? I have a problem. [You have to ask] why am I here in this jungle place.\u201d</p> <p>He says he does not want to be cleared from the site but will reluctantly board the bus when his time comes.</p> <p>\u201cI am not happy. I am not happy with what happened with me. My family are like a few hundred kilometres from me and now I have to go a thousand kilometres back.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s UK and France double standards. They look after the children. And I understand, they are helpless. But I am helpless too.\u201d</p> <p>He said the challenges in the camp were a symptom of war and injustice that the west has had a part in.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 10,000 individuals in there, 10,000 minds in there. Each one of them has a story, has their individual problem, each one has their reason to be there. Some of them are crazy, sometimes there are fights. But you have to ask, what made them like that. No one wants to be in the jungle, no one.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the squalor of the camp, the lack access to cooking facilities, to privacy, to education, he said: \u201cThis is a violation of human rights. The UK and France are responsible for this. This is an injustice.\u201d</p> <p>He spent $13,000 to get to France to be within what he thought was a whisker of his family, but now the devastation is writ large on his face as he heads to join the queues for the buses. \u201cI understand they want to help children and take them to the UK. but I am a human too. I am human too,\u201d he says, almost in tears.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhoNQgs-Sc4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DhoNQgs-Sc4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Habib Ahmadzai</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Majit Nurzei, from Afghanistan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dd099319b51430c7227daf29b481d68fc68f148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd099319b51430c7227daf29b481d68fc68f148/489_176_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calais camp clearance: Nine men from one village.

Like many they asked to be kept together. The French officials who were handed out the colour-coded wristbands were obliging anyone who wanted to be kept together with their friends. They were shown a large map of the regions of France and asked which one they wanted to go to.</p> <p>By lunchtime, there were off to a new life and the first proper bed for months. \u201cGoodbye Jungle,\u201d they chant as they are shepherded into their last tent before they board the bus.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfGt7uaVuzI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TfGt7uaVuzI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Mimi Gebreh Howit, 29 and Tigst Lakew, 29 from Eritrea</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c8e4575e4bafe27e574c9db43d3b46118618f7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c8e4575e4bafe27e574c9db43d3b46118618f7d/0_13_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mimi Gebreh Howit and Tigst Lakew - Eritreans living in the Calais camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mimi Gebreh Howit and Tigst Lakew - Eritreans living in the Calais camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa O'Carroll for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mimi and Tigst have been in the camp for three months and through broken English they explain they \u201chad no choice\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am not happy to be in this camp and I am not happy to leave because I don\u2019t know what will happen now.

They are worried France won\u2019t grant them asylum because it doesn\u2019t recognise them as persecuted, based on the experience of others who have been rejected.</em></p> <p><em>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said everyone in the Calais camp would be offered the chance to be transferred to a reception centre where they could apply for asylum. </em><em>\u201cThere will be no blanket decisions for certain nationalities,\u201d spokeswoman Laura Padoan said.</em></p> <p><em>French asylum chief Pascal Brice recently visited the Jungle and offered reassurances to the migrants and refugees, including the Oromo group, said Solan. </em><em>Brice was not available for comment when the Thomson Reuters Foundation contacted his office on Monday.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cIf they accept us we want to stay here (in France),\u201d said Solan, who did not want to give his full name. \u201cWe are not searching for a better country, we are here (in Calais) because England accepts Oromo people.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>Solan has been moving back and forth between Calais and a makeshift migrant camp in Paris for the past year, he said.

Under pressure from Britain, which sees it as having a \u201cpull\u201d effect on migration, the camp is closed in 2002. Hundreds of mainly Afghan migrants then set up camp east of Calais, on a patch of scrubland next to a road travelled by lorries heading for Calais port. The migrants call it \u201cthe Jungle\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>September 2009</strong>, the Jungle is demolished for the first time on the orders of then president Nicolas Sarkozy, following a mass police raid in which scores of people are arrested.<br></li> <li>In <strong>early 2015</strong>, a new settlement - labelled the \u201cNew Jungle\u201d - sprouts up near a state-run day centre for migrants established at the site. The camp later becomes simply known as the Jungle. <br></li> <li>From <strong>mid-2015 on</strong>, migrants attempting to board lorries or enter the Channel Tunnel frequently clash with police around the camp, which mushrooms in size as asylum-seekers pour into Europe in unprecedented numbers. That November, France\u2019s top administrative court rapped the government over conditions in the camp, describing them as \u201cinhuman\u201d.<br></li> <li>In <strong>January 2016</strong>, the port of Calais is shut for more than three hours after dozens of migrants occupy a moored Britain-bound ferry. A month later, around 20 people are arrested in Calais at a banned rally by supporters of Germany\u2019s xenophobic Pegida movement.<br></li> <li>The southern half of the Jungle camp is demolished in late <strong>February 2016 and early March</strong>, sparking protests. Iranian migrants protesting at the destruction of their shacks sew their mouths shut. The evicted migrants moved to the northern part of the camp.<br></li> <li>On <strong>26 September</strong>, President Francois Hollande says the Jungle will be demolished by the end of the year and that the migrants - estimated to number around 6,000 - will be moved to shelters around the country.<br></li> <li>On <strong>October 21</strong> the interior ministry confirms the operation to tear down the camp will start on Monday, 24 October (today). Migrants began evacuating early in the morning, with the first bus carrying about 50 Sudanese leaving the Jungle at about 08:45 am (0645 GMT). <br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580de333e4b0c146d5891341\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:34:47.178Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">600 people bussed away from Calais camp by 11.30am</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By 11:30, 600 refugees &amp; migrants had left by bus to places including burgundy, north eastern France, western France <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/calais?src=hash\">#calais</a></p>&mdash; Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/achrisafis/status/790500129530908673\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:35:04.270Z\">at 11.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580de2ade4b0ce434eca471c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T10:31:36.233Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our reporters have arrived back at the processing queues and say that all is now calm in the area.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s right Britain should be doing its bit as well.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThere has to be a plan between both France and Britain to help the children and teenagers right now.

Once the clearances start, we know that there is a significant risk that many of those children and young people disappear. That is what happened last time when part of the camp was closed without a plan for the children and teenagers.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the consequence is they slip into the arms of the smuggler gangs, the traffickers.

  "<p>Hundreds more refugee children are to be brought from Calais to Britain in the next three weeks but one in four local authorities in England, including Theresa May\u2019s own council, say they cannot take responsibility for them.<br></p> <p>As the French clearance operation got under way at the Calais refugee camp, the home secretary told MPs that 800 children claiming family links with Britain have been interviewed by Home Office officials in the camp in the past week.</p> <p>Amber Rudd said that almost 200 children have been brought to Britain in recent days, including 60 girls under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Dubs amendment</a>, which is designed to protect vulnerable child refugees across Europe. But 38 councils out of 156 in England have so far refused to take part in resettling those who have arrived.</p> <p>A total of 1,918 Calais camp residents, including 300 children, packed their bags and passed through the official registration centre on Monday, the French interior ministry said. A fleet of 46 buses started to take them to regions all over France, except Paris and Corsica, leaving an estimated 8,000 remaining in the camp waiting to be processed.</p> <p>Rudd told the Commons that Britain will not accept applications from anybody who has arrived in the Calais camp after today and that those to be brought to Britain will go through proper age assessment and security checks before they come.</p> <p>\u201cWe will only consider those present in the camps before the start of clearances [of the camp],\u201d the home secretary added. \u201cWe will continue to do this quickly, but it is essential that we carry out the proper safeguarding, age assessment and security checks, working closely with local authorities and social workers here in the UK, to ensure that the children are eligible, and that it is in their best interests to come.\u201d</p> <p>Many of those queuing to leave the camp were Sudanese and Eritrean in a largely orderly operation. As officers opened the gates, people were guided into four queues \u2013 adult, family, child and vulnerable or disabled \u2013 and given a coloured wristband. Among them, Mohamed, 23, from Eritrea, said he was happy to leave, adding: \u201cThe camp is dirty and dangerous.\u201d He had been there for three months, he told the Guardian, and had tried to get asylum in France before.</p> <p>\u201cMy fingerprints were taken in Italy and wherever you go in Europe after that they say you have to go back to Italy under the Dublin regulation. Now they say for the first time the fingerprints don\u2019t matter and we can start applying for asylum again. I am happy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd902a24097004bae5d20311aac1bf8ab10b57a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd902a24097004bae5d20311aac1bf8ab10b57a/0_142_999_599/500.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Rudd makes a statement about refugee children in the House of Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Rudd makes a statement about refugee children in the House of Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unaccompanied minors are believed to be the only group staying in Calais, including 49 lone children under the age of 13. They will be taken to containers within a secure area of the camp previously used to house adults. But conflicting advice over where children should go was \u201cextremely distressing and confusing\u201d to those who were struggling to understand where they should go and how they were supposed to get there, according to the charity Help Refugees. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cUp to a thousand children are expected to be housed in the shipping containers and at present it appears there is nothing in the way of youth workers to be responsible for, and help calm, these young people and children,\u201d Help Refugees said.</p> <p>However, the Home Office said it had temporarily suspended the transfer of children from Calais to the UK on Monday at the request of the French authorities as they started preparations to clear the camp. </p> <p>Britain is to spend \u00a336m to help the French authorities ensure that the closure of the Calais camp \u2013 which has been a focus of charitable and humanitarian efforts \u2013 is \u201cfull and lasting\u201d and that it does not simply reappear in a few months time. This money includes \u00a314m on security at the port.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>By nightfall on Monday, French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said 1,918 people had been processed and sent to 80 centres around France. Another 400 unaccompanied minors were being housed in heated shelters at the camp.</p> <p>The operation, expected to last a week, would continue as long as necessary, Cazeneuve said. \u201cThis is an operation we want to be peaceful and under control. So far it is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rudd appealed to local authorities to come forward and volunteer to take more children under the Dubs amendment, saying there were not yet enough places. One of the councils that has refused to take any lone children from Calais is Windsor and Maidenhead council, which covers Theresa May\u2019s constituency. \u201cThe Royal Borough is currently taking in four children under the Syrian resettlement programme and has committed to house another eight Syrian refugee families. We are not able to take further people at this point,\u201d said a spokesperson.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to the magazine Children and Young People Now, three of the nine regional local authority areas have not signed up to the national transfer scheme under which the Dubs amendment children will be housed in Britain. The Home Office has refused to reveal which regions have not signed up but Leicestershire county council became the latest to refuse to take part.</p> <p>The last minute nature of the Home Office\u2019s response, coming as the camp was in the process of being cleared by the French authorities, was underlined by the disclosure by the Local Government Association that the home secretary and the children\u2019s minister only wrote to council leaders on 14 October asking them if they were willing to accept the Dubs children on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>Citizens UK spokesman George Gabriel said the suspension of further transfers to Britain was disappointing: \u201cWe hope that the progress made in the last week will resume tomorrow. The Home Office must not allow vulnerable children to fall back into the hands of people smugglers because of avoidable delays.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the home secretary of treating the Calais refugees as pawns and hiding behind the French authorities for her failure to identify those eligible to come to Britain far sooner. She said the demolition of the camp should have been postponed until the position of the child refugees had been properly safeguarded.</p> <p>Yusef, 35, a pharmacist from Sudan who spent three months living rough in Calais, and said that he hoped to claim asylum in France, said he had no idea where he would end up: \u201cI will close my eyes and put my finger on the map.\u201d</p> <p>But he was optimistic. \u201cI want to integrate to start a new life, contribute. I trust France to keep me safe.\u201d Once he had hopes of making it to the UK. \u201cBut that dream died here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat bridge is closed.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/tata-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry-replaced-ratan-tata-jaguar-land-rover-tata-steel\">The ousting of Cyrus Mistry as boss of Tata</a> is a shock and could have serious implications for the UK.</p> <p>Tata matters to the UK. It owns Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain, Tata Steel (11,000 jobs) and other brands including Tetley Tea.</p> <p>Theresa May is keen to draw up an industrial strategy for the country. One of the key people the prime minister needs to talk to for that is the boss of Tata. In fact, one of the first people Greg Clark met after becoming business secretary was Mistry in Mumbai.</p> <p>The end of Mistry\u2019s four-year tenure was revealed in a remarkably terse statement by the Indian conglomerate. \u201cThe decision was taken at a board meeting held here today,\u201d Tata said. Sources say there was discontent on the board and among shareholders about the financial performance of the group.</p> <p>The change at the top of Tata has created a storm in India, where it is arguably the country\u2019s most famous corporate group. Mistry\u2019s exit was the lead story on Indian news sites on Monday. To put it into context, Ratan Tata, who is replacing Mistry on an interim basis, wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi to inform him of the news.</p> <p>Tata has become renowned for its stability, privacy, and long-term perspective. Mistry only gave his first interview as Tata boss a few weeks ago, and that was to the group website. Tata\u2019s overseas expansion, particularly into Britain, created much pride in India.</p> <p>So this brutal switch at the top is extraordinary. Ratan Tata was chairman for 21 years before stepping aside for Mistry in 2012 after turning 75. Now he is back as chairman, at least for the next four months as a committee looks for a permanent replacement.</p> <p>Ironically, one the biggest criticisms from analysts and investors about Tata under Mistry has been the slow speed at which he has tackled the problems facing the conglomerate. </p> <p>Although Ratan Tata expanded the company around the world, some of the businesses he bought now look overpriced and in need of restructuring \u2013 perhaps none more so than Tata Steel. Tata paid \u00a36.2bn for the Corus steel business in 2007, which in hindsight was the top of the commodities and financial cycle.</p> <p>If only Tata had acted as decisively with its UK steel business as it has with axing Mistry. The Indian company announced it was reviewing the future of its UK business in March, but this remains unresolved.<br></p> <p>The departure of Mistry as chairman could be good news for Tata Steel\u2019s 11,000 UK workers because Ratan Tata is a renowned Anglophile who bought the business in the first place.</p> <p>But Mistry and Tata Steel had been making progress on a potential merger of its European steel operations with ThyssenKrupp and were close to a deal with the UK government about financial support and a restructuring of its pension scheme.</p> <p>There is now a new uncertainty hanging over this deal. After months of worrying about their future, workers at the Port Talbot steelworks owned by Tata Steel could do without this.</p> <h2>Heathrow</h2> <p>The main argument about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/heathrow-airport\">why Britain needs to expand its airport capacity in south-east England</a> is to help economic growth and encourage trade links with emerging markets such as China.</p> <p>But on the eve of the government announcing whether to expand Heathrow, Gatwick or neither, British Airways has quietly put a spanner in that argument.</p> <p>With remarkable timing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/24/ba-scraps-service-chinese-city-airport-expansion-heathrow-chengdu-decision-runway\">BA has decided to drop its flights from Heathrow to Chengdu</a>, the Chinese city that was cited by pro-expansion campaigners as a key destination. BA launched flights to Chengdu, its fourth Chinese destination, in late 2013. It had already trimmed the frequency of the service on the route.</p> <p>The success or failure of one route should not determine Britain\u2019s transport strategy. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, has previously blamed the problems getting a British visa for weak demand on flights to and from China. Nonetheless, it shows that some of the presumptions behind the arguments to expand Heathrow or Gatwick \u2013 such as the boost to Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 are by no means guaranteed.</p> <h2>BHS</h2> <p>Away from the House of Commons and its raucous criticism of Sir Philip Green, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bhs\">BHS</a> scandal is far from over. </p> <p>The department store chain\u2019s administrators, the Insolvency Service, and the Serious Fraud Office are all still hard at work establishing why the company collapsed and trying to recover money owed to it.<br></p> <p>As shown by the news at the weekend that the administrators to BHS are trying to wind up Retail Acquisitions, the company Dominic Chappell used to buy the retailer, there is still much work to do on this front.</p> <p>If Retail Acquisitions is wound up then Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, will gain access to it books and potentially recover funds that it owes BHS. This could be vital in understanding what went on before the collapse, which left more than \u00a31bn of debts and led to 11,000 job losses.</p>",

The advert and the pills are part of <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/nastio-mosquito\">N\u00e1stio Mosquito</a>\u2019s contribution to <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/en/exhibitions-prizes\">Artes Mundi 7</a>, which opened last Friday at both Chapter and the National Museum of Wales. The Angolan artist is one of six contenders for the \u00a340,000 prize, awarded every two years to an artist whose work engages \u201cwith the human condition, social reality and lived experience\u201d.

It felt as if the prize had come of age. Suppositories notwithstanding, I doubt Mosquito will win. His show looks bleak, but is worth hanging around for. A video plays on an old monitor bolted high on the wall of a room scattered with plastic chairs and empty beer bottles, as if some kind of party has been abandoned. The video is very funny, if a bit laboured, a fly-on-the-wall rehearsal of a speech being worked on by AL Moore, despotic and openly criminal and corrupt contender for the presidency of the fictional country of Botrovia. We watch him being presidential, and working on his speech in the lavatory. Reaming out the country\u2019s assets, profiting from drug deals, colluding with multinationals and intimidating opponents are Moore\u2019s stock in trade. This is the human condition, all right.</p> <p>Also at Chapter, and in the National Museum, <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/lamia-joreige\">Lamia Joreige</a> takes us on a filmed tour of Beirut, focusing on a canalised river that drains through the city in a valley of concrete. Joreige interviews residents and Syrian construction workers who came here to escape Isis. The camera travels the dried-up concrete bed and the accumulated rubbish. In her installation at the National Museum of Wales, Joreige also covers one wall with a list of hundreds of objects missing from the National Museum of Beirut, lost, looted or destroyed. The huge graphic display allows one to grasp the scale of the losses \u2013 sarcophagi and sphinxes, Iron and Bronze Age busts and Phoenician antiquities, and a pharaoh\u2019s offering to the gods. They\u2019ve gone down the river, who knows where.<br></p> <p>John Akomfrah\u2019s film Auto da F\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/25/john-akomfrah-vertigo-sea-bristol-arnolfini-london-lisson-gallery-auto-de-fe-the-airport-tropikos\">which I reviewed</a> earlier this year, is one of a number of recent works by the artist that collapse space and time in their examinations of diaspora and escape. While Joreige\u2019s displaced Syrians bring present plights into sharp focus in a few words, Akomfrah\u2019s recent films, with their wooden, static and self-conscious costume tableaux, may be gorgeous to look at but promise more than they deliver. Hugely talented, he feels a bit stuck to me, and the work does not improve on second viewing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"64e88f281b0d5c7fc9c119159ab646fb7d97ff6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64e88f281b0d5c7fc9c119159ab646fb7d97ff6b/1127_0_2408_2667/903.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers\u2019 Seed Journey at Artes Mundi 7\" width=\"903\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers\u2019 Seed Journey at Artes Mundi 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>American artist <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/amy-franceschinifuturefarmers\">Amy Franceschini and Futurefarmers</a> undertake real, present journeys. Collecting grain used to make flatbread from numerous sources (from an archaeological dig in Norway, and seed saved during the siege of Leningrad), Franceschini and Futurefarmers have travelled from Oslo to Cardiff by sail, the first stage in a journey by sea back to the Middle East, where the cultivated grains originated. Along the way they make contact with bakers and farmers and make flatbread, documenting and retracing journeys that have been made for thousands of years. </p> <p>As an exhibition, all this is deadly boring, however worthy the idea. \u201cBy working collaboratively,\u201d we are told, Franceschini and Futurefarmers \u201cvisualise and understand the way systems interact and control our everyday lives and begin to question and deconstruct social systems such as food policies, public transportation and rural farming networks.\u201d Well, OK. Wooden boxes filled with seeds, displays of ears of grain, a little model boat and a banner hanging over the display like a primitive sail don\u2019t make for art that is interesting to look at. It is all a terribly dry way to make a point about what cultures share, and how they develop. This is social art at its most earnest and dull. There\u2019s not even any bread to share.<br></p> <p>The frustrations of looking at <a href=\"http://www.artesmundi.org/artists/neil-beloufa\">Ne\u00efl Beloufa</a>\u2019s work, however interesting or fun the ideas, also outweigh the positives. Getting Ukrainian teenagers to play a version of the board game Monopoly, trading on the country\u2019s assets, and displaying the film on a horizontal screen, and showing a film of another role-playing exercise, in which participants discuss the world\u2019s problems and find ever more extreme solutions, might be a fascinating exercise, but he makes it deliberately impossible to follow. The screen travels backwards and forwards on a length of track, and the videoed interactions are projected on to a surface that is covered with protuberances and hollows, as rough as a mountainside. It distorts everything, and makes looking at the imagery and reading the subtitles all but impossible. I guess this is a metaphor, or something.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9038f6f326e15c2d92df89457968920711104e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9038f6f326e15c2d92df89457968920711104e29/0_84_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ne\u00efl Beloufa\u2019s Monopoly at Artes Mundi 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ne\u00efl Beloufa\u2019s Monopoly at Artes Mundi 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Give me, instead, an ice-skater and a chiropodist, making love somewhere in a brand new city, built on the mountainsides of Cadair Idris in north Wales. Vast and dizzying towers climb the mountains, oblivious to the terrain. A cruise ship is docked on the lake in the hollow. Sunlight shafts in between glowering clouds. The day passes and lights come on in the tower blocks, the primordial night illuminated. Music soars. This is more like it. This brave new world is the vision of an architect so shy he wouldn\u2019t even sing in his own car. It is a city so new, wrote one critic, \u201cI have fillings in my teeth older than this.\u201d </p> <p>I know all this because Bedwyr Williams recounts the story as a voice-over to the huge projected image, a digitally enhanced version of the kind of matte paintings on glass that until recently provided the impossible backdrops and terrains in movies. Where painters like <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wilson-llyn-y-cau-cader-idris-n05596\">Richard Wilson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-landscape-with-cader-idris-d01873\">JMW Turner</a> amplified the magnificence of Cadair Idris in watercolour and oils, technology can do it bigger and better.</p> <p>Wind ruffles the lake, the weather comes and goes, sunlight smears a futuristic tower, a mast on the mountaintop winks in the looming dusk. Williams, telling the story of the city, ranges from the profound to the absurd. Tyrrau Mawr is the stand-out work of Artes Mundi. It is stirring and awful, tragic and hilarious. Pity the architect, killed by a jet of liquid concrete, in a building accident at the Spa and Wellness Centre. Filled with stories and alienated inhabitants, the city never sleeps.</p> <p>If German artist Hito Steyerl had not unavoidably pulled out of the exhibition at a late stage, the current Artes Mundi would feel a lot stronger. As it is, Williams really deserves to win, not because he is Welsh, but because his is the most consummately successful and engaging work here. It really stays with me. And, like Mosquito\u2019s work, it cuts through all that talk of the human condition and social worth. <br></p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.chapter.org/artesmundi7\">Chapter arts centre</a> and the <a href=\"https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/9102/Artes-Mundi-7/\">National Museum of Wales</a>, Cardiff, until 26 February 2017.</li> </ul>",

She had fled the Taliban as a child (in a heartbreaking scene, Sonita recalls her father and brother being held at gunpoint). She stayed in Iran with her sister and niece but, without papers, could not go to school. Instead, with characteristic pluck, Sonita bartered and begged her way to acquiring whatever skills and knowledge she could. \u201cShe found a woman volunteer in the mosque where she cleaned who helped her to read and write,\u201d Ghaem Maghami says. \u201cThey had no paper or ink \u2013 they would write on the wall or the windows with their fingers.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sonita-review-documentary-alizadeh-afghanistan-iran-music-arraged-marriage\">Sonita review \u2013 a refugee's dreams of superstardom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She took up karate but, without identity papers, could not gain her black belt. She excelled in photography but could only enter competitions under someone else\u2019s name. When Ghaem Maghami began filming, it was the discrimination Sonita faced that fascinated her: Afghans in Iran are often stereotyped as dirty, a danger to women, a threat to jobs. \u201cThey are living in a kind of segregation in Iran,\u201d she says. \u201cAfghan men, you only see working. Afghan women, you just don\u2019t see. Iranians don\u2019t know much about the reality of their life.\u201d </p> <p>Soon a more pressing issue took over: forced marriage. For Ghaem Maghami, it seemed a shocking practice. But for Sonita and the Afghan girls at the NGO that supported them, it was an everyday reality. In one scene, Sonita casually asks a recently engaged girl: \u201cDid you agree, or did they beat you?\u201d She is told: \u201cThey beat me up first.\u201d At other times, they discuss their \u201cbride price\u201d, something Sonita angrily says makes them sound \u201clike sheep\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was an issue all her friends faced,\u201d says Ghaem Maghami. \u201cShe knew it would happen to her. She just didn\u2019t know when.\u201d The answer comes 30 minutes in, when Sonita\u2019s brother tells her she must return to Afghanistan to be married so he can use the money to buy a wife himself. We see Sonita \u2013 and then her teacher at the NGO \u2013 begging her mother to forbid it, but to no avail. Yet Ghaem Maghami insists that blaming the family for being mercenary is too simplistic. \u201cSonita\u2019s mother is as loving as any other,\u201d she says. \u201cShe is in a bad situation. If you are struggling to survive, no one can say you care only about money.

Only 18% of Afghan women are literate, compared to 45% of men; in Iran, it\u2019s 82% and 91%. \u201cOne of the reasons girls get married early is that they don\u2019t have access to education. Families don\u2019t see any future for them. They didn\u2019t understand about Sonita\u2019s music \u2013 it was like a joke for them. They didn\u2019t understand her plan for life.\u201d</p> <p>There was only one way to free Sonita from a forced marriage: to pay up. But it wasn\u2019t the first time Ghaem Maghami had stepped in to the story. In an early scene, the young singer, along with her older sister and nine-year-old niece, are evicted from their home. The director helped them find somewhere else. It was interventions like this, she says, that created the trust between the pair, meaning Sonita finally opened up.</p> <p>But even just paying part of the bride price was a drastic move for the film-maker. \u201cIf you pay for every problem, you will never have a movie,\u201d she says, letting out a smoky laugh. \u201cThe crew blamed me because they said Sonita didn\u2019t seem worried. She could see in my eyes I would pay it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Off-camera, in events that weren\u2019t included in the film, things became even more dramatic. Sonita\u2019s brother-in-law was a brutally violent drug addict. When he was released from prison he tried to sell Sonita\u2019s niece into marriage. The police answer was to suggest deporting the whole family. Once more, the film-maker offered an escape, sheltering the little girl until her mother could move them away. Sonita, who had always protected her niece, moved in too, but did not escape unscathed. \u201cHe saw Sonita in the street and tried to kill her,\u201d Ghaem Maghami says. \u201cHe tried to burn her and, once, tried to hit her with a brick.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xIJ9Ch-rKU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-xIJ9Ch-rKU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xIJ9Ch-rKU\">Watch the trailer for Sonita</a>. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>After helping Sonita make a music video called Brides for Sale, the director made sure her activist friends shared it widely. It went viral and the young singer was offered a high school scholarship in the US. But first she needed a visa, meaning she had to return to Afghanistan. If she failed, she could not return to Iran. The pair also decided not to tell Sonita\u2019s family about their plans. \u201cI was very worried,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know what else we could do. We were on a highway with no exit. There was no turning round. All we could do was drive as fast as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The gamble paid off. Sonita, says Ghaem Maghami , is happy in her new life, while her family couldn\u2019t be prouder. \u201cThey can see she is successful and respected,\u201d says the director, who hopes her film will change attitudes to refugees worldwide. \u201cThey can see she has a future.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/sonita-review-documentary-alizadeh-afghanistan-iran-music-arraged-marriage\">Sonita</a> is out now in the UK.</p>",

When&#xa0;will Theresa May listen?</a>, theguardian.com, 20 October) made me think that there might be a route back to power for Labour, if it became the party for the 48% who wish to remain in the EU, and for the many more who are coming to that view as the consequences of leaving become apparent.</p> <p>A decision to challenge the referendum result would need to be accompanied by policies to help those who have been left behind by globalisation, many of whom voted Brexit because they had so little to lose. This is partly about investing in a more balanced distribution of economic growth, but also requires unapologetic support for redistribution, focusing on the need to address an unprecedented increase in inequality, and the real hardship faced by those left behind.</p> <p>With the Tory government set on inflicting enormous and irreversible damage to our economy, our society, and our union, there is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Labour to be the party of the sane alternative, attracting voters who would not perhaps normally vote Labour. Who knows, with a bit of compromise, it might even be possible to forge a united Labour opposition around that position. It is perhaps the only issue where there is a real possibility of attracting enough new Labour voters to evict the Conservatives.<br><strong>Mick Foster</strong><br><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee refers to the four freedoms. Why only four freedoms? Why is each beneficial to commercial enterprises but not necessarily to the wider community? (The welfare of megacorporations is not synonymous with social welfare.) Why are there only freedoms to, not freedom from? Why freedom to extend the iron grip of economic reductionism, not freedom from phenomena like job insecurity and freedom from fear of losing the continuity of community? What\u2019s wrong with economics as though people matter?</p> <p>The compression of human rights into four freedoms leads to a conflation of human rights with the neoliberal agenda. This is naive and dangerous. Let\u2019s change the terms of the debate in Europe, not just chunter on as though \u201cfour freedoms\u201d is an unquestionable assertion of fundamental moral principle. Time to reframe, surely.<br><strong>Tony Brauer</strong><br><em>Jordans, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Before we teeter off the \u201chard Brexit\u201d cliff edge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/italian-job-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">Real life has turned into a remake of The Italian Job</a>, 20 October), it is surely worth considering the scope for a \u201cthird way\u201d between the current free movement of labour policies followed within the EU and Theresa May\u2019s preference for managed migration.</p> <p>One such option would involve an open work-and-study-permit arrangement that allowed free movement between the EU and the UK for students, and for any EU citizen with a firm offer of employment in the UK (and vice versa). This would prevent (or discourage) speculative migration, where people move from one country to another and then search for work on arrival. While it would therefore be likely to reduce flows of unskilled workers, it would not prevent employers from recruiting abroad for hard-to-fill jobs, in agriculture, or in the care and hospitality sectors.</p> <p>Such an arrangement could be characterised as demand-led free movement and, as such, could be acceptable to our negotiating partners. It would not give the government the control it currently appears to seek in respect of the total volume of inward migration. But by restricting the supply of unskilled or entry-level labour, it would address a major concern expressed during the referendum debate on the effect of EU free movement on wages for the lower-paid. Perhaps the basis for the type of sensible compromise that will need to be made by both parties to ensure not a hard or soft Brexit, but a good Brexit.<br><strong>Ian Jones</strong><br><em>Fownhope, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a remain voter in the EU referendum, I note with some disdain the way in which the EU leaders have dealt with Theresa May in recent days. Rather than treating her with dignity and magnanimity as a leader who is trying to do the best with the hand she has been given by the British people, she was treated like a petulant child who had misbehaved and now had to suffer (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/21/theresa-may-eu-council-summit-brexit-russia-\" title=\"\">Sketch</a>, 22 October). This and the collapsed trade deal with the Canadians (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">Frustration as Canada\u2019s EU trade deal is blocked by Belgian region</a>, 22 October) clearly reflects how weak the EU really is, and how impossible it will be for the UK to negotiate a trade deal with it. We should be under no illusions that they will negotiate on free movement or allow us not to pay into the EU\u2019s central budget in order for us to continue to play a part in it. Britain, as a clever and able country, will indeed survive and no doubt thrive with trade tariffs if this is the price it has to pay for its vote on sovereignty and self-determination on immigration.<br><strong>Robert Bradlow</strong><br><em>Reigate, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is with a great sense of trepidation I read that the chancellor, Philip Hammond \u2013 supposedly in favour of a softer Brexit \u2013 was \u201chopeful a deal was possible that allowed all European nationals to remain in the UK and UK nationals to stay in EU countries\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/19/philip-hammond-attempts-to-ease-concerns-over-hard-brexit\" title=\"\">Hammond seeks to allay fears over Brexit</a>, 20 October).</p> <p>I find it difficult to understand the statement as anything but \u201chard\u201d, as someone who has lived in London for almost 40 years \u2013 during which time I have been working and paying taxes.

If I could choose I would go for Nico, but it\u2019s only on pure probability.</p> <p>\u201c He\u2019s in a difficult position. He needs to look at each weekend at a time, how he does. But he needs to make sure he does not DNF, which is the most important. You could probably see it in turn one [on Sunday]. Whether that played a role, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t spoken to him yet. Red Bull are doing a good job, they have closed up to us.\u201d</p> <p>Wolff added: \u201cIt keeps changing. Nico was very strong in Singapore, Lewis was very strong in Malaysia, Nico very strong in Suzuka, and Lewis very strong in Austin. It keeps bouncing between the two, so I\u2019m very curious as to how it\u2019s going to go.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton was magnificent in Austin over the weekend, winning pole, getting off to a fine start and then surging through to take his 50th career victory, though in the end it was a very controlled drive, in which he performed well within the car\u2019s and his own capabilities. In truth, it wasn\u2019t much of a race.</p> <p>For Hamilton, America provided a huge turnaround after difficult times in Malaysia and Japan. Wolff said: \u201cSuzuka was very different. We had just come out of Malaysia where he had lost the win \u2013 25 points gone \u2013 he would have made up that gap in the championship and then it started with the press conference and it went into a spiral. He had 10 days to recover and he has come back strong. He has let off steam.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton disagreed with Wolff that events in Malaysia had carried into Japan. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that is the case. It\u2019s just a different weekend. If we had come off a win in Malaysia, I would have been on cloud nine going into the next race. But I love being in Japan and I felt fantastic. I was only off by 0.07sec in qualifying and then the race was a disaster.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve battled through thick and thin through my whole career. I don\u2019t have the championship and 50 wins through luck. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and dedication, from lots of other people but also from me. Keeping my cool, doing my work. I feel great about the work we did collectively this weekend and I\u2019ll continue to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the final three races he added: \u201cI have got to keep my head down and keep trying to do the job I did this weekend, which I seriously believe I can do.\u201d</p>",

He had been in the camp for several months and had tried five times to stow away on lorries, but people smugglers asked for \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000 to open the doors of trucks and he found it impossible. His family back home in Syria was surrounded by four fronts: Kurdish fighters, Syrian rebel fighters, Islamic State and soldiers of the Syrian regime. \u201cIt has been difficult and I want to get to England,\u201d he said. He had several cousins in London, some worked in hairdressing, one worked in a supermarket, another in tiling.</p> <p>In the dead of night, a group of Syrians he knew in the camp had left with their few possessions, intending to sleep rough in the Calais area and continue trying to get across to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, keen to keep trying for Britain but exasperated at how hard it was. \u201cSometimes I feel that either I\u2019ll get to Britain someday or I\u2019ll end up having to go back to Syria.\u201d</p>",

His comments are the most detailed he has made on the likely course of negotiations since the Brexit vote on 23 June.</p> <p>Although the government\u2019s negotiating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/brexit-strategy-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-direct-line-david-davis-theresa-may\">strategy has not been agreed</a>, he said it was clear that the UK was heading for the \u201charder end of a Brexit\u201d, due to the primacy being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/restricting-immigration-will-be-at-heart-of-brexit-deal-theresa-may-says\">given to UK border controls</a> and parliamentary sovereignty.</p> <p>Speaking at the Institute for Government, Fraser said it was inevitable that negotiations over Britain\u2019s future political and economic relationship with the EU, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\">access to the single market</a> and security and foreign policy considerations, would take longer than two years. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis will inevitably mean some sort of interim relationship between leaving and establishing the long-term, permanent relationship,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said parliament would seek to be involved in any decision. \u201cIt does seem to me that government does have a responsibility to make sure that parliament is properly informed about what is happening,\u201d Fraser said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got to have a democratic process around this \u2026 I do not understand how we could go though a multi-year negotiation of at least two years to determine the terms on how we leave the EU, and then do that without at least some sort of parliamentary vote on that.\u201d </p> <p>Fraser also supported to parliament\u2019s right to be involved, saying a vote was going to be required at the most basic level. \u201cIf you were in a commercial organisation, you would never commit yourself now to accepting the terms of a negotiation on a deal that is going to be finished in two years\u2019 time.\u201d </p> <p>He said he did not expect the EU to give an early signal on whether it would give the UK an interim agreement, since this would represent a concession. But an unfavourable rupture was not in either side\u2019s economic interest, Fraser said.</p> <p>\u201cI am not a catastrophist, but let us be clear: this is going to be an incredibly difficult, tough and complex negotiation. One of the objectives of the EU side is to make it absolutely clear to anyone else thinking of leaving the EU that this is not a good idea.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, it must be absolutely clear that leaving the EU there has to be a price tag attached to that, and we are going to have accept that in terms of our economic position in relationship to the single market and in terms of our political relationship.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have less automatic involvement in the future. That is inevitable.\u201d </p> <p>If the UK did fail to reach an agreement on its separation terms, further negotiations on a trading relationship with the single market would be significantly harder, Fraser said. </p> <p>He said if the UK was not able to strike such a deal, and instead chose an arrangement based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/liam-fox-looks-to-wto-in-hint-at-hard-brexit-stance\">the World Trade Organisation relationship</a> with the EU, \u201cthat would be very worrying for the UK economy\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe would lose the automatic tariff-free access to the EU single market, and inward investment in the UK could be affected. A lot of investment in the UK was done with the specific objective of gaining access to the European market \u2013 that was clearly the understanding,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we go to less favourable terms of trade, then the context of business investment is changed. Personally, I think it is a scenario we should seek to avoid.\u201d </p> <p>His assumption was that the government would negotiate \u201csome sort of continuation of our current access to the single market, rather than the negotiation of a completely new agreement and arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Fraser said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">the government\u2019s \u201cgreat repeal bill\u201d</a>, which is due to be introduced by ministers when article 50 is triggered, provided a potential structure for an interim agreement, since it would translate EU law into UK law, \u201cgiving us the legal basis to continue that existing relationship on the basis of the content of existing law\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>It was a walk past a frozen lake 10 years ago that got Ian Tansley thinking differently about global health. The Welsh inventor had spent decades travelling and developing solar technologies throughout Africa and Asia. Yet one puzzle he was keen to crack \u2013 how to deliver vaccines on a wide-scale basis to the poorest, most remote communities \u2013 had so far eluded him.</p> <p>Vaccines are notoriously hard to deliver safely, requiring refrigeration at certain temperatures, which means having access to a constant power supply. Yet hot climates, intermittent availability of electricity, supply shortages and unreliable storage facilities mean that one in five children \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/immunization/\">more than 19m worldwide</a> \u2013 do not get even the most basic immunisations to keep them healthy.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2016/oct/24/how-sri-lanka-bit-back-mosquitoes-wiped-out-malaria-podcast\">How Sri Lanka bit back at mosquitoes and wiped out malaria \u2013\u00a0podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using the frozen lake as his inspiration, with its frozen top but liquid bottom, Tansley developed a refrigeration system, <a href=\"http://www.surechill.com/how-it-works/\">Sure Chill</a>, that harnesses water\u2019s unique properties to keep vaccines cool at 4C \u2013 yet doesn\u2019t require a constant power supply. The refrigeration compartment is surrounded by water, and relies on the fact that the liquid is at its heaviest at 4C, when it sinks. When the device has power, the water cools and forms ice above the compartment, leaving only water at 4C cooling the contents. When the power is switched off, the water warms and rises while the ice begins to melt, and water at 4C remains below to keep the vaccines chilled.</p> <p>Sure Chill \u2013 which was awarded a $1.5m (\u00a31.2m) Grand Challenges grant from the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and is now used to deliver vaccines in 38 countries \u2013 has proved a major breakthrough in global health. Tansley\u2019s immunisations cold-box can keep vaccines cool for up to 35 days in even 43C weather. And the technology is entirely scaleable, from a cool box up to a warehouse. </p> <p>Naming it one of the top four innovations saving children\u2019s lives, the Gates Foundation\u2019s director of vaccine delivery, Dr Orin Levine, calls Sure Chill <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/29/health/levine-world-immunization-week-innovations/index.html\">\u201can important tool in humanitarian response efforts\u201d</a> and says it demonstrates, for the first time in decades, a global health issue \u201cbenefiting from significant innovation\u201d.</p> <p>Innovation is the theme of this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://grandchallenges.org/\">Grand Challenges global conference</a>, taking place in London this week.

The waste is collected and converted into fertiliser and biogas, which is then used for cooking and electricity.</p> <p>The toilets are particularly essential in regions where waterborne diseases are prevalent, or where shared \u2013 or a complete lack of \u2013 toilets prevent women and girls from going to the bathroom, says Gardiner.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are going from having pit latrines at home to our toilets in their homes, which means they\u2019re not being exposed to eco-pathogens in their everyday lives any more,\u201d says Gardiner. \u201cThe current model can support 2,000 people \u2013 in urban or rural settings \u2013 and is important in showing that in this global sanitation crisis, there is technology out there than can convert waste into energy.\u201d</p> <p>Both Gardiner\u2019s and Tansley\u2019s systems get to the heart of what the Grand Challenges are about \u2013 improving the lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable.

It said there were 49 unaccompanied children aged 13 and under at the camp eligible to come to the UK. <br></p> <p>Unaccompanied minors are believed to be the only group staying in Calais, where they will be taken to containers within a secure area of the camp previously used to house adults.

  "<p>How political are your pubes? It\u2019s not a question most of us spend much time worrying about, yet when you\u2019re a woman, how you choose to cultivate your lady garden sprouts up as a topic with tedious regularity. In its latest incarnation, the arbiters at <a href=\"http://www.tatler.com/beauty/too-posh-for-bush-beauty-waxing-review-bikini-wax\">Tatler magazine have declared the \u201cfreedom bush\u201d back in fashion</a> (those who sneer at the notion of the pudenda being subject to changing aesthetic trends would do well to remember that dark mid-noughties period: the \u201cvajazzle years\u201d). If even the conservative, conventional Sloane is cultivating a full bush then, it\u2019s worth noting, that could indeed hint at a seismic shift in societal norms regarding pubic grooming. But equally, after years and years of the same \u201cdebate\u201d, is it not time that feminist coverage in the media was directed elsewhere? In other words, magazine editors, enough already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/year-of-the-bush-female-body-hair-cameron-diaz-pubic\">It's the year of the bush \u2013 time to rediscover all female body hair | Emer O'Toole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are just emerging from a period that has seen a new generation embrace feminism in a way that the capitalist post-feminists of the 1990s could scarcely have imagined. Much of this has been powerful and positive: the conversation about the importance of sexual consent, for instance, and how it operates within a culture that continues to trivialise rape, has never been louder and more energetic. The fightback against street harassment has been equally inspirational. But at the same time a strand of feminism in the media has spent the last few years concerning itself with issues that many would dismiss as trivial, including pubes, and footwear, and 50 Shades of Grey, not to mention that perennial question that birthed a million op-eds: is Beyonc\u00e9 a feminist or not?</p> <p>As a writer, I have been guilty of entering into some of these debates. With an internet media run on opinion, feminist polemic can feel like one of the few journalistic avenues open to the young, aspiring woman writer (critiquing media sexism is how I began my own career, and I am grateful to it, but I have said my piece on women\u2019s magazines). For a long while, talking about the more trivial aspects of the feminist debate \u2013 as opposed to, for instance, boring old domestic violence \u2013 was the only way to get feminism covered in the mainstream media.</p> <p>But as time has gone on, the focus on the fluffy \u2013 so often to the point where it appears to be given equal billing to more urgent and distressing issues affecting women \u2013 has irked me, and other feminists writers, more and more. Perhaps it is because I have been in this game for a while now, and have thus seen the same topics recycled several times over with very little new being said (my friend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/emer-o-toole\">colleague Emer O\u2019Toole</a> wrote the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/19/year-of-the-bush-female-body-hair-cameron-diaz-pubic\">definitive piece on female body hair</a> several years ago \u2013 what could be left to say about it?). Or perhaps it is because I have grown up a tad in the past five years. But more than either of those two things, I would reason that this is a time when the need for feminism is making itself acutely obvious in all manner of ways. There is so very little to laugh about, to the point where even the notion of a \u201cfreedom foof\u201d fails to raise a smile.</p> <p>Donald Trump, a man with so much obvious contempt for women that it feels almost unbelievable \u2013 like watching a fictional dystopia play out on our TV screens \u2013 is running for president. Analysis has shown that, if women were excluded and only US men were eligible to vote, Trump would win the election. It is abundantly clear that there are millions of people who would rather have a fascist than a female as leader. We are told that women can achieve anything in this day and age \u2013 \u201cso what are you whining about?\u201d being the inevitable subtext. \u201cLook at Hillary,\u201d we are told, to which the inevitable rebuttal is: \u201cYes, look at Hillary. Look at what she is up against.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"614ab9187e1f0812d59414376c856f1cf85ccfa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/614ab9187e1f0812d59414376c856f1cf85ccfa8/0_312_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women's refuge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domestic violence shelters are closing due to funding cuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are other concerns, of course. The way the previous sexual behaviour of the complainant in the Ched Evans case was pored over during his successful appeal and in court this month has caused widespread dismay. <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-05-11/debates/16051141000001/DomesticViolenceRefuges\">Then there\u2019s the closure of domestic violence shelters</a> \u2013 17% have closed due to funding cuts, 32 of which were specialist services for black and ethnic minority women, and 48% of 167 domestic violence services in England said they were running services without any funding. Two women a week are murdered by their partners or ex-partners, and vulnerable women such as female asylum seekers continue to be abused. There were 99 pregnant women held in Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre last year. <a href=\"http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/three-serco-officers-in-the-dock-over-alleged-rape-and-sexual-activity-with-female-detainee/story-29818634-detail/story.html\">Three Serco workers are currently in court over the alleged rape of a Yarl\u2019s Wood detainee</a>.

I returned home depressed and tearful. Faced with these sobering facts, is it any wonder, really, that so many people seek refuge in arguing instead about bikini waxes?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been to enough schools to talk to young women about feminism to know that feminist \u201cfluff\u201d can be an easy way to open a discussion \u2013 a \u201cgateway drug\u201d if you will, for those unfamiliar with the topic, or put off or intimidated by the stereotypes surrounding it. It\u2019s important that teenage girls particularly question why it is they feel pressured into certain sexual behaviours. That issue does not go away once you declare that the \u201cfull bush\u201d is back. The impact of pornography on the way young people conduct relationships goes way beyond a few wax strips, taking in issues of consent, coercion and abuse, objectification, grooming and revenge porn. It\u2019s all cheerful stuff.</p> <p>The personal is political, the feminists of the 1970s told us, and this has morphed into a strange kind of choice feminism where women are encouraged to examine their clothing, their footwear, their grooming, their behaviour, every little choice that they make, in order to assess whether it matches up. But the big picture is now so alarmingly vivid that it obscures these trivial questions. Freedom is never so easy to imagine as when it might be taken away. Most women know that our bushes have very little to do with it.</p>",

So I queued up by the Apple Store on Tottenham Court Road to get one of the first generation models. <br></p> <p> Ironically, I was underwhelmed, I only owned about 12 CDs. Also, it turned out I needed to use a friend\u2019s computer just to load it as the interface wasn\u2019t compatible with my old Mac.

I managed to persuade my parents to buy one for my Christmas present. I got back to uni and was walking around the library getting asked what the white headphones were - now a common sight but not back in the day! <br></p> <p> When colleagues who are maybe 8-10 years younger than me see my iPod they crowd around the \u2018antique\u2019, which is black and white, has no touch screen or click wheel - it\u2019s quite funny how times change! <br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, 33-year-old working for a cancer charity, London <br></em></p> <h2>\u2018The culmination of months of anticipation was typing out \u2018Michael Jackson\u2019 and \u2018Agoraphobic Nosebleed\u2019 again and again\u2019</h2> <p>In my third year at uni, I finally managed to convince my parents that a computer would be beneficial to my prospects. We were a low income household and had never had a PC at home, so illustrating the benefit of concepts such as online communities, and downloadable reading material, required all my powers of persuasion.<br></p> <p>As soon as we hooked the (huge) desktop tower and (tiny) monitor up in my student bedroom, I realised that, technically if I had any money, I could now get an iPod. And so, a few months and a bunch of overtime shifts later (kids: always remember to reduce non study commitments in your third year, ahem) I walked out of Currys with a 32GB iPod, sweet.<br></p> <p>I spent that entire Saturday afternoon ripping part of my CD collection and manually typing in album and artist details into iTunes. Looking back this seems like a crazy, menial way to spend time, but for a kid who until recently had never had personal access to the internet, this felt like the most awesome, futuristic admin work possible. The culmination of months of anticipation was typing out \u2018Michael Jackson\u2019 and \u2018Agoraphobic Nosebleed\u2019 again and again and I was loving it.<br></p> <p>That night we got burgled. Obviously.<br></p> <p>I was so dismayed at losing the iPod, my slab of handtyped metadata and low bit-rate audio files, that we had to call the police back later in the day when I calmed down and noticed the burglars had taken my passport too. Everything was eventually replaced through home contents insurance, and I had many years of joy from my replacement iPod.<br></p> <p>That one was eventually replaced by an iPod classic with greater storage capacity, which is still in use today.

In an interview with la Voix du Nord, he said: \u201cChallenging Le Touquet agreements by moving the border to the English coast would reopen the border we closed in Calais, and so give a strong signal to smugglers and migrants to return en masse there. It would start again from scratch.\u201d</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, argued: \u201cIf the border is moved to the other side of the Channel, as some suggest, we\u2019ll have to put out boats to rescue people who will be in the water.\u201d</p> <p>Cazeneuve insists that unlike 2003, when the Sangatte camp was destroyed in a short-term operation, a comprehensive strategy is in place. This includes dispersal of refugees to regional camps, securing the tunnel, a crackdown on 33 illegal immigration routes and the maintenance of a stronger police presence on the French coast.</p> <p>But if this does not work, the call for more drastic action will grow ever louder during the presidential campaign.</p>",

Her socioeconomic rhetoric chimes well but is undeliverable. Her anti-immigrant priority panders to right wing extremism and undermines the economic and social stability of the country.</p> <p>It was a stupid error to encourage grammar schools, a policy which will unravel. NHS is heading for the abyss, yet she supports Hunt\u2019s destruction of its basic principles. She is being rapidly weakened by the fissures in the government and is out of her depth. <br></p> <p>To place immigration policy above the economic wellbeing of the country will lead to catastrophe. She has bought into the fantasy that the rest of the EU and the wider world think we are as special as rightwingers do. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Government arrogance and self-delusion is increasing the likelihood of the most damaging Brexit. Unfortunately we are already a basket case owing to longstanding extreme neoliberal policies.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Brian Dobson, Blackburn</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Will the reality be an extreme, isolationist Britain?\u2019<br></h2> <p>As a leader, she appears to have united the Tories. However, a leader can be judged on the people they surround themselves by and her cabinet appointments (aside from Philip Hammond) appear to be extreme. <br></p> <p>Her actions in these appointments, and the policies they have since laid out, are inconsistent with the messages she gave on assuming the role. It will be interesting to see whether we get May\u2019s Britain as outlined in her words on entering Downing Street, or whether the reality will be an extreme, isolationist Britain as outlined in her government\u2019s actions so far. <br></p> <p><strong>Tim Perkins, Berkhamsted</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Hard Brexit will leave us isolated and alone\u2019<br></h2> <p>May is nothing new. Like all Tory leaders, they stand up after an election or at conference and perform to the gallery pledging to serve all people of the classes, but as the people go about their lives, they introduce policies that undermine the life chances and aspirations of those people. <br></p> <p>Social division: grammar schools. Life chances: NHS chronically underfunded in crisis again. Dignity in old age: social care in crisis. Aspiration for young people: huge debt, no prospect of owning a house. Workers: zero hours contracts. The same old policies. Thatcherism in many new guises. </p> <p>Hard Brexit will leave us isolated and alone and economically vulnerable. If we are not in a single market this will have a dire consequences for the City. She is gambling with the financial future of this country.</p> <p><strong>Nick Smith, Kent</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I forgot what an authoritarian home secretary she was\u2019<br></h2> <p>Like a lot of people, I was reasonably positive about May as PM \u2013 but I think now that was just relief that she was clearly \u201cnone of the above\u201d as the Leadsom/Gove/Johnson options were so terrible. Like many, I forgot what an authoritarian home secretary she had been, how lukewarm her remain credentials were and how she\u2019d been very keen to remove us from the European court of justice.</p> <p>I had hoped her cabinet selections was a tactical masterstroke where she\u2019d have someone to blame when Brexit goes pearshaped \u2013 perhaps when it became apparent that there was no plan, no consensus and no clue. It feels like we\u2019ve been there for ages already.</p> <p>Instead, May\u2019s Brexit approach has been terrifying. She\u2019s put her trust, and our country\u2019s future, in the hands of Johnson, Davis and Fox. I fear for the union and what will happen in Northern Ireland. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>Anonymous, London<br></strong></p> <h2>\u2018May trots out press lines that defy reality\u2019<br></h2> <p>May is cautious and courts popular sentiment. She trots out soundbites that she thinks will appeal to her party\u2019s core supporters and what she sees as the disenfranchised working classes, but she has no policy ideas whatsoever. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Far from demonstrating leadership, she avoids making decisions on any areas of policy, prevaricating on everything from her negotiating position with the EU to airport expansion. Her decision to support Hunt as health secretary shows that despite protestations to the contrary, she has little respect for the NHS and is likely to preside over its rapid decline.</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t handled anything to do with Brexit. There is no discernible strategy, the three Brexiters are allowed to run amok discrediting UK politics in the process, while May continues to trot out press lines that defy reality, such as maintaining access to the single market while controlling EU immigration. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Her conduct seems to reflect that displayed during the EU referendum campaign \u2013 keep your head down, wait for the dust to settle and see what happens.

But the approach of former Molenbeek mayor Philippe Moureaux, who presided over the district for 18 years until 2012, was <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/attack-on-paris-molenbeek-dirty-dozen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">laissez-faire, to say the least</a>.</p> <p> The European Institute of Peace conducted a survey this year in Molenbeek, which is home to a large Muslim community of predominantly Moroccan origin, and presented the findings to the current mayor, Fran\u00e7oise Schepmans, in September. Researchers interviewed more than 400 residents and found their main concerns to be a lack of jobs, poor levels of education, drug dealing and crumbling infrastructure. There is a growing rift between generations, as young people retaliate against the lack of opportunities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecaa3a79be2a167a82cbbbbb87f7011d7417f41e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecaa3a79be2a167a82cbbbbb87f7011d7417f41e/0_146_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young people training in Brussels Boxing Academy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many boxing students turn to their trainers when they\u2019re in trouble.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Dheedene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of Brussels but it\u2019s quite separate,\u201d says Flachett. Segregation is something that preoccupies Flachett. A lot of sports clubs fail to recognise that certain practices \u2013 like the prevalence of alcohol, or nudity in changing rooms \u2013 can put off Muslims, while other clubs are made up of \u201cexclusively 14- to 18-year-old Moroccan guys\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIn Brussels, that\u2019s one of the things that is missing \u2013 the possibility to meet, to have contact with other people, with other religions, other origins, other languages, even girls with boys.\u201d</p> <p>Mixing young people from different backgrounds, Flachett believes, is a vital part of his job. \u201cIf you have young people who are completely excluded from society, it\u2019s very easy to radicalise them,\u201d he says.<br></p> <h2>Using sport to prevent ghettoisation</h2> <p>Inclusion is also a method used in Mechelen, a small city just north of Brussels that has been praised for its integration policies. About a fifth of its population is Muslim, but no-one has left for Syria. Its mayor, Bart Somers, <a href=\"http://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/interviews/bart-somers-cities-and-local-authorities-best-placed-tackle-forces\" rel=\"nofollow\">encourages mixed sports clubs</a> to prevent ghettoisation. Young members of one of the city\u2019s football clubs have their report cards checked every month: if their marks aren\u2019t good enough, they get a two-week ban from playing.</p> <p>Schepmans has also been building links with sports clubs in her district. She recently announced that Molenbeek\u2019s football club would be inviting young refugees from nearby asylum seeker reception centres to play with local teams a few times a week. It\u2019s a model borrowed from Kraainem, a district east of Brussels that has been welcoming groups of five to 10 unaccompanied minors to play football, learn French and have a meal at its stadium since September 2015.</p> <p>Kraainem is already very multicultural, the home team has 350 players from 42 different countries, so welcoming refugees is just the next step. The football club president Laurent Thieule explained that, on the pitch, wearing the same kit, the footballers are already integrated. \u201cFootball is a universal and easy language,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put all these kids on a pitch and with 10 words they can communicate and they can play - with two legs and 10 words.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d4195443e4508798173520a10b5fb781bc8b6bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4195443e4508798173520a10b5fb781bc8b6bb/14_0_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees learning French.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraainem, a district east of Brussels has been welcoming young refugees to play football, learn French and have a meal at its stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamsin Rutter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He invited me to watch a game, where I spoke to 16-year-old Nerion, who had been in Belgium about 10 days and was staying at the Woluwe Saint-Pierre reception centre. He left Albania because of family issues, and to escape a future of drugs and limited opportunities, and he said he wants to stay in Belgium for the rest of his life.</p> <p>I asked him if he thinks he\u2019ll be able to make friends playing football. \u201cOf course,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause you are not alone. It\u2019s a sport you play with a team.\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin Renauld, a player in Kraainem\u2019s first team who is also a volunteer coordinator the refugee initiative, says it is important for kids in the local community to meet refugees, and see them as real people. \u201cWhen we started last year, it was really during the migration crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were many negative reactions, and we can make a positive story out of it.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Tackling radicalism </h2> <p>Back in Molenbeek, Flachett says it\u2019s identity that young people struggle with. They come to the gym with all sorts of questions, about where their parents come from, what they should be doing with their lives and what religion means to them. Flachett tries to get them thinking about their place in society in a positive way. Sometimes that means organising activities with local museums, theatre companies or even the police. Sometimes the trainers take groups of disaffected youngsters out of Brussels altogether, on walking trips to the Pyrenees, for example.</p> <p>But radicalism is a problem that has been thrust upon the boxing club, and it doesn\u2019t receive much funding to deal with it. Flachett and his colleagues study the subject in their own time. He has applied for funding to hire a trained social worker at the club, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll get it. The Brussels authorities, he thinks, prefer to invest in extra police and security cameras. Some <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-dozens-under-surveillance-in-molenbeek/\" rel=\"nofollow\">5,000 searches of homes and mosques</a> have been conducted in the past six months.</p> <p> Flachett\u2019s work took on more poignancy when a former student who had struggled to find work in Brussels was found dead in Syria. \u201cHe was really a nice guy,\u201d says Flachett. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t explain it. The only thing that I know, he was really trying to do his best to be somebody in society.\u201d</p> <p>He shows me a picture of another of his former students, Ahmed Dahmani, who grew up in Molenbeek. In 2010, Dahmani had his boxing licence taken off him after he was caught smoking cannabis, and he stopped coming to the gym. In 2015, he was <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3328350/Turkish-police-arrest-Belgian-man-Moroccan-descent-allegations-scouted-Paris-terror-attack-sites.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">arrested in Turkey</a>on suspicion of helping to orchestrate the Paris attacks. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only the licence they took -\u2013 they took his life. Boxing was his way to be somebody,\u201d says Flachett. \u201cAnd then, five years later, you hear something like that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",
  "<p></p> <p><strong>Where are they going?<br></strong>Sixty buses will move the refugees and migrants to 164 reception centres across France. The accommodation centres, which are intended to be temporary, will each hold 40 to 50 people for up to four months while their asylum cases are examined. Those who do not claim asylum will be sent back to their country of origin. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed in the camp have said they do not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third say they will continue to try to get to the UK, according to the <a href=\"http://refugeerights.org.uk/\">Refugee Rights Data Project</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/24/calais-camp-riot-police-prepare-demolish-refugees-migrant\">Calais refugee camp: first buses leave as police prepare for demolition \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How many people live at the camp?</strong><br>The authorities say 7,000 people live here but charities put the number closer to 10,000. The French president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, appeared to acknowledge that the official figure was an underestimate when he said last month that as many as 9,000 people could be moved from the camp to the reception centres.</p> <p><strong>How will the camp be demolished?</strong><br>It is understood that 40 people will arrive on Tuesday to begin dismantling the camp. An additional 3,000 police are expected in and around Calais this week to assist with the process of clearing the camp and to attempt to ensure that migrants who do not want to claim asylum do not flee and/or set up new, smaller camps. With the eyes of the world on Calais, police are expected to try a soft approach, at least to begin with. There are fears that anarchists will stoke the atmosphere if French police are deemed to be heavy-handed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/calais_camps_map/giv-14064m7PauCmEyR6/\" data-alt=\"Calais refugee camp map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/calais_camps_map/giv-14064m7PauCmEyR6/\">Calais refugee camp map</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong><br>France\u2019s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, says the intention is to \u201cunblock Calais\u201d, which is said to have suffered serious economic security consequences as a result of the camp and the daily attempts by migrants to smuggle themselves on to lorries bound for Britain, sometimes leading to violent attacks on drivers. Politics has played a big part with the French right and far right increasing their calls for hardline action before next year\u2019s presidential election. Alain Jupp\u00e9, the current favourite to become the next president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/alain-juppe-france-managing-migrants-uk-calais-kent-border\">has said France must push back its border</a> with Britain from Calais to the Kent coast.</p> <p>The French government has also been under pressure to act to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the camp, where there is overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages as well as trafficking and exploitation of women and children. Hollande has said that conditions are not acceptable, especially for people fleeing war.</p> <p><strong>What will happen to unaccompanied children?</strong><br>There is supposed to be a separate queue for the estimated 1,300 unaccompanied children in the camp at the warehouse that will act as a processing centre. About 500 are believed to be eligible to come to Britain under the amendment, brought about by the Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Alf Dubs</a>, himself a former child refugee. But campaigners fear that vulnerable minors could be lost in the chaos of the evacuation. Charity workers have expressed concern that children could be caught up in violence or left vulnerable to people traffickers.</p> <p><strong>Have the French previously tried to clear the camp?</strong><br>In February and March, the authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/french-authorities-begin-clearance-of-part-of-calais-jungle-camp\">demolished a large area of the southern part of the camp</a>, saying the aim was to radically reduce numbers of migrants. Police fired teargas at migrants who threw stones and set fire to shelters after dozens of makeshift shacks were dismantled. Despite the move, the number of people in the camp subsequently reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, exacerbating the overcrowding problem as an increased number of inhabitants were squeezed into an area of land less than half the size it previously was.</p>",

  "<p>Craig Baxam was lost. He thought he was in a town in northern Kenya called Marareme, though really he didn\u2019t have a clue. He then got on a bus headed to Garissa, towards the Somali border, but was puzzled by the way the other passengers referred to it as \u201cArara\u201d.<br></p> <p>Baxam was far from home, spoke no local language and knew little about the region he was traveling through. If he were successful in reaching southern Somalia, his destination, things would almost certainly get worse for him: the war-torn country, where he planned to live according to his faith, remains one of the most inhospitable and perilous on Earth. </p> <p>Yet none of that flustered him. All he wanted was to keep on moving towards the border. Find it, cross it and begin a new, better, devout life.</p> <p>Baxam, 24 at the time, had thrown to the winds his comfortable existence in Laurel, Maryland, where he worked for a TV services company. In December 2011 he cashed in his thrift savings plan account (all $3,613.38 of it), gave $1,000 of that to an acquaintance in need, and with the rest bought himself a ticket to Nairobi. He had decided to set out on a hijrah, a migration to a true Islamic land, as he was instructed to do in the Qu\u2019ran.</p> <p>To say that this was all new to Baxam would be an understatement. A black American raised Catholic who had recently discharged himself from the US army after four years of service, he grew up with no connection to the Muslim faith. But five months before his trip, he went through a dramatic and sudden conversion after stumbling on a religious website. </p> <p>Barely half a year later, he was making his way north through Kenya into the vast unknown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/aug/18/somalia-terrorist-carpenter-al-shabaab\">Somalia: one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s carpenter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he travelled, Baxam kept his head down, stopping merely to eat and pray at mosques.

US and Kenyan authorities worked closely together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/15/foreign-troops-in-somalia-struggle-to-keep-al-shabaab-at-bay\">intercept</a> any movement across the border from al-Shabaab members, and Baxam had a taste of those security efforts as he sat on the bus going north.

They asked whether she was willing to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket home. When she inquired whether he had been charged with any crime, they said no, so she readily agreed, thinking Craig would soon be back with her.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018We would like to bring him home to you, but you have to pay the airfare.\u2019 So I gave them my charge card and they put a $3,000 ticket on it,\u201d Baxam said in the course of a three-hour interview with the Guardian in her home in the Atlanta suburbs.</p> <p>On 6 January 2012, she began the long drive to Maryland to meet her son as he flew into Baltimore Washington international airport. She was apprehensive, but happy he was safe and coming home. But somewhere on the interstate, another call came in from the FBI. Craig\u2019s plane had already landed, they told her. He had been re-arrested as he set foot on US soil and taken off to a federal institution. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/power.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3148000-Indictment-1.html\">charged</a> with attempting to provide material support to al-Shabaab, the designated terrorist organisation, and informed that he faced a maximum prison sentence of 15 years. </p> <p>Of all the many things that have happened to Deanna Baxam since that day, having the FBI asking her to pay for her son\u2019s plane ticket so he could be flown into the waiting claws of the US justice system perhaps hurts the most.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very angry about that. They used me as an American citizen, had me spend private funds to conduct law enforcement activities on behalf of the FBI. That\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it is this: my government screwed my son and made me pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>She may not have realized it fully at that time, but Deanna Baxam had just been sucked into one of the defining conflicts of the modern age: religious fundamentalism versus the US national security apparatus. </p> <p>On the one hand, she now had a son who professed to be a devout Muslim and who felt such a fierce commitment to his newly discovered faith that he was prepared to leave his family and radically change his life to practice it. On the other hand, she also had to deal with seemingly duplicitous anti-terrorist agents within the FBI who were bearing down on her child with the full might of the world\u2019s only superpower. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me</p> <footer> <cite>Deanna Baxam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She was caught between two utterly bewildering worlds, and her initial reaction was one of disbelief. This didn\u2019t happen to a family like hers. \u201cI thought our family did everything right, everything that would keep us out of the government\u2019s clutches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Deanna was born in Nebraska, a US citizen, but she was raised in Jamaica to Jamaican parents. She returned to the US after completing her chemistry degree and went on to marry Carl Baxam, an American Trinidadian who worked for a defense contractor. They had two sons, the youngest of whom, Craig, was born in 1987.</p> <p>There was always something special about Craig, she said. He was creative, outgoing, smart. He also had an obsessional quality, as smart kids often do. Passions would flare up, burn brightly and then fizzle out in quick succession. \u201cOne day when he was about 10, he wanted to learn Hangul, so he visited our Korean neighbors every day \u2013 he was a real pest. That was typical: he wanted to learn the piano so he would go at it for days and days, and then it was done.\u201d</p> <p>Along with that intensity came what she describes as a purist streak. \u201cThere was no grey for him: it was either black or white, right or wrong. Nothing in between. When things were shoved into the in-between, he couldn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>There were other difficulties. He once said to his mother he thought he had attention deficit disorder, though she couldn\u2019t see it. He also took the divorce of his parents badly. They separated when Craig was eight years old and a few years after that Deanna moved away from Maryland to New Jersey, leaving her son largely in the care of his father. </p> <p>The internal struggle reflected itself in Craig\u2019s education. He flunked out of college before the end of freshman year, and then flunked out of community college. Deanna kept asking him what he was going to do with his life, a question which he answered, to her shock and dismay, by signing up for the US military. He enlisted in 2007, telling Deanna that he wanted to defend America in the wake of 9/11. After eight months\u2019 training in advanced cryptology and intelligence, he was posted to Baghdad. </p> <p>Until he joined the army, Craig had been what his mother describes as \u201cvery clean. Didn\u2019t drink or do drugs. Never. He had never been in trouble of any kind and had no criminal convictions or arrest record.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what happened to him in Iraq \u2013 to this day he refuses to talk about it \u2013 but she does know that he came back a changed person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56374f1fbe391511c34791372ea698983fcfe27e/0_346_1372_1945/705.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Baxam at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig Baxam at Goodfellow air force base in San Angelo, Texas, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a mother, it bothers me that I lent my son to the army and they didn\u2019t give him back to me. I still don\u2019t have him back. I raised nice, middle-class children, sent them to music lessons, Catholic school, and then he just came back different.\u201d </p> <p>Having never smoked, Craig now consumed cigarettes, marijuana and K2 (synthetic marijuana, which at the time of his arrest was a legal substance). He began drinking heavily, another first.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam is convinced her son displayed classic PTSD symptoms. In between flashes of anger, he was withdrawn and disconnected. She had made his bedroom welcoming for his homecoming, but instead of sleeping in the new bed she\u2019d bought for him, he insisted on lying on the floor with his head on his service bag, as though he were still in the war zone.</p> <p>He signed up for one more tour of duty, this time to South Korea. The night before he was dispatched, she recalls that Craig would not move from a chair in the kitchen. \u201cI went to bed, and I left him sitting there in the chair in the dark all night. That wasn\u2019t right. There was something bad going on.\u201d</p> <p>Amid all this turbulence, Craig Baxam turned to the Muslim faith that was to become his salvation and his undoing. </p> <p>While stationed in South Korea, he began exploring religions. He would send his mother emails asking existential questions such as \u201cdo you believe there\u2019s only one God?\u201d or comparing Christianity with Islam. She was impressed and glad he was nurturing his spiritual side.</p> <p>But when he got off the plane on his return in July 2011, she knew something major had happened. He had grown a beard and was wearing a kufi and robe. She was stunned, and let it show. \u201cOh my God, what happened to you? Why would you even travel looking like that?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m a Muslim now,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>She ran out of the airport, sat on a bench and cried.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the faith that distressed her: they had raised their children to be believers, and Deanna Baxam herself is a Pentecostal Christian. It was the feeling of abandonment.</p> <p>\u201cFaith is important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we raised them in a certain tradition, so to have him leave Christianity was like a rejection of the family. I was angry about it for a long time. I told him, \u2018I\u2019m as devout as you are, but we are on different tracks and you are separating our family.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1874.pdf\">affidavit</a> given by an FBI agent, Craig Baxman converted about a week to 10 days before he quit the army in South Korea. There seems to have been no grooming involved by any individual or organization: Baxam had been surfing the internet and had come across a website that talked about the Day of Judgment \u2013 it spoke to him and made him hungry for more. Almost instantly he was praying five times a day and devouring books on Islam.</p> <p>Back in the US, he regularly tried to convert his own mother, too. Sometimes he would say to her: \u201cMom, I respect your right to have different faith, but I\u2019m worried you are going to hell when you die.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to be as accepting as she could, hoping that his new obsession would fade away. It didn\u2019t. In December 2011 she got a call from Craig\u2019s father saying that her son had disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9db3dd80a964c3d58a557fa3c369e9afc9b85f/0_0_4483_3225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to former US soldier Craig Baxam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A copy of the Initial Entry Training Soldier\u2019s Handbook belonging to the former US soldier Craig Baxam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bita Honarvar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/04/somalia-al-shabaab-insurgency-mogadishu-mohamed-nur\">Al-Shabaab</a> is one of the world\u2019s most feared Islamist militant groups. Since Craig Baxam\u2019s attempt to live under its control, the extremists have carried out some of the most brutal terrorist attacks in living memory, including the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-hostage-westgate-nairobi\">Westgate mall attack</a> in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed.<br></p> <p>The group emerged in about 2006 out of the anarchy and chaos that has gripped Somalia, a \u201cfailed state\u201d. At the time that Baxam was making his way through Kenya, carrying only a few hundred dollars in his pocket, a prayer mat and a copy of the Qu\u2019ran, al-Shabaab militants<strong> </strong>were being forced out of the Somali capital Mogadishu but were still in control of large swathes of the south of the country.</p> <p>It was these al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia that Craig Baxam was determined to reach. Using the internet, he had identified three places in the world where, in his view, a Muslim could conform fully to the tenets of his new religion under sharia law. <br></p> <p>The trio of locations that he chose as his possible future havens are among the harshest environments \u2013 both physically and spiritually \u2013 on the globe. They were the Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan; the southern islands of the Philippines, where an extremist group was trying to gain a foothold on Mindanao; and the al-Shabaab parts of Somalia.</p> <p>US prosecutors presented in court documents a psychological profile of Baxam in which they alleged that he had been aware of al-Shabaab\u2019s terrorist designation and the insurgency it was actively fighting at the time within Somalia. Based on interrogations with him while he was held captive by Kenyan police with FBI agents in attendance, they claimed that he had become hostile towards America, which he regarded as oppressive to Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cTo live as a Muslim in the US you need to compromise,\u201d the FBI agent\u2019s affidavit said, paraphrasing Craig Baxam\u2019s alleged position. \u201cHe finds the constant playing of music and display of pictures disrespectful. Only Allah can create images.\u201d</p> <p>The affidavit went on to allege that Baxam was prepared to take up arms and fight against the US if it attacked al-Shabaab:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Baxam saw himself dying in Somalia. It might be from malaria or from being hit by a rocket. Only Allah could know. Baxam never intended to return from Somalia, he was \u2018looking for dying with a gun in my hand\u2019. He would be happy to die defending Islam; being mowed down or hit with a cruise missile. If someone dies defending Islam, they are guaranteed a place in Jannah [paradise].</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible to really know what was going through Craig Baxam\u2019s head as he was making his fateful journey. In a recent letter to the Guardian from his current prison cell in Beaumont, Texas, he declined to be interviewed, writing that \u201cdespite the grief the US government has caused me, I am a private man and I also consider what happened to me to be far more insignificant than other cases\u201d.</p> <p>But there are clues that suggest that the US prosecutors\u2019 account of his intentions was overblown. The federal judge assigned to the case, Frederick Motz, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147999-OrderReBillofParticulars.html\">cast doubt</a> on the state\u2019s claim that Baxam had terrorist inclinations. </p> <p>\u201cAccording to what he told FBI agents,\u201d Motz wrote in a court memo, \u201cit appears to me that defendant had not formed an intention to fight for al-Shabaab in any offensive capacity when he travelled to Somalia. To the contrary, all the statements seem to reveal is that defendant wanted to live in a Muslim country under Sharia law and that if the country in which he was residing was attacked, he would then defend that country.\u201d </p> <p>For Deanna Baxam, the account given by the state \u2013 that her son was a callous terrorist-sympathiser intent on betraying his own country \u2013 just didn\u2019t ring true. As she sees it, it was his innate purist streak that was leading him on, not any political sensibility. \u201cHe believed that the Qu\u2019ran says that if you live in an oppressive regime where Islam is not in control, like America, then you should make hijrah. So he set off for Somalia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97833dfc1ef4021f05b05cb6517acf939ab0afba/0_0_1260_1666/756.jpg\" alt=\"A letter from Baxam to his mother.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter from Baxam to his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deanna Baxam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A mother is not the most dispassionate witness. But Deanna Baxam also has a lawyer\u2019s eye, having retrained in law several years ago. She has identified aspects of the case that make her deeply uneasy about the justice served. There were the 11 days between her son\u2019s arrest on the bus in northern Kenya, and his return to US soil \u2013 what happened in that period, how many times was he interrogated, and what role did the FBI play in the process? Why were none of the interrogations recorded on tape so that the FBI\u2019s account of what her son told them could be verified?<br></p> <p>She is alarmed by the fact that her own government deployed its considerable resources to track and detain her child on foreign soil. Instead of providing him with the care he needed as a disturbed veteran who had seen tours of duty in Iraq and South Korea and displayed symptoms of PTSD, they left him to his own devices.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this stuff happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThey track US nationals in Kenya? To say I\u2019m outraged doesn\u2019t seem enough of a response. When you are a US national overseas I thought the job of the government was to help protect you, not to collaborate with the Kenyan authorities in tracking you down.\u201d</p> <p>She is also dismayed by what she believes was the willful denial of her son\u2019s first amendment right to practice his religion. \u201cAmerica has a history of interning the Japanese, of persecuting people because of their religious beliefs. How is that different here? How can we imprison somebody who has no demonstrated guilty intent or action \u2013 there was none of that? And yet he is rounded up and sent to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Baxam was sentenced in January 2014 to seven years in prison, with five years of post-prison supervision added on. The sentence flowed from a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3147998-Plea-Agreement-Baxam-Copy.html\">plea bargain</a> in which the US government agreed to drop the main terrorist charges against him in return for a guilty plea to a lesser charge: that he had knowingly disposed of records that could be used in a terrorism investigation. Before leaving for Kenya, he had destroyed his personal computer and thrown it in a dumpster, allegedly to foil any future FBI probe.</p> <p>Today, Craig Baxam, now 29, is approaching his fifth anniversary behind bars, some of which time he has spent in solitary confinement. </p> <p>His father, Carl Baxam, lost his job with the defense contractor after 24 years of loyal service once news of the case broke. Carl died last year while Craig was still in prison.</p> <p>Deanna Baxam had to change the church in which she worshipped because she felt stigmatized by others in the congregation. She lost a few corporate contracts as a lawyer, as well as some professional friendships, after people dropped out of sight without saying a word. </p> <p>She says she still wrestles with the fallout of it all. She travels to visit her son whenever she can, and they exchange letters regularly. In his correspondence and phone calls, Craig continues to talk about Islam fervently, and makes clear that his long-term goal remains to live under sharia law, though no longer in Somalia. </p> <p>He signs his letters \u201cEsmail the American\u201d. In them, he\u2019ll weave in and out of a discussion of his faith. Allah will appear in one sentence, a joke about his mother\u2019s basketball team the Chicago Bulls the next. From time to time, he\u2019ll make another stab at getting Deanna to convert to Islam. </p> <p>As a mother, she has had to accept that there\u2019s a side to her son that is now beyond her reach. \u201cThere is a part of me that says, \u2018How could this have happened, what would make you so driven that you would want to go and live with al-Shabaab?\u2019 I can\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p> <p>She has tried to reach out to other mothers in her position, so far without success. \u201cPeople want to stay underground,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, who wants to be known as the \u2018mother of a terrorist\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>If she had the chance to send a message to other mothers like her, trapped between religious fundamentalism and an overweaning government, what would she say? </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018You are not alone. What has happened to you is beyond your imagination.

We\u2019ve seen that so many times, now.\u201d Arsenal had 73% possession against a Middlesbrough team that played with three in central midfield and massed men behind the ball. But the home side could not break them down and it was Middlesbrough who emerged with the credit. They created the better chances and they looked the likelier winners. Arsenal were physically below par after their Champions League exertions against Ludogorets, while Middlesbrough were fresh. Perhaps Wenger\u2019s team missed the guile of Santi Cazorla or the Plan B of Olivier Giroud. But, as Burnley also showed at the beginning of the month, it is possible to frustrate Arsenal with a compact and disciplined approach. One of the keys to Arsenal\u2019s title challenge will be finding a solution. <strong> David Hytner<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/arsenal-arsene-wenger-reading-efl-cup\">Wenger riled by timing of Arsenal AGM before EFL Cup tie</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/arsenal-middlesbrough-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Arsenal 0-0 Middlesbrough</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/arsene-wenger-left-frustrated-arsenal-draw-blank-middlesbrough-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58yvq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2830004\"            data-video-name=\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left frustrated as Arsenal draw a blank \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580ba0eee4b0d7abfb253aee\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/22/161022arsenal_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/22/161022arsenal.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/22/161022arsenal_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/arsene-wenger-left-frustrated-arsenal-draw-blank-middlesbrough-premier-league-video\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger left frustrated as Arsenal draw a blank \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2) Others must step up to make Spurs more clinical</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/oct/24/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tottenham Hotspur have received a lot of praise this season. As was the case in the previous campaign, their style of play has been thrilling while defensively they have been excellent. But an area of criticism is developing in regards to their lack of cutting edge. The draw at Bournemouth made it one goal in three matches for Tottenham. Son Heung-min, positioned as a lone centre-forward, was largely anonymous while others in white also failed to threaten. In total Spurs have scored 13 league goals this season. \u201cWe show a lot of positive things but the area we need to improve is to be more clinical,\u201d said Mauricio Pochettino. Harry Kane\u2019s return from the ankle injury he sustained against Sunderland last month will help Spurs\u2019 cause but, as Pochettino went on to say, others must step up, in particular Vincent Janssen, who has scored once since his \u00a317m arrival from AZ Alkmaar. <strong>Sachin Nakrani<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/bournemouth-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Bournemouth 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jack-wilshere-90-minutes-bournemouth\">Wilshere feels the pace and return to power after 90 minute-return</a></p> <h2>3) If Koeman isn\u2019t worried, he should be</h2> <p>Everton are without a win in five games, the optimism surrounding Ronald Koeman\u2019s arrival has evaporated, and if the new manager is not worried then he should be. Maybe it was a mistake to take the League Cup too lightly, for defeat at home against Norwich City was the start of Everton\u2019s woes. Maybe the drop in intensity Koeman complained of at Turf Moor was a result of taking Burnley too lightly. Everton began the game looking as if they could score on almost every attack. Yet when things failed to go their way they ran out of ideas quickly. Everton do not seem capable of being aggressive for a whole 90 minutes, or at least until a match has been won. They have the players but the concentration comes and goes. Even Burnley fans could agree there was no way Everton should have lost this match. Koeman\u2019s priority must be to rediscover his side\u2019s focus. <strong>Paul Wilson<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Burnley 2-1 Everton</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/sean-dyche-fortress-town-moor-burnley\">Dyche\u2019s hard work ethic is paying dividends at Fortress Turf Moor</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7fd6cfcacc45f8a33c093af6c814c715e0440bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7fd6cfcacc45f8a33c093af6c814c715e0440bc/0_59_3214_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Vokes of Burnley celebrates scoring his side\u2019s first goal against Everton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Vokes of Burnley celebrates scoring his side\u2019s first goal against Everton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4) Fundamental need for patience is being ignored</strong></h2> <p>It is indicative of the reactionary nature of so much football discourse in a post-Twitter world that some people genuinely think Jos\u00e9 Mourinho should be sacked as Manchester United manager after their embarrassment at Stamford Bridge. It took Sir Alex Ferguson, arguably the greatest manager of all time, almost five years to build a United side capable of challenging for the title, yet the fundamental need for patience \u2013 still preached by Ferguson \u2013 is ignored by so many who cite every other aspect of Ferguson\u2019s reign in evidence against his successors. Most of this United squad are not Mourinho players or United players. Mourinho\u2019s signings have not yet had the expected impact, and there is a strange weariness about the Portuguese, but the time to judge Mourinho\u2019s team is when it becomes Mourinho\u2019s team \u2013 which is next summer at the earliest. <strong>Rob Smyth<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Chelsea 4-0 Manchester United</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-rages-manchester-united-incredible-mistakes-chelsea\">Mourinho accuses Conte of humiliating him after Chelsea defeat</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/manchester-united-rabble-without-cause-thrashing-by-chelsea\">Paul Doyle: United a rabble without a cause</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/23/jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united-reaction\">Like the old days, Mourinho\u2019s presence provokes Chelsea reaction</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/mourinho-blames-defensive-mistake-manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58pcy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2833239\"            data-video-name=\"Mourinho blames defensive mistake as Chelsea thump Manchester United \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580d0a3be4b0582b9a8d5f67\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023mourinho_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733826&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733826&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/mourinho-blames-defensive-mistake-manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-video\">Mourinho blames defensive mistake as Chelsea thump Manchester United</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>5) Phelan must be given time, like Hughes has at Stoke</h2> <p>Stoke City\u2019s visit to the Kcom Stadium brought a fifth successive league defeat for Hull, who have shipped 19 goals in the process and plummeted into the bottom three in the space of a few weeks. It is vital Mike Phelan is given time. In that respect, the board could do worse than take a leaf out of Stoke\u2019s book. Stability has been the watchword in the Potteries these past three seasons, with Mark Hughes guiding the club to a ninth\u2011place finish in each of them. Along the way he has been generously supported by the club chairman, Peter Coates, although the vibrant nature of Stoke\u2019s victory cannot obscure the reality that it was only their second win of the season. Yet Coates has not sacked a manager since returning to Stoke a decade ago. Now the club are climbing the table. Something for Hull\u2019s owners, the Allams, to consider as they contemplate the latest league standings. <strong>Les Roopanarine<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/hull-city-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report\">Match report:<strong> </strong>Hull City 0-2 Stoke City</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/hull-city-sale-speculation-130m-far-east-consortium-bid\">Hull sale speculation grows with \u00a3130m Far East consortium bid</a></p> <h2>6) Does Ranieri leave out Vardy again?</h2> <p>Leicester City won the title thanks in significant part to a system that worked \u2013 all the best teams have balance, and often do not include the best 11 players in a club\u2019s squad. But once they became champions, Leicester availed of the wealth and status which allowed them to attack the transfer window. So they invested in attacking options, Ahmed Musa and Islam Slimani arriving to share the goalscoring burden with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. This led to the sidelining of Shinji Okazaki and Leandro Ulloa. Though their exclusion is not the sole reason for Leicester\u2019s patchy start to the season, the return of Okazaki against Crystal Palace gave his team\u2011mates the space to excel. Now Claudio Ranieri has a problem: does he field an unchanged XI at Tottenham, again leaving out Vardy? Or does he omit Okazaki? Sometimes a win poses more questions than answers. <strong>Daniel Harris<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/leicester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Leicester City 3-1 Crystal Palace</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/leicester-city-shinji-okazaki-crystal-palace-claudio-ranieri\">Leicester in the groove as Shinji Okazaki takes down Palace</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/ranieri-hails-leicester-city-best-performance-season-so-far-premier-league-crystal-palace-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58y22\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2830034\"            data-video-name=\"Ranieri hails Leicester City's 'best performance of the season so far' \u2013 video\"                        > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580ba3e6e4b0582b9a8d59ed\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/22/161022leicesterupdate_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/22/161022leicesterupdate.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/22/161022leicesterupdate_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/ranieri-hails-leicester-city-best-performance-season-so-far-premier-league-crystal-palace-video\">Ranieri hails Leicester City\u2019s \u2018best performance of the season so far\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>7) Swansea still missing a bit of quality</h2> <p>Leon Britton has been around long enough to remember what it was like to survive a relegation battle to stay in the Football League with Swansea. He also knows \u201cyou can\u2019t just rely on team spirit\u201d and need \u201cquality\u201d too. Swansea looked more solid against Watford, yet something is still missing further forward, where their lack of confidence and conviction shone through in Bob Bradley\u2019s first home game. Borja Bast\u00f3n, the club-record signing, has yet to demonstrate he is capable of troubling defences, let alone score. The same could be said for Fernando Llorente, who also has only one goal this season \u2013 though Swansea looked more threatening with him on the pitch in the second half. Unless something drastically changes over the next two months, Bradley is going to need a centre-forward in January. What they would do for a Michu in his prime. <strong>Stuart James<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/swansea-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Match report:<strong> </strong>Watford 0-0 Swansea City</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/swansea-city-supporters-trust-relations-sour-us-takeover-huw-jenkins\">Swansea accused of ignoring supporters trust as relations sour</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/said-and-done-football-diary-fifa-migrant-lies-dive-of-the-week\">Said &amp; Done: Fifa 2.0; peddling migrant lies; and dive of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Sturridge might have to be patient </h2> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve spent \u00a3200m on those three or four front players, it\u2019s not bad is it?\u201d Tony Pulis used the \u00a3200m line several times at Anfield, reinforcing the financial gulf between Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion. That Liverpool and Albion operate in different financial worlds will surprise no one, although the combined cost of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s front three on Saturday was \u00a371.5m. Even with Adam Lallana thrown into the equation Pulis is out by only \u00a3103.5m. His other point about Liverpool\u2019s attack brooked no argument. \u201cTheir front five is as good as any in the league,\u201d the Albion manager said. Watching Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino, or the intelligence and pace of Sadio Man\u00e9, it was difficult to think of a forward line with greater understanding and balance. Daniel Sturridge may have to be patient in his attempts to play himself back into goalscoring form.<strong> Andy Hunter<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/22/liverpool-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report\">Match report:<strong> </strong>Liverpool 2-1 West Brom</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-defending\">Klopp: Liverpool do not have a problem defending</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/klopp-pleased-with-liverpool-win-says-steven-gerrard-always-welcome-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58yf9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2830392\"            data-video-name=\"Klopp pleased with Liverpool win and says Gerrard always welcome \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580bcb81e4b05ae7c6c56043\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/22/161022liverpool_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/22/161022liverpool.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/22/161022liverpool_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/22/klopp-pleased-with-liverpool-win-says-steven-gerrard-always-welcome-premier-league-video\">Klopp pleased with Liverpool win and says Gerrard always welcome</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>9) Guardiola keeps his players back after five-game dip</h2> <p>It is strange when a team that sits top of the table comes under such scrutiny, but Manchester City\u2019s run of five without a victory has prompted serious questions about Pep Guardiola\u2019s side. In the aftermath here, Guardiola admitted that \u201csomething happened\u201d to cause their dip in form. It is a dip that has coincided with a number of individual errors during matches \u2013 notably John Stones\u2019 poor pass yesterday \u2013 but Guardiola insisted that the underlying cause runs much deeper. A new goalkeeper, a changing defensive unit, increased emphasis on playing out from the back, a frustrating period for Sergio Ag\u00fcero. All are potential factors, and Guardiola said he would fight to find the reason. His players were kept in the dressing room for 50 minutes post-match, and with significant games ahead, City face a tough test to immediately rediscover their early-season form. <strong>James Riach<br></strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Match report:<strong> </strong>Manchester City 1-1 Southampton</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/23/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-draw-southampton\">Guardiola: I will fight to find out why Manchester City are on bad run</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/guardiola-rues-fifth-game-without-a-win-for-manchester-city-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/58p2z\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2832972\"            data-video-name=\"Guardiola rues fifth game without a win for Manchester City \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"PLP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580ce85fe4b0d7abfb253f79\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/23/161023city_1_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733825&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11733825&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/oct/23/guardiola-rues-fifth-game-without-a-win-for-manchester-city-video\">Guardiola rues fifth game without a win for Manchester City</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>10) Sunderland pay for handing initiative to West Ham</h2> <p>Although Sunderland improved after a hairy opening 20 minutes, they paid for their caution in the end, with David Moyes handing the initiative to West Ham United with a couple of negative substitutions in the final 10 minutes. By bringing on Paddy McNair and Billy Jones, Sunderland invited West Ham forward, an unnecessary approach given that Slaven Bilic\u2019s side had lost their way after a promising start. The visitors were defending from their own six-yard box by the end. It was a missed opportunity. There were plenty of moments in the second half when Sunderland wasted promising breaks with poor choices in the final third, but they might have scored if they had continued to examine West Ham\u2019s defensive uncertainty. Instead they dropped back, decided to settle for a point and left with nothing.

For people \u2013 and especially children \u2013 to be stuck in a place like this in northern Europe should shame us all. Ghettoised and lawless camps where criminal and trafficking gangs can exploit and threaten can never be the answer to the refugee crisis.</p> <p>So yes of course the camp needs to be cleared. The questions instead should be how, when and whether this is part of a comprehensive plan. There needs to be enough safe accommodation, UNHCR involvement and monitoring, and a proper process for asylum and immigration assessments so refugees get the urgent help they need and those who are not refugees return home. And there needs to be a proper strategy to prevent people ending up in Calais in the first place \u2013 including action against the trafficking gangs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jonathan_RTfr/status/790434753061216256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Le hangar par o\u00f9 les <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Migrants?src=hash\">#Migrants</a> transiteront avant leur \u00e9vacuation de la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jungle?src=hash\">#Jungle</a> de <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Calais?src=hash\">#Calais</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yhkEAk7GAr\">pic.twitter.com/yhkEAk7GAr</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan RT France (@Jonathan_RTfr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jonathan_RTfr/status/790434753061216256\">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But most urgent of all, action is needed to get all the unaccompanied children and teenagers to safety. Frankly it is a disgrace that they have been left there so long. And the French failure to put proper child protection procedures in place or to find enough safe accommodation for them now is appalling. Britain has to do its bit to help. Ministers are finally speeding up the process of reunification for those who have family in the UK and are legally entitled to join them. And finally the first children and teenagers are coming here under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/alf-dubs-antisemitism-islamophobia-racism\">Dubs amendment</a>: these include teenage girls from Eritrea who are among the most vulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation. The last-minute nature of this will make it a bumpy process and politicians and the media should show some calm sense in their response. But more action is still needed by both France and Britain as too many children and teenagers are still stuck there. Given the urgency of the situation, I have proposed that France and Britain agree to take half the children and teenagers each. Last time part of the camp was cleared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/register-and-house-children-living-in-calais-camp-on-their-own-france-told\">about 120 children went missing</a>.

There is a very clear emphasis on the rush to destroy buildings rather than on people\u2019s safety and wellbeing. We have not seen evidence that the measures and resources required to transport, feed, house and clothe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/uk-and-french-authorities-blind-to-growing-problems-in-calais-jungle\">10,000 people in the camp</a> have been implemented effectively at such short notice.</p> <p>For the last year Care4Calais and a small number of other charities have been the only groups providing vital aid to refugees, including clothing, food and basic necessities. The French government has so far failed to provide even these basics, raising concerns as to how refugees will access vital supplies once they are scattered across France.</p> <p>Dispersing refugees <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/france-calais-refugees-migrants-reception-centres-francois-hollande\">to welcome centres</a> around the country does not constitute a long-term solution to the crisis.

Dispersing refugees across France will make monitoring procedural inadequacies, and delivering aid, extremely difficult to impossible to achieve.</p> <p>Destroying the infrastructure in Calais will likely achieve little more than rendering living conditions even more inhumane and putting vulnerable people and children at risk of criminal trafficking. The UK government has a vital role to play in designing and delivering a sustainable solution to this humanitarian crisis, and must take urgent action to ensure the situation in Calais does not escalate even further if the camp closes.</p> <p><em>Clare Moseley is a co-founder of the charity Care4Calais</em></p> <h2><strong>Hassan Akkad: </strong>No one should have to live like this, but what is the alternative?</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/24/calais-camp-riot-police-prepare-demolish-refugees-migrant\">Calais refugee camp: first bus leaves as police prepare for demolition \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spent two months in Calais before I arrived in the UK, and now I have come back, as a volunteer and a documentary-maker.

This will not be the last time a camp appears at Calais. Humans will always move, and a few of them will always try to reach Britain. We need to accept this reality, and create legal migration routes that will give would-be migrants an alternative to squatting in the Calais rain. Our choice isn\u2019t between migration and no migration at all. It\u2019s between two forms of migration \u2013 regular and irregular. The less we provide of the former, the more we will see of the latter.</p> <p>I write this from a small Nigerian city called Maiduguri. The number of displaced people in this tiny place \u2013 1.4 million \u2013 far outstrips the number of displaced who arrived by boat to all of Europe in 2015. This tells us two things. One: Europe, and Britain, can handle a few thousand from Calais. Two: there are millions of potential migrants out there. We can only hope to better manage their inevitable movement, rather than stop it altogether.</p> <p><em>Patrick Kingsley is the Guardian\u2019s migration correspondent</em></p>",

  "<p>Roma migrants in the UK have been left in a state of deep insecurity following the vote to leave the European Union, a leading thinktank has found.</p> <p>A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) into the implications of Brexit for Roma communities found that the group faced \u201ca triple whammy of challenges\u201d following June\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.</p> <p>Uncertainty over the group\u2019s right to remain in the UK, the fact that they have historically been victims of discrimination and prejudice across Europe and concerns that a large pot of EU funding designed to support them may be stopped were all cited as factors leaving Roma particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>Estimates of the number of Roma in Britain range from 80,000 to 300,000 and some areas \u2013 including Govanhill in Glasgow, Page Hall in Sheffield, Normanton in Derby, and Loxford in the London borough of Redbridge \u2013 have seen an influx of Roma migrants since the EU\u2019s enlargement in 2004 and 2007.</p> <p>\u201cRoma communities in the UK from central and eastern Europe face deep insecurity in the aftermath of the Brexit vote,\u201d said Marley Morris, a research fellow at IPPR and the report\u2019s author.</p> <p>\u201cMany are in precarious work with non-statutory employment agencies, experience sustained poverty, and live in substandard accommodation. They are therefore likely to be particularly vulnerable to any future changes to their current residency rights.\u201d</p> <p>The thinktank estimates that a total of \u00a31.1bn in European structural funds for the 2014\u20132020 period is available to be used to promote Roma integration, and called on the government to make up any shortfall that occurs after Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cA large amount of targeted support for Roma communities is dependent on EU funding. Without this support, Roma communities will face greater barriers in accessing employment, education, and healthcare, and local services will be placed under further strain,\u201d said Morris.</p> <p>\u201cBut so far there has been little public discussion about how Brexit will affect Roma communities, despite estimates suggesting there are tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of Roma migrants living in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cCentral government needs to take action now \u2013 by clarifying the future rights of Roma migrants in the UK and explaining how EU funding to support this group will be adequately replaced.\u201d</p> <p>One of the report\u2019s key recommendations was that local authorities with large Roma communities take proactive measures to mitigate any negative effects of Brexit on Roma communities. The thinktank recommends they \u201crally together\u201d to make the case to national government for funding to support Roma communities and collect better data on Roma living in their areas. </p> <p>\u201cWe assert that taking action only at crisis point \u2013 for instance, at the point of homelessness or at the height of community tensions \u2013 places unnecessary pressures on public services and proves costlier in the long run than investing in early-stage interventions,\u201d the report reads.</p> <p>In 2013, David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary and MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/david-cameron-blunkett-immigration-riots\">caused controversy</a> when he said tensions between local people and Roma migrants in the Page Hall area of the city could escalate into rioting unless action was taken to improve integration.</p> <p>In an interview with BBC Radio Sheffield, Blunkett accused the government of \u201cburying their head in the sand\u201d over the scale of Roma settlement in the UK and said he feared a repeat of the violence that erupted between Asian and white youths in Bradford and other cities in 2001.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s a hot sunny day in mid-September and Gareth Malone is wearing a green felt Christmas tree on his head. \u201cThe more you sing this carol like you\u2019re singing to granny at home,\u201d he tells the London Youth Choir, \u201cthe more heartfelt it is \u2013 and the more the microphones will pick it up.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s best known choirmaster is making a Christmas record in Abbey Road studios. But, true to his roots, he is also doing it in the community. In fact, he\u2019s doing it in lots of communities: in Cornwall with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCRadioCornwall/videos/1294045967286221/\">Perranarworthal Hand Bell Ringers</a>; in Birmingham with its <a href=\"http://www.birminghamcommunitygospelchoir.co.uk/\">Gospel Choir</a>; and in Wales with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-35275802\">Coed Eva</a> primary school (whose building was burnt down in an arson attack on New Year\u2019s Eve).</p> <p>Over the past decade, Malone has shown he can transform pretty much any group of no-hopers into a decent choir. In <a href=\"http://www.garethmalone.com/programmes/boys-don't-sing\">Boys Don\u2019t Sing</a>, he took a bunch of Leicester schoolboys who hated the idea of singing in a choir and nine months later had them performing at the Albert Hall. Then there was <a href=\"http://www.garethmalone.com/programmes/sing-while-you-work\">Sing While You Work</a>, in which P&amp;O saw off the likes of Sainsbury\u2019s and Cheshire Fire Service to become Britain\u2019s top workplace choir.

The son of a civil servant mother and bank manager father, he grew up in Bournemouth and did a drama degree at the University of East Anglia. \u201cI thought I was going to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-branagh\">Kenneth Branagh</a> in Henry V, that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Malone was convinced he would conquer the world, that he would make his name as an actor, a director or a singer \u2013 and, if things worked out well, all three. But his ambition was not matched by his talent or dedication. \u201cI had moments of realisation at university. I saw other actors and thought, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re a bit more dedicated and a bit more serious and a bit better than me.\u2019 So that was a little knockback. I think I had the same with directing: there were these people who had a singlemindedness about what they wanted to do that I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He took a postgrad in classical singing at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music \u2013 passing with a distinction \u2013 but again he felt he was lacking. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a huge operatic voice. It\u2019s a smallish instrument. The people who get picked up tend to be the ones with opera-sized voices.\u201d To even stand a chance, he says, he would have also had to show unwavering commitment for six to eight years. \u201cIt\u2019s like brain surgeon-type commitment. A lot of my friends who I was in college with are just starting their careers now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68bd4de9a2bb547464d9032a0b994a4b895f5bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68bd4de9a2bb547464d9032a0b994a4b895f5bd4/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malone in the recording studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malone in the recording studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came out of school cocksure and confident \u2013 I thought I was marvellous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So he returned to Bournemouth, worked in a bar and sold ice creams on the beach. He was at a bit of a loss. \u201cOne day, a friend of my parents called and said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen an advert for a youth worker to work with young teenagers and I think you\u2019d be really good at it.\u2019\u201d Malone applied, got the job, and it changed his life. He worked with disadvantaged youngsters, encouraging them to take an interest in music, and he saw a world he had been oblivious to. </p> <p>\u201cI would teach them to play bass guitar, try to organise them. I found it deeply traumatic in some ways, because it was my first realisation that people had not had the same advantages I had. People would tell you their parents were on drugs or whatever and I found it difficult to deal with because I was young and didn\u2019t know much about the world.\u201d Was he naive? \u201cYes, I was sheltered till I was in my 20s.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63bb38a3495d973d6a83c7e56f18cd168ecffd72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bb38a3495d973d6a83c7e56f18cd168ecffd72/0_67_2051_1231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the first series of The Choir, pupils from Northolt High School competed in the World Choir Games in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the first series of The Choir, pupils from Northolt High School competed in the World Choir Games in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the youth work, he got a job with the <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/\">London Symphony Orchestra</a> running its youth and community choirs and <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/lso-discovery/about-lso-discovery.html\">working in inner-city schools</a>. \u201cI got a real kick out of seeing teenagers you\u2019d never expect getting involved in classical music.\u201d The experience knocked some of the arrogance out of him. \u201cIt was quite humbling. I came out of school fairly cocksure and confident \u2013 I thought I was marvellous.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointment had given him a new perspective: he now regarded himself more as an enthusiastic amateur than an unheralded divo. He certainly did not see community work as a stepping stone to a career in TV. I read that his wife Becky, an English teacher with whom he has two young children, said that he had grim prospects when they met and she took him on as a project. \u201cOh, what a lovely thing to say!\u201d he says. \u201cI think she spotted potential, but I wasn\u2019t like a high-flying city lawyer with bags of cash. I was a bohemian with grand plans. I think she felt I\u2019d always do something but she didn\u2019t know what.

And everything fell into place. The skills he had learnt over the years \u2013 acting, directing, singing, teaching, mentoring \u2013 all played a part in this new career. I ask what he thinks makes him good on TV. He ums and ahs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m certainly not camera-shy.\u201d He also says his bossiness comes in useful. \u201cI\u2019m a back-seat driver in life. You know, \u2018You might want to turn the oven down to three.\u2019 Back-seat baker, cook, organiser, back-seat everything. I have always got an opinion on how I\u2019d like things to be.\u201d</p> <p>Older women, including my mother, tend to adore Malone. She says what she loves about him is that he is an enabler: giving people the confidence to do things they wouldn\u2019t have dreamed they were capable of. A great example is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008y102\">Boys Don\u2019t Sing</a>, the BBC2 series Malone cites as his favourite. \u201cI just lived and breathed it for nine months, in and out of that school every day trying to make it work. It was the joy of going from not knowing what we were doing to standing on the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for the first time in my life with 150 people \u2013 and it working. I was really proud of that performance.\u201d</p> <p>What makes him particularly proud is that he was working with schoolboys. Why do they tend to be resistant to choirs? Malone says it\u2019s a such complex issue, involving masculinity, biology and language itself. \u201cYou\u2019re always struggling to prove it can be as manly and as cool as football and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox\">Xbox</a>. The term boy is quite complicated in relation to music. We talk of boy bands, but they are actually young men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're alway struggling to show that singing can be as manly and cool as football</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd the changes that occur to a young man\u2019s voice are very traumatic. We don\u2019t deal with that very well. We always talk about boys\u2019 voices breaking and of course they don\u2019t break. It\u2019s a source of anxiety for so many men. They say, \u2018Oh, I sang in a choir and then my voice broke and I stopped. What happens when something breaks? You throw it away and get a new one. Well, you can\u2019t get a new voice, so a lot of men just fall out of love with their own instruments.\u201d </p> <p>Does he never get bored with the TV formula of turning dross into gold?

  "<h2><strong>Er, where?</strong></h2> <p>Only 95km or about 90 minutes from Verona airport, Folgaria is a mid-sized resort in the Trentino region of northern Italy that has a reputation for being in a snow pocket. It also has impeccable ski history credentials, as the first ski lift in Italy was built here, in the 1930s, and a full ski resort created shortly after the war.</p> <p>Since then the pistes, accessed by chairlifts, have grown to cover 104km. About two-thirds of that is local to Folgaria itself; the other 30km is above the neighbouring villages of Lavarone and Luserna, a short bus ride away. Three new quad chairlifts for the 2013-14 season have connected Folgaria to the previously mothballed small centre of Fiorentini, over the regional border in Veneto. The lifts have enabled new runs \u2013 a 1.9km red and two blues (2.4km and 1km long) \u2013 to be created. The combined ski area is promoted as <a href=\"http://alpecimbra.it/en/\">Alpe Cimbra</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"269cc859330d55f43e3bbe2d3ad10b7b0ec01393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/269cc859330d55f43e3bbe2d3ad10b7b0ec01393/0_131_2473_1484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chairlifts serve 104km of pistes at Folgaria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chairlifts serve 104km of pistes at Folgaria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why try it?</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to our ski resort choices each winter, we tend to be swayed by the big-name resorts with the impressive stats \u2013 hundreds of kilometres of pistes, dozens of fast comfy lifts and a vibrant apr\u00e8s ski scene. So, despite being easy to reach and offering the type of authentic, unspoilt mountain village experience that many people say they want, with lower prices, quieter slopes and uncrowded bars and restaurants, in reality most skiers bypass Folgaria for the more famous Madonna di Campiglio and Passo Tonale, a couple of hours away. \u201cFolgaria is a gem,\u201d says Stuart McLeod of Zenith Holidays, which operates low-cost packages to the resort. \u201cIt is a short transfer from Verona with an excellent variety of slopes. It\u2019s ideal for a mixed-ability group and perfect for beginners.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The lowdown</strong></h2> <p>On the slopes, the terrain is \u201cclassic Trentino\u201d, with 37 flattering easy-to-intermediate red and blue runs carving down through the trees, plus a handful of short, testing blacks. Lift pass prices (and most other in-resort costs) are around half what you might pay in a big resort in the French Alps.</p> <h2><strong>Anything else?</strong></h2> <p>Located in the \u201cgreat highlands of Trentino\u201d, Folgaria is proud of its history and culture. You\u2019re unlikely to hear English spoken here and in some bars it won\u2019t even be Italian, but Cimbro, the ancient southern Bavarian dialect brought to these mountains by medieval settlers. It\u2019s also reflected in the food culture: I tucked in to polenta with mountain mushrooms and the region\u2019s famous Vezzena cheese at <a href=\"http://\">Rifugio Stella d\u2019Italia</a>, one of several family-run mountain huts. Pure local mountain honey is a key element of many of the desserts, including a stickily delicious strudel (there\u2019s a <a href=\"http://\">honey museum</a> down in the valley, ).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"756a212c97ca9b4c91c724eda1f11941598b905a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756a212c97ca9b4c91c724eda1f11941598b905a/0_53_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rifugio alpino Stella d\u2019Italia, Folgaria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another view of Rifugio Stella d\u2019Italia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>And the apr\u00e8s?</strong></h2> <p>A handful of bars just the right side of lively, but offering nothing too raucous. <a href=\"http://johncaffe.it/\">John Caff\u00e8</a> has been here as long as the skiing but has moved with the times and has a stylish lounge area with comfy leather seating and framed historic ski pictures on the walls.

There\u2019s also special effort made for families, with a new Kinderheim nursery and a great little terrain park.</p> <h2><strong>Where do I eat?</strong></h2> <p>Ticking off more of the Italian staples in downtown Folgaria, I found the chocolate and pistachio ice-cream sublime at <a href=\"http://www.artigeniale.it/la-baita-del-gelato\">La Baita del Gelato</a>, and the <em>formaggi misti</em> pizza, made with local cheese (\u20ac6.50) authentic and wonderful at <a href=\"http://pizzeriacheizel.it/\">Pizzeria Cheizel</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Where do I stay?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2d8faa7432c64dea1f7ae2d614811de75d18ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2d8faa7432c64dea1f7ae2d614811de75d18ee2/0_15_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Luna Bianca, Folgariatab=album&amp;album_id=736221996398856\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hotel Luna Bianca</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hotel Luna Bianca</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The modern three-star <a href=\"http://lunabiancahotel.it/\">Luna Bianca hotel</a> is one of the most popular in Folgaria, with spacious, clean rooms, good facilities including a sauna, and a reputation for good service.

Leaflets instructing the refugees to clear&#xa0;off generated outrage rather than obedience, as residents and agencies working in the camp had predicted.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/29/uk-warned-calais-border-deal-is-in-danger\" title=\"\">Le Touquet agreement</a>, which put the UK\u2019s effective border in France rather than England, and the principle underpinning it \u2013 that refugees must seek asylum in the first safe country they enter \u2013 have been unfit for purpose for some time. When people are displaced in very large numbers, they need to be distributed in a rational and humane way. It is not overly complicated to find a measure that establishes each EU nation\u2019s resources and cross-references that against existing family connections, languages and skills among the refugees themselves, then allocates people to places in an orderly and dignified way. It might be fiddly, and naturally it would take political courage, but the task isn\u2019t wild or unimaginable. Instead, we\u2019ve been hiding behind one another\u2019s skirts, hoping that Greece will take the hit by accident of geography, or Germany by dint of its prosperity.</p> <p>The logic of France shouldering our obligations was always nebulous, and relied on an unstable combination of inertia and goodwill. But one thing has become plain since the goodwill evaporated: however bad an agreement is, the only possible amelioration is a better agreement. Stitching together isolated responses, for whose deficiencies we then blame each other, is worse than sub-optimal government. In practice, it is more like having no government.</p> <p>This time last year, the refugee traffic was picking up again on the island of Lesbos after a choppy October: people died every day in the strait between Turkey and Greece, and the death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/dozens-dead-as-two-boats-sink-off-greece\" title=\"\">in 2015 for this one route was 900</a>. But Boris Cheshirkov, the UNHCR representative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/charity-appeal-2015-blog/2015/dec/14/guardian-charity-appeal-poor-weather-discount-the-refugees-risking-their-lives-at-sea\" title=\"\">I interviewed</a> at the time, wasn\u2019t even talking about the needless tragedies when he said: \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a crisis. This shouldn\u2019t be an emergency.\u201d He was referring to the reality of life on the island, with hundreds of thousands of people, some trapped in limbo and others who would be travelling onwards into yet more danger, with more barbed wire and hostile governments. We were a continent that had lost sight of its founding principles of dignity, tolerance and brotherhood, he concluded.</p> <p>The most concrete EU response to the refugee crisis so far has been to push it all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/eu-strikes-deal-with-turkey-to-send-back-refugees-from-greece\" title=\"\">back on to Turkey</a>, a country that has already hosted 2.7 million people escaping the war in Syria. That was its big idea, its stab at universal fellowship, the culmination of decades of noble rhetoric: throw some money at the problem to make sure it stays somewhere else. Pretend the conflict is smaller than it is, or larger than it is, or closer to conclusion than it is, or more never-ending than it is \u2013 anything to make it none of our business. How much money should we throw at it? Whatever it takes to preserve the integrity of our shared border, since the project \u2013 whose purpose we can\u2019t remember \u2013 will otherwise certainly fail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\">EU-Canada trade deal in crisis as Canadian minister walks out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was always a sense that some members \u2013 mainly us, but also the newer, eastern European nations \u2013 had never bought into the EU for its humanitarian vision but only as a trading bloc. Michel Rocard, prime minister of France under Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand, memorably wrote an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/french-message-britain-get-out-european-union\" title=\"\">open letter</a> to the UK two years ago, in which he stated, \u201cYou wanted trade, and you thought about nothing else\u201d, adding bluntly: \u201cGet out of Europe, before you wreck it.\u201d I want to call him prescient, except that we did get out, and it looks like we might have wrecked it anyway.</p> <p>Increasingly, I find this dichotomy between the grand language of universal rights and the base but profitable self-interest of free trade to be false. Whatever your formula is, however many millions of euros a deal will generate, whatever jobs it will create, sooner or later you will come down to the unit of a human being. As we have seen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal-meltdown-canadian-minister-walks-out\" title=\"\">Wallonia\u2019s rejection of the EU-Canadian trade agreement</a>, the rational may converge with the irrational \u2013 some might reject it because they are worried about corporate hegemony, others might be yearning for a time when you only ate a pig if its ancestors knew yours.</p> <p>But the prescription will be the same: unless you find a kind of free trade that distributes its fruits in a way that people can stomach, they will vote against it. Short of giving up on democracy, this means formulating an idea \u2013 as mutually agreed as your trading bloc is wide \u2013 of what fair distribution looks like, which cannot be done without an idea of equality at its foundation. It is hard to imagine, having got that far, a Europe that had framed its citizens as equal and&#xa0;yet offered no dignity, succour or fellowship to the rest of world.</p> <p>Perhaps it sounds abstruse to even discuss these interlinked crises of an institution we\u2019ve just walked away from. But it couldn\u2019t be more vital, as we discuss what kind of trade relationship we want with Europe, to remember that trade is just a subset of a deeper question: what kind of people do we want to be?</p>",

With absolute confidence, after several false starts, the mature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/11/georgeorwell.classics\">George Orwell</a> takes charge of this idiosyncratic account of working-class life from his first page.</p> <p>Formerly Eric Blair, he was now writing with the urgency of a freelance with a much-needed commission, and also as a man just back from a journey through the industrial wastes of Yorkshire and Lancashire in the depths of the Great Depression.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was honest about himself as a refugee from the middle class, via Eton, Burma and the dosshouses of Paris and London</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Orwell had been signed up in the spring of 1936 for perhaps as little as \u00a350 (plus expenses) by Victor Gollancz, the leftwing publisher who had championed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/04/george-orwell-jail-time-unseen-court-records\"><em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em></a>.

In fact, when Orwell delivered his manuscript at the end of the year, Gollancz was confronted with rather more than he\u2019d bargained for, an infuriating but always compelling, personal quest by one of the strangest and most complicated figures in English literature.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2011/feb/20/george-orwell-wigan-in-pictures\"><em>The Road to Wigan Pier </em></a>falls into two parts, a travelogue describing Orwell\u2019s journey through three northern towns, and a matching, but much more contentious, quest of heart and mind. It was, declared its author, a \u201cpolitical book\u201d, a mix of reportage and political commentary with a dash of autobiography. Orwell\u2019s contemporaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\">Cyril Connolly</a> noted that, henceforth, he would be a socialist, but a socialist with an aura of secular saintliness that some found affected, even comical. And yet, with all its weaknesses, it would prove to be a milestone in his creative development.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/21/age-of-corbyn-is-the-time-right-for-another-road-to-wigan-pier\">In the age of Corbyn, is the time right for another Road to Wigan Pier?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Orwell\u2019s long-term publisher, Fred Warburg, described it as \u201cone of the most contradictory books ever written\u201d, which is another way of saying that, as well as writing outstanding reportage from \u201cWigan Pier\u201d, Orwell was willing to be honest about himself as a refugee from the middle class, via Eton, Burma and the dosshouses of Paris and London. In these pages, finally, he began to carve out his peculiar place as a British literary socialist, and to reconcile himself to himself.</p> <p>The first half opens with a brilliant, stand-alone chapter about the Brookers\u2019 tripe shop-cum-lodging house, No 22 Darlington Street. From the squalor of working-class Wigan, Orwell plunges into meetings with the unemployed, with slum-dwellers, with coalminers, and dockers.</p> <p>Anxious to return to his future wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/10/georgeorwell.classics\">Eileen O\u2019Shaughnessy</a>, Orwell spent just two months in the north, and finally took the train home, closing his travels with a scene glimpsed from his railway carriage, the unforgettable image of a working-class woman trying to unblock a drain:</p> <p><em>At the back of one of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked\u2026 She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye \u2026 it wore the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever seen\u2026 She knew well enough what was happening to her \u2013 understood as well as I did how dreadful a destiny it was to be there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of a slum backyard, poking a stick up a foul drainpipe.</em></p> <p>The second half of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/20/orwell-wigan-pier-75-years\"><em>Wigan Pier</em></a> is much more uneven, and famously provocative. Even now, Orwell\u2019s private encounter with English socialism can seem shocking. His determination \u201cto see what mass unemployment is like at its worst\u201d was principally to do with his own quest, a journey that was, he writes, \u201cnecessary to me as part of my approach to socialism\u201d.</p> <p><em>For before you can be sure whether you are genuinely in favour of socialism, you have got to decide whether things at present are tolerable or not tolerable, and you have got to take up a definite attitude on the terribly difficult question of class</em>.</p> <p>Orwell is never less than self-lacerating. On the class question, he eviscerates himself: \u201cThe real reason why a European of bourgeois upbringing cannot without a hard effort think of a working man as his equal is summed up in four frightful words: the lower classes smell.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2011/feb/20/george-orwell-wigan-in-pictures\">The Wigan of George Orwell \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From here, an admission that continues to shock, and having described his adolescent self as \u201can odious little snob\u201d, he confesses his deep sense of inadequacy: \u201cI had not much grasp of what socialism meant, and no notion that the working class were human beings\u2026 I could agonise over their sufferings, but I hated them and despised them whenever I came anywhere near them.\u201d</p> <p>In conclusion, having fretted neurotically over the condition of domestic socialism, and his obligations towards it, he arrives at a kind of armistice in the war with himself: \u201cTo sum up \u2013 there is no chance of righting the conditions I described in the earlier chapters of this book, or of saving England from fascism, unless we can bring an effective socialist party into existence.\u201d</p> <p>Rarely, in English literature, has a writer flayed himself so mercilessly in print, or published so many hostages to fortune. But the upshot of this uniquely strange book was a kind of creative liberation: Eric Blair, who was now unequivocally George Orwell, had found his voice and his identity. For the rest of his active life \u2013 barely 10 years \u2013 he would write as a British literary socialist.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has claimed that what happens to refugees held on Nauru is the responsibility of the government of Nauru, not of Australia. Is this so? </strong></p> <p>His statement is incorrect. The high court has recognised that Australia has responsibility for the people it detains offshore. The <a href=\"https://jade.io/article/444349\">latest affirmation of this</a> was in February this year in the M68 case. </p> <p>Indeed, the Migration Act says the Australian government can take \u201cany action\u201d in <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s198aha.html\">relation to regional processing</a>. </p> <p><strong>2. Once people have refugee status, can they be held indefinitely on Nauru or Manus Island until a third country taken them? </strong></p> <p>Yes, in practice. No, in theory. </p> <p>The high court has said that detention is lawful as long as it is not indefinite. In other words, detention is supposed to be a condition precedent to \u201cprocessing\u201d so that refugees will move out of detention. The court has indicated that long-term detention without charge or trial would be beyond the power of the parliament as that would trespass on judicial functions. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Australia had failed to protect refugees from \u2018torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, there is a hiatus. Many people have been \u201cprocessed\u201d with the government offering them \u201cpackages\u201d to either go back home, stay in Nauru or PNG, or to a third country that Australian is looking to bribe. </p> <p>Most of the refugees have refused these enticements, as well they might. Voluntarily returning to the place from which you are fleeing doesn\u2019t make much sense, while many of the people of Nauru and PNG are hostile to refugees. </p> <p>Of 551 Manus Island detainees assessed by the PNG government up to 31 May, 2016, 98% have been found to be refugees. Of those, 20 have been resettled in PNG. On Nauru, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-dutton-should-stop-whinging-and-find-solution-to-the-offshore-problem-64132\">77% of those \u201cprocessed\u201d are refugees</a> and of those five have been resettled in Cambodia under the $55m <a href=\"http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/news/2016/09/australia-cambodia-refugee-relocation-agreement-unique-does-little-improve-protection\">Australia-Cambodia refugee relocation agreement.</a> </p> <p>Signs of resettlement progress have not been visible. It can only be a matter time before the high court finds a case affording it the opportunity to say that detention has the characteristic of being indefinite and thereby unlawful. </p> <p>In the good old days of the <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/PacificSolution\">Pacific Solution</a> (circa 2001-2008) the following countries admitted refugees who were detained on Nauru and Manus: New Zealand 401, Sweden 21, Canada 16, Denmark 6 and Norway 4. </p> <p>The opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.laborherald.com.au/people-families/refugee-resettlement-options/\">Bill Shorten, is still banging the drum for the \u201cMalaysia solution\u201d</a> \u2013 even though Malaysia is not a party to the refugee convention. </p> <p><strong>3. Is Australia\u2019s offshore detention processing policy in violation of international law, and if so what can be done about it?</strong></p> <p>Yes, Australia has violated international law. In March 2015 the UN special rapporteur on torture, Juan M\u00e9ndez, reported in relation to Manus Island that the conditions in which detainees were kept amounted to torture under the international convention against torture. </p> <p>Australia is a party to the convention and as such would be required to \u201cprovide adequate detention conditions; end the practice of detention of children; and put a stop to the escalating violence and tension at the regional processing centre\u201d.</p> <p>The report found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/09/un-reports-australias-immigration-detention-breaches-torture-convention\">Australia had failed to protect refugees </a>from \u201ctorture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d. </p> <p>The Migration Act and the Maritime Powers Act also allow for the arbitrary detention of people and for their status to be assessed on the high seas without access to lawyers \u2013 both violations of international law.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/201610/r1626465_24834993.pdf\">most recent report on Nauru</a> says the indefinite detention of refugees, particularly children, falls foul of the refugee convention. </p> <p>Australia ratified the convention in 1951 and parts of it were incorporated into the Migration Act and as such were enforceable under Australian law. This included the principle of non-refoulement (returning a refugee to a place where their life would be threatened) and the requirement that the minister should grant a protection visa to a non-citizen where protection obligations arise. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would replace a policy of punitive deterrence with one of decency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The relevant bits of the refugee convention were removed from the Migration Act in the infamous December 2014 amendments and replaced by a definition of \u201crefugee\u201d narrower than that in the convention.</p> <p>International conventions set \u201cnormative\u201d standards for contracting countries, but individuals cannot enforce those standards unless they are incorporated into Australian law. Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/20.html\">the high court has said in the 1995 case</a> of Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh, that legislation should be interpreted by courts, as far as possible, in a manner consistent with our international obligations. </p> <p><strong>4. Can refugees leave Manus Island and Nauru? </strong></p> <p>In theory, yes. In practice, no. </p> <p>The refugee convention says, \u201cThe contracting states shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status in the country is regularised or they obtain admission into another country\u201d.</p> <p>Both Nauru and PNG have signed the convention and Nauru\u2019s temporary protection visas allow refugees to leave and re-enter the country \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t come to Australia. How they might leave, of course, is the problem.</p> <p>Nauru and PNG\u2019s temporary settlement visas also allow refugees to work and receive vocational and language training. PNG also offers a pathway to citizenship, however a large proportion of refugees in this category are too fearful to move into the local communities.</p> <p>In April the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">PNG supreme court found the detention of refugees on Manus Island to be unconstitutional</a> and a violation of their rights under the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx\">international covenant on civil and political rights</a>. </p> <p>It might be open for a generous benefactor to have large helicopters swoop down onto the offshore camps and remove the refugees. Similarly, a chartered vessel might draw up alongside and spirit them away to another jurisdiction that would offer them more acceptable permanent residency. Of course that would involve violations of airspace and territorial waters but it would be a violation for a noble cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/peter-dutton-says-he-wont-be-defamed-by-guardian-and-abc-over-nauru-files\">Peter Dutton attacks Guardian and ABC over reporting of Nauru files</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>5. Is there a solution?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The current policy is a failure because Manus and Nauru were only meant to be places of temporary processing. They are now places of indeterminate detention because third-country destinations cannot be found and because the safety of refugees in local communities cannot be assured. </p> <p>A revised policy would have to fulfil the twin objectives of ending the torture and other violations without rekindling the armada of boats. </p> <p>This could be done by onshore (Australian) resettlement of those now held in the offshore facilities and at the same time instituting a program of regional refugee cooperation, focusing on Indonesia and Malaysia.</p> <p>The only reason people get on boats is because they have no hope. If they were given hope of orderly processing and resettlement the boat incentive would disappear. If anyone did get on a boat then they would not be processed or resettled. </p> <p>This would require Australia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/there-are-policy-alternatives-to-locking-up-refugees-in-pacific-gulags\">shift its humanitarian refugee intake</a> from distant camps in South America and the Middle East and focus on the region. </p> <p>It would replace a policy of punitive deterrence with one of decency and put a stop to the hypocritical rhetoric that torture is justified in the name of saving lives at sea. </p>"
