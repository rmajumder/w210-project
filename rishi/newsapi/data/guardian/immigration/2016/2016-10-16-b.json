  "<p>The role of the weak pound in pushing up prices for UK shoppers and motorists will become clearer this week, with official figures expected to show a sharp rise in inflation.<br></p> <p>One leading economic forecaster is warning that rising costs will continue to hit consumer spending next year and in 2018, as a decline in business investment after the Brexit vote applies further downward pressure to economic growth. </p> <p>Inflation is forecast to have hit its highest level since late 2014, when measured on the consumer prices index (CPI). Economists forecast the rate will have jumped to 0.9% in September from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/uk-inflation-remains-unchanged-at-06\">0.6% in August</a> when the data is published on Tuesday, according to a Reuters poll.</p> <p>Sterling\u2019s plunge against other currencies since June\u2019s vote to leave the EU has raised the cost of imports to the UK and last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/tesco-unilever-resolve-marmite-dispute-price-supermarket\">sparked a pricing row between Marmite maker Unilever and supermarket Tesco</a>.

However, this performance is expected to fizzle out, as inflation jumps to 2.6% next year and 1.8% in 2018, causing consumer spending to slump to 0.5% and 0.9% respectively. </p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London, is predicting inflation will rise to 0.8% in September as an increase in fuel prices overshadows the impact of cheaper food. He expects that downward effect from food prices to fade once supermarkets stop cutting prices. \u201cLast week\u2019s Tesco versus Unilever standoff highlighted that the end of the supermarket price war may be close,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets highlighted the likely effect of a weaker pound, which recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/04/pound-dollar-low-construction-imf-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-57f3516de4b03ca720ca247e#block-57f3516de4b03ca720ca247e\">touched new 31-year lows against the US dollar</a>. \u201cThe data are \u2026 expected to suggest that the sharp depreciation in sterling following the referendum has already started to push prices up,\u201d they wrote in a research note.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The prospect of rising inflation spooked financial markets last week and investors offloaded UK government bonds, known as gilts. At the close of another tumultuous week on markets, 10-year gilt yields, which move inversely to prices, rose to their highest levels since the referendum in June.</p> <p>The pound remained under pressure against the dollar and the euro, falling to below $1.22 and \u20ac1.11. That compares with $1.49 and \u20ac1.31 the night of the vote on EU membership.</p> <p>The key pressure on sterling over the last fortnight has come from worries that the government has set a course for a hard Brexit settlement that leaves the UK shut out of the European single market. Ministers have hinted they would sacrifice that access in return for stricter immigration controls. </p> <p>Such signals from Theresa May\u2019s government had \u201cshattered\u201d a relatively benign market view of Brexit, said economists Robert Wood and Gilles Moec at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>Referring to the mood over the summer, they wrote in a research note: \u201cWe often heard the argument that Brexit risks were overblown, that article 50 might never be triggered, or that even if it was, Brexit would never really happen.\u201d</p> <p>Now, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws\">May\u2019s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of next March</a>, launching the formal process of leaving the EU, meant Brexit was \u201cgetting real faster than markets expected, and getting real in a potentially negative way: a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 looks more likely in our view,\u201d Wood and Moec added.</p> <p>The falling pound, inflationary pressures and blow to businesses\u2019 investment plans from the Brexit vote leave the Bank of England with a difficult balancing act. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Policymakers cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August</a> and hinted at another cut to follow before the end of the year. But after reports suggesting consumers and businesses have shrugged off the initial shock of the Brexit vote, that further reduction is in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cUntil the last couple of weeks, the monetary policy outlook had appeared clear cut, with the monetary policy committee giving a strong steer that it intended to loosen policy again before the end of the year. But since then the enduring strength of the incoming data and the further sharp depreciation of the pound have thrown a couple of spanners into the works,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin at the consultancy Oxford Economics.</p>",
  "<p>A long-billed, long-legged wader stands on the edge of the mud, waiting for the tide to recede so she can begin to feed. Nothing about her stands out: she isn\u2019t strikingly pied like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/a/avocet/index.aspx\">avocets</a>; she doesn\u2019t have the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/c/curlew/\">curlew</a>\u2019s impossibly long, curved bill; and she isn\u2019t flying around while yelling a frantic, urgent call like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/r/redshank/index.aspx\">redshanks</a>. </p> <p>Yet she has a far better story to tell than any of them. For she is a <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/bar-tailed-godwit/limosa-lapponica/\">bar-tailed godwit</a>: one of the greatest of all the bird world\u2019s global travellers. She has already flown here to the river Parrett, that muddy river flowing into the Bristol Channel, from her breeding grounds far to the north \u2013 somewhere on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss5/biome/tundra.html\">Arctic tundra</a> in Scandinavia or Northern Russia.</p> <p>Having stopped off to feed and refuel, she may then just keep on going: to Spain or Portugal, or even as far as West Africa. Like all migrants, she must make a carefully calculated trade off: choosing between the potentially more reliable food supply farther south, set against the dangers of going so far.</p> <p>Different populations of different wader species make different choices \u2013 some staying put, others flying thousands of miles \u2013 which explains why, when I visit a coastline almost anywhere in the world, I come across little flocks of globetrotting birds feeding along the seashore.</p> <p>But this particular godwit\u2019s travels, impressive though they are, pale into insignificance compared with <a href=\"http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/bar-tailed-godwit\">her cousins on the other side of the planet</a>. Back in 2007, another female bar-tailed godwit was fitted with a tracking device in New Zealand, enabling scientists to follow her journey for the first time.</p> <p>What happened next astonished even the most ardent students of bird migration. The bird \u2013 nicknamed \u201cE7\u201d \u2013 first returned to her breeding grounds in Alaska via the Yellow Sea in China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/22/wildlife-conservation\">Wading bird travels 7,000 miles nonstop to break flying record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In August she made the long journey back to New Zealand. But this time she did it non-stop, taking nine days to travel 11,700 kilometres \u2013 more than 7,000 miles \u2013 to her destination. This smashed all previous distance records held by birds, and was also the longest recorded journey without stopping to feed and refuel made by any living creature \u2013 so far, at least. </p> <p>Until this extraordinary discovery, we had always assumed that, like their counterparts here in Europe, Alaskan godwits migrated along the coasts of Asia before island-hopping across the Pacific to New Zealand. Yet this one plucky little bird rewrote the textbooks, making us look at bird migration anew.</p> <p>The godwit on the river Parrett isn\u2019t the only migrant passing through my coastal patch on its way south. A constant stream of low-flying swallows skims the surface of the sea, while <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/whinchat\">whinchats</a> perch on hawthorn bushes and <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/w/wheatear/\">wheatears</a> flit along the shore, momentarily revealing their snow-white rump (the name comes from the Anglo-Saxon for \u201cwhite arse\u201d). </p> <p>This trio are definitely heading south of the Sahara, and while the bar-tailed godwit may join them, she could simply decide to stay put for the winter. Just across the river from here, the tidal lagoons at the new <a href=\"http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/steart-marshes/\">Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust nature reserve at Steart</a> are packed with molluscs and crustaceans. That\u2019s just what she needs to keep up her energy levels during the cold weather to come.<br></p>",
  "<p>Last week ministers began to take their first steps towards suspending the privacy rights of the nation\u2019s citizens. With little fanfare the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0045/en/17045en.pdf\" title=\"\">digital economy bill</a> began hearings in parliament and while the proposed legislation contains some measures to be welcomed \u2013 such as creating a legal right to minimum internet download speeds \u2013 the big unwelcome change is that the public\u2019s personal data will be shared across departments without specified safeguards. What vague measures have been outlined the information commissioner described as <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmpublic/digitaleconomy/memo/DEB36.pdf\" title=\"\">incoherent and inconsistent</a>. If the bill becomes law, it will matter not if the data was collected for one reason and used for another. Government departments will be able to pool data collected without having put in place robust privacy protections. Such an approach invites public sector bodies to mimic the data free-for-all that currently exists in the private sector. We are already halfway there. Last week it emerged that details of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/12/individual-childrens-details-passed-to-home-office-for-immigration-purposes\" title=\"\">individual children on the national pupil database in England and Wales were passed to the Home Office for immigration purposes</a> hours <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2016-10-12b.1890.4\" title=\"\">after ministers said this was not happening</a>.</p> <p>The thinking is that for all the hand-wringing over the prospect of a too-powerful state limiting civil liberties, more lives are blighted by the erosion of authority than by its extension. So the government points to success in mapping troubled families and says data sharing helps work out \u201cwarm home\u201d discounts for those in fuel poverty. Yet the bill is a symptom of a dangerously illiberal creed. There is an idea that data science will transform governance: that by harvesting and interrogating vast amounts of citizens\u2019 personal data, policymakers can pinpoint solutions to society\u2019s problems. It won\u2019t. Instead big data politics will furnish an overweening state with arguments to justify ideological choices. Data science is often just information alchemy. Look at what happened when the data suggested that a single mother in York had been claiming benefits fraudulently because she had been cohabiting with Joseph Rowntree, the Quaker philanthropist who died in 1925. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/mother-hit-by-benefits-blunder-v57fz2m0k\" title=\"\">She lived in a property provided by the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust, now a housing association.</a> With her welfare cut, she was forced to rely on a foodbank and told that she\u2019d need to appeal. As Cardinal Richelieu realised long ago, \u201cif you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him\u201d.</p> <p>In an age of deserving and undeserving citizens, judgments will have to made over the division of resources. But should virtue be ascribed by politicians who can build policies by deciding how much privacy the public is entitled to? What if local councils could decide to revoke a residential parking permit because they can access your driving record? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b31b8a0-2994-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89\" title=\"\">Where\u2019s the debate over Home Office plans to build up a picture of personal behaviour</a> by running automated algorithms on bulk data sets \u2013 which could include passport records and police records? In this new battleground who is fighting for the interests of privacy in the democratic system? Since ministers have not spelt out data safeguards no one can give the public any&#xa0;answers.</p> <p>What we are heading towards is Facebook government. Ministers have decided to change the default settings on public privacy controls so that individuals\u2019 personal information would be shared, reflecting, they contest, a shift in society towards greater openness. They are beholden to the idea that by capturing citizens\u2019 data they can reshape the state for the common good. In this world, voters are not consumers of public services, they are inputs. But personal data is the property of the citizen. It is not for government to decide whether it can be repurposed without informed consent \u2013 a lesson apparently unheeded despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/06/nhs-to-scrap-single-database-of-patients-medical-details\" title=\"\">debacle over abandoned plans to share medical records</a>. There is confusion over who can amass and manipulate data in the public and private sphere. Brexit complicates this, since we do not know whether the new <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">EU data protection regime</a> will be in place when the digital economy bill supposedly becomes law. Ministers say transparency and trust on public data will need to go hand in hand. This rings hollow. Whitehall does not even collect or analyse its performance in protecting information. <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/press-release/protecting-information-across-government/\" title=\"\">Last month the National Audit Office pointed out</a> 9,000 personal data breaches by departments. Ministers need to pause the bill and replace it with a better balance between the needs of government and the privacy of citizens.</p>",
  "<p>Brexit has been referred to as the biggest foreign policy issue facing Britain since accession to the European economic community in 1973. In many ways, this is true of&#xa0;Ireland too. As the process unfolds, one of the biggest challenges for Ireland is how we maintain a strong and close relationship with our UK friends and neighbours while remaining at the heart of the European Union. While we deeply regret the outcome of the UK referendum, Ireland remains, and will remain, a committed member of the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/huge-rise-in-britons-applying-for-irish-citizenship-after-brexit-vote\">Huge rise in Britons applying for Irish citizenship after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">referendum</a> I have engaged extensively with both my UK government counterparts and each of my foreign ministerial colleagues all across the EU. I\u2019ve spoken to the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, on several occasions, and I was pleased to welcome the secretary of state for exiting the EU, David Davis, to Dublin for discussions. Several other EU foreign ministers have also visited Dublin and last week, the EU commission\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/jean-claude-juncker-puts-michel-barnier-in-charge-brexit-talks\" title=\"\">Michel Barnier</a>, visited Dublin \u2013 the sixth capital he visited on his tour of 28. And Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Enda Kenny, has had extensive discussions with Theresa May, Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Donald Tusk and many others.</p> <p>In my discussions with EU colleagues, I have emphasised the importance of the Irish and Irish-British dimensions to Brexit for our citizens, our economy and trading links, our common travel area with the UK and, of course, Northern Ireland and its invisible border with the rest of the island. I\u2019ve also stressed the need for a strong EU, characterised by partnership, peace and prosperity. I have been heartened by the strong support across Europe for the peace process and the understanding about our special circumstances on the island.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of our key concerns about Brexit is any risk to the effective invisibility of the border between north and south</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Overall, we will be working for special arrangements that take account of Northern Ireland\u2019s unique circumstances. The process ahead is extremely complex and multi-layered. We are currently auditing and assessing the implications of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU across a range of sectors through dialogue between the north and south, between London and Dublin, through bodies such as the British Irish Council and with our EU partners. This in no way pre-empts the wider negotiations between the UK and the EU 27.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s relationship with Britain is unique in every possible way \u2013 politically, economically, culturally, legally and in terms of people-to-people links. One in four people in Britain can claim Irish heritage, while in the business world almost 60,000 UK company directors are Irish-born. The Dublin-London route is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_passenger_air_routes\" title=\"\">second busiest air route</a> in Europe. We trade over \u20ac1.2bn a week between us, and Ireland is the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1028937.shtml\" title=\"\">fifth largest trading partner</a>. We must do everything we can to protect these hard-won positive links.</p> <p>Northern Ireland is a core priority for Dublin in terms of the Brexit process. While the peace settlement is by now well-established, we can never afford to be complacent. Twice in the two years after I became foreign minister, I have spent long periods of time in Belfast participating in political talks. These ultimately led to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stormont-house-agreement\" title=\"\">Stormont House agreement</a> in December 2014 and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479116/A_Fresh_Start_-_The_Stormont_Agreement_and_Implementation_Plan_-_Final_Version_20_Nov_2015_for_PDF.pdf\" title=\"\">Fresh Start agreement</a> last November. I witnessed at first hand how the still delicate political stability in Northern Ireland can be shaken.</p> <p>The Good Friday agreement provides the framework for our engagement in Northern Ireland, and we have worked alongside the UK government and Northern Ireland\u2019s political leaders to stabilise the devolved institutions in Belfast and deliver important initiatives. Last month, honouring commitments under the Fresh Start agreement, James Brokenshire and I signed a treaty to establish an independent reporting commission to help tackle the legacy of paramilitarism which continues to plague some vulnerable communities in Northern Ireland. We want to see that scourge removed from people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>Brexit presents a substantial challenge to this remarkable but still incomplete progress. Across the UK as a whole, 52% of voters opted to leave the EU. However, in Northern Ireland, 56% voted to remain. The people of Northern Ireland are in a unique position both in the UK and the EU, entitled to define themselves as British, Irish, or both. Common British and Irish membership of the EU has been a fundamental element in the political context which allowed the peace process to move forward.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/ireland-to-set-up-rainy-day-fund-as-buffer-against-brexit-shock\">Ireland to set up 'rainy day fund' as buffer against Brexit shock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the UK leaves the EU, Northern Ireland will be the only region that shares a land border with another EU member state. One of our key concerns about Brexit is any risk to the effective invisibility of the border between north and south. The Northern Ireland executive and the Irish and UK governments have been unanimous in their view that we must maintain the openness of the border which is enjoyed today.</p> <p>The common travel area, where citizens of Britain and Ireland have enjoyed free movement in each other\u2019s countries since 1922, is highly valued on all sides. The reinstatement of any kind of hard border would also have obvious negative consequences for cross-border trade and economic activity. Equally serious would be the effect of resurrecting a potent symbol of division in a society emerging from conflict where many communities and groups are working hard to foster greater reconciliation, shared understanding and partnership.</p> <p>Future arrangements between the UK and Ireland, and between the Irish government and the Northern Ireland executive, will have to be placed in the wider framework negotiated between the UK and the 27 other EU members \u2013 including Ireland. The Irish government will work hard to make sure all sides are fully conscious of the need to work together to ensure the transformed Irish-UK relationship and the enormous achievements of the peace process are safeguarded for future generations.</p>",
  "<p><br>For Ireland, the move to Brexit brings two economic threats: clear short-term risks and huge uncertainty about the future. </p> <p>Above all, the problem in the next year or two will be volatility \u2013 in currency markets, confidence, trade and investment. Beyond that, who knows, though the rough rule for Ireland is the harder the Brexit, the worse the outcome.</p> <p>Government forecasters and private sector economists have crunched the numbers. The official GDP growth forecast for next year has been cut by half a point to 3.5%, though the sums were done before sterling\u2019s latest fall. The rough guide is that every 1% cut in UK growth hits Ireland by 0.3-0.4%. </p> <p>But all sides concede that the many uncertainties of Brexit could lead to more damage. A <a href=\"https://www.esri.ie/news/new-report-on-the-economic-consequences-of-brexit-for-ireland/\">landmark study</a> by the Economic and Social Research Institute last year warned that Brexit could reduce bilateral trade flows between Ireland and the UK by 20% or more in time. Looking at the island of Ireland, the ESRI pointed out that the Irish Republic was a more important market for Northern Ireland than vice versa.</p> <p>Beneath the numbers lurk the great uncertainties. What will Brexit mean for UK growth, a vital factor for Irish exporters? Can sterling fall much further? How will Britain\u2019s talks with the EU affect the terms on which Ireland trades with Britain and, perhaps most importantly, the common travel area that allows free movement of people? </p> <p>\u201cWords like \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 sound very hackneyed but in my career in business it is hard to imagine anything so pervasive and critical,\u201d said Feargal O\u2019Rourke, managing partner of advisory company PwC. \u201cAnd one of the key issues is that the scale of the uncertainty makes planning very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Standard economic models suggest a loss to Irish GDP of between one and three percentage points after a decade, depending on the new trading arrangements, according to Alan Ahearne, economics professor at NUI Galway. </p> <p>However, he warned that disruptions to trade, particularly from new regulations and any reinstatement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/10/idea-of-uk-border-controls-in-ireland-is-ridiculous-says-irish-mep-matt-carty\">the border on the island of Ireland</a>, were the kind of factors often underestimated by standard forecasts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/03/irish-economy-exporters-feel-chill-from-brexit-fall-in-sterling\">Irish exporters feel chill from Brexit fall in sterling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The immediate focus is sterling. If the pound heads for parity with the euro (it has fallen to about \u20ac1.10 from above \u20ac1.40 a year ago), a big challenge will become a crisis. Firms are already going bust, and Irish manufacturers exporting food to Britain are feeling the crunch.</p> <p>\u201cThe collapse in sterling is already being felt in the low-margin agri-food sector in particular,\u201d said Dermot O\u2019Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers. \u201cWith further downsides remaining for sterling, the pain is likely to worsen.\u201d</p> <p>And the fall in sterling has other immediate impacts. Shoppers are starting to cross the border again into Northern Ireland, particularly for big ticket items. Online sterling purchases by Irish shoppers are soaring. </p> <p>There are also repercussions in the other direction. One Belfast woman who booked her wedding reception in Donegal has seen the sterling cost rise from \u00a320,000 to \u00a323,000 in a couple of weeks. </p> <p>Northern Ireland faces a similarly glum outlook. Growth predictions have been slashed, with one forecaster cutting the outlook for next year to 0.5% growth, from 1.9%. The other big threat to the north\u2019s economy is the potential loss of EU subsidies, particularly in the farming sector but also in support investment. </p> <p>The second big economic question centres on trading arrangements after Brexit: will there be tariffs applied on trade between Britain and Ireland? This could be ruinous, particularly for farmers who rely on the UK market to sell their products.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28d5c18b3c830876b27806b40179d63b2fac0637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d5c18b3c830876b27806b40179d63b2fac0637/0_271_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Brexit campaigners at a mock customs hut in Carrickcarnon this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Brexit campaigners at a mock customs hut in Carrickcarnon this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the third factor is the most emotive. If a border is reinstated on the island of Ireland it will be seen as a step back in time to the days of the Troubles \u2013 and a massive blow to the economic and social relationship that has been built in recent years. There are an estimated 14m crossings of the border each year, a vital conduit for business, tourism and daily life \u2013 and for business supply chains.</p> <p>For the Republic there is also the wider issue of the future of the free travel area covering all of the UK, with Westminster tightening immigration controls. The UK labour market has traditionally acted as a destination for Irish emigrants, particularly at time of high unemployment. An estimated 400,000 people who were born in the Irish Republic are resident in the UK. </p> <p>Set against this, the upside looks thin. Yes, some businesses could migrate from the UK to Ireland, though Dublin looks unprepared for this, particularly in terms of available property. Ireland may also gain from foreign direct investment that would otherwise have gone to Britain. </p> <p>O\u2019Rourke of PWC believes EU companies could choose Ireland over the UK to avoid tariff barriers. Furthermore, companies could choose to manage more of their supply chains from the Republic, given the potential complications and costs of moving goods through the UK.</p> <p>There will be years of working out a new trade deal, and the uncertainties are unlikely to lift in the meantime.

We don\u2019t mind where they come from. We want someone who can come in, pick seasonal fruit or veg and go home. It\u2019s not an immigration issue. They come in, they go home again. We feel we need some form of visa scheme that allows us to bring in seasonal workers.\u201d</p> <p>There used to be such a system \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/seasonal-agricultural-workers-scheme-and-the-food-processing-sectors-based-scheme \">the seasonal agricultural workers scheme</a> (Saws), which for decades allowed workers from around the globe to work in the orchards and fields \u2013 but it was <a href=\"http:// https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257242/migrant-seasonal-workers.pdf\">scrapped by the Tory/Lib Dem coalition</a> in 2013. </p> <p> \u201cSaws was abolished because immigration had become too hot a potato,\u201d said Capper. \u201cThat scheme brought workers in and had a 98% return rate. It sent them home again.\u201d </p> <p>Capper argued that since 2013 the industry had become more reliant on seasonal workers coming from EU countries. \u201cThe industry has become a stepping stone for people to come, arrive and work in our industry then jump into other jobs. Arguably [scrapping Saws] exacerbated the immigration issue \u2013 an own goal.\u201d</p> <p>Capper, who is chair of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/horticulture-and-potatoes/hort-and-pots-news/meet-the-horticulture-and-potatoes-board/\">horticulture and potatoes board</a>, is often asked why British people do not want to pick apples. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pay,\u201d she said. \u201cA good picker may be earning \u00a38, \u00a39, \u00a315 an hour.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason British people don\u2019t do this work is that they are seasonal jobs in rural locations that are hard to get to. You work in all weathers, often outside. We live in a first-world developed economy with a society that has an aspiration to have jobs that are inside, in town, that are permanent, year-round and allow them to have a mortgage, have a rental contract. </p> <p>\u201cSeasonal work means you need to move from farm to farm. Those jobs require you to live very close to or on the farm. For us to put perfect fruit on supermarket shelves, we are often picking at odd times of day. </p> <p>\u201cYou have all sorts of cultural and social issues around why seasonal work doesn\u2019t suit the people that live in first-world developed economies.

  "<p>Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their epic migration from Canada to Mexico.

Two decades ago he and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">fellow Puerto Rican independence fighters</a> renounced violence and embraced peaceful political reform.

It is as though he is stuck in a time-warp, trapped for ever in the headstrong 1970s, a white-haired septuagenarian forced to dress up in floral shirt, flares and platform shoes dancing to Chic. The world, and L\u00f3pez Rivera with it, has moved on, but the US government continues to see him through the prism of a bygone age. </p> <p>Unless someone intervenes to release him, he will remain in captivity until 26 June 2023, five months after his 80th birthday. Fortunately for L\u00f3pez Rivera, there is such a person who holds the power of clemency: Barack Obama. As the US president prepares to quit the White House, he is drawing up his final pardon list, presenting the prisoner with a slender hope.</p> <p>Many prominent supporters are lobbying hard for the pardon. They make for an impressive list: Archbishop Desmond Tutu; the governor of Puerto Rico, <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/opinion/columnas/terrehauteindiana-columna-1868644/\">Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla</a>; the Hispanic caucus of the US Congress; former US president Jimmy Carter; Democratic presidential runner-up <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/05/18/bernie-sanders-vows-pardon-faln-terrorist/\">Bernie Sanders</a>; and the creator of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/Interstitial/?oasSitePage=elnuevodia.com/interstitial&amp;oasReturnPage=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">confronted Obama</a> about L\u00f3pez Rivera face to face during a recent White House visit. On 9 October thousands of supporters gathered outside the White House bearing placards of the prisoner and calling on Obama to set him free, their voices projected across the mansion\u2019s South Lawn in the hope that the president at work in the Oval Office might hear them and act accordingly.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With friends like that, isn\u2019t L\u00f3pez Rivera a shoo-in for release? Not according to the man himself, who remains cautious about his chances. \u201cI do not practise wishful thinking,\u201d he begins in perfect English, delivered with a strong Puerto Rican accent. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to read President Obama. The way he has been treated, the obstacles he has faced in the White House, makes him a little skittish about decisions.\u201d</p> <p>What a carefully weighted remark about something as visceral as his freedom. In the course of a two-hour phone conversation (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Penitentiary,_Terre_Haute\">federal prison in Terre Haute</a>, Indiana, having refused to allow the Guardian to visit him in person) it becomes clear that this is not artifice: the professorial tone is true to the man.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera says he draws some optimism from Obama\u2019s frequent expressions of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25250278\">admiration for Nelson Mandela</a>. \u201cHe embraced Mandela as a great man, he saw that what Mandela did was important throughout the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ddc06d448b2de372dd5ee68c69649d344063f7/0_73_801_802/499.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is no regret inside my heart\u2019 ...

Mandela served 27 years in South African prisons for leading an anti-colonialist liberation struggle that deployed selective violence as a political tool; L\u00f3pez Rivera has already served eight years longer, arguably for doing the same thing. Mandela <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/mandela-and-the-question-of-violence/282255/\">refused to renounce violence</a> from his prison cell; but L\u00f3pez Rivera did so, some 20 years ago.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera was born in 1943 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the north-west of Puerto Rico. His childhood was spent living in the constitutional limbo that has defined the island since it was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Neither a sovereign country, nor the 51st state of the union, Puerto Rico is caught betwixt and between. Its people are US citizens, hold US passports, and can be drafted into the US military as L\u00f3pez Rivera would soon discover. Yet when it comes to voting for the US president or a representative in the US Congress, a Puerto Rican is persona non grata. Quite rich, you might think, coming from a nation such as the US, which was founded upon the anti-colonial principle of no taxation without representation.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing we are good for is to be cannon fodder,\u201d L\u00f3pez Rivera says in a rare display of chagrin. </p> <p>Not that he had a clue about any of that when he was growing up in San Sebasti\u00e1n and Chicago, where his family moved when he was 14. He was just an ordinary kid for whom the concepts of self-determination or shrugging off the Yankee yoke were as alien as nuclear physics. \u201cBefore I got drafted I was a happy-go-lucky Puerto Rican. I enjoyed life. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to anything other than me.\u201d</p> <p>Then along came Vietnam. \u201cI arrived thinking we were bringing freedom to Vietnamese people but as soon as I hit the ground I realised that wasn\u2019t happening. We did sweeping operations lasting 30 days, getting villagers out of their homes, moving them off the rice paddies, body-searching them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6ee2197aacaa84df8412c45c149fb2e11ca3af/68_0_551_331/500.jpg\" alt=\"In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky ... a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In solitary he would spend all but two hours a week in his cell with no sight of the sky \u2026 a mural dedicated to L\u00f3pez Rivera in Puerto Rico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time he returned to Chicago a year later, sporting a Bronze Star for meritorious achievement, he says he had undergone a transformation. \u201cI felt an obligation to change, to look at life from a totally different perspective. Now I could see what colonialism did to people.\u201d</p> <p>He threw himself into community work among the Puerto Ricans of Chicago. That brought him into contact with the families of imprisoned nationalists and, without ever suspecting that he would one day join their ranks, he was sucked into the movement and eventually became a member of the clandestine <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/FALN\">Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional</a>.</p> <p>As the name suggested, the FALN believed armed force was justified as a means to an end. Between its foundation in 1974 and its effective demise in 1983 as a result of mass arrests, the FALN was said by prosecutors to have carried out about 140 bombings on military bases, government offices and financial buildings across the US, especially in Chicago and New York. Targets were chosen for being symbols of \u201cYankee imperialism\u201d, such as oil companies with offshore rigs in Puerto Rican waters.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera insists that the focus was always on bricks and mortar, not people. \u201cFor me human life is sacred. We called it \u2018armed propaganda\u2019 \u2013 using targets to draw attention to our struggle.\u201d</p> <p>That may have been the case, but the results were, to put it politely, inconsistent. In 1975 the group claimed responsibility for a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/puerto-rican-terrorists-plant-bomb-tavern-1975-article-1.2484977\">bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern</a> in Lower Manhattan, the scene of George Washington\u2019s farewell to troops after the American revolution. The attack killed four people and injured more than 50. Two years later an employee at the Mobil building in New York was killed by another FALN device.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Rivera has denied involvement with these fatal attacks. But when I asked him if he ever committed acts of armed force such as planting a bomb, he replied: \u201cI cannot comment on that.\u201d Interestingly, he still claims justification for violence under international law, using the present tense: \u201cI believe we were adhering to international law that says that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that colonial people have a right to achieve self-determination by any means, including force. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f4e4c3ef846b0e78866da991667e19dc4ac2be4/7_0_3249_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene after the FALN bomb exploded at the Fraunces Tavernin Lower Manhattan, on 24 January 1975.

By 1990, the movement was already changing with the times. \u201cWe realised other tactics to armed force could be more effective, mobilising people through peaceful campaigning. Morally, also, we came to see that we had to lead by example, that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do. You cannot get a better world by being unjust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask him if he would pose a threat to the public were Obama to set him free, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could be a threat. We have transcended violence \u2013 it\u2019s crucial for people to understand, we\u2019re not advocating anything that would be a threat to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He was picked up in 1981 at a traffic stop in Chicago and charged with seditious conspiracy \u2013 a very rare count of plotting against the US state that was first used after the civil war against southern refuseniks and then applied to anarchists and socialists before being turned against Puerto Rican <em>independistas </em>like himself. </p> <p>At trial, prosecutors presented no evidence that tied him to any deaths or injuries, or even specific attacks. For his part, he and his comrades refused to recognise the judicial process, calling himself a prisoner of war, offering no defence and declining even to attend the trial. He still describes seditious conspiracy as an \u201cimpossible crime\u201d. He told me: \u201cHow can a Puerto Rican be seditious towards the US state when we never had any part in electing a US government?\u201d</p> <p>He was sentenced to 55 years. By contrast, as his lawyer Jan Susler has pointed out, the average federal sentence for murder in 1981 was 10.3 years. Later, his sentence was extended to 70 years when, he insists, he was framed by agents provocateurs planted in his cell who cooked up a plot to escape and then implicated him in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a24b14cc9a0a6848842f2825916138513ef5872/34_0_1980_1188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00f3pez Rivera was one of two dozen independistas in prison.

Not for L\u00f3pez Rivera. He recounts his time in prison with verve bordering on enthusiasm. Yes, he has faced \u201cterrible times\u201d, been labelled a terrorist by prison guards, called a \u201cspic\u201d and worse. But he has always made use of his life of incarceration, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got to prison I made myself a promise: they can lock me up, but the time I spend in prison is my time. I use it to my own advantage, for my own goals. From the moment I get up to the moment I go to bed, I keep active.\u201d</p> <p>That means rising at 4am to an exercise regime of 40 minutes of stretching, pull- and push-ups, sidewinders and upper body routines. He reads a lot. Currently, he\u2019s reading Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism, and before that he devoured the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer\u2019s book on billionaire rightwing donors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/dark-money-review-nazi-oil-the-koch-brothers-and-a-rightwing-revolution\">Dark Money</a>.</p> <p>He teaches other inmates to read and write or speak Spanish. He also likes to paint as a way of \u201ctaking myself out of prison into the outside world\u201d. He uses as his template photographs of landscapes or seascapes that he tears from magazines, making up for his lack of access to the natural world.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/cuba-us-thaw-fugitives-william-morales\">Cuba-US thaw brings fate of cold war-era fugitives on the island into focus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He caught the painting bug after the alleged escape plot when he was put into solitary confinement in two of the toughest supermax prisons in the US: Marion, Illinois, and Florence, Colorado. He would spend all but two hours a week in his concrete cell with no sight of the sky. \u201cLittle by little, colours start to fade. Your eyes begin to change how you see things. You see less colour; everything blurs into the yellow-grey of the cell walls.\u201d</p> <p>So he turned to painting as a way to bring colour back into his life. That\u2019s when he rediscovered his passion for the monarch butterfly, reproducing pictures of the insects as a reflection on their migration. \u201cI had to be strong. I always thought they were not going to destroy me, that was not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Though he is now out of solitary he has still had to deal with social deprivation. At its peak, he was one of two dozen <em>independistas </em>in federal prisons; now he is the last one. Over the years, he has seen his comrades walk free, their ranks gradually depleted, until in 2010 he became the only one left. He is sanguine about that. \u201cI have never felt abandoned or lonely. There is no regret inside my heart.\u201d</p> <p>To have no regret about his predicament is all the more extraordinary in that he could have been released in 2009. In August 1999, Bill Clinton did what L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s supporters are now urging Obama to do: he used his final days in office to grant <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces2000/stories/faln091199.htm\">a presidential pardon to 11 Puerto Rican independence fighters</a>. L\u00f3pez Rivera was offered a lesser deal that would have seen him released after a decade, but he turned it down, because he says he had no faith in the US government sticking to its side of the bargain and he was unhappy about a couple of his fellow fighters being offered no commutation at all. \u201cWhen I was in Vietnam I never left anyone behind. That\u2019s not my practice, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de084da1ab7a5db52da7ffe9313f7db6f9f2e26d/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How can an insect so small go so far?\u2019 ... a monarch butterfly.

I believe in principles. For me, the decision was the one I had to make.\u201d</p> <p>So what now is the likelihood that Obama will follow in Clinton\u2019s footsteps and finally fling open the cell doors? One factor in Obama\u2019s calculation might be that Clinton\u2019s round of pardons sparked a fireball of opposition in Congress and the media. The \u201cClinton terror pardons\u201d remain a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120277819085260827\">bugbear</a> <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/06/04/still-blocking-the-truth/\">for the right</a> to this day, even though the vitriol overlooks one awkward fact about the releases: that not a single criminal act has been committed by any of the 11 former FALN militants in the 16 years that they have been out.</p> <p>The Clinton backlash perhaps explains Obama\u2019s apparent ambivalence on the matter. He is reported to have told Lin-Manuel Miranda that L\u00f3pez Rivera\u2019s clemency petition was <a href=\"http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/politica/nota/obamaatiendepedidodelinmanuelsobreoscarlopez-2175040/\">\u201con his desk\u201d.</a> But Congress member Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and has been a leading proponent of a pardon, has said that when he asked Obama about the account the president firmly <a href=\"http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/09/05/why-obama-lied-to-lin-manuel-miranda-an-interview-with-puerto-rican-congressman-luis-gutierrez-calling-to-demonstrate/\">disputed it</a> and gave a bland statement that \u201cprocedures must be followed\u201d.</p> <p>That sounds less than promising for the Mandela of Puerto Rico. But L\u00f3pez Rivera responds to the mixed messages emanating from the White House with trademark composure. \u201cI have no choice but to be optimistic,\u201d he says, as the Terre Haute guards call time on our conversation. \u201cHope, that is one thing we can never lose.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Italians often come into <a href=\"http://www.bar-termini.com/\">Bar Termini</a>, on the eastern fringes of London\u2019s Soho, and say that it reminds them of home. It\u2019s a compliment, of course, but sometimes the owners \u2013 Tony Conigliaro and Marco Arrigo \u2013 have to bite their tongues. \u201cI feel like saying, \u2018Where in Italy? Show me!\u2019\u201d laughs Arrigo. \u201cTermini is more Italian than an Italian could come up with. We\u2019re the only place in the world doing it this way.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true: OFM\u2019s Best Place to Drink for 2016 might look and feel like that timeless Italian bar you remember from your Roman holiday, but everything about the experience is considered and perfected. When you squeeze into the tiny room with just 25 seats, a white-suited bar person will offer you a menu. There are three coffees (espresso, bianco and latte) and a pair of hot chocolates; no skimmed milk, no takeaways, no decaf. On a short cocktail list, it\u2019s hard to look beyond the four house negronis. Arrigo, who oversees the coffee side, and Conigliaro, the cocktail alchemist, admit that Bar Termini is \u201canti-choice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about our nostalgic, exaggerated memories of Italy that only second-generation Italians have,\u201d explains Conigliaro. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily that we wanted a 100% accurate version of Italy, but we wanted people to look around and feel they had been transported somewhere.\u201d Arrigo adds, \u201cIt\u2019s nice that we can please the Italians, because they are the hardest buggers to please.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when coffee shops and cocktail bars are depressingly identikit, Bar Termini, an all-day operation that opened in late 2014, stands out. There\u2019s no latte art; instead the milk \u2013 a blend of full-fat and UHT, to give it that particular flavour of Italy \u2013 arrives in your cup like an avalanche dump, so dense you can almost chew it. Arrigo, whose other job is head of quality for Illy, describes the coffee machine as \u201cthe Frankenstein\u201d: it\u2019s a Faema body with sawn-off La Marzocco handles that produces a soft, strong, triple-shot espresso through long extraction.</p> <p>The cocktails arrive daily pre-made from Conigliaro\u2019s Drink Factory, a lab in east London that also supplies 69 Colebrooke Row and the Zetter group of hotels and restaurants. \u201cIt looks like a blood bank: 40 litres of negroni in sous-vide bags,\u201d he says. Conigliaro serves the negronis \u201cup\u201d, without ice, because he finds that ice dilutes the drink, makes it more bitter and \u201cthey just generally get soggy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone turned round and said, \u2018Tony, you\u2019ve actually iPhone 6\u2019d the negroni,\u2019\u201d Conigliaro recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand but he went on, \u2018When you look at the iPhone 6 next to the iPhone 5, you don\u2019t want the iPhone 5 any more, because it makes it look obsolete, a bit dated.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Conigliaro and Arrigo\u2019s dream is to open in Italy: \u201cThe more we say it the more it might happen,\u201d says Arrigo. But until then, they will continue bringing a hyper-real slice of the country to Old Compton Street. \u201cMy favourite thing about Termini is the \u00a31 espresso we serve at the bar,\u201d says Conigliaro. \u201cLocals come in and they drop that pound on the counter. They are not buying a coffee, they are buying a culture.\u201d</p> <p><em>7 Old Compton St, London W1D 5JE</em></p>",
  "<p>Devastating hurricane? More than 1,000 lives lost? It must be climate change! Almost inevitably, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew</a>\u2019s recent rampage across the Caribbean and south-eastern US has been fingered by some as a backlash of global warming driven by humanity\u2019s polluting activities, but does this really stack up?</p> <p>The short answer is no. Blame for a single storm cannot be laid at climate change\u2019s door, as reinforced by the bigger picture. The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary, and the last few seasons have actually been very tame. The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930. This, in turn, is no big deal as there is great year-on-year variability in the level of hurricane activity, which responds to various natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, as well as the progressive warming of the oceans as climate change bites harder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/10/un-haiti-aid-hurricane-matthew\">Hurricane Matthew's devastation in Haiti forces UN to call for $120m in aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current consensus holds that while a warmer world will not necessarily mean more hurricanes, it will see a rise in the frequency of the most powerful, and therefore more destructive, variety. This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane scientist at MIT, who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come.</p> <p>Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves, with researchers, on occasion, even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences. At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s. Now, the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate. For many, the bottom line is the sea surface temperature, which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification. Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record, so it should not be a surprise. As Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that we\u2019ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres [western and eastern] within the last year.\u201d As the Atlantic continues to heat up, the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms, so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century.</p> <p>As with hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world. Storm numbers may not rise, but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems, which tend to be the most destructive. An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered, bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds. The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller, but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes, although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere.</p> <p>Tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes and mid-latitude storms \u2013 along with heatwaves and floods \u2013 are widely regarded as climate change\u2019s shock troops; forecast to accelerate the destruction, loss of life and financial pain as planet Earth continues to heat up. It would be wrong to imagine, however, that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An earthquake fault that is ready to go is like a coiled spring \u2013 all that is needed is the pressure of a handshake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The atmosphere is far from isolated and interacts with other elements of the so-called \u201cEarth system\u201d, such as the oceans, ice caps and even the ground beneath our feet, in complex and often unexpected ways capable of making our world more dangerous. We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms, building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive. Similarly, it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps, thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. But, more extraordinarily, the thin layer of gases that hosts the weather and fosters global warming really does interact with the solid Earth \u2013 the so-called geosphere \u2014 in such a way as to make climate change an even bigger threat.</p> <p>This relationship is marvellously illustrated by a piece of research published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7248/full/nature08042.html\"><em>Nature</em> in 2009</a> by Chi-Ching Liu of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Taipei\u2019s Academia Sinica. In the paper, Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island. Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain. This may sound far fetched, but an earthquake fault that is primed and ready to go is like a coiled spring, and as geophysicist John McCloskey of the University of Ulster is fond of pointing out, all that is needed to set it off is \u2013 quite literally \u2013 \u201cthe pressure of a handshake\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps even more astonishingly, Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves, repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large, destructive earthquakes. This might explain, the researchers say, why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, in the vicinity of Taiwan, has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan.</p> <p>In a similar vein, it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones, leading to severe flooding, may also be linked to earthquakes. The University of Miami\u2019s Shimon Wdowinski has noticed that in some parts of the tropics \u2013 Taiwan included \u2013 large earthquakes have a tendency to follow exceptionally wet hurricanes or typhoons, most notably the devastating quake that took up to 220,000 lives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/16/the-haiti-earthquake-five-years-on-then-and-now\">Haiti in 2010</a>. It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes, but Wdowinski has another explanation. He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below, allowing it to move more easily.</p> <p>It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal-earthquake-2015\">2015 Nepal earthquake</a> took close to 9,000 lives, and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high. During the summer monsoon season, prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain, immediately to the south of the mountain range, which then slowly drains away over the next few months. This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity, which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/48xty\"                        data-video-id=\"2284464\"            data-video-name=\"Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Effect International\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456562623\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10317338&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/04/29/150429NepalDrone_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/apr/29/nepal-earthquake-drone-footage-shows-devastation-ancient-town-bhaktapur-video\">Nepal earthquake: drone footage shows devastation in ancient town of Bhaktapur</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>And it isn\u2019t only earthquake faults that today\u2019s storms and torrential rains are capable of shaking up. Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, heavy rains have been implicated in triggering eruptions of the active lava dome that dominates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/montserrat-volcano-british-territory-geothermal-energy-tourism-sand-mining\">Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano</a>. Stranger still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/alaska-volcano-eruption-less-intense-more-flight-cancellations\">Alaska\u2019s Pavlof volcano</a> appears to respond not to wind or rain, but to tiny seasonal changes in sea level. The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter, when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres. This is enough to bend the crust beneath the volcano, allowing magma to be squeezed out, according to geophysicist Steve McNutt of the University of South Florida, \u201clike toothpaste out of a tube\u201d.</p> <p>If today\u2019s weather can bring forth earthquakes and magma from the Earth\u2019s crust, it doesn\u2019t take much to imagine how the solid Earth is likely to respond to the large-scale environmental adjustments that accompany rapid climate change. In fact, we don\u2019t have to imagine at all. The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade, melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bottom line is that as climate change tightens its grip, we must be prepared to expect the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These huge changes triggered geological mayhem. As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished, the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia, spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes. Quakes of this scale are taken for granted today around the Pacific Ocean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, but they are completely out of place in Santa\u2019s Lapland. Across the Norwegian Sea, in Iceland, the volcanoes long buried beneath a kilometre of ice were also rejuvenated as the suffocating ice load melted away, prompting a \u201cvolcano storm\u201d about 12,000 years ago that saw the level of activity increase by up to 50 times.</p> <p>Now, global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times. It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more. In southern Alaska, which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover, the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity. In high mountain ranges across the world from the Caucasus in the north to New Zealand\u2019s southern Alps, longer and more intense heatwaves are melting the ice and thawing the permafrost that keeps mountain faces intact, leading to a rise in major landslides.</p> <p>Does this all mean that we are in for a more geologically active future as well as a hotter and meteorologically more violent one? Well, no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As always, these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions. Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go, however, climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway.</p> <p>As the world continues to heat up, any geological response is likely to be most obvious where climate change is driving the biggest environmental changes \u2013 for example, in areas where ice and permafrost are vanishing fast, or in coastal regions where rising sea levels will play an increasing role. Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers. Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland.

He says that \u201cclimate change is driving rapid melting of ice on many volcanoes worldwide, triggering unloading as ice is removed. As well as encouraging magma to rise to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity, removal of ice can also destabilise steep volcano flanks, making hazardous landslides more likely.\u201d</p> <p>The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes. Christian Huggel of the University of Zurich has warned that \u201cin densely populated and developed regions such as the European Alps, serious consequences have to be considered from [future] large slope failures\u201d.</p> <p>Looking ahead, one of the key places to watch will be Greenland, where recent findings by a research team led by Shfaqat Khan of Denmark\u2019s Technical University reveal a staggering loss of 272bn tonnes of ice a year over the last decade. GPS measurements show that, like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age, Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load. Andrea Hampel of the University of Hannover\u2019s Geological Institute, who with colleagues has been studying this behaviour, is concerned that \u201cfuture ice loss may trigger earthquakes of intermediate to large magnitude if the crust underneath the modern ice cap contains faults prone to failure\u201d.</p> <p>More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal, but this could have far wider ramifications. About 8,200 years ago, an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia, triggered the Storegga Slide; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic. Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland, and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea.</p> <p>The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped, so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown. Dave Tappin, a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey, points out that one large, undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland, but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga. Nonetheless, the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip, we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews. However, when it comes to the manifold hazardous by-blows of an overheating planet, and especially those involving the ground we stand on, we must also be prepared to expect the unexpected.</p> <p><em>Bill McGuire is professor emeritus in geophysical and climate hazards at UCL.

  "<p>Florida might need to consider redesigning its license plates. The state\u2019s plates feature a pair of ripe oranges above the famous \u201cSunshine State\u201d slogan, but the region is in the midst of the worst orange harvest crisis since records began in 1913 \u2013 and prices are soaring.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/rude-awakening-as-price-of-coffee-and-orange-juice-shoots-up-20\">Rude awakening as price of coffee and orange juice shoots up 20%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The state\u2019s orange trees, which are mostly used to produce juice, have been devastated by disease and hurricanes, causing harvest totals to fall for five successive seasons. The US Department of Agriculture this week predicted that the 2016 harvest would amount to just 70m boxes of oranges, a 14% drop on last year and a huge decline from bountiful days at the turn of this century when more than 230m boxes, each containing 90lb of fruit, were produced each year.<br></p> <p>The steep drop in production has led orange juice futures prices to nearly double in 13 months, pushing producers to reduce the size of cartons and make more drinks that blend orange with other juices, in order to avoid shocking consumers with too big a price increase at the checkout. Orange juice futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) rose from $1.03 a pound in September 2015 to $2.05 last week. Some analysts predict that the price could reach $2.20 by the end of the year.</p> <p>The orange crop devastation began in 2005 when a bacterium that causes huanglongbing \u2013 better known as citrus greening or HLB disease \u2013 was found in southern Florida. Since then, the Asian citrus psyllid, a tiny flying insect which transmits the disease, has been blown across Florida by various hurricanes, which also brought down orange trees.</p> <p>Farmers have spent more than $100m on research into ways to combat the disease, but so far scientists are stumped. </p> <p>\u201cFarmers are giving up on oranges altogether,\u201d said Judith Ganes, president of the commodities research firm J Ganes Consulting. \u201cNormally after a freeze or a hurricane [which both kill lots of trees], the growers would replant 100% of their plants.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut the disease has been spread all over by hurricanes, and made it totally uncontrollable. Farmers are giving up and turning to other crops or turning land over to housing.\u201d</p> <p>Ganes said the disease, which causes fruit to drop prematurely and eventually kills the trees, was \u201ceffectively like the trees having cancer with very low survival rates\u201d. Last month, the US agriculture department said that in the most recent season, almost a third of Florida\u2019s orange crop fell from the trees before it could be harvested \u2013 compared with just 7% five years ago.</p> <p>Ganes said prices had been surging as both Florida <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/rude-awakening-as-price-of-coffee-and-orange-juice-shoots-up-20\">and S\u00e3o Paulo state in Brazil</a>, the world\u2019s other big source of orange juice, both suffered from HLB disease. </p> <p>As the wholesale price has risen, Ganes said, orange juice companies such as Pepsi\u2019s Tropicana and Coca-Cola\u2019s Minute Maid have had to get more creative with how they sell juice to consumers. </p> <p>\u201cTo get round the price rise, they are making the cartons smaller or blending orange with other fruits or water,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Andrew Meadows of Florida Citrus Mutual, a cooperative that represents many of the 62,000 people employed in the state\u2019s citrus industry, said there was no denying oranges were in crisis but the state\u2019s farmers were not giving up yet.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through things like this before. We\u2019re not packing up and giving up on the industry,\u201d he said on the phone from the organisation\u2019s offices on Orange Street in Lakeland, a town in Polk County in the heart of the state\u2019s orange groves. </p> <p>Consumers have, so far, been saved from big price increases in supermarkets because as well as decreasing carton sizes, consumers are downing less breakfast OJ than previous generations \u2013 which means demand is also in decline. </p> <p>John Michalik, a beverages expert at the Canadian division of the market research group Global Data, said orange juice demand had been decreasing for more than a decade as consumers skip proper breakfasts and worry about the juice\u2019s high sugar content. </p> <p>\u201cUS consumers have it in their mind that orange juice is high in sugar, which it is, but it\u2019s natural sugars that don\u2019t contribute to obesity,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are not having the full breakfast at home like they used to. Now almost all breakfasts are a coffee and sandwich or snack on the go.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2016 to correct the figure for the orange harvest at the turn of the century. It was 230m boxes, not 23m.</p>",

A spoonful of sugar may help the medicine go down, but it probably screws up the placebo effect. Who knows how crucial those feelings of sacrifice, self-denial and moral superiority (lost for ever if Taste Buddy turned everything delicious) actually are to the health-enhancing powers of a balanced diet. In a carefully conducted study, it could probably be measured. But that sounds rather elitist, doesn\u2019t it? Measuring things with cold objectivity, as if that can ever matter as much as a sincere conviction of the&#xa0;heart.</p> <p>If you think that\u2019s all a bit touchy-feely, or tasty-thinky, you may be surprised to learn it\u2019s an approach Theresa May is very keen on. Last week the <em>Times </em>reported that the Home Office was concealing a report it had commissioned into the number of foreign students who break the terms of their visas and remain in Britain illicitly after their courses have finished. The number the report had come up with was about 1,500 annually, rather than the tens of thousands that had previously been estimated and generally bandied about. That was not what the Home Office, or the prime minister, wanted to hear.</p> <p>Why not? It\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it? Well not if you\u2019ve just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">cracked down on the admission of foreigners to British universities</a>, with potentially disastrous consequences for the latter\u2019s funding. The notion that this drastic policy might have almost no effect on reducing net immigration was extremely unwelcome and, the government clearly felt, best kept quiet.</p> <p>Particularly as, among likely Tory voters, there\u2019s a broad perception that foreign students stay here and scrounge. Many people feel that feckless young foreigners are dragging us down and the government has come up with a harsh&#xa0;little policy to address that. Why let the fact that it\u2019s not true get in the way?</p> <p>Surely, Theresa May must think, it\u2019s not the business of government to start telling the public it\u2019s wrong. In an increasingly virtual world, feelings are as valid as facts. Let\u2019s focus on what people perceive to be the case and concentrate on adding to that a perception that something is being done about it. That\u2019s efficient democratic accountability for post-truth Britain.</p> <p>No need to contradict people about what they reckon is going on, denying&#xa0;problems they believe exist and citing others they were previously untroubled by. Policy doesn\u2019t need to reflect reality any more than the currency needs to be&#xa0;backed by gold. Just listen to their fears, confirm them and then&#xa0;use them to make the government seem vital. People will swallow anything if you control how it tastes.</p>",

  "<p>The winner of our Young Chef of the Year Award does not do doubt. Dan Smith always knew that the professional kitchen was where he needed to be, from the moment he set foot in one aged 15. \u201cI just loved being part of a team.

Plus, he\u2019s already been in the business for eight years. Aged 15, he worked in a local restaurant in his home town of St Albans. At 16, he left school for the full-time course at Westminster Kingsway College, but worked nights in another local restaurant \u201cfor beer money\u201d. He cites his mother as a massive influence. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just do the same old dishes every night. There was something different on the table every night.\u201d Plus his parents were able to indulge his interests. He celebrated his 17th birthday with a trip to the Fat Duck. For his 18th it was back to Bray and the Waterside Inn.</p> <p>After a working trip around Australia with his chef girlfriend, whom he met at Westminster, Smith returned to London for a brief stint working with Jason Atherton. He arrived at the Clove Club three years ago, six months into its life. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much grown up with this restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s ingredient-driven. The food is complex but the place is informal.\u201d And it\u2019s big on skills: they don\u2019t just make their own bread. They cure their own meats, butcher their own animals, churn their own butter and temper their own chocolate.</p> <p>For his part, McHale says that he realised his young employee was the real thing during a trip to cook in Mexico City. \u201cHe was just on it. Frankly, he could have done the whole event without me being there.\u201d And so to the inevitable question. What\u2019s the plan? \u201cI want my own place,\u201d Smith says. \u201cA similar style of food to this but more of a pub setting. I\u2019d like to be as close to self-sufficient as possible, growing our own ingredients.\u201d As to employees, he\u2019s not going to have a problem. \u201cI\u2019ve already told him I\u2019ll come and work with him,\u201d says Partridge with a grin.

We don\u2019t need you any more. We think we can do without you now, OK?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think you can do without us. That\u2019s the thing. But then you get up and you go to work and you try to help British people get better.\u201d</p> <p>Masood and Karamountzos are telling me this in the tiny gap between their morning clinics and their afternoon surgeries. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely chaos this morning, I have to be honest,\u201d says Masood when he greets me. \u201cThe clinic is massively overbooked. But this is what always happens. And you spend 10 minutes more with one patient and there\u2019s a massive knock-on effect and this happens every week, unfortunately, and I\u2019ve got to rush upstairs because I\u2019ve got four patients that need surgery this afternoon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/jeremy-hunt-promises-to-end-nhs-reliance-on-overseas-doctors-after-brexit\">Hunt promises to end NHS reliance on overseas doctors after Britain leaves EU</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a familiar story to everyone who\u2019s ever used the NHS. But what\u2019s new is the toxic language of immigration coming up against the day-to-day reality of the NHS. This does feel new and ugly and unwelcome \u2013 and, for the 101,000 doctors born overseas who work in Britain, and the 140,000 nurses, and the 64 million of us who depend upon them, it\u2019s a depressing new departure.</p> <p>Until now, the NHS has been a place apart from what happens politically. It is an institution, something so fundamental to our sense of Britishness that it has somehow managed to resist the xenophobic tide that has become such a feature of British public life. It is something that survey after survey tells us we hold precious; that touches every person in the country, in the most personal, intimate way. And the whole fabric of its continued existence relies on immigration.</p> <p>Roberta Bivins, a professor at Warwick University who is undertaking a major project to map the cultural history of the NHS, tells me that although the NHS has been leveraged as capital and ammunition by politicians since its very inception, there is something new at work. \u201cWe expect the NHS to be above all that. It really does feel like a loss of innocence to have something that is a symbol of British tolerance and cosmopolitanism and egalitarianism dragged through the mud in this way. It is truly shocking.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS is one of the unique things that unites us as a nation, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental part of British identity. It\u2019s been something that has represented how much we believe in equality. What I\u2019ve found is that the NHS is constantly framed as the space that proves that Britain is a tolerant nation. Where racial and class and ethnic barriers are overturned. Where you can go and expect Britain to be at its best. Your doctor may have come from anywhere, and you will be treated the same as anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>And that is still true. \u201cI don\u2019t see people and think, \u2018You\u2019re British. You\u2019re Afro-Caribbean. You\u2019re whatever,\u2019\u201d Karamountzos tells me. \u201cFor me, a patient is a patient. It doesn\u2019t make any difference to me. Patients are patients and doctors are doctors. This is what counts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bdd16d4f0a091ba57133e713b5e5b7323641ad4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bdd16d4f0a091ba57133e713b5e5b7323641ad4/43_27_1188_713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the University Hospital of South Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the University Hospital of South Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @uhsmnews via twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And for at least 40 years it\u2019s been where the differences between us have been erased. \u201cThe NHS would never have survived the pent-up demand from the interwar years had it not been able to import staff from Africa and the former colonies,\u201d says Bivins. \u201cThat has always been the price of universal access, and it has been enormously benefiting to British society.</p> <p>\u201cEven by 1968, 46% of all doctors below consultant came from abroad, and 30% of all nurses.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s more, for much of the UK, she says, it was the first place where middle Britain came across multiculturalism. Part of Bivins\u2019s project is a \u201cpeople\u2019s history of the NHS\u201d, and as such she\u2019s been gathering stories, \u201ctalking to lots and lots of people, and for many, especially older people, they\u2019ll say it was the first time they met a black man or so on. It was where middle Britain met migrant Britain, and in a totally non-negotiable way. It\u2019s the one place where you\u2019d be mixing with people who are not like you, whether in terms of class or ethnicity \u2013 and who you\u2019ll be dependent on during some of the most intimate and important moments in your life.\u201d</p> <p>It was the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic games, she says, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\">Danny Boyle\u2019s great visual poem to the NHS</a>, that made them start thinking about the central role the NHS plays in Britain\u2019s cultural life. \u201cAnd what is astonishing is how much the attitudes and rhetoric have shifted since then. It\u2019s been quite amazing \u2013 and depressing \u2013 how that has happened in just four years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/boris-johnson-nhs-extra-funds-after-brexit-andrew-marr-lansley\">Boris Johnson says NHS will get substantial extra funds after Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boyle\u2019s co-writer for the ceremony was Frank Cottrell Boyce, who tells me that the section on the NHS was \u201cDanny\u2019s passion\u201d. He wanted the ceremony to be emotional. \u201cThe NHS is where British people are born and where they die\u2026 It\u2019s a huge unifying force in British social life and the point of entry for thousands of migrants.\u201d Boyle \u201creally put himself on the line for it \u2013 threatening to leave when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/jeremy-hunt-nhs-tribute-homeopathy\">suggested cutting it</a>\u201d.</p> <p>By \u201cthey\u201d he means the government, and it turns out there\u2019s a thread here. The culture secretary at the time? Jeremy Hunt.</p> <p>The BMA \u2013 which represents 170,000 doctors \u2013 knew nothing of the proposals before Hunt\u2019s party conference speech was made. They were not consulted. The head of the Royal College of Physicians, Jane Dacre, points out to me that 40% of new consultant posts are already not being filled. At UCL, Deborah Gill says that while they welcome lifting the cap on the number of medical students they\u2019re allowed to admit, they\u2019ve no idea how it will be funded, if there will be enough foundation placements, or why it has anything to do with foreign doctors \u201ccoming over here, as they do, curing our patients and paying their taxes\u201d.</p> <p>Nicola Strickland, head of the Royal College of Radiologists, tells me she believes the situation to be desperate and that Hunt\u2019s proposals cannot possibly solve it \u2013 in fact, that they are likely to make things worse. To put it into perspective, she points out that only a tiny number of the extra 1,500 students will choose to go on and qualify as radiologists, and they won\u2019t come through the system until 2030, or 2032 for clinical oncologists who the college also represent. \u201cAnd by that time,\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019ll be lucky if we have a health service for them to work in.\u201d</p> <p>Every specialism perhaps believes that its own is most crucial. But Strickland makes a convincing case for how the crisis in radiology recruitment will break the entire system. \u201cIt underlies almost every single diagnosis these days, and demand is going up exponentially. It\u2019s increased by 29% in the past three years. But there is simply not the staff. We have hard solid data that shows that we need 260 extra trainees a year for the next five years even to catch up with the rest of Europe. We know this for an absolute fact. We are currently tied third bottom with Turkey. Imaging underlies every part of the health system and without it the entire health system will fall apart. I am desperate to get this message out there, and nobody is listening to us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e731800b819c34b92b941c4b20595afab415912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e731800b819c34b92b941c4b20595afab415912/32_36_735_441/500.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @shevyuk via twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A third of radiologists already come from abroad and they are trying to recruit more, but already one in 10 consultant positions is vacant, unable to be filled. \u201cIf you believe passionately, as we all do, in free healthcare at the point of need and you see that being destroyed\u2026 well, it\u2019s very depressing and demoralising,\u201d says Strickland. \u201cAlready 230,000 people are having to wait a month to get the results of their scans and that\u2019s just not right. It causes stress and anxiety, and delays life-saving treatment. We are trying to tell everyone we can. We could train people but the money is not being made available and it\u2019s going to break the health service. I really mean that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard as an outsider to understand quite how big a crisis the NHS is in \u2013 if it really is as bad as Strickland says, or if it has always gone through these sorts of episodic cycles. But Anthea Mowat from the BMA tells me that it is real and that the collapse in morale is like nothing they\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cWe\u2019ve just done a survey, doctors 10 years post-graduation, and 42% of them say it\u2019s much worse than they expected, and approximately the same number plan to go to work overseas because they don\u2019t feel valued in the NHS.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to the point that our own UK-trained doctors don\u2019t feel valued. And now we don\u2019t value our overseas doctors either.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Masood tells me that his department, for the first time, has a vacancy for a registrar and no applicants. \u201cThis has never happened to us before. We haven\u2019t had a single applicant.\u201d And a university hospital in London is a more attractive proposition than many posts, such as a GP in Stoke-on-Trent, for example, where 65% of GPs are already from outside the EU. Chandra Kanneganti, head of the British Indian Doctors\u2019 Association, who runs three practices in the city, tells me there are currently 34 vacancies. Most of them have been empty for a year.</p> <p>But then, he says, because of visa changes it\u2019s almost impossible for Indian doctors like himself (he\u2019s originally from Hyderabad) to come and work in Britain. \u201cInstead they go to the US, to Australia and Canada. In the 1960s, general practice in Britain was on its knees and it was my colleagues who came in droves to work in the inner cities and places no one else wanted to go. They saved the NHS, and the government needs to recognise this and not make this kind of politically motivated attack on us.\u201d</p> <p>I try to end the interview with Kanneganti, but he won\u2019t let me go. \u201cI am so proud of the NHS, and I love this country. I love it for the way it recognises talent and hard work. And we do work hard and we pay taxes and we do not take benefits and all we are saying is, please recognise this.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s madness that someone as accomplished and hard working as Kanneganti feels the need to justify his position. Or Nancy Ifill, a sister in the emergency department of Whipps Cross hospital in East London. I catch up with her at 11pm, just after she\u2019s arrived home in Colchester, Essex, having left the house at 6.30 that morning. She\u2019s originally from Barbados, came here in 1989 and is now a British citizen. So does that mean she doesn\u2019t feel the insecurity that many non-UK NHS staff feel? That they might not be able to stay.</p> <p>\u201cI would never say I feel totally secure. You just don\u2019t know. With Brexit, it feels like if they want you to go back, they could. I don\u2019t know if this is being fuelled by Nigel Farage and his ideologies. It\u2019s a similar thing with Trump and Hispanics, but it makes you feel like you really don\u2019t belong. Like you\u2019re a lodger. And when we\u2019ve had enough of you we\u2019ll put you out.\u201d</p> <p>Does it upset you? \u201cOf course it does. At the end of the day you come here, you contribute to the system. You\u2019re not mooching off the state. And it\u2019s a significant contribution. A society cannot function without a healthcare system. If you don\u2019t have a healthcare system, you don\u2019t have a society. And for people to think that you don\u2019t matter\u2026 well, it\u2019s a bit tragic.\u201d</p> <p>Her colleagues at Whipps Cross are from everywhere. In her team, \u201cI can probably count the number of \u2018home-grown\u2019 nurses on one hand. \u2018Home grown\u2019! It\u2019s such an insulting, derogatory term.</p> <p>\u201cWho is this organisation made up of? It\u2019s foreign people. Whether they are nurses, cleaners, doctors, the great majority of people working in the largest organisation in the world are foreign people. If you remove them, you won\u2019t have a system. This institution is at the heart of British life and it\u2019s made up of foreigners.\u201d</p> <p>It is, and it\u2019s where the ideology of Brexit strikes against the idea of ourselves as a people in the most intimate way possible. Because the NHS is where we are literally at our most naked and vulnerable. It\u2019s at the heart of what we believe it is to be British. We are \u2013 as every staff room in every hospital in every British city shows \u2013 a country that depends upon the hard work and contribution of people who have come from elsewhere. Who are there when we\u2019re born. And there for us when we die.</p> <p>We hope.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"316418b9ba2e28dd83d3bb684be8607ac9e355aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316418b9ba2e28dd83d3bb684be8607ac9e355aa/1118_906_1828_2286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Junaid Masood\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Junaid Masood</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Junaid Masood, consultant urologist, Homerton hospital, London; British, born in Pakistan</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI came to Britain at a young age because my father came to work here as a doctor.

Soon there were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/notokay?src=hash\">millions of women telling stories</a>, often stories they\u2019d never told anyone before, often involving walking home from school, or dancing at music festivals, or the kinds of men you were meant to call \u201cUncle\u201d. Oxford said she was receiving two replies a second. \u201cAnyone denying rape culture,\u201d she wrote, \u201cplease look at my timeline now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men are oblivious to the Jaws theme each woman hears when travelling alone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is the woman who was 10 when a man with a coat over his arm groped her at a museum. The woman who was 14 when an optician dropped a contact lens down her blouse and stroked her breast. The woman who remembers a man cupping her arse when she was in the queue for ice cream at Disneyland. The effect of reading all of these tiny stories one by one is cumulative. You stand up, eventually. You get off the bus with eyes glassy and an ache behind your ribs and you walk through a group of commuters carrying your phone in one hand and in the other despair. And then you order coffee, tell the guy your name, and smile, without teeth.</p> <p>While Oxford\u2019s feed isn\u2019t shocking to a single woman, it is clearly different for men, some of whom seem to have been oblivious to the <em>Jaws</em> theme each woman hears when travelling alone. Most came open-armed, including the Republicans denouncing Trump because they have daughters, granddaughters. Which, with respect, misses the point slightly. While feminist awakenings (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Jeb Bush</a> may not have identified his as such) must be welcomed, doesn\u2019t a sentiment like that expose the lack of empathy they must have had before; their inability to recognise a woman unless in relation to a man? A meme circulated a couple of years ago, shortening \u201cShe\u2019s someone\u2019s daughter\u201d to \u201cShe\u2019s someone\u201d. It seems crucial that in order for anything to change, these fathers and grandfathers need to realise that earlier.</p> <p>As so often happens when I read women\u2019s personal stories of abuse, I\u2019m shocked at how unshocked I am. There is nothing new here. We\u2019ve smelled this gas for years, but every so often somebody like Oxford strikes a match, and fires start. You realise something, if you carry on reading, ignoring the feeling of having cycled into a bin lorry and then having rubbish dumped on your scuffed and moaning body. You realise how many stories you have told yourself throughout your life to pretend everything is OK. How much you have been expected to ignore, and how much you have glossed over, or laughed at, or pretended was totally, completely fine. \u201cMy fifth assault,\u201d continued Oxford, some time later, \u201cAge 15, at hospital for anxiety &amp; heart palpitations. shirt is off for ekg, 2 Drs, not my Drs, stop &amp; stare. 1 winks at me.\u201d</p> <p>Things in the cold light of adulthood reveal themselves as, if not technically assault, then certainly a cousin. But they\u2019ve been refiled as sassy anecdotes, or stories about the oddness of men.

Reading Oxford\u2019s feed, I remembered the ice-cream van outside school, the man who would give us broken lollies if we climbed inside and sat on his knee. I remembered walking home through the woods, and my friend shouting \u201cRUN\u201d when she saw a man with his coat open standing beside a tree. When we were called out of our French lesson to talk to the police, we told the other girls about it with pride \u2013 the story had been spun in our heads so there was something affirming about the fact that a hooded man had chosen us. Us! It wasn\u2019t fear we learned, it was something worse \u2013 we learned to laugh at the men who snuck their fingers up your top on a busy train, or shouted comments about your school uniform from cars. As adults, an accumulation of expectations of what a woman is for led to many anecdotes between friends about \u201cbad dates\u201d, \u201cbad sex\u201d, being playfully strangled, ejaculated on, left behind.</p> <p>Women walk into relationships now with virtual keys clenched in their fists, as if forever walking home on a dark night.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

Executive chef Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cIt\u2019s an important part of it,\u201d she says, of the queue that builds up here, both lunch and dinner, full of people eager to land one of the prized red-leather-topped stools at the counter. \u201cYou come through that door and it\u2019s like being in Spain. You can hear the chefs shouting orders at each other, you can see the food being cooked and you can smell it.\u201d</p> <p>Ah yes, the food. This Barrafina is one of three. Mohacho opened the first with her business partners Eddie and Sam Hart in London\u2019s Soho a short walk away in 2007. But she freely admits her favourite menu is here. \u201cA decade ago, when we opened on Frith Street, I really wasn\u2019t that brave with the cooking,\u201d she says now. \u201cI needed to find the confidence to do the food I wanted to do. I had to get to know the customers and understand that they were willing to try these things.\u201d</p> <p>There are, of course, the staples expected of any Anglo-Spanish restaurant: the padron peppers and <em>pan con tomate</em>; the finest sliced hams and tortillas. But there is also a pronounced interest in the bits of animal that often get left behind. Alongside the paper placemat menus, with which the counter is laid, there\u2019s a small blackboard of specials. I am invited to pick something off it that Mohacho will cook for a late lunch shared with Sam Hart. I choose tiny clams called <em>tellines</em>, which are sweet and salty and come in a rich puddle of the best lemony olive oil, spiked with chives.</p> <p>There are lambs\u2019 brains, breaded and deep fried, and served under a butch puree of black olives. We have dinky lambs\u2019 kidneys, speedily roasted on the Josper grill and served on a metal rack above still-smoking charcoal. There\u2019s suckling pig with skin like glass and a salad of yellow chicory with the best anchovy fillets. We watch each of these being cooked and plated. The very process of our lunch being assembled in front of us is, as all Barrafina fans know, a huge part of the fun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/18/barrafina-tapas-nieves-barragan\">Cookery masterclass: Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is my dream food,\u201d Barragan says, simply.

So I began living in the daytime, which meant eating lunch. And the place I fell in love with was <a href=\"http://www.calpep.com\">Cal Pep</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The Hart brothers are rare in the restaurant business for being so completely open about the inspiration for their own ventures. \u201cCal Pep has been there for over 30 years,\u201d says Hart. \u201cIt\u2019s a counter with cooks working behind it. There are no reservations and just 23 seats which, as it happens, is exactly the same as at our first Barrafina. And food-wise it\u2019s definitely an inspiration. It\u2019s simple cookery, and seafood heavy.\u201d</p> <p>Inspired Hart may have been, but the project took time, involving a detour through the first business he opened with his brother Eddie, a standard Spanish restaurant called Fino, now closed. By the time they came to open the first Barrafina, Mohacho, originally from near Bilbao, was a sous chef at Fino. \u201cI arrived in London in 1999, intending to stay for just six months,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI wanted to learn languages.\u201d Then she was made head chef of the new tapas restaurant. Today, as a partner in the business, she oversees the food at all three Barrafinas \u2013 the third is on Drury Lane \u2013 working a week at each in turn.</p> <p>The original, with its clean marble lines in black and grey, and its buzz and clatter, quickly garnered a huge following, as did this second when it opened in 2014. Both Mohacho and Hart agree this readers\u2019 award is more important than most because, as Hart says, \u201cIt\u2019s our customers.\u201d Or as Mohacho puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s been voted for by people who like to eat.\u201d</p> <p>So why does Hart think it\u2019s this Barrafina that the readers have chosen? He looks pained, as if I\u2019m asking him to choose between his children. The most he is willing to do is point to their unique points. \u201cFrith Street has always had the buzz that you get with all the passing trade in Soho, Drury Lane is the most beautiful room, and this one has the more adventurous menu.\u201d The Barrafinas are also defined, of course, by that controversial no-reservations policy. \u201cI know the no-reservations policy is inconvenient for some people,\u201d Hart says, \u201cbut on busy days we can have 50% staff to customers and we simply couldn\u2019t afford to do it if we were waiting for people to turn up for bookings.\u201d</p> <p>The key, Hart says, is not to turn up hungry. \u201cIf you turn up very hungry and tired this won\u2019t work for you. But if you treat the queue as before-dinner drinks \u2013 and we will serve you drinks and nibbles while you queue \u2013 then it\u2019s a different business.\u201d And this may be the second point that gives Adelaide Street the edge over its siblings. The original on Frith Street \u2013 soon to close due to the landlord\u2019s development plans, and move into nearby Quo Vadis which the Harts also own \u2013 is a shoe box of a space. \u201cThere has always been a trade-off between comfort and atmosphere,\u201d Hart agrees. \u201cSome people like being elbow to elbow.\u201d</p> <p>Adelaide Street, on a larger corner site, just has more space. You can perch at the bar in the window with a chilled glass of cava, a bowl of salted marcona almonds before you, and watch the kitchen at work, calm in the knowledge that it will soon be your turn on one of those red-leather-topped counter stools; that soon you will have the chance to rampage through Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho\u2019s gutsy, inventive and utterly compelling menu.</p> <p>As culinary theatre goes, it really doesn\u2019t get much better than that.<br><em>10 Adelaide St, London WC2</em></p>",
  "<p>The Brits are rightly renowned for their love of queuing, be it for buses, Wimbledon or the January sales, but when <a href=\"http://padella.co/\">Padella</a> set up their no-bookings pasta joint this spring, they knew they were taking a punt. After all, who in their right mind queues for a bowl of spag bol? </p> <p>Quite a lot of us, as it turns out, though it wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest of openings. Jordan Frieda winces: \u201cThe bank almost pulled out in the last week of the build.\u201d That, combined with a few other hiccups, convinced him they were doomed, \u201cbut on that first morning, we were having a team meeting when the queue started forming. By the time we\u2019d finished, the numbers outside scared the crap out of us.\u201d</p> <p>But while diners are willing to stand in line for a plate of pappardelle with eight-hour Dexter rag\u00f9, we\u2019re nowhere near as evangelical about pasta as 39-year-old Frieda and his business partner, chef Tim Siadatan, 33. </p> <p>\u201cA great plate of pasta is the most important thing in both our lives,\u201d Frieda says. \u201cIf there\u2019s something not right, I take it personally.\u201d</p> <p>Siadatan is equally effusive, having had his own epiphany in 2002 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/22/ameliahill.theobserver\">one of the original graduates from Jamie Oliver\u2019s Fifteen</a>: \u201cPete Begg from the River Cafe trained us,\u201d he says, \u201cso at 19 I got one-on-one pasta tuition from the best.\u201d He shakes his head: \u201cLooking back, that\u2019s mental.\u201d</p> <p>The pair came up with the idea for a handmade pasta bar eight years ago, but the timing was all wrong. \u201cIt seems odd now,\u201d Frieda says, \u201cbut there weren\u2019t many single-item restaurants at the time. Investors wouldn\u2019t touch us.\u201d </p> <p>So they put pasta on the back-burner and in 2010 opened a more traditional venue in <a href=\"http://www.trullorestaurant.com\">Trullo</a>, a neighbourhood north London Italian that, Frieda says, has essentially been \u201ca six-year learning curve\u201d. Not that they actually turned their backs on their true love, Siadatan admits with a shifty smile: he used it to build up a pasta portfolio. \u201cWhen we started thinking seriously about Padella again, I had 300 recipes from Trullo\u2019s back catalogue up my sleeve.\u201d</p> <p>Pasta aside, accessibility was always the next most important element in the masterplan. \u201cOther than the odd trattoria, the only places you could get truly great pasta in the UK were the River Cafe and Locanda Locatelli,\u201d Frieda says. \u201cAnd who can afford that more than once in a blue moon?\u201d</p> <p>This explains Padella\u2019s pricing: their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/padella_pasta/\">pici cacio e pepe</a>, one of 2016\u2019s most Instagrammed restaurant dishes, costs all of six quid; Siadatan\u2019s favourite, the \u00a35.50 taglierini with slow-cooked tomato sauce, started life at Trullo: \u201cIt\u2019s my chicken soup,\u201d he sighs.</p> <p>Cheap doesn\u2019t mean you cut corners, though. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a relentless attention to detail, or customers will soon suss you out,\u201d says Siadatan, whose brigade also makes bread and ice cream on site every day.</p> <p>But, deep down, it\u2019s all about the Italian carbs: \u201cThe most gratifying thing,\u201d Frieda says, \u201cis we now know other people get pasta just like we do.\u201d Well, maybe not quite.

  "<p>Ali Smith\u2019s door is ajar. She lives in Cambridge, on a half-hidden terrace of tiny Victorian cottages. The gardens are opposite, the fences between them long since removed. It\u2019s late September, and Smith\u2019s beloved apple tree is still swagged with fruit. Inside, a green sweater slung over her shoulders, she beckons me upstairs to her studio to catch the last of the sun.</p> <p>She\u2019s only just finished her new novel, <em>Autumn</em>, the first in a shape-shifting seasonal quartet about time and history, art and love and the state the state is in.

A manuscript usually takes a good year to be birthed into the world as a book, but <em>Autumn</em> sped through the presses in a matter of weeks.

All across the country, people felt history meant nothing.\u201d</p> <p>But for all its immediacy, <em>Autumn</em> also sets the congested present in perspective. Everywhere there are unlikely friendships and enriching, practically Socratic dialogues. People fall in love and conduct bedside vigils. A painter is rediscovered. A young woman in 1940s France refuses internment. Time turns tricks; time flies; a man flings a watch into a canal. The cumulative effect is liberatory, expansive, like stepping out of a fetid room and finding yourself in a field.</p> <p>I can\u2019t pretend total objectivity here. I\u2019ve known Smith since I was 17 (her partner, the artist and film-maker Sarah Wood, is my cousin). In the 1990s we used to write each other letters.

It\u2019s hard to think of another contemporary writer so adept at splicing the ordinary and the marvellous, cracking open possibilities for exuberant invention and transformation in spaces as dismally quotidian as a care home reception or Post Office queue. Words migrate and morph; perspectives slip and skew; things change. \u201cLanguage is like poppies,\u201d a character observes in <em>Autumn</em>. \u201cIt just takes something to churn the earth round them up, and when it does up come the sleeping words, bright red, fresh, blowing about.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s previous novel, the wonderfully double-jointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/07/how-to-be-both-review-ali-smith-dual-narrative-francesco-del-cossa\"><em>How to Be Both </em></a>(which was shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker, and won the Baileys prize for women\u2019s fiction, the Goldsmiths prize and the Costa novel award), imagined a possible life for a real artist, the Italian Renaissance painter Francesco del Cossa, whose irrepressibly lively frescoes in the city of Ferrara have withstood earthquakes and wars.

She painted the sexy, violent world around her with a sly, wry eye. In a surviving photograph, she lounges naked with an armful of roses against her own painting of Jean-Paul Belmondo, an oozy vaginal flower crowning his hat. (\u201cI\u2019m an intelligent nakedness,\u201d Smith has her say. \u201cAn intellectual body. I\u2019m a bodily intelligence. Art\u2019s full of nudes and I\u2019m a thinking, choosing nude.\u201d)</p> <p>Witty, clever and electrifying, Boty was at the centre of swinging London: dancing on <em>Ready, Steady, Go!</em>, making a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-KAxVNSti8\">luminous cameo</a> as a love interest in <em>Alfie</em>. In 1965, she became pregnant and was diagnosed with cancer during a routine examination. She refused chemotherapy, worried it would harm the foetus, and died at the age of 28, a few months after the birth of her daughter. With that, she sank from history until, decades later, some of her radiant, riotous canvases were rediscovered, mildewed and covered in cobwebs, in an outhouse on her brother\u2019s farm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/apr/27/pauline-boty-pictures\">Pauline Boty: life and works - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smith was knocked for six when she first saw one. \u201cThere are people who stand for their times and oh my God, Boty stands for her time.\u201d Her interest quickened when she discovered Boty had been commissioned by an unknown person to paint<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/04/profumo-affair-christine-keeler-stephen-ward\"> Christine Keeler,</a> the model at the heart of the Profumo affair (the painting, <em>Scandal \u201863</em>, which can be seen in several photographs,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/27/pauline-boty-hunt-lost-art\"> has been missing ever since</a>).</p> <p><em>Autumn</em> interleaves the schisms of 2016 with the trial of 1963. Both are key years, Smith thinks, in which a lie in the political sphere had dramatic consequences for society at large. Like Brexit, like the invasion of Iraq, the Profumo affair marked a turning point. \u201cMeanwhile, the time itself is tearing itself apart because there has been a massive lie and the lie has come from parliament and dissolved itself right the way through the country and things change. It\u2019s a pivotal moment. We were dealing with a kind of mass culture of lies. And it\u2019s a question of what happens culturally when something is built on a lie.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things she loves about Boty\u2019s playful, probing work is that it looks at how governing cultural myths are formed and perpetuated by way of images. She didn\u2019t paint people so much as pictures of people already in wide circulation: Marilyn Monroe tottering in furs; the Beatles, Elvis, JFK being shot in the motorcade in Dallas. Like fiction itself, Smith thinks, \u201cit reminds you to read the world as a construct. And if you can read the world as a construct, you can ask questions of the construct and you can suggest ways to change the construct. You understand that things aren\u2019t fixed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c3e918aa3bee40b335bb0c3bcf9309b4ee80e73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c3e918aa3bee40b335bb0c3bcf9309b4ee80e73/0_13_2480_3051/813.jpg\" alt=\"BUM, 1966 by Pauline Boty.\" width=\"813\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BUM, 1966 by Pauline Boty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pallant House Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the wall above Smith\u2019s desk is a porcelain branch breaking into leaf, surrounded by dozens of pictures.

Underneath, in huge red letters, Boty has painted the word BUM.</p> <p>The light is fading. Downstairs, Smith brings us a plate of apples from her tree and two clasp knives. There are great piles of books and records everywhere, paintings propped casually on stacks of art magazines and proofs: an iceberg, a bowl of lemons, a watercolour of a pink lily against a wash of dense black. The lily is by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\">John Berger</a>, another writer dogged in his faith in art as a force for forging connections, illuminating and resisting what<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/william-shakespeare-handwritten-plea-for-refugees-online-sir-thomas-more-script-play-british-library-exhibition\"> Shakespeare\u2019s Thomas More calls \u201cmountainish inhumanity\u201d.</a></p> <p>Where do we end up if we wall ourselves in, Smith wonders. Insist on fortifications, and you create a kind of prison for yourself. In <em>Autumn</em> an electric fence appears around a plot of common land, patrolled by the fictive security agency SA4A. It\u2019s such an ugly, absurd spectacle: \u201cPrison for trees. Prison for gorse, for flies, for cabbage whites, for small blues. Oystercatcher detention centre.\u201d Far better to yank them down, to learn how to communicate in a different tongue, to welcome the stranger as a friend.</p> <p>She knows something of what\u2019s coming next in the quartet, if not what material the future will fling her way. Winter, she thinks, is a place where you can see really clearly, while summer is the luscious moment when the light kicks in and the leaves are fully spread. But ask about individual characters and she clams up. I\u2019m particularly keen on <em>Autumn</em>\u2019s puckish songwriter Daniel Gluck: a limber 101, his life spanning the sweep of a century. Many of Smith\u2019s most memorable characters have been disrupters, from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/like.html\"><em>Like</em></a><em>\u2019s</em> Ash and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/bookerprize2005.bookerprize\"><em>The Accidental</em></a><em>\u2019s </em>Amber to Miles, the stubborn bedroom squatter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/01/ali-smith-there-but-for-the-review\"><em>There But for The</em></a>.

And then he lets time get to work on them, grass growing through ribs and eyeholes, costumes nibbled away, until there\u2019s nothing left but bones in flower.

The mere act of cracking open a book, Smith thinks, is creative in itself, capable of inculcating kindness and agility in the reader. \u201cArt is one of the prime ways we have of opening ourselves and going beyond ourselves. That\u2019s what art is, it\u2019s the product of the human being in the world and imagination, all coming together. The irrepressibility of the life in the works, regardless of the times, the histories, the life stories, it\u2019s like being given the world, its darks and lights.

Here they packed, into one small hour, more and disturbingly more turns and twists than we had any right to expect: I was left reeling a little.</p> <p>The missing of this tale is a girl, Alison, kidnapped for 11 years, who suddenly, in 2014, wanders back into the world; into a cheap smoky Christmas market leached of colour and littered with lumpy ice: you can practically smell that horrid too-pink ersatz wurst. What should have been the heartwarming end, as her parents get the news and all are reunited in hospital, is of course only the heartbreaking beginning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fda89eadd838062a2c820a84b9c144f80ad71808\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fda89eadd838062a2c820a84b9c144f80ad71808/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as Julien Baptiste in The Missing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tch\u00e9ky Karyo as Julien Baptiste in The Missing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one constant is Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, as lovely French cop Julien Baptiste, now retired yet still haunted by the occasional failure.

I know a couple of Grishams have filmed well, but that must have been accidental: after all, Hollywood even managed a 10th-way decent <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, inordinately more than the book ever deserved. In the sun-riddled environs of the San Fernando valley and Venice Beach, lawyer Billy Bob Thornton hides from the vitamin D in faintly grubby bars, all brown wood, brown memories and tatty fairylights; this is the California of tyre stores and nail parlours in much the same way as that woeful cheerless Christmas market is the reality of much of Lower Saxony.</p> <p>By common consent, he drinks too much (and always has the rejoinder: \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate. I drink exactly the right amount for me\u201d). He is also, of course, a faded lawyer, bright as a pewter button just needing polishing, and persuaded here to go up against the Goliath of the firm he co-founded in pursuit of a wrongful death-at-sea claim. He doesn\u2019t yet know, but we do, or at least can take a punt at suspecting, that it\u2019ll be, oh, <em>so</em> much more conspiratorial than that.</p> <p>This is very moreish, not least because Billy Bob is actually channelling Philip Marlowe \u2013 same shiny/dirty US state, about 80 years later. \u201cListen lady, I\u2019m nervous already, and you\u2019re a yapper,\u201d is the kind of thing he will say, not unkindly, but with equally little regard for finesse. \u201cWhen in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand,\u201d wrote Chandler: hasn\u2019t happened so far, but I\u2019ll bet the farm.

Robbie Coltrane cried not only tears but snot, and how does one manage to cry snot? Jack Thorne\u2019s script, equally and truthfully wonderful. Tim McInnerney entranced as ever, and is the right age to be our next Olivier. But the direction: I am searching for a kind way to describe it. All the reds and greens and pointless lingering on non-moments.</p> <p>I have read that it was shot deliberately in this way. Always with windows in the background to highlight the fact that we are all voyeurs; we create the media monster we then want to shoot down. We might, sigh, have been trusted to know that. We\u2019re not bairns.</p>",
  "<p>We Remainers must not give up. The future of this country, and indeed of Europe, is far too important to accept the argument that we are bad losers and \u201cit is time to move on\u201d.</p> <p>It cannot be repeated often enough that on the evening of the fateful day, 23 June, when the initial results of the referendum seemed to be going against him, Nigel Farage declared that, if the result were to be 52% for Remain and 48% for Leave, then there should be another referendum.</p> <p>Once Theresa May became leader and appeared to put the three most prominent Brexiters \u2013 namely David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox \u2013 in, as it were, poll position, the more optimistic Remainers placed their hopes in a conspiracy theory: May was being fiendishly clever, the Brexiters would get bogged down in mission impossible, and sense would prevail as they fell at various fences.</p> <p>However, as the prime minister has made crystal clear at the recent Tory party conference, her obsession is with immigration and she is perfectly happy to sacrifice our membership of the single market to appease the anti-immigration lobby. She appears to have bought Davis\u2019s line that Britain can happily negotiate all manner of trade agreements through membership of the World Trade Organisation, blissfully ignoring all the trade experts who point out that this process would take 10 years. After all, they are only experts, and one of the most prominent Brexiters during the campaign told us what to think of experts.</p> <p>I write as the pound plumbs new depths. There is real panic out there, as fund managers scratch their heads and wonder why a once-great nation can have a prime minister who on the one hand speaks grandly of a new industrial strategy and on the other hand is prepared to undermine it by putting investment and jobs at risk through obeisance to the pipe dreams of the Brexit brigade.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexiters crow that the roof has not fallen in. Or, as the man said toppling from the skyscraper: 'So far, so good'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hard truth is that the British economy is an integral part of the wider European economy, and much of \u201cBritish\u201d industry is foreign-owned by corporations that take the view that Britain\u2019s membership of the single market and the customs union makes it an ideal base for investment.</p> <p>It is not for nothing that there is a growing fissure between the Brexiters and the Treasury. If the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is prepared to point out in public that people did not vote to become poorer, goodness know what he and his officials must be telling the Brexiters in private.</p> <p>Both the Treasury and the Bank of England were criticised for the alarms they raised during the referendum campaign, and short-sighted Brexiters are crowing that, so far, the roof has not fallen in. Or, as the man said toppling from the skyscraper: \u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p> <p>One reason why the economy seems in better shape than feared is that, knowing what it was up against, the Bank of England took countervailing action to steady the markets. It was cheap for the prime minister to take a potshot at governor Carney in her conference speech.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the run on the pound. I have seen some sterling crises in my time, and the media keep referring to Black Wednesday in 1992 and the \u201cpound in your pocket\u201d devaluation in 1967. But what this reminds me of is the 1976 crisis, when the Labour government lost the confidence of the markets and had to resort to borrowing from the IMF in humiliating circumstances.</p> <p>The principal parallel is this: there was a balance of payments deficit and a Treasury view that devaluation would be helpful to exporters. At present some people, including Sir&#xa0;Jon Cunliffe (one of the numerous \u201cdeputy\u201d governors of the Bank) seem perfectly happy with what has happened to sterling. Well, Cunliffe should be careful what he wishes for. I should guess, from his public pronouncements, that Mark Carney takes a different view.</p> <p>When he quoted that great line from<em> A Streetcar Named Desire</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">about the kindness of strangers</a>, he was well aware of the problem of financing the balance of payments deficit should the confidence of strangers collapse. Collapse it has, partly as a consequence of the referendum itself, and partly because May has frightened the horses with her glib announcement that, in effect, she and her fellow Brexiters are prepared to take actions which will almost certainly do lasting damage to the economy.</p> <p>The rest of the world has woken up to this, and so has the chancellor. Indeed, one poll indicated that 66% of the British public were opposed to the prime minister\u2019s eccentric judgment, and, faced with the choice, would prefer continued access to the single market to drastic controls on immigration. Hammond is fighting to bring some sense into the rest of his cabinet colleagues. If he fails, then \u2026 who knows? In such an eventuality, if I were in his shoes, I would contemplate an honourable resignation.</p> <p>Meanwhile he has an autumn statement on 23 November. In order to deliver a convincing plan, he will need to fit in with the forecasts due from the Office for Budget Responsibility. But in order to provide him with convincing forecasts, the OBR needs to know what this shambolic government\u2019s policies are \u2013 real policies, that is, as opposed to conference rhetoric. Time to re-read Joseph Heller\u2019s <em>Catch-22</em>, methinks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Mercato Metropolitano, 42 Newington Causeway, London SE1 6DR. Food per head: \u00a310-\u00a320</strong></p> <p>London is eating itself out of house and home, literally. The pressure for affordable housing is intense. People with jobs in the capital need places in which to live that don\u2019t leave them at the mercies of Southern Rail. Instead, suitable brownfield sites for new flats at affordable prices are being transformed into vast eateries which take the street out of street food. Ah well. At least we\u2019ll never want for overloaded Korean-accented hamburgers piled with kimchi and ganjang called things like Seoul Food, because that\u2019s hilarious.</p> <p>One prime mover is <a href=\"http://londonunion.com/\">London Union</a>, which runs <a href=\"http://streetfeast.com/\">Street Feast</a>, a series of self-contained sites around the capital housing a variety of street food operators alongside bars and seating. When the parent company first launched it announced a collection of financial backers drawn from the food world, including three of my so-called rivals from the restaurant reviewing business. Any attempt by me to suggest there might be a teensy-weensy conflict of interest in people who write about restaurants also investing in them, was met by outbreaks of acute eye-rolling. Oh, please! Get a life!</p> <p>Some have attributed my comments to sour grapes because I didn\u2019t get a sniff of the investment opportunity. This is entirely true.

It was opened over the summer by Italian businessman Andrea Rasca, who has identical ventures in Milan and Turin, and who loves a bit of sloganeering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An ooze of stracchino cheese leaks its way across your fingers as you tear and fold the foccacia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the infuriating website \u2013 it keeps trying to get you to sign up to their newsletter \u2013 they \u201cbuild new jobs increase social and cultural values through the regeneration of local areas\u201d and laugh in the face of punctuation.

There are handsome displays of cheese and charcuterie, and a few ready meals. Across from there is the warehouse space proper, filled with communal tables in a renal-failure shade of yellow, edged by food stalls. Curiously, while other outfits like this big up the individual businesses, here they are blanded out by uniform, faux handwritten white-on-black signage.

The so-called \u201cArtisan French Bistro and Deli\u201d belongs to <a href=\"http://www.champagneplusfromage.co.uk/\">Champagne and Fromage</a>, which has an outpost over in Brixton Village. The ice creams come from Badiani of Florence and the pizzas from the famed Neopolitan company, Fresco. The latter, with its wood-fired oven, is clearly the star attraction and, at \u00a36 for the margherita, it\u2019s well priced.</p> <p>The market for lovingly hand-shaped, wood-fire-baked pizzas \u2013 for the humble transformed into a bourgeois fetish object \u2013 has become crowded of late. It turns out you don\u2019t have to be Neapolitan to make a good pizza. But maybe it helps. The dough is pleasingly chewy, the crust well charred. The Ripieno, a calzone-style fold enclosing tomato, mozzarella and salami, is one of the more expensive at \u00a311. It\u2019s a serious piece of work, all hot gusts of spiced air and smoky base. The only problem is the wait. On a quiet Sunday evening it takes 20 minutes to get a pizza. That\u2019s fine in a sit-down restaurant, less so when you have to loiter in a queue, trying not to look bored.</p> <p>A Vietnamese stand offers a chicken curry, full of depth and heat. It\u2019s heavy on the potatoes but only costs a fiver; a salad of finely sliced roast beef, brimming with the floral hit of mint and coriander and fresh red chilli, comes at the same price.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71b6ab921b7cc0ab427583d03529d5f48f9b14f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b6ab921b7cc0ab427583d03529d5f48f9b14f7/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Would be even better without the board\u2019: mixed grill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Would be even better without the board\u2019: mixed grill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the Argentine Grill there\u2019s a bread board piled with passable chips, surrounded by slices of slightly overcooked steak, a gnarly chorizo with the pleasing texture of something cleavered not pulsed, and pieces of sausage so garlicky your beloved will know what you had for dinner. It costs \u00a310 and would be even better without the board.</p> <p>Overall, there is the sense that there are gems waiting to be found if you can make the effort: over here a stand selling cones of deep-fried fish; over there, that place offering 19 different types of overloaded hamburger which all end up looking remarkably similar. From a stall selling myriad foccacias comes one of my favourites: \u00a34 worth of thin, lightly salted, crisp-crusted bread stuffed with an ooze of stracchino cheese, served warm. It leaks its way across your fingers as you tear and fold.

Jo Johnson, minister for universities and science, has announced that EU students applying to come to a university here in 2017 can be assured of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/eu-student-funding-in-uk-to-remain-same-in-2017-despite-brexit-vote\" title=\"\">continuing access to loans and grants</a> for the duration of their course.</p> <p>The government, then, clearly understands that there is a problem and is doing its best to help. But beyond this there are long-term issues which need to be tackled as part of the planning for Brexit.</p> <p>Top of the list is the free movement of academics and students. There is already a visa regime for academics and researchers from outside the EU which is so tight it can inhibit legitimate research contacts. For example, the government is focused on the problem of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/14/antibiotic-resistance-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">antimicrobial resistance</a>, and so academics from developing countries most affected by the problem are invited to contribute to conferences here about it; but they then get their applications for visas turned down. There is a risk that EU academics might in future be subject to a similarly strict visa regime, which could obstruct their ability to move here, either to work or even just to come to meetings. That is why our universities need confidence that the visa regime will make it easy for academics at all levels \u2013 including postgraduate students \u2013 to move here easily.</p> <p>The effect on undergraduates is another concern. At the moment, EU students pay the regulated \u00a39,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/tuition-fees\" title=\"\">fees</a> and are eligible for student loans. They will presumably become like other international students with unrestricted fees and no access to loans. The pessimists fear that EU students will be put off by higher fees with no loans. But if our universities provide a world-class education, there is a chance that they could actually get more revenues from them. The visa regime is crucial here. It makes no sense to try to restrict the number of legitimate overseas students coming to study at our universities \u2013 they are a fantastic export opportunity.</p> <p>The talk of only letting in the \u201cbrightest and the best\u201d misses the point. They are not migrants \u2013 we quite rightly expect these students to return home at the end of their course. They need to have the mastery of English and the academic aptitude to benefit from higher education, but we do not need to be more selective than that. We do not say that the car industry should only sell Bentleys abroad, not Minis. We do not say they should only sell to drivers with an advanced motoring qualification. Higher education for overseas students is a legitimate transaction, selling a fantastic British service. It is not the same as recruiting migrant workers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government knows there are problems and is trying to help. But there are long-term issues that need to be tackled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are so focused on attracting overseas students to Britain that we sometimes lose sight of the opposite challenge \u2013 encouraging more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/29/the-great-escape-five-reasons-to-study-abroad-for-a-masters\" title=\"\">British students to study abroad</a>. This broadens their horizons and strengthens long-term links with key countries. At the moment, only about 30,000 British students study abroad, an extraordinarily low number. Unlike many other countries, we do not provide any help with the cost of their fees. The loans no longer available to EU students to study here should instead be made available to English students wanting to study abroad.</p> <p>So, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/oct/29/monash-warwick-alliance-global-education\" title=\"\">University of Warwick has close ties to Monash</a>, one of Australia\u2019s leading universities, and was planning an integrated course which included Warwick students doing a year there. But they could not receive loans from the British government to cover their education, whereas Australian students here do get some help from their government. The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/highereducationandresearch.html\" title=\"\">Higher Education and Research bill</a> is a great opportunity to make these loans available to British students for study in countries that ministers specify. This is all part of the opening up to the wider world which the Brexiters say they want. And if it encourages more people to study abroad, it even reduces net migration.</p> <p>This still leaves the worries of the research community about reduced participation in research collaborations. There are lots of ideas about how to respond. Some universities are thinking of setting up operations on the continent in order to stay within these valuable networks. Another possibility is to join EU research programmes without being a member \u2013 that is what Switzerland has done for example, though it is now caught up in a dispute with the EU, which has suspended their participation after they voted in a referendum for more controls on migration. A third way round the problem is to run our own scheme in parallel with the EU to fund British participation in EU programmes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/14/all-eyes-on-the-red-planet-as-esas-lander-prepares-to-hurtle-towards-mars\">All eyes on the red planet as ESA's lander prepares to hurtle towards Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of Europe\u2019s key research and innovation networks are already intergovernmental, not part of the EU. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/european-space-agency\" title=\"\">European Space Agency</a>, which provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/18/tim-peake-grim-week-earth-mission-work-together\" title=\"\">Tim Peake</a> with his mission and which now has a base in Harwell after I \u2013 when minister for universities and science \u2013 boosted our contribution to it, is a great way to collaborate with other countries in science and technology. The European Molecular Biology Laboratory has the excellent European Bioinformatics Institute at Hinxton outside Cambridge. Its headquarters are in Heidelberg, a source of great pride in Germany. A top-level visit there with a strong message of support for that kind of research collaboration would help undo some of the damage done by German reporting, especially of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/this-is-what-theresa-mays-tory-britain-will-look-like\" title=\"\">Tory party conference</a>.</p> <p>The government has already signalled it understands the importance of these intergovernmental agencies by offering to offset the increase in the cost of our contributions because of the weakness of the pound. But we need to go further with positive efforts to increase our involvement in science and technology collaborations with countries across the world. The prime minister has told me that she sees the importance of this \u2013 and I hope it remains a priority for her government. </p> <p><em>David Willetts is executive chair of the Resolution Foundation, and is a former minister for universities and science</em></p>"
