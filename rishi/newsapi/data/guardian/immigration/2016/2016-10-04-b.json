These are all policies of a party that is reckless, divisive and uncaring.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Davis dismissed the idea that he and other prominent leave campaigners were put in charge of Brexit so they could be held responsible if it went wrong, saying \u201cthere will be plenty of blame to go round\u201d if that were to happen.</p> <p>Speaking on the fringes of the conference, the Brexit secretary said it was \u201cconspiracy stuff\u201d to believe May appointed him, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, with that in mind.</p> <p>The comments came as Brexit campaigners welcomed the lack of an economic downturn predicted during the EU referendum campaign, but critics pointed to the falling value of sterling as cause for concern.<br></p>",

The Tigers had defeated the Magpies in the first round last year but in a tough game, Goodooga pulled off an upset win to the unbridled joy of 60 community members, many whom had made the 14-hour trek by car. </p> <p> The two teams exchanged hugs and complex handshakes and the elated Goodooga youngsters were absorbed into the warm embrace of their fans \u2013 mums, dads uncles, aunties. Their enthusiasm was contagious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, cuz?\u201d said one fan to a player. \u201cPlenty, bra,\u201d he said, smiling. </p> <p> As the Goodooga Magpies team left the ground they were greeted by Uncle Allan Lamb, who said to each player: \u201c<em>Yaama dhaadhaa nginda maamali Nga</em>,\u201d which translates as: \u201cGrandfather said you done good.\u201d \u201cWithout footy,\u201d explained Uncle Allan, \u201cwhat do we have to connect the kids and the elders?\u201d</p> <p> In a burnt orange uniform the Goodooga Magpies coach, Gary Gawne, addressed the players. \u201cGee we looked good!\u201d he said, beaming. \u201cBut let\u2019s fix the little things, slow it down and play at our pace.\u201d Gawne has pulled together a team from a remote town east of Lightning Ridge and 70km from the nearest shops.

For many, knockout is the new initiation for Kooris, linking men and boys and replacing formal ceremonies of bravery that were once the rite of passage to adulthood.</p> <p> With the junior and women\u2019s semi-finalists locked in, it was time for Super Saturday, a brutal throwdown between 62 men\u2019s teams. It was blue sky for all with the hero\u2019s script yet to be written. The forward packs launched ferociously into each other and the backs sprinted, sidestepped and scored brilliant tries. The footy is flashy and it\u2019s a nostalgic return to the pre-prototype days of rugby league \u2013 diversity of body shapes, from skinny wingers to fat forwards. </p> <p> Respect is a verb at the knockout and keeping the peace is paramount among alpha males representing their community.

For Walker the fear and excitement associated with the knockout is the \u201cunknown\u201d. He lives in the structured world of the NRL, where robotic percentages reign supreme and players are videotaped and analysed daily. Knockout provides a glimpse of the old world: \u201cMore ability, less structure,\u201d Walker said on Road to the Knockout. \u201cYou turn up as an NRL player and a fearless 17-year-old kid nobody has heard of can step you silly!\u201d </p> <p> It\u2019s tough to imagine another event in the world where professionals mix so freely with amateurs, often against the wishes of their professional clubs. \u201cSome player managers don\u2019t like us playing in the tournament,\u201d said Addo-Carr, \u201cbut it\u2019s very important and we won\u2019t back down on it.\u201d</p> <p> To make the semi-finals on Monday, each team must win three games on the Sunday. Narwan Eels were led by former NRL star and four-time knockout winner Dean Widders who, at the creaky age of 36, has returned to play for his ancestral team. \u201cMy shoulders and knees are shot but I\u2019ve got to play,\u201d he said after leading the Eels to a tough win over the Illawarra Titans. \u201cKnockouts are won on spirit, not training.\u201d A Narwan fan pats Widders on the back and says, \u201cFirst games always the hardest, ay?\u201d The Eels would be knocked out later in the day.</p> <p> Throughout the crowd was boisterous and the language often blue, despite a decent contingent of police. The ground announcer bravely tried to stem the tide with a request to stop swearing. One Narwan Eels fan screeched in reply: \u201cYou\u2019ll need a big paddy wagon for that one!\u201d which set off laughter, even among the police officers. </p> <p> The NITV live coverage began on the Sunday, beamed out to the nation by a panel of expert commentators including Brad Cooke, Channel Seven\u2019s Djuro Sen, ABC\u2019s Dan Conifer and the former NRL player Joey Williams. They work in shifts dissecting matters and providing backstories, their excitement bubbling over at the athletic feats and big hits.</p> <p> Between shifts, Cooke introduced me to a standout Cabbage Tree Island Descendent player, Djann Jarrett, who takes knockout more seriously than most. Deaf by birth he has recently had a Cochlear implant and was warned about playing. With headgear in place he is prepared to take the risk. \u201cYou can\u2019t get between a blackfella and knockout,\u201d Jarrett said plainly. </p> <p> By the end of Sunday, 62 men\u2019s teams had whittled down to four, including last year\u2019s grand finalists the Redfern All Blacks and the Newcastle All Blacks, plus outsiders Cabbage Tree Island Descendants and Combined Countries. </p> <p> Monday dawned full of promise and there were plenty of walking wounded in the stands, some in arm braces and others walking with crutches. Redfern and Newcastle won their games to set up a grand final rematch. Djann Jarrett\u2019s Cabbage Tree Island did their community proud in their 30-10 semi-final loss to Redfern. His hearing implant remains intact and he\u2019ll be back for more, his disappointment cured by the alchemy of time. \u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cRedfern has been there done that.

  "<p>Theresa May has the admirable intention of restoring confidence in government by paying careful attention to the discontents of the 52% who voted Brexit. She recognises that many who voted leave did so from a sense that Westminster had yielded control of important policies, most notably immigration, to Brussels. That is partly the consequence of setting a target for net migration that was unachievable. Mrs May spent six years trying to make it work against internal opposition from the Lib Dems, and sometimes from George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. It was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11329609/George-Osborne-sees-off-Theresa-Mays-controversial-plan-to-deport-foreign-graduates.html\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne who vetoed a manifesto pledge</a> to prevent international students staying on after they had finished their studies. But international students stayed in Mrs May\u2019s sights, one of the few points of traction in the government\u2019s efforts to bring net migration down below 100,000.</p> <p>Now her successor at the Home Office, Amber Rudd, <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/full-text-amber-rudds-conference-speech/\" title=\"\">in a speech that was startlingly hardline</a>, is planning a new attack on the numbers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\" title=\"\">students coming to Britain to study</a>. Ms Rudd wants to impose different tests for applicants to different universities and colleges. The net effect is likely to be a cut in the numbers taking shorter courses or attending the post-1992 universities that offer more accessible degree subjects, and a blow to their viability, since international students account for 30% of university revenue. This is a bad policy. It imposes new bureaucratic burdens on all universities, and might seriously undermine newer ones that serve an important local role. It will be hard to enforce. Worse, it is based <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/destination-education\" title=\"\">on flaky and contested evidence</a> about how many students stay after they have completed their course of study: last year, just 11,100 people who previously held study visas <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/non-european-student-migration-to-the-uk/\" title=\"\">were granted extensions to remain in the UK</a> in a category other than study. But the government relies on the International Passenger Survey, which suggests as many as 100,000 international students might stay on. With such a dubious evidence base, it seems unlikely that these latest moves will dent the net migration figures \u2013 while further souring an atmosphere where anti-migrant attacks already appear legitimised by the Brexit campaign. A sceptical public will have yet more evidence that migration is a problem the politicians cannot solve.</p> <p>Mrs May\u2019s Home Office legacy is the Immigration Act 2016, a piece of legislation expressly intended to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/blog/2016/05/23/what%E2%80%99s-next-hostile-environment-immigration-act-2016-and-queen%E2%80%99s-speech\" title=\"\">a hostile environment for illegal migration</a>\u201d. Ms Rudd is on to it, announcing that the measures criminalising landlords who let property to illegal migrants and introducing compulsory immigration status checks on all taxi drivers will be in force by the end of the year. She made one positive announcement: a new \u201ccontrolling migration\u201d fund, at \u00a3140m nearly three times bigger than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal last week. But along with supporting hard-pressed public services, the fund will be used to help councils stamp down on wrongly claimed housing benefit and rough sleeping.</p> <p>Of the great humanitarian crisis engulfing millions of refugees, or the slow progress on uniting unaccompanied children with their British-based families, Ms Rudd said not a word. And every time a minister announces a crackdown on illegal migration, they add to the impression of an ill-defined, uncontrolled threat. Ms Rudd was a banker. She should know the value of robust evidence and reliable statistics. That is the only basis for policy.</p>",
  "<p>Ian Birrell, in an otherwise illuminating article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/tory-ukip-meeting-theresa-may-brexit-vote-immigration\" title=\"\">The delirium of these Tories: it\u2019s like a Ukip convention</a>, 4 October), says that in the forthcoming article 50 negotiations, to be triggered by Theresa May before the end of March, Britain \u201cwill have just two years to sort a trade deal with a bloc of 27 nations\u201d. In fact those negotiations are to be about the terms of UK withdrawal: only after the UK has withdrawn from the EU, probably some time in 2019, can negotiations on a substantive trade deal with the EU begin, and a trade agreement of that complexity is bound to take yet more years to conclude.</p> <p>If only Mrs May had left open the timing of the article 50 trigger, she could have had some leverage with the rest of the EU in seeking a prior understanding about a \u201cframework for [Britain\u2019s] future relationship with the Union\u201d which the withdrawal negotiations are required by article 50 to \u201ctake account of\u201d \u2013 an impossibility if even an outline framework of the future relationship has not yet been worked out. This would have enabled our government to insist that the withdrawal agreement to be negotiated under article 50 must include an interim trade agreement to cover the years after Brexit while a permanent trade agreement is being negotiated. It would also have provided an opportunity, once the \u201cframework\u201d for future relations was known, for the British people to say, before the trigger is pulled, whether the terms on offer after Brexit would be better for British interests than remaining in the EU on our existing terms.</p> <p>But by committing herself to pulling the trigger within a mere five months (including the Christmas holidays), the prime minister has thrown away her sole source of leverage, and with it the opportunity to get a better idea of what Brexit will actually involve before she burns our boats.

Not a good start.<br><strong>Brian Barder</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 When free movement of people is presented as a non-negotiable feature of the European Union, it is well to remember that such movement can in some circumstances be limited. When 10 new nations joined the EU, existing members were offered transitional controls. For a period they could limit the number of migrants from those newly acceding states. The UK declined this facility, though France, Germany and Italy all chose to exercise the right, which expired in 2011. The offer of transitional control demonstrates that free movement of people is not an inviolable principle. Elections are imminent in Germany and France. Anti-immigration challengers face Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande. It seems likely that in self-defensive mode the French and German governments will decide that some temporary dilution of free movement is justified by events. How pointless Brexit will then be seen to be.<br><strong>David Butler</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 You point out that under the Good Friday agreement all citizens in the north are entitled to an Irish and therefore an EU passport (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/ireland-to-seek-special-status-to-keep-open-border-with-uk-amid-hard-brexit-fears\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland could veto Brexit, Belfast high court told</a>, theguardian.com, 4 October). Under that agreement\u2019s principle of consent, any change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland must be \u201csubject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland\u201d. As you also point out, 56% of Northern&#xa0;Irish voters backed remain. The British government has accepted that the right to self-determination applies in any decision on whether Northern Ireland should leave the UK and join a united Ireland. Arguably withdrawal from the EU will have greater immediate consequences for the people of the north than any decision on reunification.

  "<p>The pound has fallen to a 31-year low amid signs that the UK government is leading the country into a hard exit from the European Union. At the same time, the FTSE 100 \u2013 Britain\u2019s most prestigious stock market index \u2013 is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">close to reaching an all time high</a>. Why is Britain\u2019s currency suffering while shares in its biggest companies are soaring? </p> <h2>Why has the pound fallen?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">Theresa May sent a strong signal on Sunday</a> that curbs on immigration were more important than remaining inside the EU\u2019s single market. Investors take a dim view of the UK pulling out of the EU\u2019s tariff-free zone. They also don\u2019t like the notion of restrictions on immigration that deny employers vital staff. Both policies will reduce GDP growth, they believe. </p> <p>Investors began to sell the pound soon after the speech and the momentum increased following a warning from the chancellor of the exchequer on Monday that the next two years will be a difficult time for the economy. On Tuesday, May repeated her warning that a hard Brexit was likely, which provoked another round of selling.</p> <h2>Why, at the same time, is the stock market rising?</h2> <p>There are two key reasons. The first is that many FTSE 100 firms earn their revenues in dollars. Among them are the largest on the London exchange: oil majors BP and Shell; the mining companies BHP Billiton and Anglo American; and banks such as HSBC. As the value of dollars rises versus the pound, the profits of these companies increase. They become more valuable and the stock market goes up as a consequence.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Second, share prices have been increasing all year in response to prevarication by the US central bank, which has struggled to raise interest rates despite signalling a willingness to do so. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are already offering zero or negative interest rates. If the Federal Reserve cannot increase rates from the current 0.5%, then investors must put their money into shares in order to earn a return. </p> <h2>Does it matter that the pound is falling?</h2> <p>The pound was worth $1.55 last October. Now it is hovering around $1.27. A year ago the pound bought \u20ac1.34. Like the dollar, the euro is also stronger and a pound will buy a little less than \u20ac1.12. According to some economists the 20% drop against the dollar and even bigger slide against the euro is a good thing, boosting exports and deterring the consumption of increasingly expensive imports. This gives manufacturing sales a lift and helps the balance of payments, which is in a significant deficit currently. It is also hoped that holidaymakers will want to stay at home, spending their money in British resorts and not continental destinations.</p> <p>The alternative view is that the pound\u2019s value is a measure of the country\u2019s worth relative to other nations and the recent falls means the UK is probably not the fifth largest economy in the world anymore, but the sixth or seventh.</p> <h2>Can the pound fall too far?</h2> <p>A trap door might open under sterling should the Tory messaging around a hard Brexit be taken as a sure sign that Britain will be shut out of the single market altogether. The pound almost reached parity with the dollar in the mid 1980s, but only for a brief period. It would be considered by most economists to be a huge vote of no confidence in the economy if there was a repetition.</p> <h2>Is the stock market too high?</h2> <p>The MSCI index of global stock markets is around the same level as before the 2008 financial crash. This is a huge worry, especially when much of the money in stocks and shares in the UK, the US, Japan and Frankfurt is invested by default. In other words, it is invested by fund managers who cannot get a decent return on other assets, especially corporate and government bonds. Therefore, the rising value of global stock markets is not related to profits, which are flat or declining, but just the welter of cash pouring into the exchanges. If there is an economic shock of some kind, it could trigger a panic, and then markets would have a long way to fall. </p>",
  "<p>UK stock markets soared on Tuesday, helped by a slump in the pound as it fell to a new 31-year low against the dollar amid growing fears that Britain could leave the single market after Brexit.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s leading companies \u2013 which is dominated by companies that earn revenues in dollars \u2013 surged to 7,074.34, closing at its highest level since the record finish of 7,104 in April 2015.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cIt seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline ... and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: \u201cA move down to $1.25, and even $1.20 is now a possibility ... The all-time low for the pound/dollar from March 1985 is $1.05. We don\u2019t expect to return to these lows; back in 1985 the pound only briefly dipped to $1.05 before recovering sharply.\u201d </p> <p>But the weakness in the pound helped lift the international companies and exporters which dominate the FTSE 100, making their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and boosting their profits.</p> <p>Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at fund manager Aviva Investors, said the market was being driven by different factors to a year ago, when optimism over the health of the eurozone helped push shares upwards. He said: \u201cThe dynamics driving the index towards a record high are different from [2015], when we last witnessed the index go over 7,000. Then it was about falling oil prices and optimism on the eurozone recovery. This time, it materially revolves around currency ... Overseas earners benefit from the translation of these earnings back to sterling, leading to a succession of companies upgrading their earnings forecasts for currency alone.\u201d</p> <p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/ftse-100-near-record-high-pound-31-year-low\">index of Britain\u2019s 100 largest listed companies closed up 90.82 points or 1.3% to reach 7074.34</a>, a revival of 28% since it hit a 2016 low of 5537 in February.

This, at least, suggests Continuity Osborne. The cuts ordered by the former chancellor are still there. Nothing Green said today suggested any material change to the broad thrust of Tory welfare strategy: the cuts to universal credit work allowances remain; nasty Cameron-era wheezes such as the benefit cap stay (though no longer warrant a mention); pensioner benefits will be protected.</p> <p>The centrepiece of Green\u2019s speech was work and disability. It\u2019s been18 months since the Tories ambitiously promised in their 2015 election general manifesto to halve the disability employment gap, but it is still not clear how they will achieve it. Halving the gap means getting over a million more disabled and chronically ill people into a job by 2020. Ministers no longer seem to mention that figure anymore. Duncan-Smith promised a disability employment white paper in January, but his successor Stephen Crabb halted it. Green promises a green paper \u201csoon\u201d.

So in return we will ask all new doctors to work for the NHS for four years, just as army recruits are asked to after their training.</p> <p>The result will be more home grown doctors and fewer rota gaps in a safer NHS looking after you and your family for years to come.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7898ddfba40d017ad561fe8dc12dc0e1e9dc43b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7898ddfba40d017ad561fe8dc12dc0e1e9dc43b/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt making his speech to the Conservative conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt making his speech to the Conservative conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3bca6e4b05e7633c585f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T14:32:33.810Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Green party has condemned Amber Rudd\u2019s plans to curb immigration.

And she delivered what was probably the most policy-rich speech delivered to the conference so far.</p> <p>Rudd mostly focused on immigration. She said people sent a clear message to politicians when they voted to leave the EU and she said the government was committed to getting net migration down to sustainable levels. \u201cThis means tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Specifically she announced plans to cut the number of people coming to the UK to work or to study. (Until the UK leaves the EU these proposals would only affect migrants from outside the EU.)</p> <p>She also announced a controlling migration fund, an idea that has also been proposed by Labour.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rudd announced that she was setting up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund. </strong>Jeremy Corbyn is committed to bringing back the migration impact fund (created by Labour but scrapped by the coalition) and at the Labour conference last week he suggested it might be worth \u00a350m over two years. Rudd said her proposal would go further.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have heard that Jeremy Corbyn wants the government to bring back a migration fund Gordon Brown introduced after Labour let immigration spiral out of control ...</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was ineffective and focused funding on migrants rather than the pressures caused by migration ...</p> <p>We will deliver on our manifesto commitment and set up a new \u00a3140m controlling migration fund \u2013 designed specifically to ease the pressures on public services in areas of high migration.</p> <p>And at the same time it will implement strategies to reduce illegal immigration.</p> <p>The fund will build on work we have done to support local authorities \u2026to stop giving housing benefit to people that have no right to be in the country \u2026 to reduce rough sleeping by illegal immigrants \u2026 and to crack down on the rogue landlords who house illegal migrants in the most appalling conditions.</p> <p>And for those that are here legally, we will provide more English language support. And with it, the obvious benefits of being able to join the way of life in the country they have chosen to call home.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would consult on plans to make it harder for firms to bring in foreign workers.</strong> The Home Office would soon be consulting on measures to curb immigration, focusing on changes to the rules for the work and study routes, she said. On work she said she would be \u201cexamining whether we should tighten the test companies have to take before recruiting from abroad.\u201d</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>British businesses have driven the economic recovery in this country, with employment at record levels.</p> <p>However we still need to do more \u2026 so all British people get the opportunities they need to get on in life.</p> <p>The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she wanted to toughen the immigration rules for foreign students studying at low quality colleges.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will also look for the first time at whether our student immigration rules should be tailored to the quality of the course and the quality of the educational institution.</p> <p>I\u2019m proud that we have world-leading centres of academic excellence. It\u2019s a testament to our country\u2019s proud history and our top universities\u2019 ability to evolve.</p> <p>But the current system allows all students, irrespective of their talents and the university\u2019s quality, favourable employment prospects when they stop studying.</p> <p>While an international student is studying here, their family members can do any form of work.</p> <p>And foreign students, even those studying English Language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one size fits all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities, providing thousands of different courses across the country ...</p> <p>Our consultation will ask what more can we do to support our best universities - and those that stick to the rules - to attract the best talent \u2026 while looking at tougher rules for students on lower quality courses.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the government would make it easier to deport foreign criminals. </strong>EU migrants who repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes will be deported, she said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the first time, we will deport EU nationals that repeatedly commit so-called minor crimes in this country.</p> <p>So-called minor crime is still crime \u2013 its pain is still felt deeply by victims.</p> <p>Well, those criminals will face being banned from coming back to the country from between 5 and 10 years.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would soon be implementing legislation already passed to tighten controls on immigrants in the UK.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, I am announcing that from December, landlords that knowingly rent out property to people who have no right to be here will be committing a criminal offence.

Today she said she would press ahead with the reform programme outlined by her predecessor, Michael Gove, whom she praised. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the coming weeks I will be launching my vision for prison reform to 2020 and beyond. </p> <p>This white paper will be a blueprint for the biggest overhaul of our prisons in a generation and we will legislate for these reforms early next year. </p> </blockquote> <p>The reforms will focus on rehabilitation, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prisoners are often the most damaging people in society but they are also often the most damaged.</p> <p>More than half can\u2019t read or write to a basic standard, half have mental health problems and nearly two thirds of women offenders are victims of abuse. </p> <p>Reform is the only way to break the cycle, to cut the cost to society and to spare more people the misery of being a victim of crime.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said she would be giving prison staff more time to directly supervise offenders. </strong>\u201cThis one-to-one support, which will be rolled out to every prison, is vital in bringing down levels of violence and reforming offenders,\u201d she said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/07/liz-truss-puts-prison-reform-plans-put-on-hold\"><strong>She announced a campaign to get more ex-servicemen and women to become prison officers.</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She called for more diversity on the supreme court and at the top of the legal profession generally.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The supreme court is a vital part of our constitution and I cherish its independence.</p> <p> But can it be right that out of 12 judges in the supreme court only one is a woman and not a single one is from an ethnic minority?

May did not answer directly, although she did say that she had always argued that the sky would not fall in if Britain did leave the EU. She was now focused on the future, she said. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f35082e4b03ca720ca2479#block-57f35082e4b03ca720ca2479\"> 7.50am.)</a></p> <p><strong>5 - What she thinks about Donald Trump. </strong>On Good Morning Britain <strong>Piers Morgan </strong>reminded her that she had criticised Trump for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the US.

I\u2019m accustomed to posting about the \u2018things we\u2019ve learnt\u2019 from events like this, but this morning I will do a post about all the things we did not learn from May\u2019s media round.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t entirely unproductive. We did get something out of it. Here are six things about May that we did find out.</p> <p><strong>1 - May says injustice makes her angry.</strong> At the end of his Today interview Nick Robinson asked May what made her argument, saying that this was a question that often revealed what motivated people to go into politics. May did not have to think for long before giving a firm answer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Injustice. What makes me angry? Child sexual abuse. Modern slavery. When we see the powerful abusing their position. That\u2019s what makes me angry.</p> </blockquote> <p>It would be wrong to say that she was fired up with emotion, but she did answer the question with a sincerity and directness that was lacking from her earlier answers. And it is not an answer that David Cameron would have given, at least not with the same level of conviction. Later, on LBC, May was also quite forceful when she explained that she was committed to the child abuse inquiry because she thought some victims had been denied justice for years. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f35af1e4b01506cbf24f74#block-57f35af1e4b01506cbf24f74\">8.35am.)</a></p> <p><strong>2 - May is happy to be seen as a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live?page=with:block-57f35c37e4b01506cbf24f79#block-57f35c37e4b01506cbf24f79\"> 8.44am.)</a></p> <p><strong>3 - May does not mind the media going on about her shoes.</strong> On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain <strong>Susanna Reid</strong> asked May if she thought the obsession with her shoes was sexist. May said she did not object.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it is interesting that people focus on my shoes. I don\u2019t think they focus on Philip Hammond\u2019s or Boris Johnson\u2019s in quite the same way. But, look, do I regret that fact that people look at my shoes? Hey, it gives me an excuse to go and buy new shoes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4 - May seems to be playing down her commitment to building new grammar schools.</strong> She was asked about the policy in various interviews and, although she did not go back on anything previously announced, it was noticeable that she was keen to stress that the policy she is proposing is about much more than building grammar schools. She described the policy in terms of lifting the ban on selection, and said it was only one aspect of a plan to create more good school places. (Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has suggested<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/nicky-morgan-suggests-theresa-may-is-about-to-water-down-gra?utm_term=.cedj8wNreO#.soBQw615D8\"> in a BuzzFeed interview that she thinks the government is about to compromise on its plans.)</a></p> <p><strong>5 - May can make a good impression on interviewers. </strong>At the end of the Good Morning Britain interview <strong>Piers Morgan</strong>, the presenter, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a nice lady, Theresa May.\u201d His co-presenter, <strong>Susanna Reid</strong>, added: \u201cShe\u2019s very open and honest.\u201d It is not the sort of thing John Humphrys would ever say on the Today programme, but it is interesting. I don\u2019t recall Morgan and Reid making comments like that about David Cameron. And at the end of his Sky interview, <strong>Eamonn Holmes</strong> told her he was leaving the show, before adding: \u201cI would like to thank you for all your courtesy through the years, putting up with my banal, inane questioning.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6 - May may not commit to \u201chard\u201d over \u201csoft\u201d regarding Brexit, but she does for cooking. </strong>On Good Morning Britain Morgan asked about cooking scones (May is keen on cooking, and the Sunday Times published a recipe for scones from her at the weekend) and he said she had caused a stir by saying people could use either butter or margarine. Was butter better, he asked. And should it be hard or soft? May replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you have to rub it in with the flour, and it is often easier actually if it is hard, you can get a good rub in. If it is too soft, then it starts to become a bit claggy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/783207428993212416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May vows to be &quot;ambitious&quot; in Brexit talks. &quot;I think it&#39;s not about the UK being a supplicant to the EU.&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/r4today?src=hash\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UxwRNPClIZ\">pic.twitter.com/UxwRNPClIZ</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/783207428993212416\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f36075e4b0643b5d843d2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T08:00:51.309Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some comment from journalists on Theresa May\u2019s interviews.</p> <p>From ITV\u2019s <strong>Robert Peston</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/783207742370639874\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> is an absolute genius at interviews that tell you less about her and her policies than you thought  you knew already</p>&mdash; Robert Peston (@Peston) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/783207742370639874\">October 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>From the Guardian\u2019s <strong>Peter Walker</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/783206065211056128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With best will in the world, pretty much all Theresa May&#39;s R4 answers on Brexit were meaningless platitudes.

Everybody gets it wrong from time to time. Only the inveterate fence sitters are spared having egg on their face.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund certainly knows what it is like to make a mistake. In the run-up to the EU referendum, the IMF made a series of interventions warning voters of the dire consequences that would follow a vote to leave.</p> <p>At first, the IMF stuck to long-term forecasts, saying investment and trade would eventually be weaker if the UK divorced from the other 27 members of the EU. But as the referendum neared and the vote was on a knife-edge, the warnings became more lurid. The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">would immediately start sliding into recession</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">House prices would crumble. Shares would crash</a>.</p> <p>So what do you do if your forecasts turn out to be a little wide of the mark? Either you put your hands up and admit you were wrong. Or you brazen it out. You say that it is too early to say. You say that eventually you will come right.</p> <p>No prizes for guessing which option the IMF has taken. Its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO) report says the UK will do fine in 2016 but is going to find the going a lot tougher in 2017.</p> <p>This is a perfectly respectable view, and one held by a host of academic, business and City economists. Had the IMF stuck to this sort of assessment throughout the referendum campaign, it would have saved itself embarrassment now. As it is, it will get some stick from those who thought the Washington-based fund had overstepped the mark in its support for the remain camp.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/imf-peak-pessimism-brexit-eu-referendum-european-union-international-monetary-fund\">IMF left shamefaced after peak pessimism over Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f3ac35e4b0d3973ef5f809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-04T13:21:24.999Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF singles out the UK\u2019s referendum as a key factor hurting global growth, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere is a more subdued outlook for advanced economies following the June U.K. vote in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit) and weaker-than-expected growth in the United States.</p> <p>These developments have put further downward pressure on global interest rates, as monetary policy is now expected to remain accommodative for longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also cites China\u2019s economic rebalancing, and a general slowdown in trade growth since 2012.

  "<p>Offenders could have their sweat tested for alcohol or have their movements tracked using GPS tagging under community sentencing plans announced by the Scottish government.<br></p> <p>The roll-out of new tagging technology, including transdermal alcohol monitoring, which tests the amount of ethanol in sweat, was one of the recommendations of a working group of experts which the Scottish government will now implement.</p> <p>Announcing the programme, the justice secretary, Michael Matheson, linked the SNP government\u2019s development of effective community interventions with a reconviction rate that is at a 17-year low, driven largely by a decline in youth reoffending. </p> <p>Matheson said: \u201cThere will always be crimes where a prison sentence is the only reasonable response, but international research backs our own experience that short-term sentences are not the most effective way to bring down reoffending.\u201d</p> <p>The group of experts included the pioneering violence reduction authority Karyn McCluskey, who was last month appointed chief executive of the new body Community Justice Scotland and tasked with spearheading a further drive to reduce reoffending.</p> <p>The Stirling University criminologist Hannah Graham, who carried out the report studies, said: \u201cThe recommendation to introduce electronic monitoring as an alternative to remand opens up extra opportunities to address [the high numbers of people on remand in prison] by closely monitoring and supporting more people in the community pre-trial, without losing sight of the need to ensure public safety.\u201d</p> <p>Taking evidence from Dutch and Scandinavian models of tagging, the working group also recommended that electronic monitoring should be part of a wider package of support delivered locally.</p> <p>But Graham added: \u201cTagging and curfews alone don\u2019t address the underlying reasons why people commit crime, so the working group\u2019s recommendations are welcome for how they emphasise integration with rehabilitative supports to help leave crime behind.\u201d<br></p> <p>Noting that alcohol is a factor in more than half of violent crimes in Scotland, Alison Douglas, the chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, responded that \u201cthe use of sobriety tags must be part of a much broader programme of support for offenders to address their drinking problems\u201d.</p> <p>While GPS has been piloted with some success in immigration cases and for use with child sex offenders who have completed custodial sentences in the rest of the UK, a spokesperson said that the Scottish government intended to look at the implications of using tagging more widely, rather than narrow the focus on specific offences.</p>",
  "<p>David Davis has dismissed the idea that he and other prominent leave campaigners were put in charge of Brexit so they could be held responsible if it went wrong, saying \u201cthere will be plenty of blame to go round\u201d if that were to happen.</p> <p>Speaking on the fringes of the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, the Brexit secretary said it was \u201cconspiracy stuff\u201d to believe Theresa May appointed him, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, with that in mind.</p> <p>Davis said: \u201cIf it goes wrong, the whole government will be blamed. If it goes right there will be much more than enough credit to go round, and if it goes wrong there will be plenty of blame to go round. But I don\u2019t worry about all that.\u201d</p> <p>Davis gave a predictably bullish account of how he expected the UK\u2019s EU exit to play out, saying London did not have to fear losing its prominent position in financial services.</p> <p>He said much of this was down to the anglophone culture of the finance world, and the lifestyle available in the capital. Davis added: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dreaming going on by our competition who don\u2019t really know the issues we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>While Davis gave no clues as to what he expected the technicalities of Brexit to look like, he did give a definition of what he believed would be a measure of its success.</p> <p>\u201cThe sort of basic metric is to have a very free, very unfettered trading relationship with Europe, but an even bigger, even freer trading relationship with the rest of the world,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd the economy in a better position than it is \u2013 not just for one year, but strategically in a better position.\u201d<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, Davis said he had predicted a win for the leave side two months before the referendum on 23 June, and had even won \u201ca little bit of money\u201d by placing a bet on the 52% to 48% victory margin.<br></p> <p>The Brexit secretary also said he came to support May for prime minister \u2013 he had first backed Johnson \u201cfor about five minutes\u201d \u2013 after receiving an assurance that limiting immigration would be her main task.</p> <p>\u201cI went to see her and I asked if she was going to put control of the borders as her top priority, as that was the issue,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd she did, she said yes. And I said I\u2019d support her.\u201d</p> <p>Davis also said that on the day he was appointed Brexit secretary, he had almost missed the opportunity by turning off his phone. He had switched it off after getting numerous calls about his House of Commons motion to censure Tony Blair over the Chilcot findings \u2013 and had gone for a drink with an aide.</p> <p> He added: \u201cAt about 7.30pm she said, \u2018Twitter\u2019s saying you\u2019re at No 10. I laughed \u2013 I picked up my glass of wine and said, take a photograph and show them I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, he turned on his phone to find \u201ca great stream of text messages from No 10, and you could see the pitch of the messages going up \u2013 \u2018please call No 10\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Davis recalled that the prime minister gave him a choice about the name of his new department, saying: \u201cShe said, \u2018We\u2019re creating a department which we\u2019re thinking of calling the Department for leaving the European Union or the Department for exiting the European Union.\u2019 I laughed and said, \u2018Make it exiting, we can call it Department X.\u2019 It never caught on.\u201d</p>",

The argument faded, the group dispersed, no blows were exchanged. It should have been the end of the matter, but someone had been disrespected.</p> <p>Shortly after, a group of boys, including Conteh, decided to travel to Home Park in Sydenham. It was summer and the park was buzzing. A stand-off ensued between the Sydenham Boys and the SG group, and Conteh, not wishing to fight, saw a discarded bike from the rival group and made off with it, away from the confrontation. This is supported by CCTV footage.</p> <p>Nicholas Pearton, 16, a member of the Sydenham Boys, showed up late and became isolated. He ran out of the park and across the main road, pursued by SG members. He was stabbed in the back, ran into a takeaway shop, and died minutes later.</p> <p>His murder featured in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jul/07/common-guilty-by-association-legal-system-drama-documentaries\">BBC One documentary Guilty by Association,</a> highlighting Conteh\u2019s conviction and that of another who remained behind inside the park, Joseph Appiah, 16, who was convicted of murder under joint enterprise, despite being 200 yards away at the time of the stabbing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Edward came home that day it was very late,\u201d Conteh\u2019s mother, Memunatu, <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/03/31/case-study-edward-conteh-trip-to-the-park-ends-in-homicide-conviction/\">explained to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>. \u201cWhen I saw Edward\u2019s face there was panic. I asked what happened and he said, \u2018Mummy, they said my friends stabbed someone\u2019.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Conteh\u2019s mother met Gloria Morrison, who heads the campaign group <a href=\"http://www.jointenterprise.co/\">Jengba (Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association)</a> and asked if she could help. Jengba is a grassroots campaign group formed in 2010 by four angry women. It is currently supporting more than 700 prisoners \u201cwrongfully imprisoned\u201d under the law of joint enterprise.</p> <p>Under the 300-year-old law, a second person who did not deliver the fatal blow can be convicted if they can be shown to have foreseen the possibility that another person may inflict serious harm. They do not need to intend the harm themselves, or even physically participate in it.</p> <p>This substantially low threshold of guilt has enabled thousands to be convicted of murder and sentenced to long prison terms, released on parole only if remorse is shown.</p> <p>However, even if \u201cforesight\u201d cannot be proven, if the defendant was associated with the crime in some way \u2013 ie presence at the scene or a friendship with the principal protagonist \u2013 they can still be convicted of manslaughter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He will be abandoned in Belgium this Thursday, leaving behind his parents and four younger siblings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is what happened to Conteh when he was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. A psychologist at the trial testified that his abnormally low IQ meant he was unable to foresee consequences like others, therefore would not have been able to foresee that another might use a knife to inflict serious harm.</p> <p>Conteh had almost lost all chance of clearing his name when, in February, the supreme court declared that joint enterprise had been misapplied by the judiciary for 30 years. The lack of any intention or foresight of the harm caused to Pearton would render his conviction unsafe.</p> <p>Conteh now has a good chance to appeal his conviction. Despite having served his sentence, he is still haunted by being labelled a killer. His appeal has been lodged at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-cases-review-commission\">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a>, but as a foreign national convicted of a crime he will now be deported back to Belgium without any family or even a place to stay.</p> <p>Jengba has supported Conteh while in prison and in the detention centre in Dover throughout his many deportation hearings. A judge at one hearing noted that joint enterprise was a \u201cvery controversial area of law\u201d and accepted the view of the original trial judge that there were mitigating circumstances, as outlined in a probation report: \u201cHe did not plan the trip to Sydenham and was more likely to be a follower than a leader in what took place in Home Park. His age, good character, borderline intelligence and abnormally compliant personality are mitigating features in his case.\u201d</p> <p>However, Conteh is still an offender, so his appeal against deportation was refused, despite his probation officer\u2019s views that he is a low risk to the public. Held securely in a deportation centre, travel documents in hand, he will be abandoned in Belgium this Thursday, leaving behind his parents and four younger siblings and the country that he calls home. If the Home Office stays his deportation, Conteh will have a chance to clear his name. Justice must prevail.</p> <p>\u2022 To ask for a stay of deportation to give Edward Conteh a chance to appeal his conviction, write to the Home Office minister for immigration, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-robert-goodwill/1562\">Robert Goodwill</a></p>",

She said that while an international student was studying in Britain, their family members could do any form of work.</p> <p>\u201cAnd foreign students, even those studying English language degrees, don\u2019t even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one-size-fits-all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities providing thousands of different courses across the country. And we need to look at whether this generous offer for all universities is really adding value to our economy,\u201d said the home secretary.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m passionately committed to making sure our world-leading institutions can attract the brightest and the best. But a student immigration system that treats every student and university as equal only punishes those we should want to help. So our consultation will ask what more can we do to support our best universities \u2013 and those that stick to the rules \u2013 to attract the best talent \u2026 while looking at tougher rules for students on lower quality courses.\u201d</p> <p>The plans were condemned as \u201cspectacularly ill-informed\u201d and \u201can act of madness\u201d by Paul Blomfield, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international students.</p> <p>Responding to Rudd\u2019s conference speech, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said: \u201cI\u2019m shocked by the home secretary\u2019s comments, which are spectacularly ill-informed.<br></p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to know how many universities we have in the UK or understand the current rules for which she is responsible, let alone appreciate the enormous contribution international students make to the universities and cities where they study.<br></p> <p>\u201cInternational students bring \u00a38bn a year to the UK economy, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the economy.

Ministers need to take a very different approach and support universities by removing international students from the net migration target altogether.\u201d</p> <p>Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK responded to Rudd\u2019s proposed changes by stressing the quality and diversity of British university courses and saying that the overwhelming majority of overseas students went home at the end of their studies. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe diversity of institutions and the range of high-quality courses offered is one of the many strengths of our university sector. Any criteria must reflect that diversity. The criteria must also support the critical role that many universities play in their regions, where the impact of international students directly supports regional economies, supplies high level graduate skills and ensures the sustainability of many courses at regional level,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cPolling has shown that the British public does not see international students as long-term migrants, but as valuable, temporary visitors. International students come to the UK, study for a period, and then the overwhelming majority go home after their studies,\u201d she added, disputing their inclusion in the net migration target.</p> <p>Rudd said the process of bringing skilled workers to Britain from outside Europe had become a box-ticking exercise, allowing some firms to get away with not training local people. \u201cWe won\u2019t win in the world if we don\u2019t do more to upskill our own workforce. It\u2019s not fair on companies doing the right thing. So I want us to look again at whether our immigration system provides the right incentives for businesses to invest in British workers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The review is likely to look again at the resident market labour test and ensure that job vacancies are advertised locally in Britain and not just abroad among potential migrant staff.</p> <p>Rudd said the \u201ccontrolling migration fund\u201d would be designed specifically to ease the pressure on public services in areas of high migration. It replaces a Labour migration impact fund, which was scrapped in 2010 as ineffective. The fund would also be used in the government\u2019s stated drive to \u201ccreate a hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d, she said.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund had spent money on translation services rather than English lessons, the home secretary said, and councils were given money to promote recycling rather than the support they needed to ease housing pressures.<br></p> <p>Labour\u2019s fund was financed by a \u00a350-a-head levy on visas. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Labour\u2019sthe party\u2019s new proposal \u2013 an impact fund of \u00a350m over two years \u2013 would also be financed by a levy on citizenship applications. Rudd did not spell out where the \u00a3140m would come from.</p> <p>The Home Office said the \u00a3140m fund would be spent over the remaining three-and-a-half years of the current parliament. English local authorities would shortly be invited to bid for \u00a3100m of the fund to manage a range of issues associated with sudden and high levels of migration such as securing community cohesion, providing English language teaching or tackling overcrowded properties.</p> <p>The remaining \u00a340m would be set aside to fund immigration enforcement activity in areas of high migration, including targeting and removing illegal immigrants living in overcrowded accommodation or sleeping rough who are resistant to finding proper accommodation or returning home.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said it sounded as if the prime minister had had a heavy hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard these conference promises on net migration and child migrants before and they haven\u2019t come to anything \u2013 people will take them with a pinch of salt. On Theresa May\u2019s watch, net migration reached record levels. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ab6fa93efae9832504584e714e6d380de40768/0_168_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Burnham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Burnham said it sounded as if Theresa May had a hand in drafting Rudd\u2019s speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAmber Rudd is right to introduce a scheme to help communities address the pressures of migration, as Jeremy Corbyn called for last week. But she had depressingly little to say about the largest humanitarian crisis since the second world war and failed to repeat the commitment to taking a share of adult refugees.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors also expressed disappointment at Rudd\u2019s announcement. \u201cThere are different ways to control immigration and we should see Brexit as a chance to design a system which addresses local concerns, without damaging business or universities,\u201d said Seamus Nevin, the institute\u2019s head of employment and skills.</p> <p>\u201cStaying on the current course will end up satisfying no one. Net immigration will likely stay above 100,000, while firms and the public sector struggle to fill skills gaps, making it harder for them to navigate the uncertainty of the coming Brexit negotiations.\u201d</p> <p>Addressing a fringe event, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, hinted that employers might be obliged in any future work permit system to seek a British national to fill a job before they could employ someone from overseas.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is not to write immigration policy,\u201d Davis said in answer to a question on the worries among businesses about finding sufficient unskilled labour. \u201cMy job is to get the powers back here so we can decide. That is the first thing to understand. Once you do that, the government will make its decision on how it runs its immigration policy.\u201d</p> <p>Davis said that any solution would not be immediate and would be up to May and Rudd. He said: \u201cIf they go down a route of having work permits for example, typically the way work permits work in other countries is you get to say, try to get a British citizen first and, if you haven\u2019t, then you have got to do that first. There will be tests like that.</p> <p>\u201cBut the other side of this is we have to make sure that our own population are ready and equipped to work, whether it is low-skilled work \u2013 and that is about motivation and about commitment to work. If it is higher skilled it is about education, which is why the other part of Theresa\u2019s concerns about society are very important in this context. But at the end of the day nobody is going to have an off switch.\u201d</p>",

Towards the end of the day Obama emerged from the White House on to the lawn to join the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe from Texas Tech University for a conversation tied to the release of DiCaprio\u2019s new climate change documentary, Before the Flood, which received its US premiere at SXSL. </p> <p>DiCaprio, who served as the moderator, drew cheers from the crowd when he opened the conversation with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/04/leonardo-dicaprio-climate-change-donald-trump-before-the-flood-documentary\">not-so-subtle jab at Donald Trump</a>, saying: \u201cIf you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts or in science or empirical truths, and therefore, in my humble opinion, you should not be allowed to hold public office.\u201d (Earlier in the day, Trump named <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/26/trumps-transition-team-includes-a-major-skeptic-of-mainstream-climate-change-science/?utm_term=.2b67747bd54f\">a well-known climate denier to lead his transition team</a> for the Environmental Protection Agency.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60dabaaf06270424c8a6139e4360c9a9abe2a64b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60dabaaf06270424c8a6139e4360c9a9abe2a64b/0_63_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama discusses climate change with scientist Katharine Hayhoe and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama discusses climate change with scientist Katharine Hayhoe and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the discussion, Obama framed climate change as a looming national security threat \u2013 and suggested climate deniers lack patriotism. He noted that droughts and changing weather patterns had the potential to displace hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable countries, exacerbating the refugee crisis and sparking new international conflicts. He cited early research suggesting that drought in Syria may have contributed to the country\u2019s extreme civil unrest. </p> <p>Obama suggested Republicans who don\u2019t take climate change seriously are out of sync with the nation\u2019s military leaders. \u201cWe have members of Congress who scoff at climate change at the same time as they are saluting, wearing flag pins and extolling their patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying attention to our joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagon, who are saying that this is one of the most significant national security threats that we face in the next 50 years.\u201d</p> <p>With less than four months to go before the Obama era officially comes to an end, the president and his inner coterie are clearly already contemplating life after the White House. \u201cThe president is very interested in building momentum outside Washington through change that becomes sustainable. That comes from people, building from the ground up,\u201d Jarrett told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd73acc9942fdd3ea0bfcca28e0f881b43a7d3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd73acc9942fdd3ea0bfcca28e0f881b43a7d3bc/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Participants write suggestions on the \u2018To Do\u2019 board during the South by South Lawn event at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants write suggestions on the \u2018To Do\u2019 board during the South by South Lawn event at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Lewis, who proudly invoked his record of having been jailed 40 times in the 1960s during the civil rights movement and five more times since he became a member of Congress in 1987, exhorted the young South Lawn invaders to become the non-violent change-makers of the new generation.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the internet, we didn\u2019t have fax machines, we didn\u2019t have social media,\u201d he said just a stone\u2019s throw from the virtual and augmented reality booths. \u201cBut through the actions of thousands of young people in America we made change happen, and now it\u2019s your turn to pick up where we left off.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the darkest days of January, after I had taken up the decking and dug a hole to plant my apple tree, a robin became the first visitor to my newly-made wildlife garden. </p> <p>She appeared in a flash on top of the fence, flew to the wall and then spotted me and darted off again. She had been here before, I realised, perhaps lured by the recently unveiled earth and its unearthed worms, or the new compost heap, or even the hanging feeder with its diminishing quantity of sunflower hearts. (Robins have only recently learned to use hanging feeders. And you can tell \u2013 they look ridiculous.) </p> <p>She hung around for a few days, standing stock-still on her skinny stick legs, watching me turn the earth. Sometimes she would dive down and eat worms and other grubs, other times she stayed on the wall, brown legs splayed, bobbing up and down. Once I spotted her on the apple she had watched me plant, twiggy like her, a feathered maiden. After the apple I planted two climbing roses. Then I put a robin nest box up \u2013 an optimistic effort, considering the garden was still 90<strong>%</strong> mud and stones.</p> <p>In spring she disappeared. During the next few months the garden grew; I got rid of the last bits of decking and stones, dug a pond. Everything turned green. The house sparrows became regular visitors, but the robin \u2013 or any robin \u2013 never came back. I didn\u2019t even hear one. </p> <p>And then, yesterday, she returned. I had dug and planted a new border and was busy mulching it with home-made compost. Everything was little red brandling worms and leaf litter, which I tucked under the leaves of newly transplanted foxgloves and around dying clumps of whatever would come back next year. There she was, suddenly, picking around the mulch, taking worms. She worked at my feet, untroubled by me and my fork, and almost took a worm from my hand. She stayed with me all afternoon, exploring the apple tree and the roses and the pond and the lawn \u2013 a habitat. I liked to think she approved of the progress since all the mud and stones.</p> <p>I\u2019m fairly sure \u201cmy robin\u201d is a winter migrant. To disappear in spring like that and return in autumn suggests she has another territory elsewhere. Most robins are sedentary, but some migrate for winter, often over the Channel, while British residents are sometimes joined by those from Scandinavia. I think this one is British \u2013 Scandinavian birds tend to be less used to humans and are therefore much more wary of us; I had winter robins and blackbirds in my previous garden in London, and they skulked under the shrubbery, flying off the second they saw me. This one seems far less shy. </p> <p>Of course, it could be two robins \u2013 January\u2019s may have died and October\u2019s could be a young one, exploring new territories. But, regardless, it\u2019s a new bird in my garden and I\u2019m happy to have it. The mulch will provide weeks of worms and other morsels, and there\u2019s a holly next-door but one, just coming into fruit. There are sunflower hearts both in the hanging feeder and the ground feeder, and a pond and bird bath to bathe in. The apple tree I planted the day I first saw her is just about to lose its first leaves. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Kate Bradbury is building a wildlife garden from scratch on small patch of land in Brighton: read her previous posts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-bradbury\">here</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-vote-on-refugees-will-not-take-place-suggest-first-poll-results\">More than 98% of Hungarians</a> who took to the polls in Sunday\u2019s referendum voted to close the door to refugees. However more than half of the electorate didn\u2019t vote rendering the process constitutionally null and void. We asked our readers what they thought of the result and why more people didn\u2019t vote. Here\u2019s what some of you said.<br></p> <h2>\u2018Orb\u00e1n poses a greater danger than people may realise\u2019</h2> <p>I didn\u2019t vote because not voting helped to nullify the result. Thus I am very happy things turned out the way they did.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n poses a greater danger than people may realise. He sows strife and conflict within the EU where he wants to divide and rule in his bid for ever greater power. Orb\u00e1n is not just a disaster in Hungary, but a very real and dangerous presence in the EU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-referendums-right-questions-wrong-answers\">The Guardian view on referendums: right questions, wrong answers</a> </p> </aside>  <p> I cannot understand why the EU continues to just sit on its hands, while one of its member countries flouts almost all the regulations and rules of its membership. The EU was founded not just on a free and open market economy, but its other raison d\u2019etre was the dissemination and development of democratic norms and principles.<br></p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has used these democratic systems to to undermine democracy itself and as he proudly proclaims, to create an illiberal country where he has become an oligarch. <br></p> <p><em>Anonymous, 67-year-old from Budapest</em></p> <h2>\u2018I don\u2019t agree with this demagogy\u2019<br></h2> <p>I did not participate in this referendum by voting yes or no. I voted invalidly by marking all the possible options in order to spoil my vote. I did this because I wanted to show that I don\u2019t agree with this demagogy. <br></p> <p>I don\u2019t think the quota is the right solution to handle the refugee crisis because I think a strong checkpoint is needed at the borders. But this referendum was not really about asking a question - it was about power. It was a survey of whether the Hungarian government would have enough voters in 2018 or not. <br></p> <p>I am not surprised by the result though I thought the referendum would be valid. I think people decided not to vote because they are fed up with the old world - the authoritarian governments of the past of Hungary. On the other hand, maybe people just did not care about the question. </p> <p><em>Attila Benke, 30-year-old living in Tura </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d996546651f3b4a41715d894ff4e32abae29afc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d996546651f3b4a41715d894ff4e32abae29afc2/0_88_3790_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edit Piros, an ethnic Hungarian from Romania, who moved to Hungary from Transylvania, receives the ballot paper before voting in the referendum in the village of Veresegyhaz, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edit Piros, an ethnic Hungarian from Romania, who moved to Hungary from Transylvania, receives the ballot paper before voting in the referendum in the village of Veresegyhaz, Hungary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vadim Ghirda/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I\u2019m very disappointed by the result\u2019<br></h2> <p>I voted no because I believe in a democratic society. Every person has the right to privacy and to be able to live with who they wish.</p> <p> I do not believe countries outside Europe should be able to force themselves into a country or countries where they do not belong. I am not a racist and I believe the world should look after genuine refugees but not economic migrants. <br></p> <p>I\u2019m very disappointed by the result. The referendum was not meant to be political, but a way of legally finding out how the people in Hungary feel about the migration situation. I think people refused to vote as a way of trying to get Ob\u00e1n Viktor out of office.</p> <p><em>M\u00e1t\u00e9 P\u00e1l, 72-year-old living in the north west of Hungary</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/02/hungarian-right-does-not-want-to-leave-the-eu-it-wants-to-subvert-it\">Hungarian right does not want to leave the EU. It wants to subvert it</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018More people should have spoiled their ballots\u2019<br></h2> <p>I voted by spoiling my ballot. I remember last year when a large crowd of people marched on the street near where I live. They wanted to go to western Europe and when the government banned them from going by train they just set off on foot. I had mixed feelings about them. They were determined, but I also felt like they were being arrogant in the way they left trash all over the road and seemed like they absolutely didn\u2019t care about the citizens of Hungary. Despite all of this I wouldn\u2019t mind if a few people, in moderate numbers, were to resettle in Hungary. </p> <p>I chose to vote in the referendum but I put a cross in both circles, because I think Orb\u00e1n\u2019s time is up. It seems like power has overcome him and, if allowed, would continue to dismantle democracy and the constitutional state if re-elected. So, in my opinion, this referendum wasn\u2019t really about the EU quota but more about the political mood of the country.<br></p> <p>I would be a lot happier if more people had spoiled their ballots. This would have been an obvious message - that the referendum question was improper. I think very few people voted because they thought the question was stupid, and believed there to be no correct answer. However, in Hungary this kind of turnout is pretty average. <br></p> <p><em>Krist\u00f3f V\u00e1rdy, 21-year-old student living in Budapest</em><br></p>",

Famous is when you\u2019re iconic and a legend, I\u2019m just known. But it\u2019s been pretty cool, and I love that people take the time out of their day to come up to me. <br><strong>G:</strong> It\u2019s very flattering. I\u2019m a kid who grew up in a small town and started acting when he was seven for no reason, and got lucky. Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. I feel like some people, especially child stars, act out because they don\u2019t know how to handle the pressure. Unless people are in the shoes of a child actor they don\u2019t realise how difficult it can be at times.

I hoped that we might find a safe haven there. After a year and a half of facing continued hostility in the country, I realized that wouldn\u2019t be the case. That\u2019s when we decided to move to America.</p> <p>The problems in Turkey started early. The cost of living was high, especially the rent. Because I knew no Turkish, I suffered from a lack of social contacts and from having to live without work. My children had a hard time just enrolling in school. </p> <p> After a few days in that beautiful mountain town with its captivating natural vistas, I encountered another, scary face of the city. Whenever I took my children to the nearby park, people would start to laugh and make fun of me and my children. Our skin color differed from theirs, and this prompted mockery.</p> <p>But we faced other abuse, too. Each month when I paid the landlady the rent, she would demand that we loan her money. That money would never be repaid. When I refused to give her this money, she would become angry and raise her voice. She forced us to pay costly bills for water and electricity that we did not consume.</p> <p> One morning, we woke to the heavy blows of pickaxes outside the door. The landlady was with three workmen; they were tearing out the steps to the apartment where I lived. I was furious and contacted the police. They refused to take any action against the woman, who alleged she was renovating the apartment to prepare for her mother\u2019s visit for Eid, an Islamic holiday. She claimed the steps would be rebuilt the next morning.

I never felt comfortable there and began to ask Iraqis in Turkey how to leave for some distant land. They told me I would need to submit an application to the United Nations in Ankara.</p> <p> I had to take my children with me, and so we all went by bus together. The trip lasted many hours. When we reached the UN office, we found a great number of people waiting at the entrance, trying to get inside. After a lengthy wait, we were admitted to a room filled with many people from all over the world.</p> <p> Once we signed in, we were asked why we were requesting humanitarian asylum. I told them my tragic story of how we had to flee Iraq \u2013 and why. They said they would telephone me to conduct a second interview. After that second interview, there was a third. Then we were recommended for resettlement in America; so there was an interview with American representatives.

  "<p>Authorities in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut are considering new regulations on marine tourism after the first successful voyage of a mammoth luxury liner through the North-West Passage.<br></p> <p>Nearly three football fields in length, the 13-deck Crystal Serenity docked in Manhattan last month after a 32-day voyage that saw it become the largest cruise ship to sail the once impenetrable passage. Staffed by more than 600 crew members and at times accompanied by an icebreaker ship and two helicopters, the cruise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\">capitalised on rising temperatures and steadily receding sea ice</a> to navigate the frigid Arctic waters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\">A new Titanic? US and Canada prepare for worst as luxury Arctic cruise sets sail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sold-out voyage left authorities in Canada\u2019s north bracing for a boom in tourism. \u201cNow that marine tourism is a significant and steadily growing presence in the territory,\u201d said Bernie MacIsaac of Nunavut\u2019s department of economic development, \u201cit is important that new legislation be created that will effectively regulate the sector.\u201d</p> <p>As the Serenity made its way through largely uncharted waters, the cruise\u2019s more than 1,000 passengers \u2013 each of whom paid between $22,000 (C$29,000) and $120,000 (C$157,000) \u2013 stopped in at several Inuit villages for a glimpse of Arctic life.</p> <p>The itinerary included Cambridge Bay, population 1,500. Although the hamlet has been a regular stop on the northern cruise ship circuit for more than two decades, the Serenity eclipsed the small cruise vessels that have previously stopped there, said Vicki Aitaok, a local tour operator who coordinated the visit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how it would impact us or how we would feel about the day.\u201d </p> <p>More than two years of planning went into the visit, during which tourists were brought in on Zodiac inflatable boats in groups of 150 so as not to overwhelm residents. The passengers \u2013 regaled with drum dancers, throat singers and the creations of local artisans \u2013 left more than C$100,000 in the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of employment opportunities in the community when the cruise ships come here,\u201d said Aitaok. \u201cAll the money stays in the community.\u201d </p> <p>The visit clearly demonstrated the role the burgeoning Arctic tourism industry can play in the region, said Aitaok \u2013 but within limits. The Serenity pulled into the hamlet just a day after another ship had visited, leaving many residents exhausted. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people here,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us here, because we have such minimal resources, we need at least a day between each ship.\u201d</p> <p>Most communities in Nunavut have between 500 and 3,000 residents, said the government of Nunavut\u2019s MacIsaac, meaning visits by large cruise ships risk significantly disrupting daily life. \u201cThese types of disruptions must be mitigated and one way to do that is through regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Prospective rules being considered include limiting the number of passengers who can disembark in a community at a time or forcing ships to provide passengers with visitor guidelines.</p> <p>Authorities are mindful of the need to strike a balance between regulating tourists and ensuring communities can maximise the benefits of mass tourism. \u201cMore passengers visiting a community means more carvings, prints and other crafts are purchased, which means a substantially larger economic impact on a community from a single ship visit,\u201d said MacIsaac. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f358679396e69224af26f244101f5e149c03fd/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crystal Serenity with 1,000 passengers on board rides at anchor just outside Nome, Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thiessen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Echoing a conundrum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/27/dont-look-now-venice-tourists-locals-sick-of-you-cruise-liners\">facing tourist destinations around the world,</a> the government is also grappling with how best to ensure that cruise ship visits are worthwhile for the host community, he said. \u201cSeveral communities have expressed concerns that they are not receiving adequate economic return to warrant the amount of effort involved with cruise ship visits.\u201d </p> <p>Regulations being mulled include forcing cruise ship operators to report regularly to the government on what their passengers leave behind in each community they visit, he said. \u201cThis will allow the government to track the economic impact of ship visits and to shape policy accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>The tourist boom comes just as Inuit are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/10/paris-climate-change-talks-arctic-inuit-youth-cop21\">struggling to contend</a> with the effects of climate change, said Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cIn 2015, about 200,000 people went to the Arctic on cruise ships,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The Serenity took care to mitigate its environmental impact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/inuit-arctic-ecosystem-extinction-tourism-crystal-serenity\">burning low-sulphur fuel and maintaining tight controls </a>on the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges. But the steadily growing industry, if not properly managed, could jeopardise the very ecosystem that is attracting the tourists. </p> <p>Many Inuit want to see more stringent controls of marine traffic in the Arctic, said Eegeesiak: \u201cWe\u2019re all worried about the potential for a disaster that will affect our livelihood, our food sources.\u201d</p> <p>The risks facing the industry were laid bare in 2010, after a small cruise ship carrying 128 passengers struck an uncharted rock shelf in the North-West Passage. It took 40 hours for a Canadian icebreaker to reach and evacuate the ship\u2019s passengers. The Canadian coast guard later filed a lawsuit seeking almost half a million dollars in damages over pollution, claiming that 13 tanks aboard the ship \u2013 holding fuel, freshwater and sludge \u2013 were breached during the grounding. </p> <p>The idea of mass tourism in the Arctic, said Eegeesiak, is woefully out of step with the region\u2019s glaring lack of infrastructure and limited capacity for search and rescue. \u201cOnce a disaster happens, it will have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd is that the only time we\u2019re going to say we should have done it better.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Leading shares have broken through the 7000 barrier for the first time since May 2015 as a plunge in the pound to a new 31 year low boosts the exporter-heavy FTSE 100.</p> <p>Banking shares are also receiving some support from a revival in <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>. After a market holiday in Germany on Monday, the bank\u2019s shares have reopened up 2.55% on hopes that it will not have to pay as much as the $14bn demanded by the US Department of Justice in fines related to mortgage mis-selling.</p> <p>So <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> is up 17.3p at 651.5p, <strong>Barclays</strong> is 2.1p better at 170.3p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen 2.3p to 181.6p.</p> <p>But the biggest riser in the leading index is <strong>Pearson</strong>, up more than 6% to 811p as analysts at Morgan Stanley dismissed suggestions the education specialist could issue a profit warning:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Down 25% from its highs and with an around 10% 2018 free cashflow yield versus a PE of 10 times the market is expecting another profits warning. We don\u2019t think Pearson will warn, meaning the shares could recover sharply on the third quarter results.</p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail the bank spelled out why it thinks Pearson shares are too cheap:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>(i) Pearson cut market expectations by \u00a335m-\u00a375m pre restructuring (and \u00a3355m-\u00a3395m post restructuring) in January. This covers a multitude of sins.</p> <p>(ii) Pearson\u2019s EBITA forecasts have a lot of flex allowing, for instance, an increase of \u00a3110m in incentive compensation in 2016 \u2013 18% of expected EBITA.</p> <p>(iii) Pearson strongly reiterated its 2016-18 guidance at the first half figures and has not rescinded it in subsequent public appearances, the most recent being September 21.</p> <p>(iv) There is better trading elsewhere at Pearson with good growth in the digital businesses and better than expected contract wins in Assessment. </p> <p>v) 2017 is an inevitable upswing year in US schools with a better environment in US Higher Education (enrolments close to flat) and US and UK assessment.</p> <p>(vi) With 66% of sales in the US and sub 10% in the UK, Pearson is a play on Brexit nervousness.</p> <p>(vii) We think Pearson won\u2019t warn at the third quarter (end October), the peak trading period. Given the underperformance, low rating and big dividend yield \u2013 almost 7% \u2013 we think the shares will bounce strongly on this. </p> </blockquote> <p>Testing equipment group <strong>Intertek</strong> has also received some broker support. Its shares have jumped 166p to \u00a337.08 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from underperform to buy on the basis of strong growth and possible acquisition activity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our analysis of margin levers provides a strong case for profit growth faster than revenues, while strong free cashflow allows us to now formally model M&amp;A. We upgrade 2017 earnings per share by 10% of which 6% is underlying. Growth and margins in the main division - Products - look well supported by secular drivers. Double upgrade to buy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 88.30 points at 7071.82, with UK construction data also giving some support by coming in stronger than expected.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s new slide comes after UK prime minister Theresa May set the clock ticking on Brexit negotiations, and suggested the focus would be on immigration controls rather than the single market. Financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It seems that it is going to be hard to provide a tourniquet for sterling\u2019s recent wounds given the solidity of the newly announced Brexit timeline (with March set to go down in the history books as when Article 50 was triggered), and the firmness with which May stated her intention to chase border control even if it means relinquishing Britain\u2019s position in the single market. </p> </blockquote> <p>Domestic focussed stocks and defensive shares were under pressure, with <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> down 2.2p at 323.8p and<strong> National Grid</strong> 2.5p lower at 1099.5p.<br></p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Henderson Group</strong> is down 5.3p at 265.4p after Monday\u2019s surge in the wake of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/janus-henderson-to-have-headquarters-in-london\">its proposed merger with Janus Capital,</a></strong> but specialist lender <strong>Onesavings</strong> has added 15.3p to 284p after Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight with a price target lifted from 235p to 340p.</p> <p>Continuing merger hopes among the mid-caps have helped the FTSE 250 soar to a new peak, up 1.6% to 18,474.70.

  "<p>Britain will approach exit talks with the EU from a position of strength and not as \u201ca supplicant\u201d, Theresa May has said, seeking to raise confidence in the process as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/04/pound-dollar-low-construction-imf-brexit-business-live\">pound sunk to a 31-year low</a> amid business concerns about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>Making a round of broadcast interviews before her speech on Wednesday to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, May offered no new clues as to the details or overall aims of the government\u2019s Brexit strategy.</p> <p>But with sterling dropping to $1.276 in early trading, its lowest level since 1985, May insisted that business would thrive following a departure from the EU that the government seems to be hinting will result in country ending up outside the bloc\u2019s single market.</p> <p>Questioned about her pre-referendum warnings about the economic impact of Brexit, and what concessions the UK would need to make if it wanted access to the single market, the prime minister insisted she would start the process from a position of strength.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s not about the UK, in some sense, being a supplicant to the EU,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt\u2019s about the reciprocity here. A good trade deal is going to be of benefit to us and to the EU.\u201d</p> <p>May said she was \u201cgoing to be ambitious\u201d as the negotiations began. \u201cThe way we approach this is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people talk in a way that suggests that we should be approaching this as sort of, \u2018We\u2019ve been members of the EU, when we come out, what bits of membership can we keep?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cActually, I think we need to have a different approach. When we come out of the European Union we\u2019ll be an independent, sovereign country \u2013 what relationship do we want with the EU?</p> <p>\u201cI want that relationship to be the right deal for the UK and the best possible deal in terms of trade with the EU. I want British businesses to be able to trade with the EU, and operate within the EU, and EU businesses to be able to operate here in the UK. I think that makes sense for both sides of the argument.\u201d</p> <p>Asked repeatedly about her warnings about Brexit when she campaigned for the remain side, May insisted it had been a nuanced position: \u201cI did, indeed, campaign to remain inside the European Union. I also said in my speech at the beginning of that campaign that I didn\u2019t think the sky would fall in if we were to leave the European Union \u2013 it was a balanced judgment.\u201d</p> <p>While noting that life for the UK was \u201cgoing to be different in the future\u201d, May argued that businesses were confident about the road ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThey know it\u2019s not going to be plain sailing, there will be bumps in the road, and they want certainty as soon as possible about what the future holds,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut the attitude I\u2019m hearing is, yes, the people have decided, the UK will be leaving the EU \u2013 actually, let\u2019s now come together and make sure we grasp the opportunities that will be available.\u201d</p> <p>The plunge in the pound, which was also down 0.2% against the euro, comes amid a downward trend following May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">earlier statements at the Conservative conference</a>, which seemed to indicate a move to a hard Brexit of focusing on controls of immigration at the expense of single market access.</p> <p>May said she remained committed to the target of seeing annual net migration fall to the tens of thousands.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not changed, in the sense we think net migration should be at sustainable levels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think those levels are the tens of thousands.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, once we leave the EU, there will be the opportunity to control movements coming from the European Union. I think, crucially, what people voted for on 23 June was for their government to be able to make those decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in her round of interviews, May talked about scone recipes and shoes on ITV1\u2019s Good Morning Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps her most revealing answer of the morning came on Today, when she was asked what made her angry. She replied: \u201cInjustice. What makes me angry? Child sexual abuse, modern slavery, when we see the powerful abusing their position. That\u2019s what makes me angry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday it is Bookshop Day. My heart always sinks a little when I hear that a day has been set aside to celebrate something I love: it too often feels like being put on a list of exotic endangered species \u2013 and indeed libraries, small presses and bookshops are all disappearing fast.</p> <p>When my first book was published, there were no ebooks, no Amazon and most high streets boasted a bookshop. Chains and independents thrived equally \u2013 partly because book prices were fixed, which made for a level playing field. But with the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jun/17/net-book-agreement-publishing\"> demise of the net book agreement</a>, the book world began to change. Independent bookshops could no longer afford to compete.

And yet, they represent so much more than an opportunity to buy books. Like libraries, small bookshops are a part of a wider society. A good local bookshop is quirky, individual; reflecting the needs of the community. Sometimes it looks more like someone\u2019s home than a place of business \u2013 there\u2019s maybe even a cat \u2013 and with staff who care about books, not just shifting units.</p> <p>But in the face of powerful online and supermarket opposition, small bookshops have had to work hard to survive. They have had to be creative: reading groups; storytime for children; even ice-cream stalls and bookshop bands. They are also often the most enthusiastic organisers of author visits and signings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/01/day-in-life-independent-bookshop\">Small bookshops show diversity</a> and individualism in a world growing ever more corporate.</p> <p>They stand for community in the face of business expansion. They represent a protest against the offshore companies that are reducing our high streets to a series of empty shop fronts. That\u2019s why we must do our best to support them, not just on Bookshop Day, but every day. Because in 10 years\u2019 time, no one wants to hear their child ask: \u201cMummy, what\u2019s a bookshop?\u201d</p>",

Last week \u2013 and, particularly, last weekend \u2013 feels like a bit of a Brexit turning point: we now have a date (or at least a deadline) for the start of exit talks, and what looks very much like a strategic direction.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">Conservative party conference on Sunday, Theresa May</a> said article 50 would be triggered before the end of March next year. The prime minister also said Britain would not emulate Norway or Switzerland but forge a relationship with the EU as a fully independent, sovereign country: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not leaving the EU today to give up control of immigration again, and we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. We are going to be a country ... that is no longer part of a political union with supranational institutions that can override national parliaments and courts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously that still leaves a lot unanswered about the detail of the trading relationship with Europe May will seek. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/brexit-theresa-may-prioritises-immigration-curbs-over-free-movement\">Brexit: Theresa May prioritises immigration curbs over single market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her stated priorities \u2013 curbing immigration, no more interference from foreign judges, even reclaiming the right to print food labels as Britain sees fit \u2013 would seem to rule out membership of the EU\u2019s single market. </p> <p>Although she disputed the notions of \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, this looks pretty hard: May\u2019s Brexit means sovereignty taking precedence over trade arrangements and economic interests, at least short term. </p> <p>As was necessary, the prime minister also promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\">bill to scrap the 1972 act that took the UK into the union</a> and to transfer existing EU law into British law. Parliament will be able to remove or rewrite unwanted bits later, but at least initially, Brexit will mean up to 13,000 EU regulations being enshrined in UK law. <br></p> <p>Europe largely welcomed the clarity on the Brexit timetable, happy that Britain should now be out before the European parliament elections of spring 2019.

if Britain really is not intending to seek a relaxation of the single market\u2019s rules (to allow it to control EU immigration, for example) but is just out for a reasonable trade deal, the pressure may have eased. <br></p> <p>The bloc\u2019s remaining members are also aware that as soon as article 50 is triggered, they will have the advantage: the clock will be ticking. <br></p> <aside

Their motto throughout Syria\u2019s withering conflict has been \u201cto save one life is to save all of humanity\u201d.</p> <p>The volunteers have been one of the few signs of hope in a desperate and destructive war that otherwise shows little mercy. They have been hailed across rebel areas of Syria and in Europe as a model of community cooperation and coexistence \u2013 and of success. Russian and Syrian attacks on medical centres have tried to deny care to the dying, but the White Helmets have defied that, giving comfort and life-saving care where no one else can.</p> <p>Their work has made them a prized military target for pro-regime forces, who regularly attack ambulances as soon as they arrive at the scene of a strike. The lethal threat has not been a deterrent; to many among the White Helmets it has instead been an incentive to continue serving. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Martin Chulov</em></p> <h2>Angela Merkel</h2> <p>Were Angela Merkel to win the Nobel peace prize it would hang like an albatross around her neck.

No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 months to two years.</p> <p>Posner wrote that Pence\u2019s idea of exclusion by nationality is: \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating. But that of course would be racial discrimination, just as his targeting Syrian refugees is discrimination on the basis of nationality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/indiana-refugee-resettlement-mike-pence-court-decision\">Court rejects Pence's efforts to deter refugees as 'nightmare speculation'</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57f2e4ebe4b01506cbf24df9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-gabbatt\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-03T23:10:16.416Z\">12.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prepare for the clash of veeps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Like the Gulf stream, or a young Republican who doesn\u2019t wear beige chinos, we know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a> and Tim Kaine exist \u2013 we just don\u2019t really see them.</p> <p>With the media focused on Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-interview-bill-hillary-clinton.html\">near daily</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/politics/trump-overnight-media-tweets/\">indiscretions</a>, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/01/hillary-clinton-twitter-national-service-scholarships-trump\">various</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-affairs-joel-benenson-229046\">responses</a> to those indiscretions, both the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential nominees have been forced into the shadows.<br></p> <p>But no more.

This year, the Trump Foundation made its most wide-ranging request for donations yet: It set up a public website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, to gather donations that Trump said would be passed on to veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>But the Trump Foundation never registered under article 7A of New York\u2019s Executive Law, as is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 a year from the public.

The president sat down with Jonathan Chait to discuss five key situations during his presidency: the Republicans, Obamacare, BP oil spill, Cuba and drones.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very in-depth chat with Obama, who delves into what sort of legacy he\u2019ll leave behind. Here he is on drone strikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I will say, though, is that the critique of drones has been important, because it has ensured that you don\u2019t have this institutional comfort and inertia with what looks like a pretty antiseptic way of disposing of enemies. I will say that what prompted a lot of the internal reforms we put in place had less to do with what the left or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&amp;gclid=CJuEsvCouM8CFQEkhgodwA4PCA\">Human Rights Watch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/\">Amnesty International</a> or other organizations were saying and had more to do with me looking at sort of the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up and the routineness with which, early in my presidency, you were seeing both DOD and CIA and our intelligence teams think about this. And it troubled me, because I think you could see, over the horizon, a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a president who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world, and a lot of them covert, without any accountability or democratic debate.</p> <p>But I will say that having these nonprofits continue to question and protest ensured that, having made that initial decision, we kept on going and that it got pushed all the way through. And it\u2019s not \u2014 as I announced when we released our best estimates of the civilian casualties \u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect solution. I think America will continue to have work to do in finding this balance between not elevating every terrorist attack into a full-blown war but not either leaving ourselves exposed to attacks or, alternatively, pretending as if we can just take shots wherever we want, whenever we want, and not be answerable to anybody.

It\u2019s like having a rock inside your stomach. Like this thing that\u2019s constantly pulling you down.\u201d</p> <p>Yordanos\u2019 journey to regain her life involved combining the theatre production with ongoing weekly counselling. When she was a young child, she watched her father kill her mother. When she was five years old, she was taken and trained to be a child soldier by the Eritrean army. For a decade and a half she suffered violence and sexual abuse. </p> <p>Preparing the play required extensively workshopping sessions to find ways to tell each person\u2019s stories. This meant Yordanos and the rest of the group had to revisit the trauma of their pasts, session after session, week after week. All this before getting on stage and reliving it, again and again, in front of strangers. It became too much for her. Four weeks in, Yordanos suffered an emotional collapse and quit. </p> <p>\u201cI felt tired and drained and I couldn\u2019t continue,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that happened. I was five when I was kidnapped. From that age until my teenage life, I was in that place. While making this I had so many flashbacks and I couldn\u2019t cope with all of that. </p> <p>\u201cI felt like the best thing for me was to withdraw. Just, get away from me, I don\u2019t want to be telling this again. But my counsellor thought I was strong enough to go back and continue it. That is what I did. I was so grateful I got to finish it. </p> <p>\u201cIn my life I have been voiceless. But to stand there and speak in such a way, to say \u2018this is what happened to me and I\u2019m explaining it\u2019, I think it has huge power.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52dd7531f209d528e17af52e90e4d5009f8bb4bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52dd7531f209d528e17af52e90e4d5009f8bb4bb/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yordanos Haile-Michael\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yordanos Haile-Michael was a young child when she watched her father kill her mother.

These conversations tended to be marked by long stretches of silence, she says, eventually broken by \u201cone voice which would pipe up and say, \u2018Yes, this pain is coming out. But I can\u2019t tell you how much better I feel.\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>The director used various techniques to protect the women from revisiting the most painful aspects of their stories. Instead of Aminata reading out a court testimony detailing her rape, for example, Horin swapped roles, so Aminata became the lawyer character and a friend played her. This sort of approach was used with each of the women in various ways, including through video footage and songs. </p> <p>\u201cIf somebody was very fragile and they were observing aspects of their story I could say to them, \u2018Tonight you don\u2019t have to come on stage and observe that or even listen to it,\u2019\u201d Horin says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t just one structure to the play. There was a kind of A version, then a B version, then a C version. This was all invented out of necessity. How to solve a practical problem and not be too hard on the women.\u201d</p> <p>The results are inspiring to say the least. The group bonded and grew like a family; they now refer to each other as sisters. There are scenes in the film that bring tears to your eyes, though the story is ultimately life-affirming. Among its messages, perhaps, is that hope comes in many forms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40541dad39e6b76462a3b9d02e01421a6ad839b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40541dad39e6b76462a3b9d02e01421a6ad839b3/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yordanos Haile-Michael, Rosemary Kariuki-Fyfe and Yarrie Bangura\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Among its messages is that hope comes in many forms\u2019: Yordanos Haile-Michael, Rosemary Kariuki-Fyfe and Yarrie Bangura.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goodship</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The four subjects found different pathways to resilience. One has focused on poetry, another on participating in philanthropic projects. Yordanos says that because of sticking with the stage production \u2013 slogging it out when her instincts told her to quit \u2013 she is now in a better place than ever.</p> <p>\u201cI tried so hard to fit in with my own community, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this has given me faith in humans. I made friends from different backgrounds and I get to be seen as totally the person I am. I came to accept that this is what I am meant to be and I am OK with that person. </p> <p>\u201cFor someone like me, I have no one to blame. I can\u2019t go out there saying, \u2018You have done this to me.\u2019 There is no one to say sorry, or even to acknowledge me as a human being. The play, for people to come to see it, to meet so many different people and to be able to talk about it openly \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. To me, I got my life back. I got me back.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 The Baulkham Hills African Ladies Troupe is in cinemas now</em></p>"
