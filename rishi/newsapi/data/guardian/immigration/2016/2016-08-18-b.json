  "<p> The experience of New South Wales preparing to more than double its refugee intake in response to the Syrian crisis will convince people that refugees can benefit Australia, Peter Shergold has said.<br></p> <p>The former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who is now the NSW coordinator general for refugee resettlement, told Guardian Australia the state was expecting to resettle 6,000 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/09/australia-to-accept-an-extra-12000-syrian-refugees-and-will-join-us-led-air-strikes\">the 12,000 extra Syrian refugees Australia promised in September to resettle</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/14/dear-australia-guardian-video-series\">Dear Australia: a Guardian video series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said in addition to spending $146m over four years on health and education the state government would help refugees find work, which was a current weakness in support services.</p> <p>Shergold said of the country\u2019s total annual refugee intake of 13,750, New South Wales now takes about 4,500 a year. The 6,000 Syrians expected this financial year would increase the state\u2019s intake to about 10,500.</p> <p>He said job support services were \u201cthe weakest part of the services that are provided at the moment\u201d to refugees and the state\u2019s program would complement the commonwealth job scheme, Job Active.</p> <p>He said Job Active had \u201conly a few members who have particular expertise in refugee services\u201d and NSW would take a different approach by partnering with business.</p> <p>\u201cI think the most exciting story is that we\u2019re trying to do something quite different with employment,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia actually does a very good job with settlement services when refugees first arrive.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge we have is helping with the fact they want to get into employment and set up their own businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Shergold said NSW would set up a one-stop shop to work out refugees\u2019 work experience, level of English and skills and coordinate with employers across industry sectors to find them work.</p> <p>He said 10 to 20 major employers had already signed on to provide employment opportunities or work experience, including AMP, Harvey Norman and Australia Post.</p> <p>\u201cMy aim is to meet with refugees, work out what a realistic path into employment is for them and use a network of supportive businesses to help them into work. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at probably four or five thousand people seeking help to move into labour market. We can do this. This is not overwhelming, as long as we are prepared.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about comments by the Western Australian premier, Colin Barnett, that his state would welcome refugee families, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/18/wa-premier-says-children-in-detention-unacceptable-welcomes-refugee-families\">accommodate them if more were accepted by the federal government</a>, Shergold said he would not comment on commonwealth refugee policy. But he said the Baird government\u2019s active role welcoming refugees into NSW was both a challenge and a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can show in NSW that we can respond effectively to this increase in the number of refugees, I\u2019m hoping people will see it\u2019s a positive not just for Australia ... but that refugees, with half a chance, will very quickly contribute to society.

There is an agenda in Europe which is not something Labour would support which is the free market agenda.\u201d<br></p> <p>Supporters took to social media to argue that Corbyn was more likely to attract voters in working class heartlands with his position on the EU. <br></p> <p>The two contenders \u2013 who appeared to agree on most domestic policies \u2013 also clashed over a question on Nato during an official hustings in Solihull, in the West Midlands.</p> <p>Asked how he would respond to military aggression by Vladimir Putin toward a Nato member, Corbyn suggested that he would not intervene militarily in line with the agreement between countries in the grouping. </p> <p>The Labour leader said. \u201cWe cannot allow a military buildup which could be calamitous. I would want to avoid us getting involved in military. I don\u2019t wish to go to war \u2013 what I want to do is achieve a world that we don\u2019t need to go to war.\u201d</p> <p>The comments triggered an angry response from some Labour MPs. Ilford North\u2019s MP, Wes Streeting, said the public would conclude he was \u201cunfit to hold the office of prime minister\u201d if he refused to uphold the Nato of principle of mutual defence. \u201cIt is a gross betrayal of Labour\u2019s internationalist values,\u201d he told the PoliticsHome website.</p> <p>\u201cThe only other significant politician to be so reckless and cavalier about the future of Nato is Donald Trump. They are different sides of the same coin: thoughtless and irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>Smith said: \u201cWe would have to come to the aid of a fellow member of Nato, that is the nature of the Nato accord.\u201d However, he said that it would be calamitous to get to that stage and argued diplomacy would have to be used to try to avoid it. Smith again argued that membership of the EU would help in this area.</p> <p>But the Welsh MP was heckled and jeered when he claimed that 170 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in Corbyn were \u201csocialist\u201d \u2013 causing the host, ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen, to intervene. One audience member shouted \u201ctraitor\u201d, while others also expressed anger at Smith and other politicians who had caused the leadership contest. </p> <p>Smith defended his claim that Britain should be willing to negotiate with Isis. \u201cI said yesterday there was no prospect of negotiating with IS [Isis] \u2013 we should never negotiate with terrorists when they are maiming and bombing. And the chances are we will never end up negotiating with IS. They are nihilistic and they are seeking to destroy people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he argued that if they ever did renounce violence, negotiations could take place as they had in Northern Ireland with people who had \u201ccommitted murder and terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>The pair also put forward policy ideas, with Smith flirting with the idea of reducing VAT by 5p.

The war is fought with a callous disregard for humanitarian conventions that is almost unprecedented in modern times. And, it often seems, it is fought without any sense of a future in which the combatants might be held to account for their actions. The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, appointed after two predecessors gave it up as a hopeless task, seems to convene meetings with an elegant futility. Today (by one of the grim little ironies of timing, tomorrow is <a href=\"https://worldhumanitarianday.org/\">World Humanitarian Day</a>) was the weekly meeting in Geneva of the humanitarian taskforce. Mr De Mistura was so frustrated that not a single aid convoy had managed to reach besieged areas of Syria since the start of August that he suspended the meeting after a mere eight minutes \u201cas a sign of deep unhappiness\u201d. The Russian military has subsequently said it will back the possibility of 48-hour aid-enabling ceasefires that he mooted if convoys travel to both rebel- and government-controlled parts of the city; the UN envoy says he will count on the international backers of both Syrian forces and the armed opposition to hold them to the plan.</p> <p>It is hard to be optimistic. Though Russian airstrikes seemed to stop for short periods last week, the pauses were much too brief to allow deliveries. As Mr De Mistura admitted, any progress will take some heavy lifting by Russia and the US, which neither side appears willing or able to do. The UN says this is a war fought with an unparalleled degree of cynicism, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/syria-aid-drops-need-blessing-of-syrian-government-says-staffan-de-mistura-un\">parties that refuse to engage</a> in any meaningful way with attempts to pursue a peace process. When the envoy took over two years ago, he observed that both the government and rebels thought they could win, and they still do. They regard any successful aid delivery to civilians in territory held by opposing forces as a potential weakening of their own position. No party to this conflict has avoided serious human rights violations, though the regime is responsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths.</p> <p>Mr De Mistura, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/staffan-de-mistura-man-with-toughest-job-in-world-syria\">whose career</a> has mainly been in finding innovative routes to get aid into even the most fraught and difficult places, appears defeated. Every proposal that may have had some success in the past to bring a degree of safety and security to non-combatants, such as no-fly zones, or safe zones for civilians, has quickly foundered on the suspicion that it will work to the advantage of the other side. Syria is becoming what one old hand called \u201ca forever war\u201d. Russia\u2019s deal with Tehran for its bombers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/russia-uses-iranian-airbase-for-first-time-in-syria-campaign\">to take off from Iranian airbases</a> will mean more intensive bombing in the Assad cause and few think meaningful progress will be possible until after the US elections.</p> <p>There is one small thing that Britain could do, with widespread public support. Hundreds of lone children are seeking asylum in the UK. Many of them are living in appalling conditions only a few miles away on the French coast. Today councillors \u2013 who will have the direct responsibility for their care \u2013 visited to try to speed up their arrival. The most positive response to the trauma of Omran Daqneesh would be the swiftest delivery of care that these lone children need.</p>",

To expect them to access generic services is unrealistic. We know that sex workers are targeted by violent offenders. Without services to protect and to support them when they are victims, offenders will get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>Georgina Perry, a former manager at Open Doors, a long-established and well regarded NHS service for sex workers in east London, said the service\u2019s funding was being cut by 43%. She resigned last week over the cuts and her concerns that a new funding model, set up by Hackney council, compromised patient confidentiality.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point we had 12 individuals out of 120 living with TB-HIV co-infection,\u201d says Perry. \u201cThese are really terrible statistics. When we first started with our street sex workers virtually 100% of them were homeless, they didn\u2019t have GPs, [and] they were using A&amp;E as their primary care.

Within hours they found me a hostel. They sorted out my housing benefit, my GP and my mental health. I didn\u2019t even have a clean pair of knickers. They gave me underwear; they gave me a toothbrush. Open Doors broke the chain.</p> <p> \u201cThe staff nurtured me, loved me and guided me. They taught us new ways to live. They took us out and bought us ice cream; it felt like the family I never had. Then, little by little, without you even noticing, they will take steps back. And then you realise that you are capable, you can be independent. But if you need them, they are there.</p> <p>\u201cMy son wanted to go and start taking drugs, my daughter had stopped going to school. But once I started going to Open Doors, I changed their lives. Now I have a flat; my daughter lives with me, my son with his dad. My son just got six A GSCEs, three of them A*s. He is looking to go to Cambridge; he has already been selected as \u2018Gifted and Talented\u2019. My daughter works full-time as a barista.</p> <p>\u201cI have seen mothers and daughters on the street together: one on one corner, one on the other. It is so sad.

And to think my daughter could\u2019ve been doing that too. </p> <p>\u201cOpen Doors gave me the chance to carry on and enjoy the rest of my life. I will see my son graduate; see my daughter hopefully get promoted to become manager.</p> <p> \u201cThis government doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing.

Robert E Howard created the raven-headed barbarian in the 1930s, so the books are out of copyright in many countries, which means, in theory, anyone can make a movie based on them. Marvel even published a series of Conan comics between 1970 and 2000, so it could be argued that the Disney-owned studio is the natural home for a saga based on his world.</p> <p>And yet, the A Song of Ice and Fire series seems an even better bet for a swords and sorcery cinematic universe. Unlike Howard, who relied heavily on tales of Conan and his forebear Kull the Conqueror, Martin has established a multifarious fantasy sandpit of power-hungry lordlings, treacherous queens and menacing maesters for writers to play in.</p> <p> From a prequel based on Robert\u2019s Rebellion to the story of the Targaryens\u2019 dragon-powered conquest of Westeros, or even a Tyrion: The Early Years saga, the possibilities are endless. The Tales of Dunk and Egg books would also make fine movies if studios wanted to go in a lighter-hearted direction than the TV show. There is so much for writers to play with here, especially as the civilisation introduced in Martin\u2019s novels is said to have been in existence for more than 10,000 years.</p> <p>Moreover, the author is still alive to give his blessing to Hollywood, and has shown himself to be remarkably relaxed about others taking his work and running with it. Game of Thrones, in particular, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/winds-of-winter-chapter-game-of-thrones-show-book-differences-arianne-martell-1201771703/\">seems to be developing an ever-looser connection to the books</a>.</p> <p>Other fantasy fans will have their own favourites, of course \u2013 and I\u2019d love to hear them. But please bear in mind that if we\u2019re looking at Marvel or Star Wars as the templates for a functional cinematic universe, your swords and sorcery equivalent needs to be one which already boasts its own established audience. </p> <p>The world of Game of Thrones already has that in spades. Now it\u2019s just up to Martin and the Hollywood powers that be to get together and make it happen.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration said on Thursday that it planned to end the federal government\u2019s use of private prisons, after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/private-federal-prisons-more-dangerous-justice-department\">inquiry found they were drastically more unsafe</a> than publicly run facilities.<br></p> <p>Deputy attorney general Sally Yates announced the decision in a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/886311/download\">memo to Thomas Kane</a>, the acting director of the federal prisons bureau, which was published on the justice department\u2019s website.</p> <p>\u201cI am eager to enlist your help in beginning the process of reducing \u2013 and ultimately ending \u2013 our use of privately operated prisons,\u201d Yates said.

I actually wanted to have a register office wedding followed by a few drinks in a pub, but I was out-voted. We had very little money and although my parents grudgingly coughed up for the reception we had to pay for everything else. My mother-in-law-to-be was constantly adding further expenses \u2013 flowers, organs, choirs.

We spent our wedding night in a local hotel in a room with single beds. I remember spending a lot of time in there sicking up the wedding breakfast through a combination of nerves, exhaustion and the large scotch my father pressed on me before we left for the church. It was such a disastrous day that we have never felt inclined to celebrate any wedding anniversary since, even though we have now been married for 45 years. </p> <h2>\u2018I had to grin and bear it but was livid\u2019 \u2013 Mark, London<br></h2> <p>It was my now-wife\u2019s dream to have our reception in an exquisite location, with a private garden for kids to play in. So we booked a venue in London and it rained heavily during the church ceremony, but the sun came out during the reception. However, the manager of the venue decided to lock all the doors and would not allow any of the guests access to the garden. I tried to appeal to her, but she would not come out of her office to speak to me. I got very frustrated and angry \u2013 not what you want during your wedding reception. Eventually she came down and said it was for health and safety reasons, so guests would not slip and get their clothes dirty. </p> <p>My wife and I were very upset \u2013 one of the main reasons for having our reception there was the garden, and no one told us they could lock all the doors if they chose. </p> <p>I would have made a scene if all our friends and family had not been there, but I had to grin and bear it. I am still angry about how it ruined our wedding reception. We console ourselves saying that the rest of the day was great.</p> <h2>\u2018I had to go and lie down during the dinner, and couldn\u2019t eat a thing\u2019 \u2013 Amy, 35, Wiltshire</h2> <p>I used to be an events manager. I have never had so much go wrong with planning before: the dress arrived late, the shoes I ordered had to be returned, the marquee company mis-measured the tables so I had to change the table plan last-minute. The list of problems was neverending. </p> <p>The day itself was beautiful, but we were both shattered and struggled with being the centre of attention. Both of us are quite shy. Neither of us had slept properly for weeks. I felt on edge for the rest of the day, worrying about everyone else. I wish someone had asked me if I was all right \u2013 all I needed was some reassurance that everyone else was enjoying themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The day itself was beautiful, but we were both shattered and struggled with being the centre of attention</p> <footer> <cite>Amy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had to go and lie down during the dinner, and couldn\u2019t eat anything.

I\u2019d become so freaked out, I was having anxiety dreams: walking down the aisle to find my husband-to-be waiting for me without a head, giant rats in my underground cave ceremony, that sort of thing. This was compounded by not being able to eat for the final month because of nerves.</p> <p>On the day itself, it pissed it down, the hotel \u201clost\u201d loads of the booze we\u2019d supplied for the evening bit, and the DJ was really grumpy. By the time I went to bed that evening, I was crying because my new husband had gone to the bar with his friends as he wasn\u2019t \u201cready for bed\u201d. My tears continued the next morning when I said goodbye to all my friends and family sobbing. After it was all over, I felt horrified that I had been sucked into such an embarrassing, narcissistic load of nonsense. </p> <h2>\u2018A relative died on my wedding day\u2019 \u2013 Chloe, 57</h2> <p>My husband and I were 23 when we got married. We had the wedding in my hometown in Wales and invited all our friends and then our parents invited all the family. Among them was an elderly uncle of my husband who had been poorly but came. He was in the church for the wedding and during the line to meet and greet, complained of feeling tired so his daughter took him to sit on a park bench where he promptly died as he sat there. Luckily she had the presence of mind to put his hat on his head and just hold his hand while the crowd went by. We didn\u2019t really know anything about it as half the family were doctors who knew what to do. All the family were brilliant and kept saying how he would have wanted to go like that, after having been to church and surrounded by the family.</p> <h2>\u2018I was totally pissed before the nuptials had even begun\u2019 \u2013 Tanya, 37, Ireland</h2> <p>Where do I start? My mother tried to convince me not to get married in the middle of winter, but I said no \u2013 how bad does winter really ever get in Ireland? The answer: historically bad. Christmas 2010 has become synonymous with cancelled flights, frozen pipes and no drinking water. Amazingly, all of our guests made it to the day, though evening guests cut their losses and stayed at home. <br></p> <p>The morning of the wedding, my hairdresser arrived early. \u201cThem roads are shocking, you better ring and warn your guests before someone\u2019s killed on that ice,\u201d was her opening greeting. That didn\u2019t help my nerves and so I started on the bubbly, while texting every single friend with road safety measures. I cried a bit. I drank some more. The photographers arrived and remarked that they thought the groom would be there by now but couldn\u2019t find him. I became convinced he\u2019d been killed. More tears ensued, and I downed a third glass. The bridesmaid was dispatched to locate the future husband and on coming back with good tidings I guzzled more to celebrate. Result? Totally drunk before the nuptials had even begun.</p> <p>Now, one would imagine that that was sufficient trauma for one day. But alas, we had chosen a multipurpose venue for our special day. In the function room next to ours was wedding number two, a rowdy and animated bunch. That would have been fine, if the rooms hadn\u2019t been separated by a partition and we weren\u2019t sharing the same bathroom facilities. These guests were stashing their Smirnoff behind the cisterns in the loo, and any attempt to use the toilet by our guests was deemed as an intrusion. <br></p> <p>The redeeming parts of the day were the service itself, which, despite my being rather drunk was very moving and special. I did keep looking at my husband and thinking, \u201cI am so thrilled and lucky to be marrying you.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Some names have been changed</em><br></li> </ul>",

There are some clues. First, it\u2019s clear that Trump is an ardent supporter of the leave campaign \u2013 or at least, he became one when he finally found out what it was.</p> <p>When Trump was asked by journalist Michael Wolff for a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/donald-trump-conversation-politics-dark-898465\">Hollywood Reporter</a> interview published in June what he thought about Brexit, he was flummoxed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnd Brexit? Your position?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d replied Trump.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Brits leaving the EU,\u201d I prompt, realizing that his lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah, I think they should leave.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The UK vote \u2013 inspired, in part, by fears of immigration and anger with the way the economy has been gamed by a global elite \u2013 has clear echoes of the billionaire property tycoon\u2019s own platform. Immigration \u201chas been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/donald-trump-brexit-222874#ixzz4HhECYHSg\">a horrible thing</a>\u201d for Britain, he told Fox News. \u201cA lot of that was pushed by the EU,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And after the vote, on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-hails-eu-referendum-result-as-he-arrives-in-uk\">trip to Scotland</a> to promote his golf course, Trump called the vote \u201ca great victory,\u201d attributing the Brexit vote to immigration and opposition to the \u201cglobal elite\u201d before boarding his gilded private jet to return to the US campaign trail.</p> <p>But why go back to Brexit now? Assuming Trump reads more than his own press cuttings, he may have spotted some news that suggests Brexit has not, as yet, been as catastrophic to the UK economy as first feared.</p> <p>Yesterday, the US Federal Reserve issued the minutes of its latest meeting and mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit 20 times</a>. However, for all its concern the Fed concluded that Brexit had had little impact on the US and global economy. And in the UK, public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">confidence has rebounded</a> after the Brexit vote, with consumers shrugging off fears of imminent doom.</p> <p>Of course, the consequences of Brexit (or a Trump victory) will play out over years, not weeks. All of Britain\u2019s trade agreements with the EU must now be renegotiated. Top companies including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/ford-considers-closing-factories-raising-prices-europe-brexit\">Ford</a> and Goldman Sachs have warned they may cut back or leave the UK following the vote.</p> <p>Back in the US, Trump\u2019s economic policies are under attack and he has been forced to reshuffle his election team in the face of withering polls. But just for a moment this morning, maybe, Trump thought he\u2019d backed a winner. And like the Brexit, he\u2019ll surprise us all come November.</p> <p>Go ahead, call him MR BREXIT.<br></p>",
  "<p>The cast and crew of Fear the Walking Dead are tucking into their lunch buffet with all the appetite of the show\u2019s zombies (or as the show refers the them the \u201cinfected\u201d). The sun is beating down in Baja, Mexico, the location of the studio where the show is filmed, and though most of the day\u2019s shoots are happening indoors, everyone still needs to travel from the large building where the buffet is laid out to various sound stages, office buildings, dressing rooms and several infinity tanks which give the illusion of open water (both in front of green screens and facing out onto the ocean).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/08/fear-the-walking-dead-sets-sail-for-season-two\">Can zombies swim? Fear the Walking Dead sets sail for season two</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fear the Walking Dead, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/fear-the-walking-dead-episode-by-episode\">companion show</a>\u201d to the original Walking Dead series, follows several loosely blended families trying to survive the early days of the outbreak that will eventually create the world that Carl, Rick and co inhabit. Over the first seven episodes of the show\u2019s second season (the eighth airs on Sunday 21 August), the cast travels from Los Angeles to Baja aboard the Abigail, a yacht belonging to enigmatic businessman Victor Strand, played by Colman Domingo. </p> <p>Hence the infinity tanks, which today are empty \u2013 the main exterior Abigail set has just been removed from the studio\u2019s prize outdoor tank, which resembles an enormous series of interlocking concrete salt dishes. It\u2019s a massive undertaking: the original task of moving the boat from the soundstage where it was constructed to the tank was scheduled for half a day, but took over two days. Still, even the empty tank is impressive, and looks more like a skate park than a film set. (It comfortably held the entire vessel used for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1089474,00.html\">Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0aef582fb351bc5d5a8506ca837d437d0669920e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aef582fb351bc5d5a8506ca837d437d0669920e/2341_243_8388_5035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There will be blood: Frank Dillane as Nick Clark, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia Clark and Michelle Ang as Alex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There will be blood: Frank Dillane as Nick Clark, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia Clark and Michelle Ang as Alex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Foreman Jr/AMC/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tank is wide open, but the rare moments of filming I see during my day on set are crammed into tight spaces in what comes to feel like a maze encompassing the indoor sound stages. Each scene is set up in a space so narrow that it would be almost impossible not to get the angle the directors want, so they only run through a quick take or two before sending the relevant cast members off to another segment of the maze. The haste makes sense: each episode is filmed in eight days (some seven) on a tight turnaround.</p> <p>Not that the cast members are upset. \u201cPeople see what they want to see,\u201d Colman Domingo says, stretched out on a couch in his dressing room in one of the studio\u2019s main buildings, surrounded by a gaggle of journalists. He\u2019s describing the ambiguity of his character, Victor Strand, who provides some respite from the constant trauma of life in a zombie apocalypse and who is by far the best part of Fear the Walking Dead.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I love about our show is that you\u2019re ahead of the game,\u201d Domingo adds, referring to the fact that the Walking Dead audience knows far more than the characters. Alycia Debnam-Carey, who plays angsty teen Alicia Clark, knows all about the passion of the show\u2019s fans. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a teenager who is making mistakes in a world where the audience is so much more aware than our characters,\u201d she says, which is something she describes as \u201cfrustrating for our audience\u201d. She continues: \u201cThey\u2019ve got six seasons of The Walking Dead rulebook to go by.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80f9a5f9868d86535e50320d74b0a0b8348e1439\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f9a5f9868d86535e50320d74b0a0b8348e1439/0_144_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernardo Trujillo: \u2018We learned a lot about boats.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernardo Trujillo: \u2018We learned a lot about boats.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Foreman, Jr  SMPSP/Richard Foreman, Jr/AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What, exactly, is in that rulebook? Speaking in a room covered in 3D models and SketchUp renders that look like unused concepts for Doobie Brothers album covers, production designer Bernardo Trujillo tells us that he and his team did the entire design and building of the Abigail sets in six weeks, from elaborate renderings depicting the full interior of the yacht to the various pieces that combine to create almost all of the locations and cabins. (\u201cWe learned a lot about boats,\u201d he says, laughing.) Erickson admits the intensity of this demand: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to be in the writer\u2019s room and say hey, they\u2019re gonna get on a boat for a season. It\u2019s another thing when you have to build your section of the boat in six weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an extraordinary amount of stuff needed to keep the Fear machine going. Case in point: the props department, housed in a warehouse filled with fake weapons, backpacks and cans of food, in addition to making molds, filling them, and generating a large silo of prop weapons (including several differently-sized duplicates used to film slightly different, stitched-together versions of fight scenes), has to get clearance for the use of certain items. This legal limitation contributes to the oddity of many of the weapons used on the series \u2013 as props master Colin Thurston wryly notes, handing one of the assembled reporters a rubber machine gun for further examination, \u201cAMC are very protective about marks and branding\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/best-tv-fear-the-walking-dead-60-days-in-fearless\">The week\u2019s best TV: Fear the Walking Dead, 60 Days In and Fearless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Walking Dead is, perhaps, the most valuable of those marks \u2013 especially considering the intensity of its fanbase. Over the course of our set visit, each actor on the show our group talks with is asked about the rabidity of fan reactions. \u201cOut of every hundred people,\u201d says Mercedes Mason, who plays Ofelia Salazar, there are \u201cthree or four who are mad at everything\u201d. Domingo, who plays Strand, is slightly more delicate: \u201cI love the idea that people are that \u2026\u201d He takes a moment to find the word, \u201cspirited\u201d.</p> <p>In this light, the rush to make more Fear makes sense. The studio is the site of a hyper-efficient production assembly line, churning out the same scenes with different variations to meet a large demand for Walking Dead content. It\u2019s kind of like a lunch buffet, just waiting to be crammed down so everyone can get back to work. But despite this high level of activity, the set is still somewhat subdued, more efficient than lively \u2013 for the production of a zombie show, Fear the Walking Dead is surprisingly bloodless.</p>",

  "<p>\u00d6tzi the Iceman, a naturally mummified corpse found trapped in the ice of the Italian Alps, has become something of a celebrity in the 25 years since tourists first stumbled upon his frozen remains \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that his sense of style has come under scrutiny. </p> <p>Scientists studying the 5,300 year-old remains say they have finally unravelled the secrets of \u00d6tzi\u2019s wardrobe.</p> <p>The new research reveals that the iceman was potentially a versatile tailor, with skins from sheep, goats and cattle as well as hides from a brown bear and roe deer used to create his outfit.</p> <p>Ron Pinhasi, co-author of the research from University College, Dublin said the findings show that \u00d6tzi was \u201cpretty picky\u201d when it came to his choice of skins. \u201cTo me it seems pretty sophisticated in terms of the capacities to use so many different materials from different animals,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Aged around 45 years, \u00d6tzi is believed to have bled to death after being hit in the shoulder by an arrow. But it\u2019s not only his grisly demise that has been a subject of scrutiny. Scientists have inspected almost every aspect of the iceman\u2019s remains, revealing everything from his medical history (it turns out \u00d6tzi had Lyme disease) to his penchant for a scrap \u2013 with a deep cut on his hand suggesting he was involved in a brawl shortly before his death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/08/otzi-the-icemans-5000-year-old-stomach-bug-sheds-light-on-human-migration\">\u00d6tzi the Iceman's 5,000-year-old stomach bug sheds light on human migration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while it was previously known that the iceman had used various types of leather to create his wardrobe \u2013 an array of clothing including a loin cloth, cap and coat, the Copper Age leather manufacturing processes, and the impact of time itself, made it difficult to tease apart exactly which species of animals were used.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/srep31279\">Scientific Reports</a>, researchers from Ireland and Italy describe how they analysed a type of genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA, that was extracted from nine fragments from six of his garments, including his loin cloth and fur cap.</p> <p>\u201cThe main question of study was to see what species these leathers were from and then the secondary question was are these species domestic varieties or not,\u201d said Niall O\u2019Sullivan, first author of the research from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy.</p> <p>The results reveal that the Iceman used at least five different species to create his clothes. His loin cloth, the scientists found, was made of sheepskin, his shoelaces of cow-leather, his leggings from goat hide, and his coat made from a mixture of both sheep and goat hide, taken from at least four different animals, that had been joined together. What\u2019s more, analysis of the mitochondrial DNA revealed that the sheep, goats and cattle from which the leather was made were domesticated animals.<br></p> <p>But \u00d6tzi\u2019s hat and quiver, it turns out, were fashioned from rather more exotic materials \u2013 the cap was made from the hide from a brown bear while the quiver fashioned from the skin of a roe deer. </p> <p>That, says O\u2019Sullivan, shows that while \u00d6tzi was likely to be from an agricultural or herding community, he was an enterprising chap. \u201cIt is possible that he might have used his hunting ability to capture and kill a bear, or it [could be] that he came across a dying bear and opportunistically took the skin and used it as leather,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cIt shows us that he was opportunistic and resourceful and used to the best of his ability the scarce resources which were available to him in a very harsh environment.\u201d </p> <p>The iceman, it seems, was also adept at a bit of make do and mend. \u201cThe Copper Age neolithic style of making leather was very primitive, clothing would have decomposed and degraded quite quickly under normal circumstances,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cSo he had to rapidly change his clothes and he was probably constantly renewing the clothes and augmenting it so that bits didn\u2019t fall apart.\u201d</p>",

They offer a hopeful picture of how to engage kids in healthy eating:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> All our main meals are cooked with fresh ingredients so we know what\u2019s going in. Kids are involved in the cooking (and growing food) so they learn to enjoy food. Sweet/sugary treats are not forbidden but are limited, usually as a treat with lunch or after school on a Friday. My kids are young enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about them eating junk food unless we give them it, they don\u2019t get fizzy juice and the diluting juice they do get is sugar free. We don\u2019t eat takeaways or prepacked food. Biggest issue is breakfast cereals, even Wheetabix has added sugar these days! <br></p> </blockquote> <p>They also talked about a great initiative their school is involved in:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our school does a Wednesday wander where all the kids (preschool to p7) all walk, run, skip etc a mile every Wednesday.

Medical experts and campaigners criticised the strategy \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\">centred on the sugar tax \u2013 as \u201cweak and embarrassing\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The strategy relies on voluntary action by the food and drink industry, which has undertaken to reduce by 20% the amount of sugar in products such as cereals, desserts, yoghurts and sweets. It\u2019s been made clear to manufacturers that reducing sugar in their products means they will escape the sugar tax, not due to come in for two years.</p> <p>So, what do you think of these plans? The money the government make from it will go to fund breakfast clubs and sport (giving students an extra 30 minutes a day of physical activity). </p> <p>Alex Renton wrote about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/20/sugar-tax-good-idea-go-after-processed-foods-next\">the benefits of a sugar tax in March, saying</a>: \u201cHundreds of millions will flow (if Osborne keeps his promise) into children\u2019s sports, neatly answering those who still believe, against the evidence, that the best way to address the excess calories modern children eat is through exercise.\u201d</p> <p>However, critics complain that this should go hand in hand with other measures proposed by Public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> England: banning price-cutting promotions of junk food in supermarkets and restricting advertising of unhealthy food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cf872d9b430239a3fbfd7d913410f7f31f0c1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf872d9b430239a3fbfd7d913410f7f31f0c1ee/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"burgers and chips\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more, others feel that the sugar tax in its current form is an ineffective measure. The British Medical Association said: \u201cAlthough the government proposes targets for food companies to reduce the level of sugar in their products, the fact that these are voluntary and not backed up by regulation, renders them pointless. Targets are also needed to reduce levels of saturated fat and salt in products \u2013 these must be backed up by regulation.\u201d</p> <p>The British Soft Drinks Association is also unhappy the sugary drinks levy is going ahead. \u201cGiven the economic uncertainty our country now faces, we\u2019re disappointed the government wishes to proceed with a measure which analysis suggests will cause thousands of job losses and yet fail to have a meaningful impact on levels of obesity,\u201d said Gavin Partington, its director general. He added that manufacturers were already cutting the sugar content of their drinks.</p> <p>What do you think? Share your views with us by joining our debate here from 12pm-2pm.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>I was brought up in Halepa, a small neighbourhood on the outskirts of Chania, Crete. Right beside the sea, it is one of the most beautiful little gems surrounding the city.</p> <p>By the age of six, I was pretty independent. I\u2019d walk to school 200 metres down the road, play hide and seek in the grounds of the nearby church, and ride my BMX until the early evening. On my bicycle, I could be anywhere within minutes. I\u2019d go swimming in the morning and then visit my <em>giagia</em> (granny) for a little sweet treat \u2013 usually a spoonful of a thick, chewy, sugary paste flavoured with gum mastic, dunked in a glass of ice water. We called this a submarine. Giagia was the best storyteller I have ever met. Me and my cousin Athina would sit listening to her for hours in her small kitchen, our legs dangling from two chairs, mesmerised.</p> <p>I would then head down to the little harbour where my dad or one of my uncles would be working on their boats or just staring into the horizon and contemplating whether the weather conditions were right for fishing.</p> <p>The whole area around the harbour is surrounded by the most incredible buildings \u2013 factories for treating leather \u2013 some derelict and others still in use. Every time I return home, I go for a walk around the harbour and sneakily try to enter one of those abandoned factories. I would love to make one of them my home one day.</p> <p>The tiny road that continues further along from there leads to a handful of houses and our old family restaurant. That\u2019s why my parents called it Akrolimano, \u2018the end of the harbour\u2019. After that, it\u2019s a dead end.</p> <p>Eating out in other restaurants was not something that my family really did \u2013 we were always in our own. We were open seven days a week for dinner but, occasionally, after all the shopping was done, mum would take me and my brother for a quick souvlaki lunch: freshly made pitta, lots of thinly sliced pork, tomato, red onion and lots of thick yoghurt.</p> <p>These days, we love going into town for lunch. There are many amazing tavernas. You can go by the sea for seafood or stay in the centre for more traditional dishes. The main indoor market, the <em>agora</em>, is packed with small eateries serving offal, mostly. Some open around 5am and feed everyone from the night workers needing a good meal before sleep to the party goers craving a plate of hot meaty soup to line their tummies.</p> <p>For me, lunch has become an opportunity to catch up with all the people I miss when I\u2019m in London. It starts with a group of four, and ends, several hours later, with a group of 10. Usually there is no menu. Drinks and bread arrive, then you place your order from memory. Food comes as and when it is ready. Everything is shared and everyone tucks in. You always over-order and feel so full by the end that when the lovely shot of tsikoudia (raki) is offered \u2013 to aid digestion of course \u2013 you down it happily.</p> <p>The kitchens are usually full of cooks (mostly women), rather than chefs, working wonders. I always admire the ladies that can hollow enough courgettes to make a few massive trays without breaking even one. It took me a long time to perfect my technique for hollowing vegetables destined for stuffing. Every kitchen has a slightly different way of making this dish. Some use rice, others bulgur; some use meat, others keep it vegetarian. Usually vine leaves, peppers and tomatoes are stuffed as well as courgettes and everything is cooked together in a big tray in the oven. When the tray comes out, everyone knows \u2013 the smell is simply irresistible.</p> <p>These are summertime flavours, and with summer in Crete comes watermelons. They are enormous and they weigh about the same as a small child. The farmers sell them directly from the back of their vans all over the city. The scene is amazing. An overloaded trunk, a pair of scales, and a piece of cardboard with the price per kilo written in bad handwriting.</p> <p>I was introduced to feta and watermelon about 17 years ago when a very good friend of mine, Nina, used to eat the two together with a slice of fresh bread. I still remember thinking: \u201cYou are absolutely mad.\u201d I couldn\u2019t fathom how on earth those three ingredients could be eaten together. Who would have imagined that, many years after that initial exposure, I would come to think that a fresh watermelon and feta salad is actually the best summer snack ever?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0c0b4f9205ec1ec656531d3e183a5106949d10f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0c0b4f9205ec1ec656531d3e183a5106949d10f/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marianna Leivaditaki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Back in Crete, lunch has become an opportunity to catch up with all the people I miss when I\u2019m in London,\u2019 says Marianna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Watermelon, charred feta and bread salad with mint</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br>2-3 slices sourdough bread, cut into squares<br>5 tbsp olive oil, plus more for drizzling <br>500g watermelon flesh, cut into bite-size pieces<br>10 Greek black olives, stoned<br>2 tbsp fresh mint, chopped<br>5 tbsp olive oil<br>A handful of purslane, roughly chopped<br>200g feta, cut into cubes<br>Salt and black pepper</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

  "<h2>Winning tip: Spectacular bike/train trip, Norway<br></h2> <p>Take the scenic 2\u00bd-hour train journey from Bergen to Finse, the highest railway station in Norway (1,222 metres), which is close to the Hardangerj\u00f8kulen glacier, the film location for the planet Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back.

  "<p>Ice scientists are mostly cheerful and pragmatic. Like many other researchers coolly observing the rapid warming of the world, they share a gallows humour and are cautious about entering the political fray.</p> <p>Not Peter Wadhams. The former director of the Scott Polar Research Institute and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge has spent his scientific life researching the ice world, or the cryosphere, and in just 30 years has seen unimaginable change.</p> <p>When in 1970 he joined the first of what would be more than 50 polar expeditions, the Arctic sea ice covered around 8m sq km at its September minimum. Today, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/14/melting-arctic-ice-our-world\">hovers at around 3.4m</a>, and is declining by 13% a decade. In 30 years Wadhams has seen the Arctic ice thin by 40%, the world change colour at its top and bottom and the ice disappear in front of his eyes.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/273799/a-farewell-to-ice/\">a new book</a>, published just as July 2016 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/july-2016-was-worlds-hottest-month-since-records-began-says-nasa\">confirmed by Nasa as the hottest month ever recorded</a>, this most experienced and rational scientist states what so many other researchers privately fear but cannot publicly say \u2013 that the Arctic is approaching a death spiral which may see the entire remaining summer ice cover collapse in the near future. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eeabfddac63fb17f179ff984cfb59d9d2328f99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eeabfddac63fb17f179ff984cfb59d9d2328f99/0_0_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Wadhams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Because Peter Wadhams says what other scientists will not, he has been slandered, attacked and vilified by denialists and politicians who have advised caution or non-action.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The warming now being widely experienced worldwide is concentrated in the polar regions and Wadhams says we will shortly have ice-free Arctic Septembers, expanding to four or five months with no ice at all. The inevitable result, he predicts, will be the release of huge plumes of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, accelerating warming even further. </p> <p>He and other polar experts have moved from being field researchers to being climate change pioneers in the vanguard of the most rapid and drastic change that has taken place on the planet in many thousands of years. This is not just an interesting change happening in a remote part of the world, he says, but a catastrophe for mankind.<br></p> <p> \u201cWe are taking away the beautiful world of Arctic Ocean sea ice which once protected us from the impacts of climate extremes. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is man\u2019s first major achievement in re-shaping the face of the planet,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>And, boy, are we seeing extremes. So far this year, the planet\u2019s average temperature has been 1.3C warmer than the late 19th century, and 2016 is virtually certain be the hottest year ever recorded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/climate-ministers-bribe-local-fracking-environment\">Nobody can buy the silence of a climate spinning out of control | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain and northern Europe may have had average temperatures, but <a href=\"https://www.mpg.de/10481936/climate-change-middle-east-north-africa\">500 million people</a> in the Middle East and north Africa, along with most of south-east Asia, have experienced droughts and searingly hot days and nights, which are only partly to do with the natural <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino\">El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon</a>.

But now he returns their fire, exhorting people to counter what he calls \u201cthe sewage flow of lies and deceit\u201d emitted by the deniers. Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours. </p> <p>But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power \u2013 both of which answers can be swallowed \u2013 but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/climate-crisis-media-relegates-greatest-challenge-hurtle-us-collapse-planet\">The climate crisis is already here \u2013 but no one\u2019s telling us | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the deliberate attempt to reduce warming by the planetary-scale manipulation of weather patterns, oceans, currents, soils and atmosphere to decrease the amount of greenhouses gases. </p> <p>Spraying sun-reflecting chemicals into the atmosphere, mimicking volcanoes, blocking sunlight and fertilising the oceans with iron filings attracts people who think that technology has all the answers, but it should strike fear into most of the world, which has not been responsible for warming and which has no reason to trust politicians\u2019 or scientists\u2019 further meddling with planetary forces. </p> <p>How to proceed safely in a warming world without disastrous unintended consequences? The need for truly urgent action is undeniable, but by the time answers have been found to the massive questions of science, engineering and governance that Wadhams agrees need to be solved before geo-engineering on a planetary scale can go ahead, it will be far too late. </p> <p>Climate change has been caused by ignorance and stupidity and cannot be solved by endorsing more of the same with geo-engineering.

  "<p>JM Coetzee\u2019s Man Booker-longlisted sequel to his 2013 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/27/childhood-of-jesus-jm-coetzee-review\"><em>The Childhood of Jesus</em></a> poses an intriguing question: when is a novel not a novel? The driving energy of the book, like that of its predecessor, is philosophical rather than narrative: at this stage of his career, Coetzee is far more concerned with ideas than character or plot (which have never, it has to be said, been the main strength of his terse, enigmatic fiction \u2013 rarely has a writer so effectively managed to turn his limitations into a trademark). He has always preferred to construct novels that generate their own paradigms, that operate outside recognisable historical or geographical settings, and even outside recognisable psychologies. The Coetzeean landscape is eerily stripped down, often physically rudimentary, like a <a href=\"https://zoowithoutanimals.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/de-chirico_melancholia-1916.jpg\">vista by De Chirico</a>: a featureless arena in which colossal philosophical questions cast long shadows.</p> <p>In <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>, however, the scenery is so flimsily assembled that it could come straight from Ikea. The book picks up where the first one left off, in a nameless country where everyone speaks Spanish and where refugees arrive on boats, are given new names and identities, and are \u201cwashed clean\u201d of all their old memories and associations. The capital city is Novilla, a socialist utopia whose citizens are without desires or appetites (the standard fare is bread and bean paste) but are fond of having ad hoc philosophical debates in their breaks from comradely manual labour. These conversations are all rendered in Coetzee\u2019s stilted, courtly idiom, which feels oddly apt here, reading as if it might indeed be a translation from Spanish into English.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The scenery is so flimsily assembled that it could come straight from Ikea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one in the novel is called Jesus. The Jesus of the title alludes to a motherless refugee child named Dav\u00edd who, in the previous volume, is taken under the wing of Sim\u00f3n, an earnest middle-aged man not entirely happy with this brave new world. Sim\u00f3n recruits a suitably virginal young woman, In\u00e9s, to be Dav\u00edd\u2019s new mother, but their makeshift family unit is threatened when the boy, who has unusual intellectual gifts, begins to resist the officially approved methods of learning and is sent to a reformatory. (He escapes.) The end of the first book sees the holy family in flight, following a star \u2013 their destination the \u201csprawling provincial town\u201d of Estrella.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65b0080dbca61b90a9889b2653f61501652e49d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65b0080dbca61b90a9889b2653f61501652e49d4/0_0_5150_3430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the Place d\u2019Espagne, Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reckless romancing or stolid pragmatism? \u2026 statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the Place d\u2019Espagne, Brussels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em>The Childhood of Jesus</em>, Sim\u00f3n hazards that \u201cWe are like ideas. Ideas never die,\u201d and in the sequel, too, it is ideas that matter. What actually happens is secondary, designed to move us on from one open-ended debate to the next: what is the nature of the created world? Of love? Of freedom? Of the self? Above all, of passion? Once in Estrella, Dav\u00edd is enrolled in the local Academy of Dance, run by the severe Ana Magdalena, who has the \u201calabaster\u201d beauty of a classical statue and who instructs her pupils in a mystical \u201cdance of the universe\u201d that purports to map out \u201ca higher realm where the numbers dwell\u201d. With her \u201cperfect features, perfect skin, perfect figure, perfect bearing\u201d, and chilly commitment to Platonic mumbo-jumbo, Ana Magdalena is the ultimate representative of this strange utopia\u2019s idealising tendency. \u201cBloodless, sexless, lifeless\u201d, she has all the detachment of the ideologue. Ideologies do not equal passion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his fidelity to instructing rather than seducing, Coetzee does not actually write fiction any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout the book, it is Sim\u00f3n who champions the \u201cprimacy of the personal\u201d over the communal, abstract ideal; of clay over marble. As the novel\u2019s Joseph figure and Dav\u00edd\u2019s protector, Sim\u00f3n is an indefatigable guide through these Socratic dialogues, always ready to \u201cproduce the correct, patient, educative words\u201d. The paradox is that, in spite of being the voice of individualism, he is another of Coetzee\u2019s self-abnegating protagonists, who approaches passion at a slant, dispassionately. Sim\u00f3n is a prim pedant, a killjoy, disapproving of dogs and sausages and inventing one\u2019s own stories to go with the pictures in a book.</p> <p>Never is this more apparent than when Coetzee invites us to consider philosophies of fiction. Why is Spanish the language spoken in his invented world? Because it is the language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/classics.asbyatt\"><em>Don Quixote</em></a>, the Ur-novel, one of the first to pose the question of what realism is and what fiction is for. Which is more \u201creal\u201d, more useful in navigating our existence: Quixote\u2019s reckless romancing or Sancho Panza\u2019s stolid pragmatism? <em>Don Quixote</em> (or a children\u2019s illustrated version of it) is the book that Dav\u00edd uses to teach himself to read. In <em>The Childhood of Jesus</em>, it becomes the springboard for an exchange between Dav\u00edd and Sim\u00f3n about the nature of fiction. \u201cYou can look at the page and move your lips and make up stories in your head, but that is not reading,\u201d warns Sim\u00f3n:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For real reading you have to submit yourself to what is written on the page. You have to give up your own fantasies. You have to stop being silly. You have to stop being a baby.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Sim\u00f3n is \u201ca dry old stick\u201d, Dav\u00edd \u2013 rather like the historical Jesus, one imagines \u2013 is, in his sense of authority and conviction, his dogged rejection of systems, genuinely uncanny. Dav\u00edd (who roots for Don Quixote, the fantasist, rather than for Sancho Panza, the drab realist) knows instinctively that it is \u201cthe hole between the pages\u201d, the tapping into our own fantasies, that makes fiction fiction and makes reading pleasurable. His natural affinity is for the transgressive, in particular the novel\u2019s \u201cman of passion\u201d, a voluble murderer called Dmitri who ruminates at length on guilt and justice (\u201cdon\u2019t ever let them forgive you, and don\u2019t ever listen when they promise you a new life\u201d). Dmitri\u2019s country of origin is clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\">Dostoevsky</a>.</p> <p>Sim\u00f3n is greatly exercised by the question of passion, but pleasure, rather than passion, is the real problem in <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>. It is by now apparent that this mysterious Spanish-speaking country, this place of refugee souls, stands for our embodied earthly life: \u201cThe boat docks at the harbour and we climb down the gangplank and we are plunged into the here and now. Time begins.\u201d The name \u201cNovilla\u201d suggests both a place of new beginnings and the genre in which the characters find themselves, the novel itself \u2013 that ultimate, well-worn site of inventing things anew.</p> <p>So, what are stories for? Are they for grownups or babies? In spite of its declared suspicion of Platonic idealism, the spirit of Plato, rather than the anarchic Jesus with his boundary-pushing parables, hovers over this book. Plato was famously dismissive of the seductive properties of mimetic literature, which urge us to make an imaginative identification with a fictional world. He would have agreed without hesitation that novels are for babies. Philosophy is for adults. On the evidence of this austere, barely realised mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, it is difficult not to feel that Coetzee, like Plato, is no longer much interested in the accidents of our quotidian human world, the shadows on the cave wall. He is after essence alone, the pure, ungraspable fire. In his fidelity to ideas, to telling rather than showing, to instructing rather than seducing us, he does not actually write fiction any more. <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>, philosophically dense as it is, is parched, relentlessly adult fare \u2013 rather like eating endless bread and bean paste.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/schooldays-of-jesus.html\"><em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em></a> for \u00a314.75 (\u00a317.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>When Georgina Nelson sat down with the consultant she had hired to dispense sage advice on breaking into the card payments industry and taking on TripAdvisor at the same time, she was underwhelmed. The brief was to get her rating software working on card terminals so customers could review a business as they paid their bill. The advice she was given was summed up in a presentation with a single slide of a brick wall, with a warning not to bother.</p> <p>\u201cHe was kind of right because it is a very tough industry to get in to,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he realised how determined I am though.\u201d</p> <p>Three years later and Nelson\u2019s startup, <a href=\"http://www.trurating.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">truRating</a>, has raised \u00a313.2m in angel and venture capital funding and has offices in the UK, US, Canada and Australia. Agreements have been signed with the world\u2019s two largest card payments companies, Ingenico and Verifone, along with 60 separate agreements with software providers to ensure truRating can work on their systems. </p> <p>The company now employs more than 50 staff , is chaired by former Visa Europe chief executive Pete Ayliffe and the co-head of investment banking in Europe at Goldman Sachs, Anthony Gutman, is a board-level adviser. </p> <p>The brick wall has been breached and the focus has moved from breaking into the industry to building up the scale to truly rival a TripAdvisor or Yelp. </p> <p>The idea for the business was simple and struck Nelson while she was working in the legal team at Which? magazine.</p> <p>\u201cI went to one of those great business lunch talks that really gets you thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a fabulous speech about how the big ratings sites, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, rely on a tiny proportion of members to write the vast majority of their reviews. At the same time, they have a big problem with people not knowing for sure a reviewer has really been to that hotel or restaurant. It could be a rival slamming them, or it could be the business saying great things about itself.\u201d</p> <p>It got Nelson thinking that there had to be a better way of ensuring views were reliable. She concluded the only way to make sure a review came from a real customer would be to take a rating as that person made a card payment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a623888f68a56d6884ff90a54ba296528aa13296\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a623888f68a56d6884ff90a54ba296528aa13296/488_90_721_433/500.jpg\" alt=\"Georgina Nelson, CEO and founder of startup truRating\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgina Nelson, CEO and founder of startup truRating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe question changes with each customer as it revolves around what they thought of the food, service, cleanliness, ambience or whatever the company wants to measure,\u201d says Nelson.</p> <p>\u201cA company can vary the questions between each of their different locations and they may choose to concentrate on a particular question or two at one outlet, perhaps to see how new staff are performing or if a new product is being well received.\u201d</p> <p>There are two aspects to the ratings. First, each company can set up a profile on the truRating website to show their scores \u2013 a part of the service that is still under development. Secondly, a business can use the ratings to keep informed on how it is performing. </p> <p>\u201cThe big benefit for businesses is that they\u2019ve not normally got any idea if service levels have dropped or people aren\u2019t enjoying the food in one of their outlets until it\u2019s too late and people have been put off and bad reviews have been posted,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cSo, we give them a live dashboard for how each of their locations is performing so they can find out much sooner if things are going well or if some attention is needed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/may/12/the-smartphone-app-revolutionising-foreign-currency-exchange\">The smartphone app revolutionising foreign currency exchange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At London pizza restaurant chain Franco Manca, the live feedback from the truRating system has meant that operations director Sandro Spahiu can monitor customer satisfaction levels and take action promptly when they dip.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping an eye on each outlet\u2019s ratings provides a really useful window to identify the small operational decisions that could be having a big impact,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cJust last week truRating showed our product ratings dropped in the afternoons at one of our restaurants. We investigated and it turns out our chefs were turning down the oven temperatures during the quieter afternoon periods to save energy \u2013 but it was making our pizza bases less crispy. The oven is now kept at the optimum temperature all day and our product scores have improved.\u201d</p> <p>According to Rob Kniaz a founding partner of venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures, this instant feedback could prove appealing. As for rivalling the big ratings services, he thinks that growth might be limited by trying to address a problem that is not a pain point for consumers in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people realise the big review sites balance out in the end, between the nutters who hate everything and people rating their own business,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses will often ask you to rate them on TripAdvisor so they get feedback for free, or they may give customers a code on their receipt with an offer of a voucher if they rate them on their own site,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs for the card terminal approach, it\u2019s a very hard business to make money in because margins are tiny and not every company wants an extra piece of software running on their point-of-sale system.\u201d</p> <p>Currently there are too few reviews to offer a TripAdvisor-rivalling service, although Nelson claims truRating is on course to receive more than three billion ratings by the end of 2017. Until recently, she says, truRating was in the classic chicken-and-egg situation of needing companies to sign up for a service they could only use if their card payment provider offered it. </p> <p>Now these deals are in place, she says the next task is to turn conversations with large retail and cafe chains into sign-ups for the service. These potential new customers could cumulatively provide billions of ratings per year \u2013 meaning that truRating would have the numbers needed to take on their larger rivals, with real-time feedback from verified customers.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

He lost hope because of the delay and continued to make dangerous attempts to get to the UK each night instead. A 16-year-old boy arrived at the camp with nowhere to stay and was forced to move into a tent with strangers while waiting to be granted asylum in France. </p> <p>A team of experienced therapists, including a group from the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust in London, are making regular visits to the camp. Known as the Calais Resilience Collective, they are working to enhance coping strategies of refugees, staff and volunteers, building on work carried out by the refugee team at the Tavistock.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the collective expressed alarm at the findings of the RYS report and said conditions for children were \u201cvery grim\u201d.</p> <p>Campaigners have criticised the UK government for not doing more to bring unaccompanied child refugees to the UK in line with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/fresh-proposal-to-help-child-refugees-stranded-in-europe-tabled\">Labour peer Alf Dub\u2019 s amendment to the immigration act</a> promising sanctuary.

  "<p>\u201cYou need to puncture your raft before you arrive, or they\u2019ll send you back.\u201d \u201cIf you apply for the relocation programme, they send you to Venezuela.\u201d \u201cIn Europe you won\u2019t need money, everything is free.\u201d</p> <p>These are just three of the many confusing rumours that migrants and refugees might hear. Some of them are downright dangerous, like the one about the raft. Others cause people to make the wrong decisions or take risks. <br></p> <p>In response, the Mediterranean Rumour Tracker project has been launched to better inform migrants of the facts. Fieldworkers who speak Arabic or Farsi engage with people in the Greek camps, collect the rumours that are circulating, and then verify or dispel them. This information is posted on a dedicated <a href=\"https://newsthatmoves.org/en/category/rumours/\">website</a> and corresponding Facebook pages in English, Arabic, Farsi and Greek.</p> <p>\u201cWith our Facebook pages, we reach about 350,000 people,\u201d says Stijn Aelbers of <a href=\"https://internews.org/\">InterNews</a>, the organisation that has set up the rumour tracker in collaboration with two other NGOs: <a href=\"http://translatorswithoutborders.org/\">Translators without Borders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.actionaid.org.uk/\">ActionAid</a>. \u201cBut we think face-to-face contact is just as important. People like to talk with a real person, they want to be able to ask questions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes we are able to prevent people from falling in the trap</p> <footer> <cite>Nayief Salameh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Migrants and refugees are constantly on the move; this means traditional media often don\u2019t reach them. So they get their information from hearsay, from stories that circulate among their group. Aelbers says: \u201cAs many of these stories are unfounded or only half true, they run the risk [of taking the] important next steps on the basis of false information.\u2019\u2019 </p> <p>Some rumours arise simply because people misinterpret information they get. \u201cThe rumour about Venezuela, which as a South American country cannot be part of the EU-relocation programme, probably stems from a Greek ferry boat called Venizelos,\u201d he adds. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48361f96da64d792724df709a47c5f0a20b7231f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48361f96da64d792724df709a47c5f0a20b7231f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a life vest to guide a raft carrying Syrian and Iraqi refugees onto the island of Lesbos from Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a life vest to guide a raft carrying Syrian and Iraqi refugees onto the island of Lesbos from Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rumours can also be damaging in other ways. Some may be told not tell the authorities that they are Muslim, leading them to lie during registration procedures, which can cause problems later on. And rumours in refugee camps that some groups are treated better than others, or simply get better food, can lead to conflict and brawls.</p> <p>The concept of the rumour tracker is not new. InterNews tried it out during the Ebola crisis in Liberia and during the earthquake in Nepal in 2015. \u201cRumours play an enormous role in every crisis, because people will always fill in the gaps in the information they get,\u201d Aelbers says. \u201cSo when a government campaign informs them that Ebola kills, but they see some patients recovering, rumours spring up immediately that these people are ghosts. <br></p> <p>\u201cBy dispelling rumours you can avoid huge problems. And this is certainly the case during the refugee crisis, where so many people are basing their survival strategies on false rumours. In a way, the refugee crisis is also an information crisis.\u2019\u2019</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/20/children-fleeing-conflict-deserve-more-world-humanitarian-summit\">Children fleeing conflict deserve more than razor wire and border fences | Carsten V\u00f6lz and Andreas Papp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shabnam Mortazavi is one of the four volunteers that work as refugee liaison officers for the rumour tracker in the Greek camps. Being of Iranian descent, she is fluent in Farsi, which not only enables her to communicate with Iranians, but also with Afghans, a large group among the migrants. She has recently arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos, where she\u2019s visiting the official and unofficial camps.</p> <p>\u201cMy work starts with simply talking to people,\u201d she says. \u201cI go up to them and ask them how they are and what\u2019s challenging them. I give them useful information and try to build up trust. And then they start to tell me the rumours they\u2019ve heard.\u201d </p> <p>She writes down everything she hears meticulously. \u201cRumours are also a good barometer: they tell you what\u2019s going on among migrants,\u2019\u2019 Mortazavi says. \u201cThe stories are changing all the time. When the Balkan countries where closing the borders for Afghans in February and March, there were constant rumours that they would be admitted again soon. Right now we hear lots of rumours about family reunification and returning to Turkey.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>The smugglers also spread these stories about the borders to persuade people to use their services, or to drive up the price. They might also tell migrants that in Europe everything is free, encouraging people to spend all their money on passage. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey will also say: once you come to Greece, you will be transported to Germany immediately,\u201d says Mortazavi\u2019s Arabic-speaking colleague Nayief Salameh. \u201cI met people who believed this rumour and sold everything they had to come to Greece. They were devastated when they arrived and found themselves stuck in a camp. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/close-worlds-refugee-camps-says-david-miliband\">David Miliband: close the world's refugee camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut sometimes we are able to prevent people from falling in the trap,\u201d Salameh continues. \u201cFor example, Greek travel agents on the islands spread the rumour that migrants who book a ferry to Athens need to also buy a bus ticket to Macedonia. It was a lie to make more money \u2013 once people arrived in Athens, they found out there was no bus. It\u2019s very helpful when you can dispel such rumours.\u2019\u2019 </p> <p>Aelbers believes that the need for the rumour tracker service highlights the failure of larger NGOs to keep migrants informed. \u201c[They] tend to be quite reluctant to provide information. Sometimes that\u2019s good, because the situation changes every day. But it is not always in the best interest of the migrants. Our approach is different. We work with information given by refugees.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>InterNews\u2019s motto is that communication is aid. \u201cMigrants and refugees often feel cut off from the world,\u201d Aelbers says. \u201cThere are not many people who speak their language [so] even fewer people are prepared to listen to them. And they seldom come across someone who says, \u2018OK, I am going to find out whether this story you\u2019ve heard is true and give you helpful information\u2019.\u201d </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

R\u00f6yksopp? Earlier this week, he finally revealed a few items from his current motivational playlist, including Promises by Nero and Skrillex and No Beef by Afrojack and Steve Aoki. That aggressive combination of jabbing synths and pounding kick drum is pretty standard for Phelps; in the past, he has dropped names such as Young Jeezy, Eminem and Lil Wayne. But while Phelps\u2019s teammate Ryan Lochte is reported to get similarly fired up by Lil Wayne\u2019s rhetoric in The Sky Is the Limit (\u201cCos the sky is the limit / The sky is the limit / And if you look high, you see that I\u2019m gonna be in it\u201d), the collective playlist of 2016\u2019s Olympians is a more multi-dimensional musical beast.

  "<p>The protest that interrupted Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) on Wednesday was perfectly pitched. Just after the prime minister warned about the international return of \u201cinward-looking\u201d populist politics, in came a woman with a sign reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/close-the-bloody-camps-protesters-disrupt-malcolm-turnbull-speech\">\u201cFFS close the bloody camps\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s attempt to project seriousness and toughness on economic matters was overshadowed by a reminder of how the Liberal party actually wins elections. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/17/close-the-bloody-camps-protesters-disrupt-malcolm-turnbull-speech\">Refugee protesters disrupt Malcolm Turnbull speech: 'Close the bloody camps'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His attempt to criticise the likes of Pauline Hanson and Donald Trump in the name of free markets was deflated by a blunt reference to an electoral history that he, and everyone who has benefited from it, should never be allowed to disavow. </p> <p>If you didn\u2019t catch the speech, Turnbull diagnosed the rise of rightwing populism as an outcome of \u201cuncertainty\u201d: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Political divisions in advanced economies \u2013 particularly where there is high unemployment or a high risk of unemployment \u2013 are feeding on a sense of disenfranchisement among many people who feel the rapid economic changes of our time, have left them behind.</p> <p>Political responses to this mood of disaffection can have the potential to destabilise global growth, perhaps even reversing some of the spectacular gains that we have made over recent decades, through open markets and free trade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that Turnbull\u2019s main concern is that this all leads to \u201cprotectionism\u201d. He doesn\u2019t mention the blatant xenophobia that figures like Hanson and Trump invoke in scapegoating minority groups, and the heightened racial tension that this produces. </p> <p>In a way, that makes sense. The Liberal party has shown, at least since the Tampa election of 2001, that it is more than happy to recalibrate the Hansonist message to its own ends. It has been populist on immigration, and ruthlessly orthodox on economics. </p> <p>It has been far more concerned with departures from neoliberal doctrine than with the fate of those \u2013 including children \u2013 who have been imprisoned for seeking asylum in Australia. </p> <p>Since 2001, at crucial moments, it has run on platforms that scapegoat refugees, while doing nothing to ameliorate the economic system that produces a feeling of \u201cdisenfranchisement\u201d among those who have been \u201cleft behind\u201d, and drives some of them into the arms of racist parties. </p> <p>In particular, in 2013, when Tony Abbott won the majority that Malcolm Turnbull has all but lost, he ran a relentlessly negative and cynical campaign that could almost be a prototype for Trumpism. </p> <p>Where Trump promises to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d; Abbott said he would \u201cstop the boats\u201d. Where Abbott promised to \u201cend the waste\u201d, Trump promises to \u201cdo better deals\u201d. While Abbott pandered to climate change denying crackpots, Trump peddles conspiracy theories about his primary opponents. Each energised the rightward edge of his party. </p> <p>And both men have projected hypermasculine public images while prosecuting intensely personal, sexist campaigns against female opponents. While Trump talks about \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d, Abbott yelled about Julia Gillard\u2019s \u201ccriminal government\u201d. </p> <p>Granted, Tony Abbott and Donald Trump have different relationships to their parties\u2019 establishments, but the fact that the Liberals promoted Abbott is not to their credit. </p> <p>Turnbull served as a cabinet minister while all this was going on, and when the opportunity arose to knock off Abbott, he was happy to swoop on the fruits that the 2013 campaign bore. He is complicit in the further entrenchment of racially-inflected scapegoating as the Australian right\u2019s way of doing politics. </p> <p>In office, Turnbull may have wound back the rhetoric, but he hasn\u2019t changed refugee policy at all, and seems unable or unwilling to rein in those members of his party who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/13/senator-cory-bernardi-wins-inquiry-into-halal-and-kosher-certifications\">obsess about halal food</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/17/hell-will-freeze-over-before-i-pull-out-of-reclaim-australias-rally\">attend Reclaim Australia rallies</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/if-malcolm-turnbull-cant-fix-this-mess-tony-abbott-is-available\">If Malcolm Turnbull can't fix this mess, Tony Abbott is available | Kristina Keneally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he deserves any credit at all, it arises from the fact that his lack of evident enthusiasm in administering these policies has led the likes of <a href=\"http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/malcolm_turnbull_you_are_finished/\">Andrew Bolt to criticise him</a> relentlessly. </p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the Liberal party has been the principal agent in embedding an immigration system, and a kind of ambient public racism, that acts as a <a href=\"http://www.ukipdaily.com/how-australia-stopped-mass-immigration/\">model for populist right wing groups</a> in Europe and elsewhere. (Labor\u2019s craven accommodation of this \u2013 after having initiated mandatory detention in the first place \u2013 is a discussion for another day.)</p> <p>And Turnbull\u2019s solution to the social and economic dislocations that far-right parties exploit is \u2026 more of the same. More free trade agreements, more tax cuts for business, and some vague noises about \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d. </p> <p>None of this suggests that Malcolm Turnbull understands what gives rise to populist revolts. And anyway, no one needs to take his pronouncements on rightwing populist ideas seriously until he stops profiting from them, and closes the bloody camps. </p>",
  "<p>British society hands out golden tickets to the privileged. These tickets secure the lucky few, born into certain select families, disproportionate power and influence for the rest of their lives. Growing up in a comfortable home with space to study; always having a satisfied stomach; being exposed to a wide range of books and a broad vocabulary from an early age; all these factors help guarantee academic success.</p> <p>A private education can inject extra confidence; family connections and contacts can open the door to desirable professions. Expensive postgraduate qualifications \u2013 increasingly necessary for certain careers \u2013 can be paid for by parents with the disposable income to do so. Working for free in unpaid internships \u2013 another ever more crucial passport into elite jobs \u2013 is a financial non-starter for many, but not for those whose parents have healthy bank balances. The housing crisis can be bypassed with a generous bank transfer from Mum and Dad, either helping with the rent or putting down the deposit.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that British elites are so&#xa0;utterly unrepresentative of the wider population. Private schools educate only 7% of Britons. And yet, according to research by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/24/privately-educated-elite-continues-to-take-top-jobs-finds-survey\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust</a> this year, private school alumni make up nearly three quarters of the top judiciary, over two-thirds of Oscar winners, six out of 10 top doctors, over half of the top journalists, and almost a third of MPs.</p> <p>Unless you really believe \u201cthe most talented\u201d and \u201cthe most privileged\u201d are synonymous, this is manifestly unjust. Only a programme of social transformation can address such inequality \u2013 from tackling the housing crisis to increasing investment in early-years education to a war on poverty.</p> <p>This government, on the other hand, has opted for tinkering. The Tory Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer (himself the privately educated son of a&#xa0;Tory cabinet minister) proposes to ask all civil service applicants <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/job-applicants-to-be-asked-if-they-are-from-middle-classes-qqrsmffdm\" title=\"\">12 questions</a>. Their purpose: to assess where they stand in the social pecking order. The questions are certainly eclectic, ranging from whether they spent time in care or previously held refugee or asylum status, to what school they went to, whether they were eligible for free school meals, and what their postcode was at the age of 14. And then the question guaranteed to cause squirming \u2013 how the applicant would assess their own socio-economic background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b01c66a7a9d05939897ddaa761d7353407de74f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b01c66a7a9d05939897ddaa761d7353407de74f2/0_25_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The shift from a working class of mines, steelworks and factories to one of supermarkets, call centres and offices confused things, but merely discussing class is often regarded as subversive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such efforts are not worthless: they may provide a small boost to efforts to make elite professions more diverse, and at least foster debate about our class-ridden \u2013 indeed, class-defined \u2013 society. Sure, the shift from a working class of mines, steelworks and factories to one of supermarkets, call centres and offices confused things, but merely discussing class is often regarded as subversive: after all, it not only makes us confront the issue of who has wealth and power, it also encourages us to ask why.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Questioning class privilege in elite circles can be construed as a personal attack</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there\u2019s the insecurity of the elite. Everyone likes to believe their success is down to their own talent, hard work and determination. Questioning class privilege in elite circles can be construed as a personal attack: \u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m only here because I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth!\u201d (Cards on the table: I do not believe I would be writing for this paper if, like people I grew up with, I spent my childhood on a Stockport council estate.)</p> <p>Discussions about class suffer from a lack of precision. For example, the&#xa0;educational attainment of working-class white pupils is often discussed, but&#xa0;the statistics actually relate to \u201cwhite pupils who are eligible for free school meals\u201d. Only around 14% of pupils claim them, so \u201cworking class\u201d simply becomes synonymous with the poorest families in society.</p> <p>But the working class has always included a broad variety of experiences: homeowners and social housing tenants, full-time and part-time, women&#xa0;and men, British-born and migrant, black and white, public and private sector, urban and rural, English and Scottish, and so on. Such differences often become divisions that&#xa0;are ruthlessly and effectively exploited, turning neighbour against neighbour, rather than directing anger at&#xa0;the powerful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/14/courageous-thinking-labour-education-jeremy-corbyn\">At last, courageous thinking from Labour on education | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The left desperately needs to refocus on class. From the 1980s onwards \u2013 as the Labour movement was crushed, old industries smashed and the cold war ended \u2013 class took the back seat. Gender, race and sexuality seemed more salient and relevant. In truth, it should never have been either/or: how can you understand gender without class and vice versa given, say, the disproportionate concentration of women in low-paid and insecure work?</p> <p>But this era left many working-class people feeling that not only did the left no longer care about them \u2013 worse, that these issues had become sticks to beat them with. Many felt insulted and written off as a bigoted, backward, knuckle-dragging mob, only happy when launching an expletive-ridden diatribe about a minority.</p> <p>The abandonment of class since the 90s has had profound consequences for this country. As in the&#xa0;United States, the populist right saw a vacuum and they occupied it: they&#xa0;adopted the language of class, spoke of how the metropolitan liberal set had nothing but contempt for working-class Britain, and championed working-class interests \u2013 not against bosses and bankers, but rather immigrants and benefit cheats.</p> <p>And lo, a working-class revolt finally came, and it was Brexit. Let\u2019s not generalise: millions of working-class people did vote to remain, particularly those from ethnic minorities or who were younger. But while a large majority of middle-class professionals voted for the EU, a decisive majority of working-class people opted to leave. Ukip chipped into&#xa0;a Labour working-class base that felt maligned and demonised.</p> <p>While Labour descends into a mire of&#xa0;introversion and internecine conflict, Theresa May is cleverly raiding the old language of the left. Her government will only further entrench the concentration of wealth and power in very few hands.

He said: \u201cGoing home is not an option for these men, most of whom have already been recognised as refugees\u201d. </p> <p>O\u2019Connor said the proposed resettlement of these people on Papua New Guinea is \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d, due to physical violence and threats against them.</p> <p>The Refugee Action Coalition called for people on Manus to be released, and said the Australian and PNG governments may be trying to head off a court case seeking the unconditional release of all detainees and their return to Australia.</p> <p>The Save the Children chief executive, Paul Ronalds, said: \u201cThe Turnbull government must now find a humane and sustainable resettlement pathway for these men, be it in Australia or a safe, developed and appropriate third country that affords them the rights.\u201d</p> <p>Human Rights Watch Australia director, Elaine Pearson, echoed that call and said the men could not be \u201csimply shunted down the road to a transit centre or moved to Nauru or Cambodia\u201d.</p> <p>Oxfam Australia chief executive, Helen Szoke, called for the Manus and Nauru detention facilities to be shut, for detainees\u2019 claims to be quickly assessed, and refugees to be permanently settled in Australia if their claims were successful.</p> <p>Speaking on the ABC\u2019s AM program on Thursday, Dutton confirmed that refugees and asylum seekers in offshore detention \u201cwill never be settled in Australia\u201d.
