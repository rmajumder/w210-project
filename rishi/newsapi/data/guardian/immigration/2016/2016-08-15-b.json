We are beyond that point. And at this stage, the only humane option is to bring people to Australia, or perhaps allow them to go to New Zealand, as has been offered by that country. It\u2019s the only option that is humane and defensible.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Realistically, the only option is Australia and New Zealand</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Hughes, ANU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Menadue said where processing took place was not the critical issue: \u201cWhat is important is that processing is efficient, humane and fair.\u201d</p> <p>Australia had to work much harder, he said, to forge strong and trusting relationships with other countries in the region \u2013 particularly the transit countries of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia \u2013 to be able to build a genuine \u201cregional arrangement\u201d for addressing irregular migration flows.</p> <p>Menadue said the 2011 refugee transfer arrangement with Malaysia, ultimately defeated after it was opposed by the Coalition in opposition and the Greens, and then struck down by the high court, could have been the \u201cbuilding block\u201d for more effective regional cooperation.</p> <p>Under the deal 800 boat-borne asylum seekers in Australia would have been transferred to Malaysia for processing under the auspices of the UN high commissioner for refugees in exchange for 4,000 registered refugees in Malaysia being flown to Australia for resettlement.</p> <p>Late last week, after the revelations of the Nauru files, the Malaysia arrangement\u2019s most vocal opponent, the then opposition leader Tony Abbott, questioned whether he was wrong to oppose the deal, saying:\u201cLetting it stand would have been an acknowledgment of the government-of-the-day\u2019s mandate to do the best it could, by its own lights, to meet our nation\u2019s challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been a <a href=\"http://tonyabbott.com.au/2016/08/transcript-of-the-hon-tony-abbott-mp-address-to-the-samuel-griffith-society-stamford-plaza-hotel-adelaide/\">step back from the hyper-partisanship</a> that now poisons our public life.\u201d </p> <p>Menadue said the defeat of the Malaysia transfer arrangement had been \u201ca tragedy, because that has given us Nauru and Manus Island\u201d.</p> <p>Peter Hughes from the Australian National University\u2019s Crawford school of public policy \u2013 formerly the deputy secretary of the immigration department and the official who negotiated the ultimately blocked refugee transfer arrangement with Malaysia \u2013 <a href=\"http://johnmenadue.com/blog/?p=6269\">has written that the Australian government now needed to find a way to resettle</a> those now held on Nauru and Manus.<br></p> <p>\u201cRealistically, the only option is Australia and New Zealand,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/offshore-detention-australia-secret-exposed-nauru-files\">Offshore detention\u2019s callous, brutal bureaucracy damns itself | Ben Doherty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hughes argued that, at best, only a handful of refugees might be able to stay on Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and that efforts to find a suitable \u201cthird country\u201d for resettlement had foundered.</p> <p>In three years since the reinstitution of offshore processing, only one country, Cambodia, has agreed to accept refugees from Australia. At a cost of more than $40m to Australia, it has resettled one person. </p> <p>\u201cIf there was somewhere else \u2018acceptable\u2019, it would have been found by now and the refugees would have moved there,\u201d Hughes wrote. \u201cRegional countries will be wary of helping out, given the propensity of Australians to drag them into our domestic disputes and make them the target of criticism for getting involved.</p> <p>\u201cThe pressures of asylum seeker and refugee populations faced by many countries around the world mean that the price that Australia would have to pay (in whatever form) for any country taking even small numbers would be very high.\u201d</p> <p>The director of the Kaldor centre for international refugee law at the University of New South Wales, Jane McAdam, said those held in detention offshore should be brought to Australia, as the majority of those held under the first iteration of offshore processing, between 2001 and 2007, ultimately were.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Protection must be front and centre. We need policies founded on respect for human dignity</p> <footer> <cite>Jane McAdam, UNSW</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTransferring asylum seekers to offshore processing centres was never going to be a durable solution,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the former secretary of the immigration department, Andrew Metcalfe, said in Senate estimates in 2008, other countries were very reluctant to resettle refugees from Nauru \u2018essentially for the reason that those folks are seen as Australia\u2019s responsibility and Australia is a country with sufficient resources to deal with the issue\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>McAdam said other elements of Australia\u2019s asylum policies, such as boat interdictions and turnbacks, did not comply with international law. She argued that Australia should reorient its policies to comply \u201cwith both the letter and the spirit of international law\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cProtection must be front and centre,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need policies founded on respect for human dignity and the premise that every person should be able to live a safe and dignified life. </p> <p>\u201cIf we did this, many of our current policies simply could not continue \u2013 mandatory detention, turnbacks without proper screening, offshore processing without rigorous oversight and durable solutions in place.\u201d <br></p> <p>McAdam said, historically, Australia had had one of the best refugee status determination systems in the world, and could be an exemplar again.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia could show principled international leadership on refugee protection at a time when this is sorely needed. By modelling good practice and \u2018protection in action\u2019, we could help to develop the regional protection space.\u201d</p> <p>Father Frank Brennan, professor of law at the Australian Catholic University, described the Manus and Nauru detention centres as \u201cticking time bombs\u201d and said that for the government to continue to hold people in indefinite detention was \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They have no mandate to make these people suffer more, in our name, for no appreciable benefit to anybody</p> <footer> <cite>Father Frank Brennan, Australian Catholic University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He told the Guardian the Australian government should impose a time limit \u2013 proposing the end of this year \u2013 to facilitate third-country resettlement or bring people to Australia.</p> <p>Brennan argued the indefinite warehousing of people in offshore detention was not necessary to stop boats, and that moving people out of those detention centres would not restart boats coming to Australia, because Australia was capable of successfully interdicting boats leaving from Indonesia.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Houston panel saw only three purposes to be served by holding people on Manus and Nauru: a temporary circuit breaker; a standby for any future influx; a part of the jigsaw for a regional solution with regional processing centres,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe ticking time bombs on Nauru and Manus meets none of those purposes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the major parties to commit to a timetable for resettlement in appropriate countries. If proven refugees are still being warehoused on Nauru or Manus Island at the end of the year, they should be resettled in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan told the Guardian that while some in the refugee advocacy community would oppose any position that maintained boat interdictions and turnbacks, it was a solution that would allow for the camps on Nauru and Manus Island to be emptied.</p> <p>He said while the government had a mandate to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, it had no mandate to publicly punish people \u2013 not accused of any crime \u2013 as a deterrent to others. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/nauru-files-how-you-can-help-people-held-in-detention-by-australia\">Nauru files: how you can help people held in detention by Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey have no mandate to make these people suffer more, in our name, for no appreciable benefit to anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Several migration experts who spoke anonymously to the Guardian have said that within the immigration department there was widespread, and growing, realisation that the offshore detention regime was failing and unsustainable.</p> <p>Some suggested the government needed to find a way to close the Manus and Nauru camps in practice, while still retaining the policy of \u201coffshore processing\u201d \u2013 even if only in theory.</p> <p>It was suggested to the Guardian that opponents of offshore processing needed to allow the government a \u201cface-saving\u201d option to close the camps while still ostensibly retaining its policy, heeding the advice of Sun Tzu who counselled leaving opponents a way to escape, usually quoted as an entreaty to \u201cbuild your opponents a golden bridge to retreat across\u201d.<br></p>",

Then, from next May, for larger employers, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work\" title=\"\">the apprenticeship levy</a> will also be applied. If, in addition, there are fewer EU workers, that is likely to mean more upward pressure on pay. Some employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/16/employers-claw-back-national-living-wage-cuts-pay-perks\" title=\"\">are already clawing back other benefits</a> in response to the living wage, and warning of existential threats.</p> <p>Contemplating the consequences of Brexit is clarifying the real impact of the movement of 21st-century labour. The latest research from the Resolution Foundation summarises the impact of high levels of migration from the new accession countries after 2004. It acknowledges that those who argued that migration was an unmitigated good, growing the economy to the benefit of all, overstated their case \u2013 almost as much as did those who argued that migration was invariably harmful. The latter were right that in low-paying sectors, wages were held down. But EU migrants also tended to contribute more in taxes than they received in benefits. Maybe the biggest impact is contradictory: it concealed the other marked development in the period, particularly after the 2008 crash \u2013 the wider stagnation of wages.</p> <p>Of course, pay was not the only reason that migrant workers came to be so resented. Queues for doctors\u2019 appointments and overcrowded classrooms were easier to see than differences in pay, and they played a bigger part in fuelling resentment. Yet in the same way that migration concealed structural change in wages, its impact on public services served as a distraction from the real cost of the austerity measures brought in by the coalition government in 2010.</p> <p>What is already becoming clear, and will only become clearer as EU membership is more fully examined, is that Britain\u2019s labour market does not function well. If EU migration has held pay down, it ought to follow that pay will go up in response to the labour shortages that are likely to be the consequence of a cut in migration. Not so much, according to the Resolution Foundation. The original impact of cheap labour was to cut at most a few pence off wages, and only from the pay of \u201cnative\u201d workers with no qualifications; on the foundation\u2019s projections, the likely effect of cutting EU economic migration will simply reverse that. And if, as projected, the economy shrinks, it is likely to mean a downward pressure on wages that could outweigh the impact of labour shortages.</p> <p>In theory, scarce labour should also be an incentive to invest and modernise in a way that the plentiful supply of low-paid workers has made unnecessary until now. The teams of car valets from Lithuania will be replaced by an upgraded version of the drive-through car wash that had almost disappeared, and supermarkets will at last introduce the kind of electronic pricing system that is commonplace in France. UK productivity may even show an improvement. But it would also upend the British labour market model where high levels of employment are set against hyper-flexible working and low pay. Post Brexit, there may be fewer jobs, but they will be better paid.</p> <p>So far, so good. But there are much wider consequences, not least for millions of local authority workers and the councils that pick up their wages bill. There is a crisis already in the care home sector, and the NHS is in the grip of its worst ever cash shortage. Faced with challenges like this, the government will have to take some hard decisions about how it meets its pledge to the Brexiteers.</p>",
  "<p>You might think that the nation that gave the world the theory of evolution would be a bit better at learning from its mistakes. Not so. Four years ago, the weeks running up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">the London Olympic Games</a> generated a carnival of British negativity. Nothing would be ready; it would all cost too much; the VIPs would hog the tickets; Londoners would be fed up; non-Londoners would resent the whole thing; it was all an expensive folly.</p> <p>But then the Games started, and everything changed. Thousands volunteered. Even bigger numbers bought tickets; millions were glued to the coverage; our team did well; the show brought us all together; so did the sport. Everything worked. We found new heroes: Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Nicola Adams. Instead of moaning about the games, we found ourselves feeling surprisingly good about ourselves. In the blink of an eye, London 2012 was suddenly the best Games ever; and the doomsters were routed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/rio-2016\" title=\"\">Rio 2016</a> is not yet halfway through. Something there may yet go wrong. Yet already a similar about-turn, at least in British attitudes, is in evidence. Before they started, the Rio games were loftily pronounced a disaster from afar. The facilities weren\u2019t ready; a divided Brazil could not afford it; protesters would bring Rio to its knees; the Zika virus would make people stay away; drugs cheats would destroy the games.</p> <p>All that looks pretty silly right now. True, there have been embarrassments such as the diving pool turning green and some dubious plumbing in the Olympic village. True, some events have been played out to at best half-empty stadiums. But the much larger reality is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games\" title=\"\">the Olympic Games</a> have proved once again that they genuinely capture the attention of the world. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/opinion/brazils-uplifting-olympics.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Brazil itself</a>, which as the composer Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim once said is not a country for beginners, has gone a long way to silence the sceptics, at least for now.</p> <p>Most of that \u2013 why should anyone be surprised? \u2013 is down to the sport. Granted, some of the sports are niche activities, not global pastimes, and some coverage here and probably elsewhere is too chauvinistic at times. But such points have to be put in perspective. Sporting success is something to applaud, not sneer at \u2013 and yes, Britain is good at this stuff. Much of the competition in these Games has been unconditionally inspiring. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/aug/15/usain-bolt-wins-olympic-gold-again-andy-murray-del-potro-rio-video-highlights\" title=\"\">Usain Bolt\u2019s third successive 100 metres gold</a> was a moment when most of the world was watching and cheering as one. In gymnastics, Simone Biles has made herself a global icon. There have been a host of less celebrated feats and moments to treasure too: the <a href=\"https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/games-of-the-underdog-five-athletes-who-won-their-country-s-first-ever-gold-medal-at-rio-2016-oympic-games\" title=\"\">first ever gold medals</a> for Fiji, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore and Vietnam; the heroism of the refugee team with its Syrians and South Sudanese; corny moments like the Chinese swimmer\u2019s marriage proposal; and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/irish-rowers-paul-gary-odonovan-give-the-best-interview-of-the-rio-olympics-so-far_uk_57aed77ae4b01ec53b3f6b8d\" title=\"\">the Irish rowers\u2019 matchless TV interviews</a>.</p> <p>The Olympics are a global corporation. They are not perfect. It might be better to hold them on a permanent site in Greece \u2013 good for the Greek economy too \u2013 than to rotate the Games every four years. But Rio is confirming what London taught. The games are worthwhile. They celebrate individual achievement of every kind, not just national prowess. They bring people together far more than they drive them apart. And the peoples of the world respond to them with real enthusiasm. None of that is bad. Memo to ourselves in 2020 and beyond: the Olympic Games will be fine, come what may.</p>",
  "<p>I get nauseous every time I hear the name Ralph Nader. If all those votes cast for him for president in 2000 had gone to Al Gore, we might have been spared the Iraq war, the frat-boy alliance of George W and Tony Blair, and other horrors.</p> <p>So I hate so-called third parties. I prefer to call them \u201cfringe\u201d. I don\u2019t believe that voting has anything to do with the so-called likability of the candidates. Who cares which of them is the one you\u2019d rather meet in the pub? Nor should voting be an act of protest. The Green party zealots who went for Nader because they said there wasn\u2019t a dime of difference between Bush and Gore were tragically wrong.</p> <p>Voting is a sacred duty of US citizenship and as such, the presidential contest is about one central question: in whose hands is the country most likely to prosper, be safe and come closest to the American promise of equal rights for all?</p> <p>Because Trump and Clinton are such disliked and polarizing candidates, I understand why alternatives might appeal. Many voters do want to support someone who most purely mirrors their ideals. They don\u2019t want to vote pragmatically or settle for the lesser of two evils.</p> <p>This is a real dilemma. But 2016 isn\u2019t the year for purity. Casting a vote for any of the alternative party or independent candidates in November could have truly disastrous effects.</p> <p>With Trump on the ballot, the risk of unintentionally helping elect an unstable man who is clearly not prepared for the job is too big. After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">past two weeks</a>, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that the pugnacious real estate tycoon has spontaneously combusted, like <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/60468/how-charles-dickens-fueled-world-spontaneous-combustion-truthers\">Old Krook</a> in Dickens\u2019 Bleak House. But by November, as has been true in most recent American elections, the gap between the two candidates will narrow. Even with all the self-inflicted wounds, Trump still starts out with a likely base of 170 electoral votes. Getting the next 100 needed for election will be extremely hard but not impossible. If Clinton is to win the swing states she needs to get to 270, she can\u2019t have too many votes siphoned away by fringe candidates like the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>When I combed through their platforms and records, I, too, found a lot to like about Stein and Johnson, especially after I listened to their one hour, <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/green-party-nominee-dr-jill-stein\">back</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2016/08/10/gary-johnson-on-what-it-means-to-be-a-libertarian\">back</a> interviews with Boston radio host Tom Ashbrook. Stein\u2019s sincerity and smarts were evident. Since she twice ran for governor of Massachusetts and once before for president in 2012 (she received 469,000 votes, more than separated JFK and Nixon in 1960), she was more seasoned as a politician than I expected. Her calls for free college tuition and a 15% federal minimum wage mirrored those of Bernie Sanders, some of whose followers are using the Twitter hashtag #jillnothill. As would be expected of a Green candidate, her top issue is protecting \u201cMother Earth\u201d, by dramatically reducing dependence on fossil fuels and banning nuclear power.</p> <p>Her central message is a direct play for disaffected Democrats: \u201cThe [Democratic party] boat is sinking and it\u2019s taking us down with it. This is the time to get off of that boat. We [progressives] have a lifeboat. It\u2019s called the Green party, so let\u2019s not sink together, let\u2019s sail together!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, the genial former Republican governor of a Democratic state, New Mexico, was popular in office, lowering state taxes, expanding jobs and attracting more businesses. Although he says he\u2019s personally against abortion, he believes it\u2019s the woman\u2019s right to decide. His antipathy to stricter gun laws isn\u2019t surprising for a libertarian, but will turn off liberal voters in urban areas. He\u2019s for legalizing marijuana. His low-tax mantra will appeal to Republicans who think Trump\u2019s economic plan is voodoo, to use an old Geroge HW Bush word. Johnson does seem a viable alternative to Trump for Republicans who just can\u2019t stomach Clinton and perhaps for Sanders Democrats. Maine senator Susan Collins <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/susan-collins-no-clinton-226822\">suggested recently</a> that she\u2019s considering voting Libertarian.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that people will see that we don\u2019t have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative,\u201d Johnson has said.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also watched some television appearances by Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old factotum of the Republican party, who is running as an independent candidate. Virtually unknown, he is hardly the GOP\u2019s answer to finding a viable Trump alternative. I do give him credit for having the guts to try to drain Republicans away from Trump, but he just won\u2019t be a factor in November.</p> <p>None of this occasional likability translates into anything meaningful, however. None of these candidates could possibly win. So a casting a protest vote for any one of them is akin to throwing your vote away.</p> <p>The most influence they would hope to wield is if any of them reach 15% in national polls. That way, they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/third-party-candidates-johnson-stein-mcmullin-debate-polling-percentage\">included in the presidential debates</a>, gaining much wider national exposure. Johnson probably has the best chance to make it in, but Trump opposes anything but a direct one-on-one with Clinton. Some suspect this is a ruse to withdraw from the debates altogether, rather than get creamed by Clinton.</p> <p>This extraordinary election is definitely a two-horse race. But the questions raised by the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump point to an uncertain future.</p> <p>A politically savvy friend of mine, who works for one of the American TV television networks, told me he thinks Trump may be the last GOP presidential nominee. This friend, a Republican, believes the party will never recover from the Trump disaster. It will splinter into various other entities, some of them to sit it out on the fringe.</p> <p>And what of those Democrats alienated by Hillary\u2019s pivot away from the left as she moves into territory vacated by Trump, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clintons-embrace-of-kissinger-is-inexcusable/\">courting</a> Republican establishment figures such as Henry Kissinger?</p> <p>If there is no realignment, no recalibration, then the risk is that the angry voices on both left and right find no meaningful outlet. Third parties will never be a significant feature American politics, but after this election, the future shape of the two main ones is a question that cannot be neglected.</p>",

One in four residents were born abroad: people such as British bankers, German teachers and Italian doctors.

In a high-profile case in 2009, Semenya burst onto the international scene in Berlin with a stunning performance in the 800m. She was immediately investigated by the IAAF, the body that oversees international athletics competition, over concerns about her eligibility to compete in women\u2019s events, largely based on her appearance. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/07/06/athletics.semenya.cleared.to.run/\">Semenya was cleared to compete as a woman by the IAAF</a> a year later. </p> <p>The episode, and the IAAF\u2019s poor handling of it, led the athletics governing body to develop a new set of rules for eligibility into women\u2019s competition based on testosterone levels. But those new rules were tossed out last year by <a href=\"http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/award_internet.pdf\">the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which argued</a> that high testosterone levels in women did not lead to \u201csuch a significant performance advantage that it is necessary to exclude them from competing in the female category.\u201d <br></p> <p>The absence of clear rules has led to a vigorous debate over testosterone or other techniques that might be used to sex test athletes. Much of that debate veers into territory that is at times overtly sexist and degrading. The IAAF itself says that a policy is needed to show \u201crespect for the very essence of the male and female classifications in athletics.\u201d Under its testosterone policy, the IAAF provided criteria that could be used to identify women who may be in violation of its testosterone regulations. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Edge-against-Cheating-Corruption-Cutthroat/dp/1938901576/\">These criteria include the size and fullness of breasts, hip size, and other conventional stereotypes of femininity</a>. Sexism in the sex testing debate is not found only in online discussion.</p> <p>But as debate proceeds, the world moves along. Sport can\u2019t wait for the elusive Holy Grail, as IAAF experts have explained: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15265161.2013.776129\">We must find ways to take into account that sex is not neatly divided into only two categories in the real world</a>.\u201d <br></p> <p>So how should sports organizations use science to draw a line between men and women for purposes of competition? The answer seems obvious: they shouldn\u2019t. We should stop searching for the biological \u201cessence\u201d of males and female and instead take a more pragmatic approach.</p> <p>Some observers have come to a similar conclusion and have recommended a policy of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/sports/olympics/olympic-sex-verification-you-say-youre-a-woman-that-should-be-enough.html?_r=1&amp;\">anything goes</a>,\u201d in which an athlete simply determines his or her gender when entering a competition and that is that. This approach respects the dignity of the athlete, but presents some practical obstacles. For instance, even though fraud has not been a significant problem in the past, opening up participation to anyone on their say-so could lead to mischief if men enter women\u2019s competitions. </p> <p>Fortunately, sporting organizations are no strangers to classifications challenges. The resolution of such a challenge in a different context offers some guidance on how to deal with segregating women and men in competition. </p> <p>In elite sport, <em>nationality</em> refers to the country (or political body, as not all sporting nations are independent, sovereign countries) that the athlete represents in competition. Sporting bodies have learned that <a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf\">nationality is not the same thing as legal citizenship</a>. In the pursuit of sporting success, some nations have shown a willingness to issue passports to elite athletes <a href=\"http://www.lawinsport.com/articles/regulation-a-governance/item/us-immigration-policy-negatively-impacts-us-soccer\">who have very few ties to the country whose name is on their new passport</a>. That practice has forced sports organizations to come up with new rules for governing nationality.</p> <p>Some critics of nationality guidelines see the fundamental ambiguity in such rules and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/26/which-country-did-you-say-you-were-playing-for-in-the-olympics/eliminate-nationality-rules\">call for them to be abolished</a>. Others see in the rules the \u201cvery essence\u201d of nationality. For instance, when it was revealed that the teenage Manchester United star Adnan Januzaj, a Belgian citizen of Albanian descent, would be eligible to play for the England national team, Arsenal\u2019s Jack Wilshire prompted a row by tweeting: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/09/kevin-pietersen-jack-wilshere-twitter-englishness\">The only people who should play for England are English people</a>.\u201d Kevin Pietersen, a cricket player who was born in South Africa but played for England, took exception to the comment and replied with a list of English sports stars of various national lineages: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/09/kevin-pietersen-jack-wilshere-twitter-englishness\">Interested to know how you define foreigner ...? Would that include me, Strauss, Trott, Prior, Justin Rose, Froome, Mo Farah</a>?\u201d</p> <p>Sporting bodies, wisely, have not waded into the thicket of defining the essence of nationality, lest it open up issues of ethnicity, historical conquest and subjugation, race, and politics. But these bodies also reject a policy of anything goes that would risk turning national sport competition into a club-like competition where athletes are traded, bought, and sold. Nor do these bodies generally rely on legal citizenship. For instance, according to Fifa\u2019s rules, citizenship is not a sufficient basis for eligibility to play on national soccer teams.</p> <p>Sporting bodies have adopted procedural guidelines to reflect the reality of nationalism while avoiding making a mockery of the categorization. Consequently, there are strict criteria for changing nationalities. <a href=\"http://qatarsportstanmiya.org/naturalized-players-dominate-qatars-sports-scene/\">Some say that they are not strict enough</a>. </p> <p>As with the issue of sex testing, the procedural guidelines for determining nationality are openly debated and challenged and found by some to be unsatisfactory. But unlike with the sex testing guidelines, sporting bodies do not appeal to scientific criteria or physical appearance to determine nationality (though one could easily imagine the use of genetic tests to determine ancestry for purposes of nationality). The key difference between nationality and sex testing is that those who govern sporting bodies appear to believe in a binary differentiation between men and women, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. In other words, they reject the idea that science can determine \u201cEnglishness\u201d but accept the idea that science can identify \u201cfemaleness.\u201d </p> <p>What would a procedural approach to determining eligibility for participation in women\u2019s events look like if it were modeled on nationality guidelines? Here are some thoughts:</p> <ul> <li>Legal status alone would be insufficient, and it may or may not be necessary (currently some countries recognize men and women, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/11/01/242366812/germany-offers-third-gender-option-on-birth-certificates\">others recognize a greater number of genders</a>, and still others have no formal policy regarding gender status). </li> <li>Participation in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s competitions would be determined initially by the athlete in the first instance of participating in organized national or international <em>elite</em> competition segregated into men\u2019s and women\u2019s categories. This would in almost all cases take place at the youth or junior level.</li> <li>On reaching senior competition and legal adulthood, the athlete would sign an affidavit testifying to his or her gender.</li> <li>Consistency in participation in men\u2019s or women\u2019s competitions would be required from the first instance through senior (i.e., adult) competitions.</li> <li>In those cases where an athlete wishes to change gender categories, policies and procedures would cover this contingency.</li> </ul> <p>Challenges under this approach would focus on whether procedures were followed for determining eligibility, not on medical tests or examinations, and certainly not on the \u201cessence\u201d of femininity based on criteria of physical appearance or biological markers.</p> <p>Becoming an elite athlete is a monumental achievement, requiring years of commitment and effort. It also requires some luck in having the physical capabilities necessary to achieve success at the highest levels of competition. Many exceptional athletes have exceptional physical characteristics. Some athletes have appearances that may challenge or be at odds with conventional gender norms. Sporting organizations should embrace this diversity, rather than trying to normalize it.</p> <p>The policy recommended here has three distinct advantages over other proposals that have been advanced. </p> <p>First, this policy is consistent with the state of scientific understandings of biological sex and gender. Any effort to implement a biological test to distinguish men from women is bound to fail in the sense of producing false positives and false negatives. Such failures have been shown repeatedly to violate human dignity. A policy consistent with scientific understandings and evidence would eschew any such test. </p> <p>Second, it places the onus of responsibility for determining gender on the athlete rather than on an international sports organization. For those concerned about fraud: If parents want to raise their boy as a girl for several decades in hope of producing an elite female athlete, then we can address such deviousness when it occurs. Until it does, it should not be a significant concern.</p> <p>Third, despite recognizing that gender is a social construction, a procedural approach acknowledges and reinforces the fact that gender is very real in terms of its social functions. Considerations of gender have changed over time and will continue to change in the future. As society changes, how individuals see themselves will also change. The policy recommended here rejects the idea of the \u201cvery essence\u201d of men and women and is capable of evolving as social norms change. How those norms change involves complex sociological, cultural, and political factors. Sports officials should not be in the business of trying to supersede these factors, much less codify them via regulation. </p> <p>Under the approach recommended here, what would the response be when a woman with bulging muscles or a deep voice wins an athletic competition? It would be to give her a medal and our applause and to be thankful that, after more than half a century, sport has finally been able to leave sex testing behind.</p>",

By the end of August at least three families will have spent a full year in custody.</p> <p>\u201cOn many occasions our children have thought about suicide because of the confinement and desperation that is caused by being here,\u201d read a letter 22 mothers sent last week to Department of Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson.</p> <p>The protest comes after Johnson recently defended the Obama administration\u2019s controversial family detention practices by telling reporters it \u201cis ensuring the average length of stay at these facilities is 20 days or less\u201d.</p> <p>Twenty days is the maximum time suggested in a federal order that limits how long children can be detained by immigration authorities to three to five days, except \u201cin the event of an emergency influx\u201d.</p> <p>In their letter to Johnson, the mothers at Berks accuse the government of \u201cmaking arguments that are false\u201d and cite the federal order, saying \u201cour children are entitled to freedom according to the case of Flores, and still they are here with us\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/27/pennsylvania-immigration-center-detainees-child-illness\">The children held at Berks</a> range from age two to 16 years old.</p> <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not comment on why the detainees have not been released within 20 days, saying that due to privacy laws it is prohibited from discussing specific cases.</p> <p>Advocates supporting the hunger strike say 26 mothers were participating. ICE says about four continue to refuse to eat. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Many of those participating in the protest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/12/immigration-detention-centers-children\">fled gang violence</a> in Honduras and El Salvador and believe they will be killed if sent home. One woman escaped with her seven-year-old son after receiving repeated death threats because her partner, and son\u2019s father, cooperated with local police in reporting their activities. </p> <p>Those who have largely exhausted their legal options for remaining in the country are often transferred to Berks from two family detention centers in Texas and soon processed for removal. But last year, 28 families held there won a stay of removal after the American Civil Liberties Union argued they have a right for a federal judge to review their asylum hearings. In the meantime, they have been detained much longer than the standard of 20 days ICE says it is aiming for.</p> <p>\u201cICE thinks of them as an aberration because they are fighting their cases,\u201d said attorney Bridget Cambria, whose clients at Berks were denied asylum after fleeing violence and persecution in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.</p> <p>She says their denial of their asylum claim followed a cursory interview by a border official. Officials perform interviews with newly arriving migrants to determine whether they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning to their home country that would warrant consideration for asylum. But having just arrived in the country disoriented and traumatized, Cambria said they were not well positioned to accurately express their fear of returning to their countries, and that this was later used against them in an asylum hearing.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have a child subjected to abuse, or a mother who is a victim of violence, sometimes this is not something they can talk about with a person the day after they cross the border,\u201d Cambria argued. \u201cWe often sit with them for hours at a time and you would be amazed at what starts to come out.\u201d</p> <p>The ACLU case is now pending in federal court and may end up before the supreme court in a process that could take another year. As it winds its way through the system, lawyers argue their clients should be released from Berks.</p> <p>\u201cIt is becoming increasingly hard to conclude that there is not some punitive element to keeping these women in detention simply because they exercised their right to bring a constitutional test case,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project.</p> <p>Psychologists and pediatricians who visited Berks for a report produced by Human Rights First say the long-term confinement led to \u201csymptoms of depression, behavioral regression and anxiety\u201d in children they observed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we saw among the adults were signs of fear and of unknowing what would happen to them next,\u201d said Dr Alan Shapiro, who visited Berks for the report. \u201cThese feelings of helplessness and hopelessness hurt their ability to mitigate the stress on their children.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, ICE said Berks \u201cis staffed with medical and mental health care providers who monitor, diagnose and treat residents\u201d and \u201calso uses outside, private medical/mental health care service providers as needed\u201d.</p> <p>But Shapiro has suggested a follow-up visit since the hunger strike was launched, and says the American Academy of Pediatrics \u201cis very concerned about the health and welfare of children and families in immigration detention\u201d.</p> <p>In the last week officials released two families from Berks who are not part of the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit. One had been held there with her three-year-old son since November.</p> <p>\u201cThey were in the exact same legal position as the mothers they won\u2019t release,\u201d said her lawyer Carol Anne Donohoe, who has other clients still inside. \u201cIt shows their detention is arbitrary, not mandatory.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My first morning at the Labour party conference of 1980 had been as dire as my Marxist brain imagined. Then, after lunch, <a href=\"http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0017200001010\">Tony Benn stood up</a>. He promised to abolish the House of Lords, enact an industry bill \u201cwithin days\u201d of coming to power to take ownership of key private industries \u2013 and to return all powers ceded to Brussels. Even from high up in the balcony of the Blackpool Winter Gardens, I could see Benn\u2019s eyes were on fire.</p> <p>Three years later, Labour bombed in the 1983 general election. Its manifesto, though only a pale reflection of Benn\u2019s leftwing programme, was dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/labour.margaretthatcher\">\u201cthe longest suicide note in history\u201d</a>. Today, with a mass influx of left-leaning members and a slump in the polls, parallels with the early 1980s are being drawn. They are almost all false.</p> <p>First, because we are at the other end of the neoliberal era, and as an economic model it is broken. Labour lost in 1979, and saw its membership almost halve because it had clung to a failing system \u2013 Keynesian economics \u2013 long after it ceased to work. All the momentum, in ideas, in broader society and among the elite, was towards the free-market, authoritarian project we now call Thatcherism. In that situation, to make traditional-left Keynesianism work, as Benn suggested, would have meant an all-out clash with both the market and the state. Labour\u2019s poll ratings \u2013 which collapsed in Foot\u2019s first year \u2013 were a signal that its electoral base was not up for that.</p> <p>By contrast, today neoliberal capitalism is busted, discredited and on life support. The whey-faced remnants of \u201cold Toryism\u201d may have crowded around the cabinet table, but their free-market philosophy has come apart. The fact that people are flooding into a left-led Labour party, not out of it, is evidence of a search for answers among broad sections of the population.</p> <p>The next most obvious difference is the absence of what we used to call the \u201cindustrial struggle\u201d. It has been invigorating to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/11/deliveroo-couriers-demonstrate-against-new-contract\">Deliveroo drivers on wildcat strike</a>, together with migrant hotel cleaners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">train guards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/80-percent-junior-doctors-took-part-in-all-out-strike\">junior doctors</a> all in a single summer. But the leftism we carried with us into the Winter Gardens in 1980 had its origins in the syndicalism of ordinary workers in the 1970s. To the shop stewards I met in the years between Benn\u2019s 1980 speech and the miners\u2019 strike, Labour politics were a sideshow.</p> <p>The unions had achieved control of many workplaces and \u2013 it seemed \u2013 could go on calling the shots. In the year Benn made his electrifying speech, the steelworkers\u2019 union had just won a double-digit pay rise in an all-out strike. To the wider left, of shop stewards, feminists, black community activists, a group such as Militant \u2013 which had moulded its entire practice, and even its clothing to conform with the dreariness of internal Labour life \u2013 seemed irrelevant. Its claimed membership of 2,300 in 1981 \u2013 out of 348,000 - sounds about right.</p> <p>Today, work is much less central to the left project, and for a variety of reasons. It is precarious, hard to organise. Also, the things the left wants to achieve have become more social, less industrial. There is, on the left, an implicit understanding of political philosopher Toni Negri\u2019s claim: that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workerism\">the \u201cfactory\u201d is now the whole of society,</a> and the subject of change is everybody \u2013 especially the networked youth.</p> <p>I do not recall many of the miners and engineers who fought for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981 being existentially devastated when he narrowly lost. They knew this was just a warm-up for the decisive battle, which would happen in barricaded pit villages four years later. This generation, by contrast, understands that the most revolutionary thing you can do to neoliberalism is to put a party in government that dismantles it.</p> <p>And that, in turn, reflects another big difference: the rule of law is stronger now. Everybody involved in the Bennite movement sensed that Britain\u2019s legal institutions were so weak, its police, security services and judiciary so politicised, its constitution so malleable, that the scenario in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/07/past.comment\">Chris Mullin\u2019s novel A Very British Coup</a> was not paranoia. Today, though the secret state is large, it is under much stronger legislative control. Should a leftwing Labour party come to power \u2013 either on its own or in coalition with left nationalists \u2013 it is likely to be able to govern relatively free of politicised sabotage from the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/15/europe-owen-smith-beats-jeremy-corbyn-labour\">When it comes to Europe, Owen Smith beats Jeremy Corbyn hands down | Neil Kinnock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels, though. As with the SDP, there is a prospect that a few entitled Labour MPs will split, and that the media will get behind the narrative that they are the \u201ctrue\u201d Labour party. Disunity has already damaged Labour in the polls, just as it did with Michael Foot.</p> <p>But the differences are what should make these, for the British left, days of hope.</p> <p>Michael Foot was a dire leader not because he was too old or too leftwing (or wore a duffel coat), but because he was a compromise candidate, constantly torn between the interests of the unions \u2013 who were largely on the right \u2013 and the membership, which had moved left. His 1983 manifesto was actually well crafted, but they were the right ideas at the wrong time.</p> <p>Whatever you think of Corbyn (I support him and will campaign to keep him as leader), today is the right time for the idea that neoliberalism is over; that the state should shape, control and sometimes suppress the market; that austerity is self-defeating; that more expeditionary warfare cannot put right the chaos and injustice Blair and Bush injected into the Middle East.</p> <p>Once we had revived our local Labour ward in Sheffield in 1980, its monthly attendance rose from the 12 pensioners and councillors that had kept it alive under Callaghan to maybe 30, one-third of whom were Trotskyists or sympathisers of the Communist party. And that was it. We achieved stuff \u2013 above all in supporting Sheffield city council when it resisted cuts. But ultimately the social forces that were driving Thatcherism were stronger. Thatcherism was the main event.</p> <p>The main event of 2016 \u2013 in England and Wales at least \u2013 is that 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. Sure, some of the same people are still around, including me, but it feels like a much bigger moment than the Benn insurgency. Anybody who thinks it is being driven, or \u201ctwisted\u201d, by re-enactment groups from 20th-century Marxism is going to the wrong meetings.</p>",

  "<p>A month has passed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-coup-attempt\">the failed military coup in Turkey</a>. The nightly demonstrations against the attempted coup culminated in pro-government rally in Istanbul a week last Sunday, where hundreds of thousands of flag-waving supporters were addressed by the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. </p> <p>Following the coup, the government launched a sweeping crackdown with Erdo\u011fan accusing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-who-is-the-man-blamed-by-turkeys-president-for-coup-attempt\">Fethullah G\u00fclen, the US-based cleric,</a> of masterminding it. Nearly 18,000 people have been detained or arrested across Turkey, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/turkey-issues-arrest-warrants-42-journalists-attempted-coup\">42 arrest warrants for journalists</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/turkey-sacks-15000-education-workers-in-purge\">sacking of 15,000 education workers</a>.<br></p> <p>Fethullah G\u00fclen, blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for the failed coup in Turkey, has said the uprising by members of the country\u2019s military<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan\"> could have been \u201cstaged\u201d by the government</a>.</p> <p>We heard from our readers across the country on the mood in the country one month after the abortive coup.</p> <h2>\u2018My fear is that this turns into blood-shed\u2019</h2> <p>We are living a post-coup era. The number of purges, arrests and restrictions are probably unseen. My fear is that this turns into blood-shed! God forbid. Which Erdo\u011fan openly said \u201cpeople want it, and I want it.\u201d<br></p> <p>I\u2019m from a secular Turkish family, orginating in Istanbul. I feared G\u00fclen people when I was at high school probably because of a video clip where I saw someone shaking hands with a rabbi and a pastor. Now I began to believe, he is a good believer. Maybe the best one I know living today.</p> <p>My dad put two Turkish flags on my car so I am less likely to be get harassed like his friend who was beaten up by democracy guards for not joining their car convoy by honking. Where is the right to choose? Where is democracy?</p> <p>I have not seen a single news agency that does not repeat what government says about the coup. If in you are in Turkey and a Turkish citizen, you have to blame G\u00fclen movement for everything. Just yesterday, Melih G\u00f6k\u00e7ek the mayor of Ankara, said \u201cFetullah Terrorist Organisation \u2013 referred to widely as FETO \u2013 is planning an earthquake on 14 August.\u201d </p> <p>If you have a public disagreement the AKP police unquestionably arrest you. There are countless examples over the twitter, including an example recently where a blind boy was arrested.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan is a man of vengeance. Looking back at his history, he always fought against someone and made himself essential to his supporters for their survival. It\u2019s very clear that his supporters fear an artificial enemy in Turkey; which makes them fanatically connected to Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p><strong>Mustafa, Istanbul </strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s a witch hunt\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The mood is terrible in my community. The coup attempt created devastating effects for me and my family. After Erdo\u011fan accused Fethullah G\u00fclen movement as the mastermind of the coup attempt with no evidence, we suffered greatly since my father was leading a G\u00fclen institution. </p> <p>Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people are in similar situation. I was lucky enough to leave Turkey since I have a US visa. My brother was a government official and he got suspended with no reason. He\u2019s literally waiting to be imprisoned with his bag prepared, even though he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. My sister\u2019s passport has been revoked with no reason. My uncle is in prison and we can\u2019t track him. No information is provided on his whereabouts. And no lawyer wants to defend him since they\u2019re afraid to defend someone who is a brother-in-law of a person who works for a G\u00fclen institution. </p> <p>We had nothing to do with the coup and we condemn it. But we are being oppressed with no evidence whatsoever. This is how people who have some connection to G\u00fclenist network suffers in Turkey right now. It\u2019s a witch hunt. </p> <p><strong>Mulat, currently living in New York</strong></p> <h2>Europeans have a lack of sympathy for the Turkish people</h2> <p>Turkish people resisted and blocked the attempted coup at a risk of losing their lives. This is the fact which should be applauded and praised by the West, Europe in particular, who are consistently claiming democracy as a European value.</p> <p>Yet, there hasn\u2019t been one high-level visit from Europe. Even worse, instead of strongly condemning the coup attempt, and expressing condolences for those who lost their lives, some chose to condemn the purge that occurred after that.</p> <p>This behaviour proves the Europeans have a lack of sympathy for the Turkish people. Turkish people are angry which is, I believe, one hundred percent right. <br>Although there are stories of unjust dismissals, I see these as minor given the depth of the investigation, they can be tolerated.</p> <p><strong>Emre, Ankara</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"089612baf7db1ef0deb3a8e91b707784cfc034c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089612baf7db1ef0deb3a8e91b707784cfc034c6/0_0_1954_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Government poster on a train in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Government poster on a train in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anonymous/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The despair of the pre-coup times is replaced with tentative hopes\u2019</h2> <p>There was an air of alarm among the Turkish opposition during the immediate aftermath of the coup, but it waned to some extent as the government started to carry out a normalisation process with the opposition. It is sad that this process excludes the pro-Kurdish HDP, which is a sign that the government will not return to the peace process and the Turkey-PKK conflict will continue. <br></p> <p>However, in general, the despair of the pre-coup times is replaced with tentative hopes, as Erdo\u011fan seems less aggressive and has been making concessions to some of the opposition. It is also perceived as a positive development that the G\u00fclenist infiltrationist network in the state is getting dismantled, which has been seen as a threat by most of the society, given that diverse socio-political groups, from secularist soldiers to Kurdish activists, have been the target of operations by G\u00fclenist policemen, prosecutors and media in the past decade. </p> <p> The reports of torture are horrible and prison conditions are worsening in general due to State of Emergency measures. The possibility that the death penalty might be re-instantiated is worrying. The purges should be carried out more carefully, making a clear distinction between members of the G\u00fclenist network and people who are mere sympathizers of G\u00fclen. <br></p> <p><strong>Anonymous, Ankara</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I am happy normality has returned so quickly\u2019<br></h2> <p>There is some tension because of the ongoing arrests but generally people are bored of the whole subject and want to get on with their lives and enjoy the summer.</p> <p>I am happy that normality returned so quickly. I am not happy that Erdo\u011fan has increased his power base. I am saddened that those who were murdered by the lynch mobs have not been permitted proper funerals and burial, I feel for their families. I fear the reintroduction of the death penalty.</p> <p>I am surprised that everyone seems to have accepted that G\u00fclen was the organiser of the coup, even those who are poles apart from Erdo\u011fan and the AKP seem to hate and fear G\u00fclen even more. I cannot decide if this is mass brainwashing or if there is some clear evidence that has passed me by.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6086d4645805a4dc9d37da8a30b4663986f229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6086d4645805a4dc9d37da8a30b4663986f229/0_0_3870_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the nightly rallies in solidarity with the Turkish government, Bal\u0131kesir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the nightly rallies in solidarity with the Turkish government, Bal\u0131kesir.<strong><br></strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deniz/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The rallies every night to celebrate the overthrow of the coup were generally festive occasions involving all types and ages of people but they prevented any other sort of gathering in what is usually a very busy public space.

It saw the city demarcate some 60 blocks of Manhattan\u2019s oldest neighbourhood as part of an urban geographical experiment meant to alter the often-fractious dynamic between motorists and pedestrians that is the unwritten law of the concrete jungle. </p> <p>Police officers stood with signs announcing <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/sharedstreets/shared-streets.shtml\">Shared Streets</a> at various checkpoints along the border of the Financial District, east to west from Broadway to Water Street, and north to south from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Battery.</p> <p>Within that area, pedestrians were encouraged to treat the roads like pavements, and cars were told to keep their speeds at 5mph or below.

In front of small crowd of assembled onlookers in front of the historic Fraunces Tavern and accompanied by a fife-and-drum quartet decked out in full colonial regalia, city officials ushered in the event with a brief set of remarks.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time that we think something of this scale and size certainly has been done in New York or any other American city,\u201d said New York City Department of Transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, announcing the event.</p> <p>\u201cOur streets are for everyone,\u201d said public advocate Letitia James. \u201cAnd before there were cars we were all cyclists and pedestrians, commuters and explorers, in this infinitely marvellous city. And today we try to return to that period.\u201d</p> <p>Hamburg, Helsinki, Madrid and Oslo have also recently pushed for sizeable car-free zones in their city centres. </p> <p>Advocates argue that restricting car usage in cities is not only important in the broader fight to curb carbon emissions and greenhouses gases, but as an important mechanism to take the load off overstretched public transport systems.</p> <p>New York is particularly at risk on that front, with its subway systems adversely impacted by record usage rates, desperately needed infrastructure updates, and the looming close of the L Train from Brooklyn to Manhattan, which will impact the commutes of thousands of New Yorkers. </p> <p>Judging by the results of Saturday\u2019s event, it\u2019s an idea that is likely to find many supporters, but whose specific scheme is likely to be an evolving process of in terms of how the city tries embrace car-free solutions. </p> <p>For those expecting a replay of Times Square, which has been blocked off for cars since 2009, there was little similarity to that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/new-york-taskforce-topless-times-square-performers\">bastion of tourist-inundated cacophony</a>, which has been praised by advocates for its embrace of pedestrianism, but criticised by others, including mayor Bill de Blasio, for its carnival atmosphere. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acb0e9987a32854aa3a8296ee235d3e522bee34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb0e9987a32854aa3a8296ee235d3e522bee34d/0_34_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Times Square has been blocked to cars since 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Times Square has been blocked to cars since 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siegfried Layda/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For one, there were fewer people at Shared Streets, a fact the might be partially explained by the weather, as the heat index exceeded 100 degrees.</p> <p>But the streets were far from empty.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really cool to have time where you can just be on a bike and not worry about cars,\u201d said Eve Wool, a city resident who works for a mental health initiative. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just for the whole idea that a lot of folks who bike in New York City I feel like are always so cramped.\u201d</p> <p>But she also said the she didn\u2019t know if the new initiative would be totally utilised. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people know about Shared Streets, it\u2019s newer so it\u2019s still gaining popularity,\u201d she added, after saying she was more aware of the related Citi Summer Streets initiative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml\">Citi Summer Streets</a>, which is happening on three consecutive Saturdays in August, is the hugely popular event that the city first began nine years ago.

  "<p>There are probably fewer Trotskyists in Britain today than at any time since an ice pick was plunged into the skull of Leon Trotsky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1940-1949/Story/0,,127350,00.html\">almost exactly 76 years ago</a>. There were once Trotskyist groups in Britain with thousands of members: the Workers\u2019 Revolutionary party (defunct), the Socialist Workers\u2019 party (more irrelevant than ever) and Militant (deceased, with a noisy but shrivelled successor party). The political significance of British Trotskyism is minimal. Its influence is mostly confined to blocking entrances to political events with aggressive paper-sellers, and asking questions at political meetings which are really long-winded pre-prepared statements that achieve little other than driving other attendees to think \u201coh god, what am I doing with my life?\u201d</p> <p>If you want to understand the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon in good faith, there is little value in the discussion of entryism that has been taking place over the last week. Now, to be absolutely clear, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, did not say that the hundreds of thousands of new members who have transformed Labour into Europe\u2019s biggest progressive party were Trotskyists. He said a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/763386815348871168\">\u201csmall number of people\u201d </a>were, and suggested there were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">\u201csome old hands twisting young arms\u201d</a>. My experience of young Labour members is that they have a huge capacity to think for themselves and develop their own politics. That aside, Watson highlighting efforts by the Alliance for Workers\u2019 Liberty (AWL) to get involved in the Labour party will undoubtedly fuel a media narrative that Labour is falling under the spell of revolutionary zealots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/15/judges-and-infiltrators-in-labours-civil-war\">Judges and infiltrators in Labour\u2019s civil war | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even under Tony Blair\u2019s leadership, there were Trotskyist groups involved in the Labour party, ranging from the AWL to Socialist Action. Undoubtedly some of them see the Corbyn surge as a fantastic recruitment opportunity, or the next stage in fomenting the kind of revolution that has never taken place in a single western country. Some Trotsykists who, a year and a half ago, were berating me for being a rightwing sellout for suggesting Labour was the left\u2019s best bet are now berating me for being a rightwing sellout for showing insufficient loyalty to the Labour leadership. But in the grand scheme of things, they are just irrelevant. Most of Labour\u2019s membership influx would probably struggle to even define Trotskyism. They believe in things like public ownership of rail, higher taxes on the rich, improved workers\u2019 rights and investment rather than cuts. Trotsky\u2019s transitional demands it ain\u2019t. In the 1970s such beliefs would have been regarded as pretty timid social democracy. There are too few Trotskyist activists to have any decisive impact on a party as big as Labour now is.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Labour party millionaire donor Michael Foster\u2019s description of Corbyn supporters in the Mail on Sunday <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3739516/Why-despise-Jeremy-Corbyn-Nazi-stormtroopers-Jewish-Labour-donor-MICHAEL-FOSTER.html\">this weekend as \u201cNazi stormtroopers\u201d</a>. As the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/J_VoiceUK/status/764812048148602880\">Jewish Voice puts it</a>, such a suggestion is \u201cdangerous, offensive and cynically exploits fear\u201d. Comparing politically enthused democratic socialists to murderous paramilitaries employed by a genocidal totalitarian regime that slaughtered leftists: well, frankly, it\u2019s diabolical.</p> <p>A large chunk of the Labour party membership believe that they are at war with the party\u2019s old order. They are furious. The more they feel insulted and belittled, the stronger their support for Corbyn. And with these distractions, the party is being denied a debate on the issues. The Corbyn campaign\u2019s floating of a cradle-to-grave national education service is a good example. How can Labour win over older Britons who have turned away from the party in great numbers? What does the party have to say to the growing ranks of the self-employed? How will it tackle the triple whammy of a lack of social housing, an unregulated private rented sector and collapsing home ownership? And, yes, how can a Labour leadership with such disastrous poll ratings turn them around and prevent the party being wiped out at a possible snap election?</p> <p>Labour is in the midst of a civil war that threatens its future existence. All sides have a responsibility to prevent the party from disappearing. And a start would be to calm down the rhetoric and stick to the issues. Otherwise the party will become a freakshow existing for the entertainment of the Conservative party.</p>",
  "<p>While most people accept the reality of human-caused global warming, we tend not to view it as an urgent issue or high priority.

Over the coming decades, we\u2019d see about another 0.5\u00b0C warming, largely due to what\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://ourchangingclimate.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/climate-inertia/\">\u201cthermal inertia\u201d of the oceans</a> (think of the long amount of time it takes to boil a kettle of water). The Earth\u2019s surface <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/hansen-and-sato-2012-climate-sensitivity.html\">would keep warming about another 1.5\u00b0C over the ensuing centuries</a> as ice continued to melt, decreasing the planet\u2019s reflectivity.</p> <p>To put this in context, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the international community agreed</a> in last year\u2019s Paris climate accords that we should limit climate change risks by keeping global warming below 2\u00b0C, and preferably closer to 1.5\u00b0C. Yet from the carbon pollution we\u2019ve already put into the atmosphere, we\u2019re committed to 1.5\u20133\u00b0C warming over the coming decades and centuries, and we continue to pump out over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year.</p> <h2><strong>The importance of reaching zero or negative emissions</strong></h2> <p>We can solve this problem if, rather than holding the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide steady, it falls over time. As discussed in the above video, Earth naturally absorbs more carbon than it releases, so if we reduce human emissions to zero, the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide will slowly decline. Humans can also help the process by finding ways to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">pull carbon out of the atmosphere and sequester it</a>. </p> <p>Scientists are researching various technologies to accomplish this, but we\u2019ve already put over 500 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Pulling a significant amount of that carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it safely will be a tremendous challenge, and we won\u2019t be able to reduce the amount in the atmosphere until we first get our emissions close to zero.</p> <p>There are an infinite number of potential carbon emissions pathways, but the 2014 IPCC report considered four possible paths that they called RCPs. In one of these (called RCP 2.6 or RCP3-PD), we take immediate, aggressive, global action to cut carbon pollution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels peak at 443 ppm in 2050, and by 2100 they\u2019ve fallen back down to today\u2019s level of 400 ppm. In two others (RCPs 4.5 and 6.0) we act more slowly, and atmospheric levels don\u2019t peak until the year 2150, then they remain steady, and in the last (RCP8.5) carbon dioxide levels keep rising until 2250.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dc4f6dcf39736cdc4a8b60ad863f34fba3ec131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dc4f6dcf39736cdc4a8b60ad863f34fba3ec131/0_0_677_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the four IPCC RCP scenarios.\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the four IPCC RCP scenarios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Dana Nuccitelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the figure below shows, in the first scenario, global warming peaks at 2\u00b0C and then temperatures start to fall toward the 1.5\u00b0C level, meeting our Paris climate targets.

Every year, 60 million more units are being sold there, eight times as many as are sold annually in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>As large developing countries such as India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil grow richer, staying cool may come to be seen as a necessity and not a luxury, leading to severe energy shortages and major environmental stress, says Davis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a62a621df37506eacba79c949db77e9899d4a14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a62a621df37506eacba79c949db77e9899d4a14b/0_181_3684_2210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People relax in the sunshine in St James\u2019s park in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People relax in the sunshine in St James\u2019s park in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAir conditioning is wonderful. As people are coming out of poverty, they buy a TV, then a fridge, then a car and air conditioning. There are a lot of hot places where people are getting richer. As average temperatures increase, the reach of air conditioning will be extended, even to the relatively cool areas of the world where saturation is currently low,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But Davis, who expects nearly all households in warm countries to have air conditioning within 20 to 30 years, warns that the extra energy needed will be dramatic and could have huge consequences for global warming. \u201cWe are talking about hundreds of new power stations having to be built in China alone over the next 20 or 30 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His research is backed by the US government\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where researchers have calculated that 700 million air-conditioning units are likely to be installed worldwide by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050. Sales in Indonesia, Brazil and India have been growing 15% a year, it says.</p> <p>Technologists say it\u2019s not just warm countries switching from fans to air conditioning. \u201cOffices, businesses, hospitals, shops and homes in Britain are all using air conditioning as buildings fill with computers, televisions and other heat-generating machines,\u201d says a spokeswoman for the Institute of Refrigeration. In addition, she says, better insulation in new buildings traps heat and it is too noisy in cities to have windows open: \u201cThe way we live now increases the need for air conditioning.\u201d</p> <p>Cooling systems may already account for about 10% of total electricity consumption in the UK , says the UK Building Research Establishment. It estimates that 65% of UK office space and 30% of UK retail space was air conditioned in 2012.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s climate change body, the IPCC, has projected that global air-conditioning energy demand will grow 33-fold from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to more than 10,000TWh in 2100, with most of the growth coming in developing economies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are talking about hundreds of new power stations having to be built in China alone over the next 20 or 30 years</p> <footer> <cite>Lucas Davis, energy economist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c10,000TWh is roughly half the total electricity generated worldwide in 2010,\u201d says Martin Freer, director of Birmingham university\u2019s Energy Institute. In a recent report, which he co-authored, Freer says: \u201cWorldwide energy demand for space cooling will overtake space heating by 2060, and outstrip it by 60% at the end of the century, as cooling demand in the developing countries of the global south grows faster than heating demand in the developed northern economies.\u201d</p> <p>But in a world already warming because of fossil fuel emissions from oil, gas and coal, demand for air conditioning and refrigeration is seen as one of the greatest accelerants of climate change.</p> <p>\u201cIf nothing is done, within 15 years cooling will require an additional 139 GW \u2013 more than the generating capacity of Canada \u2013 and raise greenhouse gas emissions by over 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, three times the current energy emissions of Britain,\u201d says Freer.</p> <p>Concern is also mounting over a class of chemicals widely used in refrigerants and air-conditioning units. Hydrofluorocarbons, which have largely replaced CFCs, which were found to damage the ozone layer, are potent greenhouse gases. Although they are far less significant today than CO2 for global warming, if the numbers of refrigeration and air-conditioning units explode as expected, they could add to the problem.</p> <p>\u201cThe data is poor, but one estimate suggests that refrigeration and air conditioning cause 10% of global CO2 emissions \u2013 three times more than is attributed to aviation and shipping combined, through energy consumption and leaks of HFC refrigerants that are themselves highly potent greenhouse gases,\u201d says Freer.</p> <p>\u201cAs climate change increases outdoor temperatures, air conditioning will more often be used to maintain comfortable indoor conditions. Climate change is expected to stimulate installation of air conditioning in some buildings that would otherwise not need air conditioning.\u201d</p> <p>Policymakers from across the world met recently in Vienna to agree to phase out HFCs but some countries are nervous about the extra cost of changing to alternative refrigerants. Researchers in India have estimated it could cost the country tens of billions of dollars.</p>",

The Athlete challenged the decision rendered by the IAAF Doping Review Board (IAAF DRB) on 12 August 2016, which revoked its previous decision declaring her exceptionally eligible to compete in international competitions, including the athletics competition at the Olympic Games 2016.</p> <p>Such decision, declaring her ineligible to compete, was based on new factual elements concerning the Athlete presented by Prof. Richard McLaren in addition to his report delivered on 18 July 2016.</p> <p>On that basis, the IAAF DRB determined that the Athlete was directly affected and tainted by State-organized doping scheme described in the McLaren Report. Furthermore, the IAAF DRB noted that the results management in respect of certain of the Athlete\u2019s samples has been subject to tampering and manipulation during the \u201crelevant period\u201d (i.e. starting on 1 January 2014).</p> <p>The CAS Panel in charge of this matter heard the parties and their representatives today between 11am and 3pm. At 1:00am today, the parties were informed that the application was upheld and that the Athlete remained eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio. The CAS Panel applied the IAAF Competition Rules to conclude that the previous decision of the IAAF DRB, that the Athlete complied with the relevant criteria because of her permanent residence outside Russia, still applied despite the additional information provided by Prof. McLaren. Relevantly, the Athlete established that she was subject to fully compliant drug-testing in- and out-of-competition outside of Russia for the \u201crelevant period\u201d.</p> <p>The full award with the grounds will be published on the CAS website as soon as it will be available.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06bc7c7874458795e92ffab23d1d52a37d141090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06bc7c7874458795e92ffab23d1d52a37d141090/0_131_3585_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"15th IAAF World Athletics Championships Beijing 2015 - Day SevenBEIJING, CHINA - AUGUST 28: Darya Klishina of Russia competes in the Women\u2019s Long Jump final during day seven of the 15th IAAF World Athletics Championships Beijing 2015 at Beijing National Stadium on August 28, 2015 in Beijing, China.

Making the final here aged 23 is a bonus for the new British record holder, who went sub-Holmes just a month ago. She will run without pressure in the final. It\u2019s not impossible you know. And while we\u2019re on just a word on Caterine Ibraguen in the triple jump. What an athlete! The stadium on that side is full of Colombian fans, flags draped over the rails, and she\u2019s putting on a real show. Ibarguen is the favourite and now the leader having just jumped 15.18. above all she is just a genuinely compelling spectacle, all bounding muscle and grace, plus a real performer too. In slow mo you can see her grinning even as she flies through the air. If she wins this (part of) the roof (by the Colombians) will come off.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>[This post was edited to change Columbia to Colombia because it\u2019s Colombia.]</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T02:46:24.810Z\">at 3.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b1154ee4b062ce4d22363d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-15T01:05:35.371Z\">2.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Men\u2019s Water Polo</strong>: Hungary ended up beating Brazil by the final score of 10-6.

This is of course good news for the assembled media, who can now complain instead about the terrible crush, too many people coming in, not enough empty seats etc. It\u2019s a muggy, hot night in the old Nilton Santos. The people in blue blazers are mithering about fiddling with the fixings, photographers are bustling about, the stage being set. The idea of a lightning quick track in Rio De Janeiro seems something of a stretch given the rest of these Games, which have involved for most on the periphery an endless stream of delays and interminable journeys. Who knows, perhaps Bolt will win in 24 seconds tonight having got lost three times long the way. Either way this really is the ultimate test of how well Brazil has managed to stage and sell and fluff the Olympics.

Apparently there are one or two things happening in Rio today, as you\u2019ll have gleaned. Most notably, perhaps, Usain Bolt\u2019s bid for a triple-treble of Olympic golds, which starts in earnest with the men\u2019s 100m sprint semi-finals and \u2013 should he make it (it couldn\u2019t happen, could it?) \u2013 final. Still, as a grey dawn breaks over London, that seems a very long way off right now. And you know what? It is. It\u2019s just coming up to 4am in Rio, and Usain will no doubt be tucked up in bed dreaming of Justin Gatlin and rear-view mirrors. With the Games\u2019 blue riband event not taking place until late evening, it falls to the golfers to get us underway. Erstwhile Ryder Cup partners Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, respectively placed in the gold and silver medal positions heading into the final round, tee off in just over three hours. They do like their early starts, the golfing fraternity. I\u2019m Les Roopanarine, by the way, and I\u2019ll be guiding you through the day nine build-up until lunchtime UK time. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T06:57:54.720Z\">at 7.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57aecca3e4b0178756b5c3dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/russell-jackson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-14T05:23:54.683Z\">6.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Day nine briefing</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome back for day nine at Rio, where we\u2019ve witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/he-gets-knocked-down-but-mo-farah-gets-back-up-to-win-10000m-gold\"><strong>Mo Farah</strong> quite literally picking himself up off the ground</a> to take back-to-back golds with a rousing win in the men\u2019s 10,000m final, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-olympic-career-swimming-gold\"><strong>Michael Phelps</strong> signed off on his Olympic career with his 23<sup>rd</sup> gold medal</a> \u2013 and his fifth at these Games \u2013 in the 4x100 medley relay. </p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Day eight quite simply belonged to two phenomenal athletes: Phelps having finished his Olympic career with 23 gold medals in a Rio campaign whose statistical complexity staggers us all anew, while Farah\u2019s brave and brilliant gold medal run to defend his 10,000m title after stumbling onto the track early served as a reminder of how singularly monumental each and every gold medal is at Olympic level.</p> <p> There was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/elaine-thompson-womens-100m-gold-jamaica\">gold for Jamaica\u2019s <strong>Elaine Thompson</strong> in the women\u2019s 100m dash</a>, which thwarted her compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\u2019s attempt at a third successive Olympic crown, though the latter still took home bronze. \u201cThere is a big screen back home in my community in Jamaica,\u201d Thompson said afterwards. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what is happening there right now.\u201d A decent old party, one would suspect.</p> <p> <strong><strong>You should also know:</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/north-korean-weightlifter-says-olympic-gold-will-make-beloved-kim-jong-un-happy\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/rio-olympics-logistics-ioc-gunfire\">Despite gunfire, green pools and logistical chaos, Rio\u2019s efforts have actually been pretty decent so far</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-olympics-2016-bronze\">Ibtihaj Muhammad\u2019s bronze medal is a vital one in this US summer of Trump</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/russian-whistleblower-yuliya-stepanova-hacked-wada\">Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova\u2019s data has been hacked, says Wada</a></li> </ul> <h2> Team GB roundup</h2> <p> It was a day dominated by Farah\u2019s remarkable efforts across at the Olympic stadium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-women-gold-olympic-team-pursuit-rio-2016\">but </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/britain-women-gold-olympic-team-pursuit-rio-2016\">Team GB\u2019s golden run at the velodrome also continued today</a> with <strong>Laura Trott</strong>, <strong>Joanna Rowsell-Shand</strong>, <strong>Katie Archibald </strong>and <strong>Elinor Baker</strong> taking gold in the women\u2019s team pursuit.

Ennis-Hill couldn\u2019t beat Thiam by the 9.47 second margin she needed at the end, missing out by a couple of seconds.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/justin-rose-henrik-stenson-rio-2016-olympics-golf-third-round\">Great Britain also might be looking at a medal in the golf</a>, where <strong>Justin Rose</strong> has moved ahead of Australian <strong>Marcus Fraser</strong> and Swede <strong>Henrik Stenson</strong> for the overall lead with a single round left. The 36-year-old began the day four shots off Fraser\u2019s lead but stormed back to take a one stroke lead by the end of the day. <strong>Andy Murray </strong>will also be playing for gold in the men\u2019s tennis singles when he takes on Argentina\u2019s <strong>Jua</strong><strong>n Martin Del Potro</strong>. The swimming is now done and dusted, but with silver in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britishswimming/status/764649621377388544\">Team GB has had its best Olympics in the pool since 1908</a> with one gold and five silvers.</p> <p> The unhappiest medalist of the day was Team GB\u2019s reigning long jump champion <strong>Greg Rutherford</strong>, who scraped into the final with his last attempt of the heats and was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/greg-rutherford-olympic-long-jump-rio-2016\">beaten into third place by American <strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> and South African <strong>Luvo Manyonga</strong> in a dramatic final.</a> But at least he put the disappointment in perspective: \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard bronze medal to take. If you\u2019d told me 10 years ago I would be gutted with an Olympic bronze, I\u2019d have told you not to be so stupid,\u201d Rutherford said afterwards.</p> <h2> Team USA roundup</h2> <p> What you are reading now is not template text, it\u2019s just that <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> keep winning gold medals.

You might not have heard of Leonidas of Rhodes, who dominated the Games between 164 and 152 BC (I think NBC might be showing his events on a tape delay sometime in the next few days) but we assure you, Phelps is now better than him. His team-mates who took gold in the men\u2019s 4x100 medley relay don\u2019t go too badly either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So many emotions! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash\">#Rio2016</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/N5NYojqWHk\">pic.twitter.com/N5NYojqWHk</a></p>&mdash; TODAY (@TODAYshow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/764655964628852737\">August 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p> Elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/jeff-henderson-usa-long-jump-gold\"><strong>Jeff Henderson</strong> jumped to gold in the that men\u2019s long jump</a> final, though his winning leap of 8.38 metres really does remind you of how insane Mike Powell\u2019s 1991 world record of 8.95 metres really is.

If all four install rigs, it will significantly increase the risk to South Australia not only through the presence of oil rigs, but also in the increase in marine traffic this will cause,\u201d the report notes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bp-reveals-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-sites-are-within-marine-reserve\">BP reveals Great Australian Bight oil drilling sites are within marine reserve</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the licence holders, BP is set to be the first to install an oil rig in 2016, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bp-reveals-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-sites-are-within-marine-reserve\">recently revealed</a> it planned to do so in parts of the Great Australian Bight protected in commonwealth marine parks.</p> <p>In 2010, BP was responsible for the world\u2019s largest oil spill \u2013 the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the Bight.</p> <p>BP hasn\u2019t released modelling of the impacts of an oil spill, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/bp-oil-spill-in-great-australian-bight-would-be-catastrophic-modelling-shows\">independent modelling</a> commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed it would be catastrophic, impacting the entire southern coast of Australia.</p> <p>The department\u2019s report appears to acknowledged the potentially extensive impacts, spreading into Western Australia. \u201cThe intended drilling activities increases both the South Australian and West Australian risk profile with respect to possible spills,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>It notes that arrangements for a response to such a spill are ongoing with BP, which has had its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/bp-application-drill-oil-in-great-australian-bight-rejected-for-second-time\">environmental plans knocked back twice</a> by the regulator. The reasons for that rejection were kept secret, and it is understood BP will be submitting new plans this month.</p> <p>Peter Owen, South Australia Director for the Wilderness Society, said a spill from an oil rig in the Bight could force the shutting of fisheries across the length of the southern coast from Tasmania to Western Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time the South Australian government acknowledged that drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight threatens marine life and fisheries,\u201d said Owen.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves/south-west/gab\">According to the Department of Environment</a>, the area in which BP is going to install its two oil rigs was inscribed in the reserve system for a range of reasons, including being a \u201cglobally important seasonal calving habitat for the threatened southern right whale\u201d and important foraging areas for sea lions, white sharks and sperm whales.</p> <p>The process around the approval of BP\u2019s drilling has been criticised in a Senate inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/assessment-of-bps-bight-oil-drill-plan-secretive-and-weak-senate-told\">for being secretive and weak</a>, with federal government approval devolved to <a href=\"https://www.nopsema.gov.au/\">NOPSEMA</a>, an agency that specifically deals with offshore oil and gas applications.</p> <p>BP maintains that oil and gas exploration can safely coexist with the marine environment. \u201cWe have assessed potential environmental issues from exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight and in turn incorporated this into our planning,\u201d a spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/bp-reveals-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-sites-are-within-marine-reserve\">told Guardian Australia earlier this month</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Thailand has said a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/one-dead-and-20-injured-in-two-bomb-blasts-in-hua-hin-thailand\">series of explosive and arson attacks</a> that killed four people and injured dozens in popular tourist spots across several provinces last week were orchestrated by one person who ran a network of bombers.</p> <p>More attacks appeared to have been planned and authorities found two incendiary devices in Hua Hin on Sunday, the interior ministry said.</p> <p>\u201cThe acts were carried out by a group in many locations simultaneously, following orders from one individual,\u201d Pongsapat Pongcharoen, a deputy national police chief, told reporters on Sunday. He did not provide further details.</p> <p>One suspect is in custody for strikes that appeared to target Thailand\u2019s vital tourism industry, with blasts on Thursday and Friday in the top seaside resort areas Hua Hin and Phuket.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/one-dead-and-20-injured-in-two-bomb-blasts-in-hua-hin-thailand\">Tourist towns of Phuket and Hua Hin in Thailand hit by fatal explosions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but analysts point to political enemies of the ruling junta or members of an ongoing insurgency in the Malay-Muslim-majority south.</p> <p>The strikes, a series of small improvised bombs that also left 10 Europeans wounded, came less than a week after the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in 2014 coup, won a country-wide referendum on a constitution that entrenches their power in any future government. </p> <p>The results antagonised the junta\u2019s political foes across the country.</p> <p>Hua Hin, where miles of high-rise hotels line the Gulf of Thailand coast, was the scene of the worst wave of bombs. Explosives hidden in plant pots detonated late on Thursday in the high-density bar district and again on Friday morning by the central clock tower.</p> <p>Another fire bomb was also found on the island of Phuket on Sunday, police said, and two devices in Phang Nga. Explosives had detonated in both those areas on Friday, as well as Surat Thani, a provincial capital used as a land route for island hopper visitors.</p> <p>The attacks were not linked to international terrorism but planned to create \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d, coup leader and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said.</p> <p>When a devastating bomb hit Bangkok a year ago, killing 22 people and wounding more than 125, the government issued several contradictory statements over the ensuing weeks, eventually announcing it was the work of a human smuggling network. However, no group ever claimed the attack.</p> <p>Senior figures in the main opposition Pheu Thai party said on Saturday their members were not to blame for last week\u2019s strikes. Political violence is common in Thailand and two Pheu Thai former prime ministers and siblings, Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra, were overthrown in coups in 2006 and 2014.</p> <p>Members of the 12-year insurgency in the south, which has left more than 6,000 people dead in a fight for greater autonomy, have also been considered as potential culprits. </p> <p>Three home-made bombs exploded in the deep south province of Yala on Sunday night but caused no casualties, local media <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/security/1062033/3-bombs-in-yala-no-casualties\">reported</a>.</p> <p>And the Bangkok Post <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1061584/south-insurgency-linked-to-blasts\">quoted</a> Police Lieutenant General Suchart Theerasawat, assistant national police chief, as saying the bombs were \u201crelated and similar to those found in insurgent attacks in the deep south\u201d.</p> <p>However, militants do not normally target tourists and stick to provinces close to the Malaysian border.</p> <p>The dean of Thailand\u2019s Rangsit University\u2019s faculty of economics was <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1061592/blast-impact-could-cost-b33-billion\">quoted</a> in the Bangkok Post as saying the attacks may cost as much as 33.4bn baht (\u00a3744m) in economic losses.

  "<p>Perhaps there is an audience out there somewhere for Emo the Musical, the feature film debut of Australian writer/director Neil Triffett. But I\u2019ll be jiggered if I know who they are (surely not Christians or emos, two groups the film-maker mocks by pointing out endless base-level stereotypes), or what kind of strange, subterranean vernacular they might speak. <br></p> <p>Triffett\u2019s film is a 95-minute expansion of his well-received <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twnAfEse0II\">2014 short film of the same name</a>. It has a slight, if one-trick, pull-my-finger, charm to it and a memorable core message about tolerance. But boy, seeing this padded out into an hour and a half is something else: a tough assignment to sit through, full of knowingly wishy-washy songs that are bad-bad rather than funny-bad.<br></p> <p>Bible-bashing teenagers with shampoo commercial smiles gather on school lawns and sing songs with lyrics such as \u201ccome to church with me\u201d, looking like kids plucked from daggy 90s professional family photographs. Doom-and-gloom emos smoke cigarettes, apply dark eyeliner and plan their next self-harming session.</p> <p>After being expelled from school following an incident with a noose, Ethan (Benson Jack Anthony) starts at the run-down Seymour High, a supposedly dilapidated setting \u2013 it actually looks in pretty good nick \u2013 funded by a pharmaceutical company flogging antidepressants.</p> <p>The protagonist joins emo group Worst Day Ever after impressing the band by singing about how he doesn\u2019t want to join their stupid band. Bass player Roz (Lucy Barrett) takes a fancy, but Ethan pursues a secret romantic relationship with devout Christian singer Trinity (Jordan Hare), who is constantly talking about the Good Book and trying to get him along to youth group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b88ede74a75d651d54d8d8ce93b62d7677b245f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b88ede74a75d651d54d8d8ce93b62d7677b245f6/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trinity (Jordan Hare) in Emo the Musical\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trinity (Jordan Hare), devout Christian singer/love interest in Emo the Musical.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MIFF 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script expends virtually no effort explaining why the pair might be fond of each other; the point is that this is a Montague and Capulet situation. Except with schoolyard politics, pashing in the library and the trite, stale addition of a band competition at the end, judged by the most emo emo of them all (Dylan Lewis) \u2013 a guy who once kissed a man for seven hours, while crying. <br></p> <p>The fresh-faced young cast show pluck, verve, splash and charm. Their energy is infectious at times, but the songs are a big problem: babyish and basic, with gallingly obvious rhymes and cut-and-paste structures, they scale back the spirit of the film when it needs it most.</p> <p>Musical parody is a tough gig. Comedy is subjective at the best of times, without even allowing for the skills required to construct a good, catchy, lyrical song that also serves a function in the narrative. But when lyrics remain at the standard of \u201cOne time it will all become clear, that dating you was a bad idea\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll follow everywhere you go \u2026 Antarctica, New Mexico\u201d, it\u2019s hard to feel much of anything \u2013 except perhaps a growing desire to be somewhere else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/filmblog/2016/jun/20/every-australian-film-maker-owes-something-to-director-paul-cox\">'Every Australian film-maker owes something to director Paul Cox' | Luke Buckmaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the talent comp, one sad sack sings: \u201cSally I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll stop sleeping with your friends if you forgive me\u201d. The song is meant to be terrible \u2013 as the host of the show observes, it totally sucks balls. The problem with using it as a punchline, though, is that the quality of the songs in the film more broadly aren\u2019t much better, and they\u2019re geared towards the same kind of reaction.</p> <p>Triffett seems to want us to laugh at how bad they are, but the film doesn\u2019t carry the overload of camp or kitsch that would push them into \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d territory. A couple of flat songs in musicals are expected, perhaps even par for the course, but there\u2019s an awful lot of them here and the showstoppers never come.</p> <p>This critic is almost certainly not the film\u2019s target audience, but then again, who is? Much of the humour in Emo the Musical derives from an adult perspective. Jokes about Christian prejudice against people who are gay, for example, or the school\u2019s funding, or the underlining observation (though not much is done with it) that society tends to put people in boxes. But the tone and execution is pretty infantile, suggesting something too childish for adults or even teenagers, with an intellectual context too serious for kids. </p> <p>Of course, maybe I\u2019m wrong; maybe there\u2019s a subterranean crew of someone-or-others huddled somewhere right now, reciting the lyrics and laughing at the jokes.</p>",

  "<p>What can be done to redress the horrible mistreatment of people held in offshore detention? Can Peter Dutton or any of his servants or agents be dragged into court and punished? Can\u2019t international law come to the rescue of tortured asylum seekers and refugees? Are other civil or criminal remedies and responses available? </p> <p>Big questions with interesting possibilities but much as many would like to see a punitive response dished out to those who implement this abuse, the pathway is relatively untrod and uncertain. </p> <p>Australia is a party to the Rome statute that established the international criminal court, which can prosecute crimes against humanity \u2013 and that includes \u201cinhumane acts ... intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health\u201d. The first trials for crimes against humanity took place at Nuremberg after the second world war. </p> <p>Some years ago the federal MP <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/will-the-international-criminal-court-prosecute-australia-for-crimes-against-humanity-33363\">Andrew Wilkie wrote to the ICC prosecutor in The Hague</a> requesting an investigation and prosecution of the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, and 19 of his cabinet ministers in relation to the mistreatment of asylum seekers. </p> <p>Not much more was heard about this submission other than outrage from Andrew Nikolic, now an ex-MP, who said the accusations were \u201cvague and embarrassing\u201d, and the then immigration minister, Scott Morrision, who said he would keep on doing what he was doing and would not be intimidated. </p> <p>As a condition to becoming a party to Rome statute and agreeing to the jurisdiction of the ICC, Australia introduced to the <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html\">commonwealth criminal code</a> provisions relating to crimes against humanity, providing for a penalty of imprisonment of 25 years (see: 268.12 and 268.13). This adds a frisson of excitement to the prospect of getting some really nasty types charged up and in court. </p> <p>The provision in the code mirrors the relevant part of the <a href=\"http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm\">statute of Rome</a>, so our domestic law provides for such a crime with elements, such as: infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering which are not incidental to lawful sanctions; and the conduct is committed knowingly as part of a systemic attack on civilians. There are also provisions dealing with \u201cimprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty\u201d. </p> <p>Domestically, the commonwealth director of public prosecutions would be the prosecutor but only if the attorney general agreed and any offences would have to be prosecuted in the name of the AG. On the face of it there is plenty of evidence of conduct that fits the ingredients prescribed in the criminal code. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/nauru-inquiry-should-look-at-whether-abuse-reports-were-investigated-labor\">Nauru inquiry should look at whether abuse reports were investigated \u2013 Labor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But can you see the attorney general, George Brandis, going completely off-piste and prosecuting Peter Dutton, a man who displays such a lack of human empathy? </p> <p>Because the relevant bit of the Rome statute is part of Australian domestic law, the ICC itself has stronger and more plausible arguments should it be inspired to look into what\u2019s going on down here. </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine Malcolm Turnbull, Dutton and other ministers in the same Hague dock as Congolese warlords who conscript child soldiers. Yet, it is quite plausible that the ICC could mount a preliminary examination into Australia\u2019s shocking treatment of offshore detainees who sought our protection under the Refugee convention. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=160704-otp-stat\">ICC is undertaking the same process in relation to the Iraq war</a> and in doing so will consider the findings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/iraq-war-inquiry\">Chilcot report</a>. After a preliminary examination the next step would be an investigation and if all the dots lines up, a prosecution. <br>Even a preliminary examination by the ICC would be a major embarrassment for Australia which, so far, has been beyond embarrassment in the ruthless implementation of \u201cborder protection\u201d. It would flag internationally a pariah status for a country that wantonly abuses human rights, particularly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/there-are-policy-alternatives-to-locking-up-refugees-in-pacific-gulags\">there are policy options</a> far more humane than the one preferred by successive governments. </p> <p>Comparisons have been made with mistreatment of <a href=\"http:// https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/11/comparing-nauru-to-guantanamo-bay-is-ridiculous-says-australian-immigration-minister\">detainees at Abu Ghraib</a>, where <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2006/03/14/prosecutions_convictions/\">US military personnel have been tried and convicted</a> by courts martial.

The barrister and refugee advocate Julian Burnside QC told Guardian Australia that Dutton is right, but not in the way he imagines.</p> <p>\u201cGuant\u00e1namo Bay holds people who are thought to be dangerous terrorists, whereas Nauru holds people who have been assessed as refugees, people fleeing terrorism, people who are not thought to be a risk to anyone at all.\u201d </p> <p>Dutton also said the mistreatment was out of Australian hands and was a problem for Nauru. He may not have caught up with the <a href=\"http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-1-2016-02-03.pdf\">findings of the high court in February this year</a>, in the M68 case, where even though, by a majority, the judges found that detaining people on Nauru was not unlawful, nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/the-high-court-despite-the-law-at-its-disposal-has-let-them-get-away-with-it\">Australia\u2019s involvement in the regional \u201cprocessing\u201d centre was found to be \u201cindisputable\u201d</a>. You might think that would put an end to the fiction that it has nothing to do with us.</p> <p>There\u2019s another aspect to the high court\u2019s Nauru decision that puts the government on notice. The offshore regime is only lawful if it is \u201cproportionate\u201d to the requirement of processing refugees and not a system of permanent detention. The fact that there has been precious little resettlement puts the commonwealth on shaky ground. The longer refugees are held, the more unlawful the Nauru regional processing centre becomes.</p> <p>There have also been calls by the Australian Lawyers Alliance to have <a href=\"https://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/news/comcare-must-prosecute-for-nauru-abuses\">Comcare prosecute relevant offenders under the Work Health and Safety Act</a>. The alliance says the act applies to Australian activities on Nauru and makes liable people who are responsible in a workplace for the health and safety of others. An offence is committed where those with a duty to protect the health and safety of people in their care fail to do so, thereby exposing \u201can individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness\u201d. </p> <p>Liability also arises for breaches of a civil duty of care and a couple of high-profile class actions have been launched on behalf of detainees. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/current-class-actions/people-detained-on-christmas-island/\">Maurice Blackburn has a case under way</a> in relation to Christmas Island \u201cfor people who sought asylum and were injured or pregnant while in detention and suffered physical or psychological injury or the exacerbation of an injury due to the failure of the commonwealth to provide adequate medical care\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/05/want-to-know-about-immigration-detention-then-sue-for-negligence\">Slater &amp; Gordon is also running a class action in Victoria</a> on behalf of people detained on Manus Island. The defendants are the commonwealth, Transfield (now Broadspectrum and part of the Spanish Ferrovial group) and the former contractor G4S. The claim relates to the provision of substandard food, water, shelter and medical care. </p> <p>Civil actions are slow, arduous and expensive. The remedy is in damages which is not much of a sanction to large global corporations or the commonwealth.
