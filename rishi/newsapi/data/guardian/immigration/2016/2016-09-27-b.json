  "<p>Britain\u2019s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, according to the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/Media/GCR1617/GCR_16.pdf\">Global Competitiveness report</a> had used data collected before the 23 June referendum.<br></p> <p>Noting that the UK was currently one of the most competitive economies in the world, the WEF said: \u201cAlthough the process and the conditions of Brexit are still unknown, it is likely to have a negative impact on the United Kingdom\u2019s competitiveness through goods and financial markets as well as market size and, potentially, innovation\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/brexit-anxiety-financial-services-sector-cbi-\">Brexit anxiety taking its toll on financial services sector, CBI finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WEF study chimes with reports from other global institutions - including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - which said ahead of the referendum that Brexit would have a long-term impact on the UK in terms of weaker inward investment and less trade.</p> <p>The studies have been challenged by Brexit supporters, who say the UK will be able to forge closer trade links with countries outside the EU and will benefit from a reduction in the red tape generated in Brussels.</p> <p>The WEF\u2019s report is published at a time when the government is mulling over its exit strategy from the EU. Some ministers favour a soft Brexit under which the UK would prioritise access to the single market, while others back a hard Brexit that would make immigration control the priority in negotiations.</p> <p>The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cToday\u2019s report demonstrates our ability to sharpen our edge and improve our competitiveness. This government will build on that progress, as we demonstrate to the world that Britain continues to be highly competitive and open for business.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/uk-economy-faces-challenging-period-after-brexit-vote-says-bank\">UK economy faces challenging period after Brexit vote, says Bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p> <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/launch-of-the-world-trade-report-2016-inclusive-trade-and-smes\">Speaking at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva on Tuesday, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, </a>said the UK would push for more trade liberalisation after Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe decision of the British people to leave the EU is not symptomatic of looking inwards, but a people who want to take more control over our laws, our money and our borders,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe are a proud and outward-looking trading nation.\u201d</p> <p>The WEF said the UK\u2019s competitiveness relied on highly efficient goods and labour markets, in which it ranked 9th and 5th respectively out of the 138 countries assessed. The UK was third for technological readiness and scored more highly than the EU as a whole in11 of the 12 categories covered.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Britain scored less well than the EU for its macro-economic environment, largely because of its large budget deficit, high debt ratio and weak performance in savings. Despite a rise of 23 places in the category, the UK still ranks only 85th in the world. </p> <p>The three top countries in the league table \u2013 Switzerland, Singapore and the US \u2013 remain unchanged from 2015, with the rest of the top 10 made up of the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong and Finland.</p> <p>European countries made up half of the top 10, but the WEF said there was a marked divide between the north and south of the continent. Spain was up one place to 32nd, Italy dropped a spot to 44th and Greece dropped five places to 86th. France, the second biggest country in eurozone rose one position to 21st.</p> <p>\u201cFor all economies in Europe, maintaining and improving prosperity levels will depend heavily on their ability to harness innovation and the talents of their workforces\u201d, the WEF said. </p> <p>The report also noted an increase in both the developed and developing world in non-tariff barriers to trade, more burdensome customs procedures and tighter rules affecting both foreign direct investment and foreign ownership. The trend was most evident in high and upper middle-income countries.</p> <p>Klaus Schwab, the WEF\u2019s founder and executive chairman, said: \u201cDeclining openness in the global economy is harming competitiveness and making it harder for leaders to drive sustainable, inclusive growth.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s a scene that has played out hundreds of times before, heard by millions but seen by only a small roomful of people. Bruce McAvaney, adopting the unshakable postural arc of a veteran racing caller, stands from his chair and stoops forward slightly in the Seven broadcasting booth, binoculars firmly pressed to his eyes as he motors through another rapid-fire description of the action unfolding beyond the glass. His voice deepens to the kind of ecstatic growl every football fan knows well. The growl is the same whether McAvaney\u2019s calling the opening bounce of a cut-throat final or junk time in a pre-season blowout. </p> <p>Calmly seated beside him is Dennis Cometti; immaculately blazered, liberally hairsprayed and laconic. From his chair Cometti alternates between a panoramic view of the ground, his carefully-prepared notes and a small TV monitor on the desk in front of him. He absorbs McAvaney\u2019s description through his right ear, mentally limbering up for his own entrance. The opening is something Cometti can sense from decades spent as McAvaney\u2019s co-pilot on hundreds of football broadcasts but also by his colleague\u2019s cadence \u2013 sometimes wearied and flagging but with McAvaney, just as often a spittle-inducing parabola whose upward peak pushes the limits of human oxygen intake. When Bruce\u2019s bolt is shot, his left arm comes down and he tags his offsider into the fray with a collegial hand on the shoulder. Dennis Cometti is away.</p> <p>So endures Australian sports broadcasting\u2019s premier double act, or so it has, until this weekend, when at the conclusion of the AFL grand final Cometti peels off his headset, rolls back his chair and rises next to his favourite colleague one last time. After 49 years in broadcasting \u2013 30 of them calling AFL football on network television \u2013 Dennis Cometti himself is tapping out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b516eac2c2febe73dd128ed579e5c0a51e34749/0_65_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti interviewing Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti interviews Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson before an AFL game in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018You can go back to the place but not the time\u2019</strong></h2> <p>To fully understand Dennis Cometti you need to start with family. To do that you have to begin with the lowlight of Cometti\u2019s life: the sudden death in 1969 of his father James, the son of working class Italian migrant Giovanni, who travelled to Australia in 1909 from Tirano in the Northern Italian Alps and walked 800km through blistering sun from Perth to find backbreaking work and a new life in the harsh, dust-swept terrain of the Meekatharra goldfields.</p> <p>When James Cometti collapsed on a Perth street and died of a heart attack his 18-year-old son and only child was busy training with WAFL team West Perth. Dennis was by that point a teen sensation. The winter before he\u2019d kicked 60 goals and played alongside the club\u2019s legendary captain-coach Graham \u201cPolly\u201d Farmer in a league semi-final. </p> <p>Expectations for Cometti\u2019s fledgling football career were lofty, and the father-son bond shared by James and Dennis had been strengthened by the game. It was James Cometti who passed on so many of the fundamentals that would later appear in his son\u2019s oft-quoted commentary. Their conversations, and all the long afternoons spent sitting side-by-side at the footy had become a roadmap for Dennis Cometti\u2019s understanding of the game.</p> <p>The day before James Cometti died, he and his son had what seemed at the time a trivial argument. Dennis returned home late from a night on the town \u2013 not the commitment to his burgeoning sports career his father expected of him. Their disagreement was not a screaming match and there were no histrionics, just disappointed silence. What they didn\u2019t know was that they\u2019d never speak again. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/27/it-still-feels-close-vin-catoggio-on-grand-final-heartbreak-and-finding-peace\">'It still feels close': Vin Catoggio on grand final heartbreak and finding peace | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt lingered on until the next day and I didn\u2019t see him in the morning and he passed away that afternoon,\u201d Cometti tells me as we look back on his life. \u201cI always felt that was a terrible thing to have happened because the relationship was so close. I was an only child and he was more a mate than he was my Dad, and just a really good bloke. I felt that I\u2019d let the team down a little bit by doing that.\u201d</p> <p>The manner in which Cometti learned of his father\u2019s death has always stuck with him, too. Razzed onto the training track by West Perth players, a young police constable accommodated his nerves by laughing at the gibes as he approached the lanky young spearhead. It was a misleading portent. Guided to the sidelines, Cometti was bluntly presented with the news: \u201cBy the way, your dad is dead.\u201d Shocked, he left the ground and had to identify the body to spare his mother Dulcie the task. </p> <p>After his father\u2019s death Cometti drifted from footy, withdrawing into himself and pushing the game away. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull of his alternative life as a rookie FM radio disc jockey was proving strong, so he only half-heartedly committed himself to West Perth and wouldn\u2019t return to the fold properly until well over a decade later, in a middling three-year stint as coach.</p> <p>\u201cWith my Dad not there, because we\u2019d really had an adventure together with footy from when I was about 11 and we\u2019d had a lot of fun with it, I think I was able to drift a lot more readily,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cHad he been there I\u2019m sure he would have pulled me into line. I respected him greatly and I would have felt that I was letting him down. When he\u2019d gone I let my standards slip because he wasn\u2019t there to safeguard my standards.\u201d</p> <p>What kind of man did Dennis Cometti become as a result of the events of March 1969? Perhaps it\u2019s best to consider a pair of facts from the life he made following his father\u2019s death. The first is that at some point, adapting the lyrics to an obscure song called Waking Up Alone by 1970s singer-songwriter Paul Williams, Cometti settled upon a revealing credo for his life: \u201cyou can go back to the place but not the time.\u201d</p> <p>The second is that despite the fame and millions of dollars that his career in broadcasting has brought him, Dennis Cometti still lives in the house he grew up in \u2013 Jack and Dulcie Cometti\u2019s family home in Perth.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You know he\u2019s in the room\u2019</strong></h2> <p> When you speak to people who\u2019ve spent a lot of time around Dennis Cometti you encounter a few recurring observations; nobody who has ever worked alongside him has a bad word to say about the guy; his preparation for every broadcast is exhaustive \u2013 whether it\u2019s a NAB Challenge pre-season junket in Dubai or a finals blockbuster \u2013 and that the retiring broadcaster is an irreplaceable talent.</p> <p>Colleagues also talk about his <em>presence, </em>a statesmanlike aura that makes even champion footballers self-conscious in his company. \u201cYou know he\u2019s in the room,\u201d his Triple M and former Channel Seven colleague Michael Roberts says. \u201cAnd when he speaks, people listen.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is tall, gangly and easy to imagine as his youthful self \u2013 flying high into the backs of defenders for pack marks. His long, crooked nose bends across his face like a crow swooping down from a streetlamp, a Cometti family trait he\u2019s traced back to the old country. His ears are long and droopy, lending him the air of a friendly basset hound. That face, unmistakable to old-timers when he\u2019s out and about, is a type you don\u2019t really see on TV anymore. Cometti is the Toby jug commemorative version of a 1970s newsreader.</p> <p>Most who know him mention Cometti\u2019s unique and occasionally flamboyant dress sense, which would probably sit somewhere between a comfortably unhip veteran rock star and Alan Partridge; carefully pressed denim, sunglasses and leather jackets. Older colleagues remember the youthful era in which the jeans were subbed out for outrageous leather pants. \u201cThey were fashionable leather pants, if leather pants can be fashionable,\u201d laughs Cometti\u2019s former Seven commentary colleague Drew Morphett. \u201cHe was a product of the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll era. You wouldn\u2019t see Jonathan Brown or Jason Dunstall or anybody else going out in leather pants. It became a bit of a signature for him.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgAOrWVHsz0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DgAOrWVHsz0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti quits as West Perth football coach.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Cometti lobbed at Triple J for an appearance in the late 90s, the station\u2019s staff were delighted to note that the commentary legend not only travelled with a leather man-bag tucked under his arm but that it contained a miniature can of hairspray. Cometti\u2019s never been shy about the haircare routine. Before he goes on air he will confer with make-up artists as to the specific brand they\u2019re using, often carefully applying the finishing touches himself. The Cometti barnet is now almost as iconic as the voice \u2013 a perfectly sculpted helmet of hair. \u201cHe\u2019s rock n roll,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou know him in a crowd.\u201d</p> <p>As his retirement heralds the end of an era, Cometti is also one of the few remaining denizens of Australian showbiz whose employers consider worthy of limousine service. He\u2019s only ever been late to a game once, after a cancelled flight to a Sunday fixture in Adelaide, for which he didn\u2019t arrive until quarter time. His Melbourne driver, Raj, has ferried Cometti and his wife Velia around town for years. When a network boss joked that Seven were paying Raj more than some of Cometti\u2019s co-commentators, the broadcasting icon shot back: \u201cWell you should be paying your commentators more.\u201d</p> <p>Co-workers consider a ride in the Cometti limo a bit of thrill, though none can claim an anecdote as colourful as that provided by Seven boundary rider Jude Bolton. \u201cOne day we left Etihad stadium and I jumped in, myself and Dennis with Raj,\u201d Bolton tells me. \u201cI\u2019d eaten something really dodgy at Etihad Stadium during one of the calls and I just turned green. Literally green in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI started getting the cold sweats and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to jump out at the first terminal and I\u2019ll walk to our spot.\u2019 And Dennis said, \u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t do it in Raj\u2019s car.\u2019 So I ended up having to get out of the car and he\u2019s jumped out with me and he\u2019s helped me through it as I\u2019ve just vomited on the side of the road, and he\u2019s handing me water and telling me he hopes I\u2019m alright.\u201d Then, as Bolton gathered his composure, Cometti appraised the scene in signature style: \u201cCentimetre perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Bolton laughs. \u201cJust one of my highlights along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti\u2019s rock star transport arrangements also featured prominently in his colleague Matthew Richardson\u2019s first day in broadcasting, a story that also highlights the fastidiousness of Cometti\u2019s preparation. \u201cI remember rocking up to my first game at Subiaco,\u201d Richardson tells me. \u201cI had a coffee with him the day before. I remember being told to make sure I did my homework, so I had three or four pages of notes and I thought I was going pretty well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI pulled up in the old yellow cab there outside the gate at Subiaco feeling pretty good about things, but there was a big black limousine in front of me and out jumped Dennis Cometti. He\u2019s always got the sunglasses on and looks immaculate. He\u2019s a very cool-looking man. And here I am with my four pages of A4 notes and he gets out of this black limo with his massive briefcase of notes and immediately I just thought to myself, \u2018Gee I\u2019ve got a long way to go\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Cometti doesn\u2019t sweat football 24/7, and rarely seeks conversation about the game when he\u2019s off the clock. Richardson says they normally chat about music, pop culture and news. When I speak to Cometti myself we talk at length about gonzo journalism, The Carpenters, various JFK assassination conspiracies and his aborted documentary on the latter, which he\u2019d started tackling in his final year at the ABC.</p> <p>Cometti has diverse reading tastes and a lot of time to indulge them on long-haul flights between Perth and the east coast, on which most colleagues think he also dreams up many of his signature commentary quips. His favourite writers are Hunter S Thompson and PJ O\u2019Rourke, and he revisits Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas every year. It\u2019s rarely noted, but Cometti has been for most of his career a prolific writer himself \u2013 not just his fastidious pre-broadcast notes and Rodney Dangerfieldesque one-liners but newspaper, magazine and online columns, plus books. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/tom-wills-grave-restoration-project-reveals-footballs-heart-soul-and-history\">Tom Wills grave restoration project reveals football's heart, soul and history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If he\u2019s given to invoking the past, with his nods to The Easybeats and Big Bob Johnson, Cometti might also be the least sentimental romantic in the business. He fulfilled radio obligations on the night his father died and read Perth TV news the night his mother passed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a cold person,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/chris-beck-talks-to-dennis-cometti/2008/05/14/1210444510098.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1\">he once said</a>. \u201cBut what it does, it probably understands that life and the job run side by side.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti also missed the births of both his daughter Ricki and his son Mark due to work commitments. Mark, now a professional wrestler, was born as his Dad called a Sheffield Shield cricket match (\u201cWe named him Mark, because you\u2019ve never heard of a kid named handpass or kick,\u201d Cometti told listeners).</p> <p>He is avowedly apolitical in his broadcasting, an approach that has had the unintended consequence of courting trouble at times. He was on the mic when Sydney Swans great Adam Goodes performed his famous war dance towards Carlton fans in 2015, and drew stinging criticism for suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t have done it himself before claiming that it wasn\u2019t in Goodes\u2019 best interests either, but he has paused to consider the incident since.</p> <p>\u201cThere was nothing sinister in it,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood what that was all about. It was certainly going to make him the centre of attention in perhaps a difficult way for him, and it turned out to be that way, although I think in the end he got more support than opposition and that was a good thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682981272fbb87876312f0df9f0c5814179b36f2/0_83_3781_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footballer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Cometti was criticised for his reaction to a war dance performed by AFL legend Adam Goodes against West Coast in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Mcdonough/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think I said at the time that I wouldn\u2019t have done that, probably at the time not fully understanding what was involved. I didn\u2019t think it was as significant as it perhaps played out to be. But that\u2019s the problem with live television sometimes. It was the opposition cheer squad, so I thought it was provocative in that way, but it was one of those situations looking back that I probably should have bitten my lip.\u201d</p> <p>The question of keeping schtum on his own views is a recurring theme for Cometti, who prefers to remain a neutral observer. \u201cI just don\u2019t think sporting commentary is the place for them, to be honest. That\u2019s just a personal view,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a forum. The audience is certainly widespread in its political views and its views on most things in live in general, so to go too deeply or too far down that track probably does the broadcaster no good, the organisation he represents no good.\u201d</p> <p>To understand Cometti\u2019s reticence on loaded issues like gender and race, and their intersection with sport, it possibly pays to acknowledge the two people who most obviously influenced his early philosophies in life: his mother Dulcie, who was an aspiring novelist when she met Cometti\u2019s father, and his Aunt Esme Fletcher, who opened Western Australia\u2019s first child daycare centre and also a women\u2019s refuge. The strength of the women in his family had an impact on his outlook in life.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Esme and my mother were feminists, perhaps before feminists were invented,\u201d Cometti once told SBS. \u201cWhat do I think about it? Well I think they were both admirable people. I mean, I agree with what they were on about, there\u2019s no question about that. Sometimes, it needs to be said, they saw men as the enemy and as a young man in that environment you needed to be careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of what I have I owe to them ... a lot to be thankful for.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos\u2019</strong></h2> <p>What they say about Dennis Cometti\u2019s swotting before games is true: for as long as he\u2019s been calling football on TV he\u2019s spent 15-20 hours per week watching game tapes in a room dedicated to the task. Sometimes he sits and makes notes, studying patterns of play or doing reconnaissance on new players. Other times he does a workout as he watches, chugging away on an exercise bike or the treadmill set up in front of the screen. </p> <p>Not only does this habitual process enhance his knowledge of form, tactics and precisely what he can expect from the games he\u2019ll be calling, it pays practical dividends, enabling him to nail the basics like correctly identifying players, a fundamental component of broadcasting expertise in which he often puts younger colleagues in the shade. \u201cSometimes a bloke runs straight at you and you can\u2019t see a number,\u201d notes Drew Morphett. \u201cYou know he\u2019s got blonde hair and bandy legs or something like that, but you think \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019 if he\u2019s playing game number five or something, but Dennis will know him back to front because he\u2019s watched the videos. Dennis is fantastic at that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long and his preparation is just second to none,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThe amount of work he puts into each game is probably the thing I noticed right from the start and probably something you take away \u2013 that someone who has been doing it as long as him but was still putting in as much time as anyone on the preparation. I guess that\u2019s what makes him so good.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/bulldogs-faithful-pray-afl-miracle-wandering\">Bulldogs faithful pray for one more AFL miracle to end the wandering | Craig Little</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However Cometti\u2019s quest for knowledge doesn\u2019t extend to fraternising with players or getting to know them on a personal level. \u201cCertainly I try to avoid planes with teams on them,\u201d he tells me. \u201cObviously there\u2019s not many planes to Adelaide, so you get what you get. I get on well with the teams but there\u2019s so much small talk and you sort of get tired of that.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Cometti has taken that separation of duties to a level that amuses colleagues. Morphett remembers waiting for him at Adelaide airport before a Crows game against West Coast. Cometti arrived on the same flight as Eagles players but went missing when Morphett was trying to find him at the baggage carousel. \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2018where the hell is Cometti?\u2019\u201d he remembers. \u201cAll of a sudden he appears out of the dunny after half an hour. I said \u2018where have you been?\u2019. He says \u2018I don\u2019t like talking to the players. You\u2019re bumping into them all the time\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe flies by his own rules a little bit.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Spinning the platters that matter\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s impossible to see that an AFL broadcasting talent of Dennis Cometti\u2019s versatility and widespread appeal will emerge from the present media landscape, and now probably unfair to expect it. That\u2019s partly because the culture and times from which Cometti sprang \u2013 the Fleetwood Mac double shots, vaudeville wisecracks and unapologetic schmaltz of 1960s FM radio \u2013 no longer exists. </p> <p>Neither does the regimented ABC of Cometti\u2019s 14-year stint running from 1973 to 1986. On FM radio Cometti found his inner court jester. From the national broadcaster\u2019s Perth offices on Adelaide Terrace, he painstakingly learned his trade as a broadcast journalist from some of the best teachers and practitioners the country has ever produced. At the ABC there were standards to be maintained and structure to be adhered to and a proper way of doing everything; in cricket, batsmen were always named before bowlers. </p> <p>Cometti\u2019s first foray into radio was spinning the platters that mattered for Perth station 6KY, which in the late-60s battled head-to-head with 6PR for the loyalties of Perth\u2019s Top 40 radio listeners. In those formative years there was no rulebook and no internet resources to crib his style from, so Cometti imported cumbersome reel-to-reel tapes of America\u2019s best rock DJs and studied them for hours once they\u2019d finished their six-month sea freight journey to Perth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85025c2fea390932b3ef0b03da2a76273371ceb4/318_265_5725_8067/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1980s promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cometti\u2019s first proper radio gig, in mid-1968, fell into place when an old school friend forwarded his \u201cless than sophisticated audition tape\u201d to veteran 6KY announcer Alan Robertson, who in turn got it to the station\u2019s program director John Lehman. The early days were a bit of a lark but not always smooth-sailing. In one gaffe, Cometti mispronounced a live-read ad for an incense boutique, which he described as \u201cspecialising in incest\u201d. For Cometti, each weekend brought the chance to run out onto football grounds alongside Polly Farmer and during the week he was not only lost in music, but in love. In his first summer of broadcasting he also met Velia, who he would marry.</p> <p>But if Robertson taught Cometti the fundamentals of preparing for a broadcast, and instilled in him the idea that he couldn\u2019t just fly by the seat of his pants, he also might have mentioned that nobody in broadcasting is invincible. Between Cometti\u2019s 6KY debut in 1968 and his move to the ABC in 1973, his CV \u201cread like a greyhound bus schedule.\u201d No job was safe.</p> <p>In 1971 a lack of opportunities in Perth sent him to Melbourne, where he balanced an oddball football comeback in the reserves at Ted Whitten-coached Footscray with the weekday night shift and Sundays on 3DB, Victoria\u2019s home of footy, racing and Top 40 hits. For the day job he\u2019d leave training early and jump on the 6:15 to Flinders street. \u201cMr Part-time,\u201d Whitten would call him. Seven or eight reserves games and his best-paid year in radio behind him, he was back in Western Australia.</p> <p>The sidestep into sports broadcasting didn\u2019t come until \u201873 and in unexpected circumstances: a late call-up to play second fiddle to 3KZ footy stalwart Ian Major for the Victoria-WA state game at Subiaco. Soon he was regularly calling games with WA broadcasting star Oliver Drake-Brockman (\u201cOliver could make dogs weep,\u201d Cometti once said). </p> <p>ABC program director Jim Fitzmaurice came after him not long after, with a view to the young gun calling sport full-time. Given the tumult of Cometti\u2019s previous five years the security appealed. \u201cWe were middle class and I was an only child and my mother wasn\u2019t working, so there was, if you like, a realisation that I needed to be careful with my next step,\u201d Cometti tells me.</p> <p>In the following 14 years at Aunty, Cometti refined the impeccable broadcasting habits that would form the basis of his calling style over the next four decades. At the ABC\u2019s Perth headquarters he shared a tiny office with fellow newcomer Drew Morphett. \u201cIt was 12 feet by 20 feet or something like that,\u201d remembers Morphett. \u201cWe lived in each other\u2019s pockets early on.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti was an instant hit. Morphett jokes that having slaved away trying to climb the ladder himself, he was immediately leapfrogged by his new colleague, and was told by Fitzmaurice to work around Cometti\u2019s Sunday league football coaching commitments. \u201cHe was always the favoured son,\u201d Morphett laughs. \u201cHe had it over me right from the word go.\u201d</p> <p>Experienced help was always at hand. \u201cOur superiors were <em>broadcasters</em>,\u201d Morphett says, pointing to Fitzmaurice as a key mentor. \u201cHe was a legendary broadcaster. When Jim tapped you on the shoulder and told you you were ready to go, it was coming from a good source.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were all taught the basics of broadcasting. He (Cometti) didn\u2019t need much coaching to do football broadcasting because he was a coach and a former player. He got a very early nod to be the ABC\u2019s Test cricket caller on radio. I thought at the time it was a very quick elevation.\u201d</p> <p>Though it was an odd fit at first, Cometti rose to the challenge of calling cricket beside Alan McGilvray and former Test captain Lindsay Hassett during the 1974-75 Ashes, starting a lifetime habit of over-preparing to avoid any chance of being caught short. Each morning he\u2019d arrive with a long list of headlines to work from; weather, the toss, the batting order and other stories of the day. \u201cHe did it almost by indexing,\u201d says Morphett, \u201cso that if he ran out of something to say, he went to the next topic.\u201d</p> <p>To this day, Cometti still tenses up at the start of broadcasts the same way he did back then and delivering the opening monologue to camera has always been something of an ordeal. \u201cEven this year, I think he still probably gets nervous,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what makes him so good. He\u2019s not taking any call for granted no matter where it is, whether it\u2019s a big game or a final, or maybe a game between teams on the bottom of the ladder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/20/from-the-footy-almanac-vault-barry-dickins-remembers-mud\">From the Footy Almanac vault: Barry Dickins remembers mud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As late as the early 90s, Cometti remained so concerned about nailing his opening lines that he instituted his own homespun autocue. \u201cDennis set up this little system,\u201d says Morphett, who adds that Cometti would be mortified by people knowing. \u201cHe had a piece of dowel. He put it across the lens of the camera and he had two pieces of paper left and right of the lens, and on them he\u2019d have headlines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first line would be \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019. Second line would be \u2018West Coast v Richmond\u2019. Third line would be, \u2018fighting for a finals berth\u2019 or whatever. I used to say, \u2018why have you got to write down \u2013 \u2018Hi, I\u2019m DC\u2019? It was a piece of wood across the lens of the camera and two foolscap bits of paper. This was just his way of getting under way without making any blues right from the start.\u201d</p> <p>Yet no amount of preparation could prevent the chaos around him. When a nervous Cometti took the chair for his first ever stint at the mic in a Test, during the Perth Test of 1974, he was mortified when he turned and realised his expert offsider Hassett had picked up his trademark pipe and wandered off into the distance for a smoke. \u201cIn many ways that day was helpful,\u201d Cometti later noted, \u201cif for no other reason than to illustrate how isolated and vulnerable broadcasters could be.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti himself has grown into a thoughtful and generous colleague, ever-conscious of injecting his less experienced co-workers into the broadcast and putting them at ease. Before Richardson\u2019s debut broadcast as a Seven boundary rider and knowing he was nervous, Cometti and McAvaney walked down to the fence together and reassured him that he\u2019d be fine. \u201cRight from day one I was made to feel welcome by Dennis,\u201d Richardson says.</p> <p>That extends to the call itself. \u201cHe always throws down to you in a great way and brings you into the conversation with a perfect little lead-in,\u201d says Seven newcomer Jude Bolton. \u201cThat\u2019s made my transition as easy as possible.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl7y7zlsJqE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hl7y7zlsJqE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calls the 2011 Meredith Gift.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such grace and care for co-callers also helps Cometti\u2019s own image, says his long-time colleague Michael Roberts. \u201cHe\u2019s looking after you, looking after the brand, and looking after himself,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s blokes that I work with that just get their kicks out of putting you on the spot and getting a laugh out of seeing you stuff up. But Dennis is all about looking after you. He\u2019s a team player. He looks after his team-mates and he makes sure that the brand is winning.\u201d</p> <p>At the ABC Cometti was actually being groomed as McGilvray\u2019s long-term replacement, though his bosses might have known that jig was up when he knocked back a chance to accompany the cricket broadcasting great on an Ashes tour, preferring instead to focus his energies on the WAFL season at hand. It\u2019s rarely mentioned these days but Cometti\u2019s cricket broadcasting days spanned from that fiery 1974-75 Ashes through the World Series schism and the troubled early seasons of the Border years, and he\u2019d also return for Seven in the 1990s, calling Australia\u2019s 1997 tour of South Africa.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb-XKc8Idnw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gb-XKc8Idnw?start=240&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dennis Cometti calling Australia\u2019s 1997 Test tour of South Africa.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cricket was also the scene of one of his rare tantrums. Ray \u201cSlug\u201d Jordon once recalled an ABC call of a New Zealand-Sri Lanka one-day international at Bellerive Oval, for which the ABC was provided 30-minute shifts each from the travelling Nine TV broadcast team \u2013 Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Tony Greig and Ian Chappell.</p> <p>To get into the broadcast area both sets of callers needed to ascend a narrow and amateurishly-constructed piece of scaffolding, which gave the operation the feel of a tree house. Chairs, desks and broadcast equipment had been lifted into position with a rugged pulley system. Cometti started to baulk. Come the morning shift, Benaud hit his head on the scaffolding as he climbed a rickety ladder. </p> <p>\u201cThat was the end for Richie,\u201d said Jordon, \u201cand Dennis spat the dummy in sympathy. Richie retreated to the luxury of the channel Nine box while Dennis headed back to his hotel room and locked the door.\u201d By 1987, when Cometti departed the ABC to star in Broadcom\u2019s VFL football coverage en route to Seven, his days of schlepping around on a public service budget were done.</p> <p>We forget it now, because his name is synonymous with AFL, but Cometti has been a versatile caller in the past two decades, an adaptability that came from those days at the ABC. His calls of Kieren Perkins\u2019 1500m gold medal and Susie O\u2019Neill\u2019s triumphs at Atlanta \u201896 are classics in the annals of Australian sports broadcasting. As ever, success came from preparation. \u201cHe just did the homework and worked hard at it,\u201d Morphett says. \u201cHe would just find a little corner in the broadcast centre and just be poring over notes and preparing himself perfectly.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018He was a very quiet man\u2019</h2> <p>If Dennis Cometti will be remembered best for his iconic one-liners, what will be missed most is his voice \u2013 a deep and humming baritone that croons its way through football matches. When Dennis Cometti calls upon his entire vocal range and enunciates it\u2019s as though the words are echoing up from the bottom of a French oak wine barrel.</p> <p>Cometti is not really sure where that voice came from, but says there\u2019s some similarities with his father\u2019s. \u201cHe was a very quiet man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say he didn\u2019t have a deep, manly voice, my father. It was hardly ever raised in anger or raised in any way. It was just a different time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like me getting too loud at the footy and I suppose that tempered my view in terms of when I do the broadcast now. I certainly don\u2019t have any skin in the game. I don\u2019t barrack for teams. As a result I find that helpful. He sort of imbued me with that in the early days when I\u2019d get a little too vocal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/afl-and-nrl-grand-final-entertainment-the-worse-it-is-the-better-it-is\">AFL and NRL grand final entertainment: the worse it is, the better it is | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Cometti pipes have been passed on his professional wrestler son Mark, who could prove one of football\u2019s great father-son selections if things go right. \u201cHe\u2019s got a better voice than I have,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cI think he\u2019s flirting with the idea of going into broadcasting and I\u2019m trying to help him a little bit at the moment, because he\u2019s back nursing a shoulder injury in Perth. He was supposed to be my superannuation package when I sent him away but now he\u2019s back here.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You can have a good time at the footy\u2019</h2> <p>As he crosses the finishing line on a 49-year broadcasting career, Cometti is by such a margin the numero uno of AFL broadcasting that you forget it wasn\u2019t always so. In the late 80s and early 90s there was a perception on the eastern seaboard, quite unfair, that he favoured his home-state West Coast Eagles. At times Seven overlooked him for key finals, and he certainly wasn\u2019t the face of the network\u2019s coverage.<br></p> <p>He first moved to Seven in 1988, the season after his shambolic and strange year with Broadcom, joining the likes of McAvaney, Morphett, Sandy Roberts, Don Scott and Peter Landy as household names in AFL states. Though Seven still has the strongest claim on Cometti, it\u2019s also true to say that through the 1990s, neither they nor the staid nature of sports broadcasting in Australia allowed him to emerge as the universally-loved caller we now know.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no overt \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Cometti says of that period, \u201cit was just that you understood the environment you were in, and it was very hardcore football.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a80c139743a9b91e388d766ca02a4ef84999fa/298_58_3212_4521/710.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Cometti\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotional photograph of Network Seven AFL broadcaster Dennis Cometti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seven Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was out of the great TV rights war of 2001 that Cometti was able to find a new gear and unprecedented levels of popularity where so many other callers of his generation faded from view or disappeared from our TV screens entirely. Drafted in alongside Eddie McGuire as a star attraction of the Channel Nine team, he spent six years reinventing himself as the most consistently entertaining caller in the business, an evolution in his calling style that Nine encouraged.</p> <p>Cometti likens the transition period to a rediscovery of his lazy late-1960s days out at the footy, when he\u2019d try to make his friends laugh on the banks of Leederville oval in Perth, whose amphitheater design allowed wisecracks to ring out across the ground. \u201cYou can have a good time at the footy,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to the detriment of the game and not pushing yourself up, but a few lines here or there in the course of the afternoon \u2013 particularly if the game is a little dull \u2013 doesn\u2019t add up to much time compared to the game itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy recollections of the footy was that you went and had a good time and you made a lot of smart alec remarks about the players and whatever else might be happening. It\u2019s probably an insight into my personality that I do like to do that. I probably am a bit of a smart alec, which may have come from being in the disc jockey business and trying to be funny. I had no trouble just trying to be me. I felt that sometimes I pulled back from that in the early days at Seven.\u201d </p> <p>By 2008, when Nine lost the rights and Cometti returned to Seven, the network\u2019s bosses were more than happy to let him do his own thing. Entertainment was back on the agenda. \u201cYou can\u2019t be making light of what\u2019s happening too often,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting line to walk, and you can\u2019t be disrespectful. The contest is the thing. It\u2019s everything.\u201d</p> <p>But what Cometti has learned across his career is that a special kind of relationship develops between commentator and listener, one that needs to be tended to. Some callers, he says, prefer to keep the audience at a distance and not reveal much of themselves, but for Cometti it\u2019s been a gradual process of letting people in. He wants his fans to know him, to see who he is.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you can watch a bloke on TV for 20 or 25 years and really be none the wiser about who he is,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not a criticism. That is a choice that someone has made and they can do it very well. I\u2019m of the opinion, if I watch and invest so much time in somebody or something, I would like at the end of that to know someone I\u2019ve spent all that time with a little better.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I view a relationship: you\u2019ve gotta let people in. Some people say it\u2019s not a relationship, but I think it is. For me, that was important. To have people say \u2018he seems like a reasonable bloke\u2019. When I finished I wanted to be better known to the people I was broadcasting to, especially if they\u2019d put that time and energy into listening to me. I owe them a debt of gratitude.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket\u2019</h2> <p>Of course Dennis Cometti\u2019s disappearance from our TV screens means not only the loss of a singular broadcasting talent but also spells the end of his enduring double-act with McAvaney, with whom he\u2019s formed a professional dynamic that will be impossible for Seven to replicate. Dennis and Bruce. Bruce and Dennis. They\u2019re like an old couple, right down to the biscuits McAvaney brings to every game, always from the same shop on Flinders lane.</p> <p>Their longstanding rapport has been possible due to immense mutual respect and the kind of casual comfort among each other that allows them to sit alone at opposite ends of hotel dining rooms without acknowledging one another, lest they stifle their on-air chemistry. \u201cWe\u2019re such good friends we can tell each other to bugger off,\u201d Cometti once said. Another key to their partnership, he thinks, is that they never compete against each other for attention. Each caller knows his role.</p> <p>When I talk to Cometti about the closeness of that bond, I mention a theory floated by ESPN\u2019s Tony Kornheiser about his on-air partnership with his PTI co-host and friend Michael Wilbon; that the secret to the successful on-air partnership is like the old joke made by the Wimbledon groundskeepers when they\u2019re asked how they keep the courts so green: you just start with 5000 years of rain. Cometti laughs. He and Bruce have had their 5000 years of rain, and they\u2019re sad that it\u2019s coming to an end.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a harsh word,\u201d Cometti says. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends. We don\u2019t live in each other\u2019s pocket but we work in each other\u2019s pocket. It\u2019s been a wonderful relationship. I\u2019ve got the utmost respect for him.\u201d</p> <p>For those around them, it\u2019s also the end of an era. \u201cAs long as I can remember, it\u2019s been \u2018Bruce and Dennis\u2019, you know? You can\u2019t replace that overnight,\u201d says Matthew Richardson. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s irreplaceable really. Not many Dennis Cometti\u2019s come along in broadcasting. I guess it\u2019s like a superstar footballer. They only come along once in a while. I guess it\u2019s going to be the same with Dennis and that\u2019s the challenge \u2013 finding that chemistry up in the box when he does retire.\u201d</p> <p>The only time Cometti seems anything other than comfortable in his decision to call it quits is when he discusses Bruce. \u201cHe is certainly the thing I will miss most from broadcasting footy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure it for the rest of my life. I envy my replacement in that regard.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019</h2> <p>As his final game approaches, Cometti is at pains to point something out: he\u2019s not quitting football broadcasting per se, he is just retiring from travelling. \u201cThe weekend before last I had three games in three states,\u201d he says. \u201cNow a man of my advancing years can\u2019t be doing that too often.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI just feel that now I\u2019m not enjoying it because of the travel. Once I\u2019m at the ground and being with Bruce and watching the game, and Hamish and Basil on Sundays, it\u2019s terrific. It\u2019s really good fun. I\u2019ve met some great people along the way, and that\u2019s all good and well, but at the same time you think \u2018I\u2019m starting to punish myself now\u2019. At my age it\u2019s probably not the time to be taking the punishment.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been mooted that he wouldn\u2019t mind calling some local games. \u201cI could wander down to the WAFL and just sit in on the telecast,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d like that. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, because not many go to the WAFL, but that\u2019s where my youth is. I\u2019m sort of mired back in the 50s and 60s\u201d. But he\u2019s not so keen on learning nine new team lists and says \u201cit\u2019s all up in the air\u201d for now. </p> <p>\u201cI could see myself being an \u2018expert\u2019 in inverted commas,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs a failed coach I\u2019m perfectly credentialed to do that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/the-joy-of-six-afl-player-coach-feuds\">The Joy of Six: AFL player-coach feuds | Russell Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Either way Cometti will continue his association with Seven, doing some blogging and filling the odd gap for Western Australian events. His mood after the grand final, he thinks, will depend on how his call has gone. \u201cIf I thought the broadcast has gone well, I\u2019ll probably have a little elation after the grand final, you know, that you got through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made the choice and I\u2019m comfortable with it. I\u2019m looking forward to the game, but I\u2019m also looking forward to the Sunday night after it when I go out for dinner. I dunno what that tells me. I\u2019ll be happy with the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Cometti is also happy for fans to remember him at his peak, rather than hanging on too long. \u201cA lot of people are talking to me now, saying that it might be a Johnny Farnham retirement,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI use the analogy that sooner or later, if you stay out long enough, forget about Johnny Farnham, you become Meatloaf. So we don\u2019t want to do that either.\u201d</p> <p>And that is more or less that. Though not quite. Just when I think I\u2019m done sifting over Dennis Cometti\u2019s life in broadcasting and finished speaking to the people who\u2019ve sat beside him along the way, a phone call arrives one morning from the man himself. Our conversation has stirred a memory in him and his effort to call back and share it seems revealing of his professional generosity.</p> <p>At this stage Greater Western Sydney are still a decent shot of making their first AFL grand final, and with that in mind Dennis has remembered an anecdote he thinks would work perfectly. In 2011, before the Giants had played a single league game, Cometti was receiving a tour of their training facilities when then-assistant coach Mark Williams roped him into giving the fledgling club\u2019s young players a pep talk. </p> <p>He hadn\u2019t thought of it again until earlier this season when he bumped into Williams again, and the coach thought Cometti would get a kick out of knowing that the Giants had picked a choice phrase out of the motivational spiel and had it plastered over their locker room walls: \u201cYou can go back to the place but not to the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Support our journalism with a <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/au/supporter?INTCMP=mem_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">monthly</a> or <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com/au?INTCMP=co_au_editorial_cometti_footer\">one-off</a> contribution to Guardian Australia</p>",

His film in question, Elle, does star Isabelle Huppert, one of the most celebrated actors of all time - but the thriller, about a steely businesswoman caught in a game of cat and mouse with her rapist, refuses to tone down the director\u2019s confrontational style. In France, where the film opened in May following its debut at the Cannes film festival, there was nary a hint of controversy. That\u2019s likely to change when Elle arrives on these shores on 11 November.</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that instead of going with Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s Frantz, a period war drama that plays more to the Academy\u2019s often cautious sensibilities, France went for this year\u2019s most button-pushing Cannes selection (each country can only nominate a single film). Verhoeven, who is from the Netherlands, has made fewer films than Ozon over the course of his career, but he\u2019s indisputably better known, and his film higher profile \u2013 all of which highlights a trend that\u2019s emerged in this year\u2019s race for the foreign award.</p> <p>Frequent competitors - such as France, Spain, Iran, South Korea and Chile - have opted to bank on festival favorites from directors with significant art-house clout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30343203ae80027a29a987330a2bfeb3d0681579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30343203ae80027a29a987330a2bfeb3d0681579/74_0_2252_1351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s pony, Julieta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s pony, Julieta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As tried-and-tested as this method of attack sounds, it\u2019s in fact not a given occurrence.

With Spain\u2019s decision to support his latest melodrama, Julieta, that tally has now grown to six. It marks the first time Almod\u00f3var\u2019s been nominated by his country since 2006\u2019s Volver, despite the fact his fans in Spain largely shunned the drama, resulting in smaller-than-average homespun numbers for the prolific director. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis\">Fire at Sea review \u2013 masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similar to Spain, Italy doesn\u2019t seem too concerned with box office clout, having chosen Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s refugee-crisis-themed documentary Fire at Sea over some of the country\u2019s splashier, star-driven output.

What seems to matter for Spain, however, is that the film has a proven hit at festivals, having won the Golden Bear at the Berlin international film festival (a rare feat for a documentary) and garnered acclaim at several more.</p> <p>Germany and Chile have followed suit, placing their hopes in Maren Ade\u2019s Cannes favorite Toni Erdmann and Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s festival darling Neruda, respectively. Ade isn\u2019t as established as the bulk of directors vying for the prize, having helmed four features prior to the family comedy, but as many critics would wager, Toni Erdmann is distinctive enough to warrant her the auteur moniker.</p> <p>The same goes for Larra\u00edn, who is in the midst of a remarkable run this year, having premiered Neruda, his metafictional portrait of the celebrated poet and politician Pablo Neruda, at Cannes, followed mere months later by the debut of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk\">Jackie</a> at Venice.

  "<p>Polly Toynbee assumes few people understand Labour\u2019s parlous national electoral situation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-2016\" title=\"\">The truth hurts. No&#xa0;wonder Corbynites block their ears</a>, 27 September). However, it is clear to most, given the Scottish referendum, the recent general election and the referendum on Europe that Labour faces defeat in the next general election, whether the party is led by Jeremy Corbyn or not. The danger is that a loss will be seen as a consequence of his leadership, while the underlying problems will go unattended. For support Toynbee\u2019s article refers to \u201cA solid old [Labour] councillor from Sunderland\u201d who says that people are turning away from Labour and will not vote again for Labour \u201cwhile Corbyn\u2019s the leader\u201d.</p> <p>It is disingenuous (or a logical slip?) not to acknowledge that the \u201cturning away from Labour\u201d (often to Ukip) occurred when Corbyn was not leader. It follows, surely, that the effects of economic and social exclusion \u2013 with the perceived negative corollary of immigration \u2013 is at the heart of such disaffection. Much of which is arguably the co-responsibility of previous \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d supporters within Labour and the persuasive power money can buy to promote the current ideological climate.<br><strong>Edwin Prevost</strong><br><em>Matching Tye, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 What Polly Toynbee and other supporters of the parliamentary Labour party have failed to pick up on is that the policies of the past have failed to deliver. Labour have now lost two elections in which their policy offer was designed to appeal to moderate Tory voters. Whatever may be said about Labour\u2019s policy offer at the last election, it was intended not to frighten the middle England horses. Radical policies such as rail nationalisation were rejected in favour of a meaningless compromise measure. All governments since 1990 have followed John Major\u2019s policy lead of offering a mix of right-of-centre economic policies with left-of-centre social policies. The past 26 years have demonstrated the failure of this policy as the social divide within the country has worsened and economic policy has become one failure after another. Interest rates are at rock bottom levels because the economy is so fragile that any moderate increase would tip it into recession and perhaps worse. Yet politicians on both sides of the parliamentary divide want to continue to espouse the same old failed policies.</p> <p>While the majority of Labour MPs will find it impossible to support the \u201cprogressive politics\u201d of Jeremy Corbyn, they can still contribute to the progressive politics of this country by uniting with their ideological soulmates in the Osbornite faction of the Conservative party to prevent a hard Brexit and the damage it would inflict on the social and economic fabric of the UK.<br><strong>Derrick Joad</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee writes of a councillor who claims that the new members in his constituency aren\u2019t getting involved in canvassing. In my ward in south-east London, many of us who have been out canvassing in the last few elections are new members. If her councillor\u2019s experience is more representative than mine, as it may be, we need to persuade the new membership to get out and campaign. I don\u2019t believe that condemning them as naive is going to do that.<br><strong>Giles Barrett</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Has the split threatening the Labour Party reached the Guardian?

The steady tramp of yesteryear has long demonstrated that the judgment of Karl Marx was fatally flawed, both economically and politically.

Perhaps not, but he seems to be oblivious to the arguments from many academics, commentators and politicians of every stripe that good government is dependent on a strong opposition who will challenge the governing party\u2019s ideas; and that a strong opposition will not emerge from a divided party. Therefore, if we are to have good government from this Conservative party, there needs to be a strong Labour opposition. That will not happen should the party lack unity.

But the climate is changing, and the question now is whether what\u2019s down there is going to stay down there.\u201d</p> <p>The study suggests it is not.</p> <p>Project Iceworm, presented to the US chiefs of staff in 1960, aimed to use Camp Century\u2019s frozen tunnels to test the feasibility of a huge launch site under the ice, close enough to fire nuclear missiles directly at the Soviet Union.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc1b9b5ff13ffe8f99fbe61cb4b9eb6ecddebf93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1b9b5ff13ffe8f99fbe61cb4b9eb6ecddebf93/0_0_3398_5146/660.jpg\" alt=\"Nuclear waste tank\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crane positions Camp Century\u2019s nuclear waste tank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W Robert Moore/National Geographic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the height of the cold war, as the US and the USSR were engaged in a terrifying standoff over the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, the US army was considering the construction of a vast subterranean extension of Camp Century.</p> <p>A system of about 4,000 kilometres of icy underground tunnels and chambers extending over an area around three times the size of Denmark were to have housed 600 ballistic missiles in clusters six kilometres apart, trained on Moscow and its satellites.</p> <p>Eventually the engineers realised Iceworm would not work. The constantly moving ice was too unstable and would have deformed and perhaps even collapsed the tunnels.</p> <p>From 1964 Camp Century was used only intermittently, and three years later it was abandoned altogether, the departing soldiers taking the reaction chamber of the nuclear generator with them.</p> <p>They left the rest of the camp\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 and its biological, chemical and radioactive waste \u2013 where it was, on the assumption it would be \u201cpreserved for eternity\u201d by the perpetually accumulating snow and ice.</p> <p>Thus far their assumption has proven correct. Up to 12 metres deep at the time it was abandoned, the ice covering Camp Century has since thickened to around 35 metres and will continue to deepen for a while yet.</p> <p>Climate change, however, looks certain to reverse that process, Colgan and his six-strong team from Canadian, US and European universities said in their report, which was published last month in Geophysical Research Letters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/camp_century-zip/giv-1406fZI2VlU9wqJq/\" data-alt=\"Camp Century graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/camp_century-zip/giv-1406fZI2VlU9wqJq/\">Camp Century graphic</a> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/06/10/greenland-witnessed-its-highest-june-temperature-ever-recorded-on-thursday/\">Greenland\u2019s temperatures broke new records this spring and summer</a>, hitting 24C (75F) in the capital, Nuuk, in June \u2013 a figure that shocked meteorologists so much they had to recheck their measurements.</p> <p>Between 2003 and 2010, the ice that covers much of the island melted twice as fast as during the whole of the 20th century. This year it began melting a month earlier than usual.</p> <p><a href=\"https://news.agu.org/press-release/melting-ice-sheet-could-release-frozen-cold-war-era-waste/\">The researchers studied US army documents and drawings</a> to work out how deep the camp and its waste \u2013 estimated to include 200,000 litres of diesel fuel, similar quantities of waste water and unknown amounts of radioactive coolant and toxic organic pollutants such as PCBs \u2013 were buried.</p> <p>Then they ran regional and global climate change simulations to work out how much longer they would remain interred. Based on the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d climate change scenario, Colgan said, snowfall would continue to be greater than ice melt for a few more decades. \u201cBut after that, melt will be greater than snow. Every year, another layer of ice will be removed. Our estimate is that by 2090, the exposure will be irreversible. It could happen sooner if the magnitude of climate change accelerates.\u201d</p> <p>Once that starts to happen, the question of who is responsible for the clear-up \u2013 already the subject of discussion \u2013 will become more pressing, the report said, presenting \u201can entirely new form of political dispute resulting from climate change\u201d.<br></p> <p>With no established agreement on the question, the report says the \u201cmultinational, multi-generational\u201d problem posed by Camp Century and its waste could become a source of tension between the US, Greenland and Denmark.</p> <p>Denmark allowed the US to build Camp Century and other bases on Greenland in a 1951 agreement, but it is not clear how much it was told about the work being done there or the waste left behind. Complicating matters further, Greenland became largely self-governing in 1979.</p> <p>Vittus Qujaukitsoq, Greenland\u2019s foreign minister, said he was concerned about the camp\u2019s future and determined to establish responsibility. His Danish counterpart, Kristian Jensen, has said the issue was being examined in close contact with Greenland.</p> <p>The Pentagon has said it \u201cacknowledges the reality of climate change and the risk it poses\u201d for Greenland, adding that the US government has pledged to \u201cwork with the Danish government and the Greenland authorities to settle questions of mutual security\u201d.</p>",

I\u2019m sorry it has taken a while to post a summary, but Labour were slow sending out the transcript. Anyway, it\u2019s worth it. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Watson warned Labour against \u201ctrashing\u201d the record of the Blair and Brown governments. </strong>In a comment clearly aimed at some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supports, which received strong applause, Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t know why we\u2019ve been focusing on what was wrong with the Blair and Brown governments for the last six years, but trashing our own record is not the way to enhance our brand. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He told Labour not to treat capitalism as the enemy.</strong> This passage seemed to be aimed at some on the Corbyn wing of the party too.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the past, big businesses were too easily cast as predators. We meant to say that we would stand up to the abuse of corporate power as the Tories never will. But we ended up sounding like we were anti-business; anti-prosperity; anti-success. We\u2019re not and we never have been. Capitalism, comrades, is not the enemy. Money\u2019s not the problem. Business isn\u2019t bad. The real world is more complicated than that, as any practical trade unionist will tell you. Businesses are where people work. The private sector\u2019s what generates the money to pay for our schools and hospitals.</p> <p>We can afford the best health service in the world because we are one of the most prosperous countries in the world. That\u2019s a fact and we forget it at our peril. And I don\u2019t say this because it\u2019s what wins elections, I say it because it is true. And people know that it\u2019s true. And that\u2019s why it wins elections. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he expected an early general election.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a general election soon. The more often Theresa May says it won\u2019t happen, the more certain I am that it will. And, comrades, we need to be ready.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour could win a general election by building on its achievements in local government.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We owe the British people - our people - an alternative to a government that doesn\u2019t care and a Prime Minster they didn\u2019t vote for. You keep hearing that Labour can\u2019t win, well we can, and we will. And I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re going to win: we\u2019re going to win through local government because that\u2019s how we always win.</p> <p>Our councillors are the engine of Labour\u2019s electoral machine. It\u2019s Labour councilors all over the country who are our leaders and ambassadors in local communities. Our councillors and our trade unions: these are the rocks our movement\u2019s built on.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He lavished praise on Labour\u2019s leaders in local government and in the Wales. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a champion [Sadiq Khan] is. What an outstanding representative of our great national capital and our historic socialist party - still relevant, resonant, and winning elections in one of the most dynamic cities on earth.</p> <p>And in Bristol we have got marvellous Marvin, who you have just heard from.</p> <p>What a hero. And in our other great conurbations next May: Andy Burnham,</p> <p>Si\u00f4n Simon and Steve Rotherham are going to follow Sadiq\u2019s and Marvin\u2019s example. And Carwyn in Wales. Reminding people what Labour government looks like - how innovative and radical we can be. How growth and prosperity, social justice and fairness all go hand in hand under Labour. And not just doing the right thing - not just compassion - but doing the thing right. Competence.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson\u2019s comments about people like Sadiq Khan and Marvin Rees contrasted strongly with what he had to say about Jeremy Corbyn. He praised Corbyn\u2019s performance at the last PMQs, when he attacked Theresa May over grammar schools, but otherwise his praise for Corbyn was conspicuous by its absence.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed his plan to set up an independent commission on the future of work.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the next Labour government we must judge ourself on our ability to redraw that pie-chart. The problems of inequality aren\u2019t new, but the solutions will need to be. So I\u2019ve put together an independent commission on the future of work, to start influencing policy right now - from opposition.</p> <p>It will be chaired by Helen Mountfield QC, joined by a world-class team including Naomi Climer, the first ever female President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Professor Michael Sandel, Jon Cruddas, Lord Jim Knight and many more. We\u2019ll feed into Jon Trickett\u2019s work on building a targeted Industrial Strategy and we\u2019ll report back to you next year.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that the Tories only cared about money and power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the real British values the Tories can never understand; of compassion and fairness alongside enterprise and fierce independence. This is no nation of ideologues. We know that and that\u2019s our advantage over the Tories.</p> <p>They\u2019re blinded by money and power. It\u2019s all they care about. And the old lady next door; and your neighbour\u2019s children; and that migrant family working 60 hours a week and paying taxes: all these can go hang to the Tories. Other people don\u2019t matter. Well that\u2019s not the British way.</p> <p>Yes, British people want a fair chance for themselves and their families. They want their hard work rewarded. But they also care what happens to the other children in the class, the other people at the bus stop, the others in the lengthening queues waiting months now for life-saving operations.</p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/181b4c82c43cd25ac24fb55be3bcc8dc1d1cbc1f/0_255_4954_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson addressing the Labour conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T17:15:23.596Z\">at 6.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8fdee4b08ca277ca0c28\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T16:09:03.464Z\">5.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jeremy Corbyn's interviews - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>has done a round of interviews with broadcasters this afternoon. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said he would hold a shadow cabinet reshuffle next week.</strong> It would not be this week, he said, but it would come before parliament resumes a week on Monday.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will be appointing ahead of the return of Parliament to ensure that we have an effective shadow cabinet. We are filling the positions, but we are not announcing anything this week. It is all going to come later on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Corbyn also hinted that the reshuffle might not involve filling all 60-odd vacant frontbench jobs. He said he would \u201cdevelop a team of the size that we need\u201d. But there is no absolute requirement for the shadow ministerial team to be as large as it was. In the past oppositions have functioned with fewer shadow ministers than they normally have now.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed that \u201clots\u201d of MPs would return to the front bench. </strong>\u201cLots of MPs are coming back,\u201d he said.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He restated his opposition to bringing back full shadow cabinet elections. </strong>Asked if he would agree to them, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn\u2019t vote for it.

No child should be left out or left behind. </p> <p>Conference, Tony Blair talked about education, education, education. Theresa May wants segregation, segregation, segregation. And our Labour Party will fight it, starting on Saturday when we launch our nationwide campaign against more grammar schools. We\u2019re going to take the fight to the Tories and I appeal to all my MP colleagues to help lead this fight.

Flynn, a leftwinger, has spent most of his career on the backbenches as a member of the awkward squad but he was appointed to the shadow cabinet in the summer when the resignations happened. Flynn doubles up as shadow Welsh secretary and shadow leader of the Commons. His promotion was all the more remarkable because he is 81.</p> <p>Flynn started with a joke about his age. He was speaking as a \u201cgrateful recipient of Jeremy\u2019s job creation scheme for geriatrics\u201d, he said. But his speech, which he delivered in his capacity as shadow leader of the Commons, contained some strong lines.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn appealed to the Labour MPs who resigned from the front bench to return.</strong> He said he disagreed with Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, who gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/26/labour-conference-john-mcdonnell-speech-says-labour-will-run-interventionist-government-politics-live?page=with:block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac#block-57e92dc5e4b01a7059fc9dac\">a speech yesterday saying the \u201cmerchants of doom\u201d should quit. </a>Flynn said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Len McCluskey made a speech for unity yesterday but there is one phrase in it - the one that he stole from Shakespeare - that I must disagree with, because he did say \u2018some should depart the field\u2019. No, no, no.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got some of our best people sitting on the subs bench, you don\u2019t score goals from the subs bench. Some resigned, they all did for honourable reasons. It took courage for many of them to resign, it\u2019s going to take greater courage for many of them to come back and we must make it possible for them to return with dignity and respect.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Labour should abandon negativity.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the last 12 months we\u2019ve been locked in a gap year of negativity, of pessimism, of hopelessness, by many in our party. It seemed at times a competition to see who could be the most pessimistic about our future and our prospects - we\u2019ve got to end that. It\u2019s time to now to give unity a chance. Take all the bile and the hatred together, put it in a box, bury it deep underground, put six feet of concrete on top and then put a sign saying \u2018never should the last 12 months be unearthed from its dishonest grave\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn insisted that Labour could win. To back his point, he recalled helping out during the 1945 general election campaign with his brother. He was only 10 at the time, but he remembers his mother telling him he was wasting his time. She told him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, boys, you are on the right side, it\u2019s the Labour party, it\u2019s our party, but this candidate cannot win because of prejudice. You cannot win in Wales as a candidate if you\u2019ve got an Irish name. And no one called Jim Callaghan has any future in politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Callaghan was elected MP for Cardiff South in 1945, and of course went on to become prime minister.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn claimed that Labour had enjoyed \u201cmarvellous results\u201d in elections over the last year.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The trouble with unity is that it is not sexy. The media, the press, are not interested in it. They are interested in rows, they are interested in division, they are interested in conflict. But they don\u2019t notice the brilliant year we\u2019ve had: magnificent election results. Instead of the polls, look at what happens when real people use real votes in real elections. Marvellous results in all the mayoral elections, in all the byelections. In Wales we gained three parliamentary seats that we lost a year ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn seems to be using the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d rather loosely. For a more accurate assessment of Labour\u2019s electoral record over the last year, read <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9749\">this UK Polling Report blog by Anthony Wells.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Flynn mocked David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Daily Mail, of all people, described his honours list as devalued, debased, discredited, egregious, grubby, tawdry, tainted, tarnished - otherwise alright. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said Britain needed \u201croot and branch reform of our democracy\u201d.</strong> But reform needed to happen by cross-party agreement, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only House in the world where we have chieftains, hereditary chieftains in parliament, is ourselves and Lesotho.

It was a tribute to the way, during the London mayoral campaign, Khan relentlessly and unashamedly kept going on about his upbringing at every opportunity. It worked, because there is not a soul in London who does not know what Khan\u2019s dad did for a living. Khan is someone who understands the importance of repetition.</p> <p>But this speech took the art of repetition to a whole new level. At times it was veering into self-parody. Essentially, almost every sentence was about how Labour can only achieve things if it is \u201cin power\u201d. It certainly wasn\u2019t subtle, and some will accuse him of overkill, but if Khan\u2019s only concern was to get his message across, then it was certainly effective.</p> <p>And what was the message? Khan backed Owen Smith in the leadership contest because he thought Jeremy Corbyn could not win an election. He explained his thinking in an Observer article. In his speech today Khan did not criticise Corbyn directly, and he specifically said that the leadership issue was settled. But he did not retract anything he said during the summer. His focus on the importance of Labour being able to win elections to get things down could be seen as a firm reminder to Corbyn that he will be judged by electoral performance, but it sounded more as if Khan was advertising his own credentials as an election winner. He seemed to be putting down a marker for the future, signalling that if Labour needs an election-winner when the Corbyn era is over, Khan will be available.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Khan said Labour should focus on winning power.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the election this summer the leadership of our party has now been decided and I congratulate Jeremy on his clear victory. Now it\u2019s time for us all to work together towards the greatest prize: getting Labour back into power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that Labour was in power in local government and in Wales, if not at Westminster.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour in power, Britain is a fairer country - a more equal country and a more just country. And Labour is in power right now - not just in London but in Wales too. Labour re-elected with the First Minister, Carwyn Jones, and in Bristol with the new Mayor, Marvin Rees. Labour is in power right now in Liverpool, Manchester and Southampton; in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cambridge; in Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds and Cardiff too.</p> <p>Labour is in power in towns and cities the length and breadth of Britain. And Conference, where Labour is in power it\u2019s thanks to your hard work. Thanks to Labour members, activists and supporters. Thanks to the trade unions and the working people they represent. Thanks to the Labour staff who work so hard for us.<br></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explained why being in power was so important.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With Labour out of power, the number of affordable new homes built falls, the cost of rent rockets, and the number of homeless people sleeping on our streets rises. But it\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can make tackling the housing crisis our number one priority; we can create new teams like Homes for Londoners, to get more genuinely affordable homes built; or a new social letting scheme to stop renters being ripped off; we can enact new policies like the London Living Rent to put home ownership back within reach for our young people; and we can make tackling homelessness and rough sleeping a real priority - because it\u2019s a stain on our great nation.</p> <p>Most of the speech consisted of Khan making this point again and again, but applying it to issues like housing, air pollution, social integration, inequality, education, Brexit and the public services.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He stressed that EU citizens in Britain are welcome.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d like to take a moment to speak to the European citizens living across Britain, and who make a huge contribution to our NHS, schools, on construction sites and in business: you make a massive contribution to our country; economically, socially and culturally. Thank you. Thank you for all that you do to make our country great.

In the Conservative Party, where the overthrow of leaders is an art form nurtured and treasured over two centuries, we would never have made this error. The rule of thumb is that it takes a good two years for a party to despair even of a very unsuccessful leader. By jumping the natural starting gun, the moderates left some Labour members able to say that their leader was still new and hadn\u2019t been given a chance.</p> <p>Third, that premature challenge was not spearheaded by a real alternative. Owen Smith was not only unprepared for the fight but offered merely a less doctrinaire version of Corbyn himself, rather than a different vision of Labour\u2019s future. Thus the central argument about the whole direction of the party was never fought out, and the leadership election actually shifted the terms of Labour\u2019s debates further to the Left.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ironically, on one point at least, Hague\u2019s analysis is identical to John McDonnell\u2019s. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/07/watch-john-mcdonnell-labels-labour-rebels-fing-useless\">McDonnell famously said the Labour plotters had been \u201cfucking useless\u201d.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/labour-remains-stuck-as-the-world-moves-on-5zc6v0wdx\">Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says Labour as a party is out of touch with modern Britain.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that Labour\u2019s biggest problem is not Mr Corbyn himself but the fact that the world has moved on and the party has not. Although its battles are conducted on Twitter and Facebook, it is still an analogue organisation in a digital age. Even its name looks like an anachronism. This is a party of \u201cthe workers\u201d, which grew out of the trade union movement but which has failed spectacularly to understand that the nature of work has changed over the past 30 years.</p> <p>The number of self-employed people is predicted to overtake public sector workers by 2018 as the internet transforms the way business is done. About 16 per cent of people in this country now work for themselves \u2014 up from 8.7 per cent in 1975 \u2014 and it\u2019s a trend that will only accelerate with the rise of automation.</p> <p>The self-employed will be an ever more powerful economic and political force, but Labour has nothing to say to these voters. Its policies on full employment or workers\u2019 rights are irrelevant to them and its statist solutions are likely to be anathema to this instinctively individualistic group. These are not all thrusting entrepreneurs setting out to become millionaires by setting up their own companies.

Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish leader, and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh leader, are both seen as opponents of Jeremy Corbyn, and Corbynites fear this rule change will result in the anti-Corbyn faction on the NEC getting too extra votes. Currently Corbyn has a small majority on the NEC on some issues, but it is finally balanced. The Corbynites wanted the new Scottish and Welsh NEC representatives to be chosen by party members, which would probably have led to Corbyn supporters being elected.</p> <p>But some of the other changes are quite significant. Here is a full list of what they are.</p> <p>1 - Clarification that a sitting leader does not need to be nominated by 20% of MPs and MEPs to stand in a leadership election if challenged. This change is being introduced because the current rules are ambiguous. Labour\u2019s NEC decided that Corbyn could stand in the leadership contest without getting fresh nominations, but because the rules were not 100% clear, a Labour member took the party to court in an unsuccessful attempt to get that decision overturned.</p> <p>2 - Clarification of for how long someone needs to have paid affiliation fees to attend a CLP AGM (60 days).</p> <p>3 - Tightening of rules allowing the party to exclude people convicted of serious offences from joining, to include people subject to rulings from civil courts relating to their behaviour. This is intended to ensure Labour can exclude people who might be a threat to children but who have not been convicted of a criminal offence.</p> <p>4 - Giving the national women\u2019s conference a formal role in policy making.</p> <p>5 - Toughening up penalties for Labour groups that do not follow gender balance rules.</p> <p>6 - Banning Labour councillors from voting for an illegal budget.</p> <p>7 - Obliging Labour mayors and police and crime commissioners to report to Labour organisations and conferences.</p> <p>8 - Changing the way Labour councillors pay a levy to the party.</p> <p>9 - Adding two members to the NEC, a frontbench member of the Scottish parliament nominated by the Scottish leader and a frontbench member of the Welsh assembly nominated by the Welsh leader.</p> <p>10 - Allowing the Scottish and Welsh leaders to attend the Clause 5 meetings that determine the party\u2019s election manifesto.</p> <p>11- Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of deciding their own Westminster candidates.</p> <p>12 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of candidates for the devolved bodies.</p> <p>13 - Putting the Scottish and Welsh executives in charge of setting rules for the selection of council candidates in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>14 - Formalising the posts of Scottish deputy leader and Welsh deputy leader.</p> <p>15 - Formalising the new rule changes affecting Scotland and Wales.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3af8e4b0a785ec48be49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:26:16.660Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the Labour conference <strong>Andy Kerr</strong>, a member of the national executive committee, is now opening the main debate on the proposed national executive committee rule changes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3609e4b08ee6d0d2f3b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:08:50.120Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paddy Lillis</strong>, the NEC chair who is chairing this morning\u2019s session, called a vote on a show of hands on whether to agree a \u201creference back\u201d so that delegates could vote on all 15 proposed rule changes separately. There were loud protests when he did not agree a card vote, but Lillis said there was a clear majority against a reference back. <strong>Manuel Cortes</strong>, the TSSA general secretary who proposed a reference back, then came to the stage to protest, saying party rules said there should be a card vote. Lillis over-ruled him, saying it was clear from the show of hands who won.</p> <p>Now that\u2019s over it is seems certain that the proposed rule changes will be agreed quite comfortably.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea3157e4b08ee6d0d2f3ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:47:54.506Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour conference has opened, and there will be a debate on the proposed changes to party rules (including giving Scotland and Wales a seat on the national executive committee). But, being the Labour party, at first they are having a debate about who to hold the vote. Labour HQ wants a single \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 vote on all 15 proposed rule changes. But some delegates are now arguing for individual votes on each measure.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea2cdee4b0a785ec48be11\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:42:50.062Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour conference backs call for possible referendum on final Brexit deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There were not many policy issues that divided Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith during the leadership contest but one was Europe. Corbyn said the party should accept the Brexit vote, and focus on getting the best possible deal. Smith said that any final deal should be put to the public, in a second referendum or a general election, and that he would like the UK to stay in the EU.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Labour party conference has backed the Owen Smith position. There has not been a formal debate on Brexit at the conference, but yesterday\u2019s economy debate included various composite motions on employment rights, including one proposed by the TSSA union. It was passed unanimously, and no one paid much attention to the detail, but it included a line saying the UK should retain the option of staying in the EU.</p> <p>Here is the key passage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Conference] recognises that many of those who voted to leave the EU were expressing dissatisfaction with EU or national policy and were voting for change, but believes that unless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should therefore be subject to approval, through parliament and potentially through a general election, or a referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>In practice, the significance of this is limited. According to party officials, the fact that the composite was passed does not mean that demanding a possible second referendum is now official party policy. Instead the motion will feed into the national policy forum policy-making process. And in practice Corbyn\u2019s election victory means he has a mandate for his \u2018it\u2019s settled\u2019 position.</p> <p>But the fact that conference has passed this motion will embolden those Labour MPs, like Smith, who are demanding a second referendum. And if the Commons ever ends up voting on amendments to Brexit legislation demanding a second referendum, as seems inevitable, Labour MPs will be able to use composite 1 as justification for backing those amendments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T09:00:22.322Z\">at 10.00am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea1520e4b0a785ec48bdb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T08:05:22.315Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labour does not feature much on the newspaper front pages this morning although, given<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> </a>the splash headline on one of the few papers that does lead on Labour, Jeremy Corbyn may consider that a blessing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tuesday&#39;s Daily Mail front page:<br>Labour in la-la-land<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tomorrowspaperstoday?src=hash\">#tomorrowspaperstoday</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bbcpapers?src=hash\">#bbcpapers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hjgkCbCMOs\">pic.twitter.com/hjgkCbCMOs</a></p>&mdash; Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\">September 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can read how the Mail explains its headline<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/780517261501198336\"> here.</a></p> <p>Our coverage is rather different. You can read most of our conference stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">here.</a></p> <p>In the past Tuesday at Labour conference has always been the day of the leader\u2019s speech, but this year Jeremy Corbyn is doing what most other party leaders do and using his keynote speech to close the conference. The advantage of this arrangement, for all political leaders, is that the speech gets reported in full, but the media can\u2019t then spend the next 24 hours prowling the conference finding party members to slag it off. Instead Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, gets to take the Tuesday afternoon slot.</p> <p>Here is a round-up of the overnight Labour conference stories.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, will say that the party must develop policies to stop automation harming workers.</strong> Announcing the launch of an independent commission into the future of work, Watson will highlight research saying that more than a third of workers think their job security will be harmed by automation, while a fifth think it will hit their wages. He will tell the conference:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>New automated technologies are fusing with the internet, and creating models of work and jobs we haven\u2019t seen before. Daily we hear stories of machines and systems that can do things we thought only humans could do - driving cars, drafting contracts, even composing music. </p> <p>It\u2019s been called the fourth industrial revolution - a new era of fast, technology-driven change, which we\u2019re beginning to feel in everything we do. </p> <p>And it\u2019s uncertain because it isn\u2019t yet fulfilling its potential to change working lives for the good - we aren\u2019t seeing it. Too many people whose grandparents were trade unionists with secure jobs are now working 60-hour weeks, below the minimum wage, without any support from a union. The dark side of the gig economy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Diane Abbott, the shadow health secretary, will tell the conference in her speech later that Labour will rescue the NHS.</strong> She will unveil various proposals, including: focusing more on public health and preventative health care; prioritising mental health services; and ending \u201cdamaging\u201d competition and marketisation in the NHS, \u201cremoving the private sector where it is ripping-off the NHS\u201d.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, will tell the conference in his speech that the party must focus on winning power</strong>. Saying that the leadership issue is now settled (Khan backed Owen Smith, not Corbyn), he will say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s only with Labour in power that we can create a fairer, more equal and more just Britain.</p> <p>Labour out of power will never, ever be good enough ... The people who need us the most are those who suffer the most when Labour is not in power.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, will say every parent should have the right to quality, afforable childcare <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37475733\">in her speech to the conferrence. </a></strong>She will announce a review of childcare provision and early-years education. She will say:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our aim will be to provide the care and support for every child to fulfil their potential, and to help parents back to work. Getting it right will improve the life chances of countless children across the country. That must be our mission.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Newsnight last night that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/jeremy-corbyn-puts-aside-objections-to-renewing-trident\">despite Clive Lewis\u2019s speech yesterday signalling that Corbyn will not try to overturn Labour\u2019s pro-Trident policy,</a> the policy could still be changed.</strong> McDonnell said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Lewis\u2019s] view is that the matter has been decided for the time being.

  "<p>The children\u2019s commissioners for England and France have called on the French government to identify, register and house the 1,000 lone asylum-seeking children who are living in dire conditions in the Calais camp, \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d before the site is demolished.</p> <p>After President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced that the refugee camp would be shut down and asylum seekers moved to official centres around the country, charities said they were concerned about the safety of the unaccompanied child refugees, who make up about 10% of the camp population.</p> <p>Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, said that while she supported the French government\u2019s decision to close the camp, \u201cthis needs to be done in a properly planned way so that children currently there are protected from harm and do not disappear from the radar of the agencies or try to make the dangerous trip across the Channel in the back of a lorry\u201d.</p> <p>When parts of the camp were demolished earlier this year, 129 children went missing. \u201cWe know that papers were destroyed and homes were torn down, support networks ripped up,\u201d Longfield said. </p> <p>She criticised the French government\u2019s failure to provide homes for the unaccompanied children over the past year as the site expanded rapidly. \u201cI do feel angry with the French for not protecting the children that are there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is horrific. Children are clearly at immense risk \u2013 both if they stay in the camp, at risk from traffickers, and are exposed to immense dangers if they try to get on a train or a lorry.\u201d</p> <p>She said she was shocked that the situation had been allowed to continue for so long. \u201cIt seems inconceivable that you would have that situation in England \u2013 hundreds of children living in the woods or without any protection. It is a dire situation. While they are in France, the French government has to protect them.\u201d</p> <p>The main<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/calais-refugee-children-abandoning-plans-to-reach-uk\"> French charity</a> working to house unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, <em>France terre d\u2019asile</em>, said last week that it was turning away 15-35 children a day because its centre was full.</p> <p>Longfield said she was concerned that the British government was not acting with sufficient urgency both in processing \u201cDublin III\u201d claims from children in Calais who had family in the UK and so had a legal right to travel here, and in implementing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\" draggable=\"true\">Dubs amendment</a>, under which it has commited to house an unspecified number of the estimated <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases/Unaccompanied-refugee-and-migrant-children-in-urgent-need-of-protection-warns-UNICEF/\" draggable=\"true\">90,000 vulnerable unaccompanied refugee</a> children currently in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThe British government has been very worried about encouraging more children to come to Calais. I think there is a point now where they have a responsibility to step up with the French government to ensure those children who can come here are helped to as swiftly as possible.\u201d </p> <p>She said the recent death of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/afghan-boy-killed-in-calais-in-attempt-to-climb-on-to-lorry-to-uk\" draggable=\"true\">14-year-old boy from Afghanistan</a> \u2013 he appeared to have had the right to be reunited with family in the UK but was killed in a hit and run as he tried to climb on a lorry to travel to England \u2013 could have been prevented if the legal processes had been faster.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tragedy. This was a child who could have been protected and wasn\u2019t. That has to be a responsibility for us all. There has to be a process that has urgency around it to get children here if they are eligible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Genevi\u00e8ve Avenard, France\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, said: \u201cIf the camp is cleared, the closure must comply with French law. Every child who is currently living there should be provided with appropriate accommodation so closure should not be enforced until the authorities have looked for genuine alternative accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>Avenard and Longfield were due to travel together on Wednesday to visit a reception centre in Dover for asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel, and where there are child-friendly facilities run by the Refugee Council. </p> <p>The children\u2019s commissioners\u2019 concerns were echoed by charities working with refugee children. \u201cBefore the bulldozers arrive, there must be robust plans to safeguard the hundreds of unaccompanied children currently stranded in the camp,\u201d said Unicef UK\u2019s deputy executive director, Lily Caprani. \u201cIf mistakes from the first eviction are repeated, we will see more children going missing, falling prey to traffickers and facing the winter without a home.\u201d</p> <p>Josie Naughton, the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\">Help Refugees</a>, said: \u201cThere are currently 1,022 children on their own in the Calais camp. These children need to be made a priority and adequate care needs to be provided for them.\u201d</p>",

That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u2019s open and US-dependent economy.</p> <p>In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u2013 and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u2013 to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile.</p> <p>But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8c6be4b04cbd30bc3a55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:12:59.937Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And maybe there isn\u2019t an oil deal after all:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HermsTheWord/status/780783664393314304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iran&#39;s Zanganeh emerges from meeting with Russia&#39;s Novak.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%.</p> <p>The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure. Iran could be targeting something closer to 4.5-5m barrels per day in output, making a freeze agreement unlikely this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is down 2.8% at $46.02 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has lost 2.94% to $44.58.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:10:45.383Z\">at 4.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea82a8e4b091b7fa2b5a3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:32:07.024Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Returning to the positive US consumer confidence figures, which seem to give more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.</strong> Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be delighted to see an above-expectations rise in consumer confidence for September, which follows on from an already strong August.</p> <p>Yellen was singled out for criticism by Donald Trump during last night\u2019s presidential debate, with the presidential hopeful accusing Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons.

Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u2019t switch off coupons, but it can\u2019t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u2019s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u2019s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u20ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u20ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u20ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit.</p> <p>The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario.

During the Scottish referendum campaign she was a regular critic of sexist abuse online and became a well-regarded advocate for women\u2019s concerns.

Tests on the wife showed that while she was healthy, about one-quarter of her mitochondria carried the genes for Leigh syndrome.<br></p> <p>When the couple approached Zhang for help, he decided to try the mitochondrial transfer procedure. He took the nucleus from one of the woman\u2019s eggs and inserted it into a healthy donor\u2019s egg that had had its own nucleus removed. He then fertilised the egg with the husband\u2019s sperm.<br></p> <p>The US team created five embryos but only one developed normally. This was implanted into the mother and the baby was born nine months later.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/feb/02/three-parent-babies-explained\">\u2018Three-parent\u2019 babies explained: what are the concerns and are they justified?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The baby is not the first child to be born with DNA from three people. In the 1990s, fertility doctors tried to boost the quality of women\u2019s eggs by injecting cytoplasm, the cellular material that contains mitochondria, from healthy donor eggs. The procedure led to several babies being born with DNA from the parents plus the healthy donor. Some of the children developed genetic disorders and the procedure was banned. </p> <p>Speaking about the latest case, Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cWithout much ado, it appears the first mitochondrial donation baby was born three months ago. This was an ice-breaker. The baby is reportedly healthy. Hopefully, this will tame the more zealous critics, accelerate the field, and we will witness soon the birth of the first mitochondrial donation baby in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>But some questions remained, he said. \u201cBy performing the treatment in Mexico, the team were not subject to the same stringent regulation as some other countries would insist on. We have no way of knowing how skilful or prepared they were, and this may have been a risky thing to do. </p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, we have what appears to be a healthy baby. Because it was successful, fewer questions will be raised, but it is important that we still ask them.<br></p> <p>\u201cWas this the first time ever they performed the technique or were there other attempts and they are reporting this one because it was successful? </p> <p>\u201cThis and other important questions remain unanswered because this work has not been published and the rest of the scientific community has been unable to examine it in detail. It\u2019s vital that that happens soon.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alison Murdoch, a fertility doctor at Newcastle University, said: \u201cIf this baby has been born as suggested then that would be great news. The translation of mitochondrial donation to a clinical procedure is not a race but a goal to be achieved with caution to ensure both safety and reproducibility.\u201d<br></p> <p>Details of the birth are due to be presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in Salt Lake City in October. <br></p> <p>Doug Turnbull, a neurology professor at Newcastle University who pioneered mitochondrial transfer in the UK, said the technique offered hope to mothers who carried mitochondrial DNA mutations. </p> <p>\u201cThere have been extensive discussions in the UK to ensure that families with mitochondrial disease get the best possible advice about their reproductive options and that any new IVF-based technique is appropriately regulated and funded.

  "<p>Bobby Breen, who has died aged 87, belongs on the long list of Hollywood child stars whose careers were terminated or blunted by adolescence. It was particularly poignant for the curly-haired, cherubic Breen because his fame resided mainly in his high, prepubescent singing voice. Rainbow on the River (1936) was perhaps his best-known film, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVaNaKd_ap0\" title=\"\">title song</a> also becoming his greatest hit on Decca records.</p> <p>From the age of eight to 11, from 1936 to 1939, Breen, under contract to RKO Pictures, starred in eight hit movies, almost rivalling Shirley Temple and Freddie Bartholomew in popularity. The modest semi-musicals were cleverly constructed vehicles that highlighted his clear, boy soprano tones and natural acting ability. Although all the characters he played had one parent or were orphans, Breen was a cheerful, spunky child, who avoided the saccharine elements usual in such portrayals (like, for example, those of Temple). Luckily, when his voice broke, he was not. He had made enough money from films to be able to explore other avenues, while staying in show business.</p> <p>He was born Isadore Borsuk in Montreal, the son of Hyman and Rebecca, poor Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. Soon after, the family, including his three older sisters, moved to Toronto. His sister Susan, a music student, noticed the boy\u2019s singing talent as early as the age of three. After lessons with her music teacher, he began to sing in public, winning prizes at competitions. By the age of six, little Isadore, who had become Bobby Breen, was singing in shows around the US. In New York, he enrolled in the Professional Children\u2019s School and got the part of Bob Hope\u2019s newsboy son in the Broadway musical Say When (1934).</p> <p>Finally landing in Hollywood, he appeared regularly on <a href=\"http://www.radioechoes.com/the-eddie-cantor-show\" title=\"\">Eddie Cantor\u2019s weekly radio show</a>. This led to the film producer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504344/\" title=\"\">Sol Lesser</a> offering him the starring role in Let\u2019s Sing Again (1936). In it, Breen joins a travelling circus run by an ex-operatic tenor (an Italian stereotype played by Henry Armetta), who hides the boy. One scene has Breen singing his benefactor to sleep with a lullaby, which leads to his being found by the father he thought dead.</p> <p>His debut film set the formula for all Breen\u2019s subsequent movies. Thus: Bobby is having problems at home or school so he runs away and is befriended and helped by an older man who falls for his personality and singing voice \u2013 a plot that could only be devised in more innocent times.</p> <p>The plots gave Breen time to burst into song at many appropriate moments, mostly in natural rather than theatrical settings. The songs were a mixture of operetta and operatic arias, and modern romantic ballads, though Breen was able to swing a tune from time to time.</p> <p>In Rainbow on the River, his second movie, Breen played a New Orleans boy raised by a former slave (Louise Beavers) after his parents died in the civil war, who has to move in with his stuffy Yankee relatives in New York. According to the New York Times review, \u201cMaster Breen is a clever little performer who can carry anything from Schubert\u2019s Ave Maria to Stephen Foster\u2019s Old Folks at Home with a bell-like voice which demands your respect. He also plunks a banjo, smiles winningly ... and holds the women of the audience in the palm of his hand from the moment he takes the screen.\u201d</p> <p>Breen inspires an operetta composer played by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rathbone\" title=\"\">Basil Rathbone</a> in Make a Wish (1937). In Hawaii Calls (1938), Breen stows away on a ship from San Francisco to Honolulu, where he gets to sing a bunch of Hawaiian melodies while on the run. Despite having put on inches in height and breadth, Breen\u2019s voice remained high in Breaking the Ice (1938) and Fisherman\u2019s Wharf (1939).</p> <p>As an orphan boy who has inherited a plantation, including its slaves, in the pre-civil war south in Way Down South (1939), Breen got to sing, in voice like that of a grown woman, a few negro spirituals. Ironically, the screenplay, which seemed to suggest that slaves were happy under benevolent white owners, was written by the African-American actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615617/\" title=\"\">Clarence Muse</a> and Harlem renaissance poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/langston-hughes\" title=\"\">Langston Hughes</a>.</p> <p>The ageing 11-year-old Breen\u2019s last film as a boy soprano was Escape to Paradise (1939), set in a fictional Latin American state where he is a motorcycle taxi driver, complete with local accent.</p> <p>Breen\u2019s final screen appearance was in a non-singing tongue-in-cheek cameo as himself in Johnny Doughboy (1942), alongside other former child stars such as Carl \u201cAlfalfa\u201d Switzer and George \u201cSpanky\u201d McFarland from the Our Gang shorts.</p> <p>After having joined the army during the second world war, he returned to New York, where he took singing lessons to allow him to adapt to his adult tenor voice. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he worked as a singer in nightclubs and in stock theatre.</p> <p>\u201cThey expect me to come on stage still wearing short pants,\u201d Breen later remarked. \u201cIt takes a lot of work out there to make them believe I\u2019m grown up. They resent it somehow. It\u2019s something I have to fight every single performance.\u201d</p> <p>He also recorded briefly for the Motown record label, singing on two singles, before it was realised that he did not have the type of voice that suited Motown. But he was not forgotten. Breen\u2019s face appeared on the cover of the 1967 Beatles album Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band between George Harrison and Marlene Dietrich. \u201cHow they chose me, or where they got the picture, I have no idea,\u201d Breen said.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, he and his wife, Audre (nee Scharf), had lived in Florida, where they set up a successful theatrical agency. Audre died three days before Bobby. He had three sons, Hunter, Ron and Paul.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Bobby Breen (Isadore Borsuk), actor and singer, born 4 November 1928; died 19 September 2016<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Theresa May faced accusations from within government that she tried to remove evidence about the positive impact of immigration on the British economy from a critical report that was published before the EU referendum. </p> <p>Correspondence seen by the Guardian lays bare a six-month tussle between Conservative and Liberal Democrat advisers over the study, which was part of a government-wide exercise into the pros and cons of EU membership. </p> <p>Emails dating back to 2014 show Lib Dem advisers, who were then in government as part of the coalition, complaining repeatedly about May\u2019s interventions. </p> <p>They claimed internally that the then home secretary was determined to paint a negative picture of Britain\u2019s relationship with European countries when it came to immigration.The exchanges suggested that May wanted to claim that \u201cbenefits tourism\u201d was a serious problem, attracting immigrants into Britain.</p> <p>But the advisers said there was little evidence to support the assertion, suggesting instead that internal DWP figures might underline it as a \u201csmall-scale problem\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy impression is that Conservative secretaries of state are determined not to admit this,\u201d wrote one participant. Another said: \u201cThe home secretary is also deeply committed to the argument that free movement allows foreign criminals into the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The suggestion will be seized on by pro-EU campaigners who believe that May made it harder for David Cameron to argue for Britain\u2019s continued membership.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cA lot of the pro-free movement evidence has been removed,\u201d complained one adviser, citing a UCL report that said eastern European migrants were \u201c58% less likely to live in social housing\u201d and one showing migrants paid more in tax then they take in benefits.</p> <p>The emails report conversations among civil servants inside the Home Office and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) saying that May had taken a particularly active interest in the study. </p> <p> </p> <p>Overall, the Lib Dems expressed frustration at an attempt to depict free movement as a \u201cone-way street\u201d, with foreign workers using the UK\u2019s NHS and claiming benefits, while downplaying the numbers of British people living and working on the continent. </p> <p>The emails have been seen after Cameron\u2019s former director of communications, Craig Oliver, accused May of repeatedly failing to throw her weight behind the campaign to keep Britain in the EU.</p> <p>The report from the Home Office, with contributions from Ian Duncan Smith\u2019s DWP, was one of the 32 Whitehall studies on the \u201dbalance of competences\u201d between the UK and the EU insisted on by the Conservatives in the 2010 Coalition Agreement.</p> <p>The immigration report was the most bitterly contested and Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, has since publicly accused May of tampering with the report to minimise the number of British people living abroad.<br></p> <p>But this set of emails goes further, suggesting the report was delayed because Lib Dems believed the home secretary\u2019s office refused to release revised versions. They argued that the government would be left picking up the tab for Brits abroad if their interests were completely ignored. </p> <p>Clegg\u2019s party also described as \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d the idea that benefits were the key factor in attracting workers in the UK, rather than shortages of skills in the UK labour market.</p> <p>Downing Street released the final report the day after parliament rose for the 2014 summer recess. </p> <p>Lord Wallace of Saltaire, the Lib Dem minister who led the negotiations on these reports, told a similar story to the correspondence. \u201cThere was a deep-seated reluctance from within the home secretary\u2019s office to admit that free movement brings benefits as well as costs to British citizens, or to allow us to cite evidence which weakened the Eurosceptic narrative,\u201d he told the Guardian.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A source close to the prime minister accused the Lib Dems of trying \u201cto rig the balance of competences review\u201d and saying the country had since voted decisively to leave the EU. </p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has been completely consistent in her view that we need more control over our immigration system rather than less, and that levels of immigration are too high. Since becoming prime minister, she has made clear that following Brexit we will get the right deal to control the number of people who come to Britain from Europe,\u201d he said. </p>",

  "<h2><strong>Healing Labour\u2019s wounds</strong></h2> <p>I agree with your editorial (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/the-guardian-view-on-labours-shadow-cabinet-an-election-that-could-heal-some-wounds\" title=\"\">Election to heal wounds, 16 September</a>) that the Labour party must unite to move forward. You rightly say that it has always been a broad church and that the two wings of the party must respect each other.</p> <p>However, I find baffling your conclusion that allowing the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) to elect the shadow cabinet would heal the wounds. Leader Jeremy Corbyn was elected by an overwhelming majority of members a year ago and the re-run of his election this year due to the undermining of that vote has caused ill-feeling among members towards the PLP.</p> <p>Gerrymandering and a McCarthy-style purging of members by the National Executive Committee has made the feelings all the more bitter. So the question is: how do we re-unite ? There must be some form of negotiations. The new direction of the party is the wish of a majority of its more than half a million members and must be respected.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br>Montbrun, Bocage, France</p> <h2><strong>Rock, muskeg and welcome</strong></h2> <p>Patrick Kingsley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\" title=\"\">Europe turns its back again, 9 September</a>) writes that Canada \u201cpromised\u201d to resettle 25,000 Syrians. This promise was kept over six months ago. More refugees will arrive next year. There has been little criticism of this policy, only of the lack of enough ready accommodation.</p> <p>Essentially we live on a strip of land and water of varying width along the northern border of the United States, having over the years lost choice bits to the Americans, backed by Britain.

He would be surprised, he said, if 40 of them actually voted in November. Because nobody at any age votes much in Nevada, which is usually in the bottom 10 states for voter turnout.</p> <p>\u201cNevada has been one of the fastest-growing states,\u201d Lokken said en route to class one recent Thursday. \u201cNo one is from here.

  "<p>Sadiq Khan\u2019s <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2016/09/watch-sadiq-khans-brilliant-speech-to-labour-conference-on-winning-power/\">speech to the Labour conference</a> was carefully crafted to win audience applause but also, and most of all, to make point after point about the need to win elections and wield power. He congratulated Jeremy Corbyn on winning the most recent election he has run in, the pushover that has further strengthened his stranglehold on the Labour Party. After that, Khan didn\u2019t mention Corbyn at all. He didn\u2019t need to. The London mayor had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/labour-cannot-win-jeremy-corbyn-im-voting-for-owen-smith-says-sadiq-khan\">already made clear</a> what he thinks of Corbyn\u2019s chances of emulating on a national scale his recent triumph in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zac-Versus-Sadiq-become-London/dp/1911079204/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">the fight for City Hall</a>: \u201cIf Jeremy remains as leader, Labour is extremely unlikely to win the next general election.\u201d </p> <p>Full marks for concision. So much is being written about Corbyn. So little is required. He is an ineffective Labour leader, both in parliament and in the country. Labour MPs from across the left-right spectrum have known this from day one. The Great British electorate too is unimpressed, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/labour-struggling-attract-working-class-voters-analysis-fabian-society\">working-class voters</a> Corbyn\u2019s admirers insist he can inspire and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-results-live-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-poll-incompetent-working-class-voters-a7326486.html\">floating voters he must attract</a>.<br></p> <p>Those who\u2019ve kept him in place as party leader are either na\u00efvely idealistic, coldly manipulative or blissfully consumed by their own piety. While Corbyn leads it, Labour will fail to command the House of Commons or the general public\u2019s confidence. His notion of building Labour into a grassroots movement that will transform society from below is fanciful. That\u2019s all you need to know.</p> <p>The task now for Labour politicians who want to do more than address rallies of admirers and pretend in the face all evidence that they are on the path to victory is to work out how best to outlast Corbyn\u2019s ascendancy until the Outer Left alliance that sustains him succumbs to disappointment, its customary internal bickering and its deep, ancestral longing to feel betrayed.</p> <p>That struggle to endure will take various forms. Khan has shown a way to do it. Others have used the conference to get their own, related strategies underway. The mood music from those who haven\u2019t joined the \u201cI\u2019m With Corbyn\u201d chorus has been conciliatory in a minor key. How generously they\u2019ve greeted a victory they think calamitous. How plangently they\u2019ve harmonised with their conqueror\u2019s calls for unity. It is all part of their survival strategy. </p> <p>Andy Burnham, who has stayed on as shadow home secretary and steered a neutral course during the leadership campaign, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-not-afraid-of-challenging-labour-policy\">among the first</a> to take this line. Next spring, he will seek to be elected executive mayor of Greater Manchester. His path to that post, which he clearly finds more appealing than being mired in endless parliamentary opposition, will be the smoother if he can neutralise the Corbyn drag effect.</p> <p>Sparing himself harassment by Corbynite inquisitors will be part of that. A bigger part will be separating himself from Corbyn in electors\u2019 minds. In London, Khan could hardly have distanced himself from Corbyn more completely, running a self-contained campaign and allowing himself to be seen just twice in Corbyn\u2019s company. </p> <p>His need to do so was increased by his having nominated Corbyn for the leadership ballot last year, despite being from the \u201csoft\u201d rather than \u201chard\u201d left of the party. Cynics might suspect this was a ploy to help him vanquish his chief rival to become mayoral candidate, the Blairite Tessa Jowell. Cynics might be on to something there. Whatever, it led to Zac Goldsmith, Khan\u2019s Tory opponent in the mayoral race itself, no doubt informed by private polling, trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/01/london-mayor-race-could-jeremy-corbyn-be-zac-goldsmiths-best-friend\">detrimentally link Khan and Corbyn in voters\u2019 minds</a> as part of a wider scare strategy. </p> <p>Khan\u2019s response was to insist and, indeed, to demonstrate that he was his own, very different kind of politician. Corbynites protest that Khan\u2019s huge win in May was really Corbyn\u2019s. Team Khan, which secured the win, don\u2019t see things that way at all.</p> <p>His success is now a blueprint for how Labour candidates of several kinds can establish in voters\u2019 minds that they are not Corbyn\u2019s men or Corbyn\u2019s women. By this time next year there will almost certainly be Labour \u201cmetro mayors\u201d in post in Liverpool and Birmingham as well as Manchester, with varying powers over their cities and surrounding areas. They, along with Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, will be the most powerful Labour politicians in the UK: high profile and, hopefully, on the road to becoming highly effective at implementing Labour programmes in new forms of regional government.</p> <p>Their progress, and that of Labour leaders of other big cities - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarvinJRees?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bristol</a>, <a href=\"http://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=107\">Leeds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/give-refugee-children-home-uk-11936510\">Newcastle</a> and more - in the years leading up to 2020 will depend less on the endeavours of their party\u2019s national leader than on their marshalling of the resources they have at their disposal and their ability to persuade, enthuse and cajole a range of interest groups \u2013 housing providers, public sector bodies, educators, voluntary organisations, businesses and so on - to pursue progressive common goals. In the longer term, they will want to talk to the Conservative national government into giving them greater leeway to do things their way in the post-Brexit national interest.</p> <p>Collectively those governing Labour politicians could, in effect, represent a parallel, much broader Labour Party than the narrow one Corbyn leads; a very different political entity sharing the same name. This parallel Labour would be largely autonomous and, by necessity, pragmatic, practical and consensual. It would be localist, focused on fostering local growth, nurturing local skills and meeting local need, but also internationalist, looking outwards to the wider world to attract know-how and investment.</p> <p>It could be electorally helpful to Labour council and parliamentary candidates too, its endeavours and mayoral figureheads boosting hard-pressed contenders for marginal wards and constituencies. Would such candidates sooner be photographed with can-do winners like a future Mayor Burnham or Mayor Khan, or with Corbyn, who looks to most voters like a loser? There is, of course, serious talk of a Labour split. But an informal Labour fragmentation looks more likely, with the party\u2019s separate strands increasingly going their own ways within the UK\u2019s increasingly fragmented political landscape. By such means Corbyn\u2019s leadership might be survived. </p> <p><em>Dave Hill is the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/dave-hill-the-london-mayor-election-was-a-harsh-but-ultimately-cheering-battle\">Zac Versus Sadiq: The Fight to Become London Mayor</a>, which is available from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Guardian Bookshop</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cSeeing Giselle as a member of the audience is a very different thing from seeing it as a choreographer \u2013 and knowing that, fucking hell, you\u2019re going to have to be dealing with it yourself.\u201d</p> <p>That was the sobering thought that struck <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net\">Akram Khan</a>, whose <a href=\"http://giselle.ballet.org.uk\">new version of the ballet</a> has just opened in Manchester. Before he embarked on the project for English National Ballet, he explains, he had only ever seen one performance of Giselle, and that was as a curious outsider. Originally choreographed in 1842 by Jules Perrot and Jean Coralli, the ballet comes straight from the heart of European Romanticism. Its plot is a narrative world away from Khan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/16/akram-khan-desh-review\">Bangladeshi heritage</a>: the story of a young peasant heroine who is deceived by her aristocratic lover, Albrecht, but continues to adore him from beyond the grave.</p> <p>By the same measure, Giselle\u2019s delicate, airborne vocabulary is on a completely different physical plane from the grounded, percussive language of the Indian dance form <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak\">Kathak</a>, and from the western contemporary dance styles in which Khan was trained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8da617b2bb91dc738b3fa00095cc566e4a61340b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8da617b2bb91dc738b3fa00095cc566e4a61340b/1159_442_2169_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akram Khan in Dust, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akram Khan in Dust, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the world of ballet has begun scouting for its choreographers in new and sometimes surprising places, and Khan himself has been growing progressively more responsive to its call. He has collaborated with French ballerina <a href=\"http://\">Sylvie Guillem</a> and in 2014 he accepted a commission from ENB\u2019s newly appointed director, Tamara Rojo, to create a new work for the company.</p> <p>That work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/11/tamara-rojo-english-national-ballet-first-world-war\">Dust</a>, proved to be such a mutually satisfying experiment that Rojo then suggested Giselle. And as daunting as it was for Khan to tackle so revered a classic, he was also fascinated to discover exactly what its story, its characters and its structure might offer him as a choreographer. \u201cIt was so important to me to respect the original. With a work as sacred as Giselle, it would be easy to say \u2018Fuck off\u2019 and make something that\u2019s the exact opposite. But I realised you have to listen to it and open yourself up to it.\u201d</p> <p>This is what Khan has spent the last year doing, in collaboration with his dramaturg <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/company-profiles/ruth-little/\">Ruth Little</a>. When I speak to the pair in a small mirrored studio in ENB\u2019S London base, they acknowledge how hard it was, at first, to get to grips with the ballet\u2019s plot and with its accompanying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Adam\">Adolphe Adam</a> score. \u201cThe story seemed naive in so many ways,\u201d says Little, \u201cand the music seemed so bitty and motif-led.\u201d Each sequence was only a minute or so long, and it all seemed so different from the kind of organic unfolding that happens in Khan\u2019s work. But, as Little points out, \u201cthe ballet hasn\u2019t survived for no reason\u201d, and it has been robust enough to support other radical retellings, including those by Mats Ek and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/feb/24/dance\">Michael Keegan-Dolan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fc0348e8a3b68263261c04177640e93eb32ec9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fc0348e8a3b68263261c04177640e93eb32ec9a/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Akram Khan and Stina Quagebeur in rehearsal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Akram Khan and Stina Quagebeur in rehearsal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she and Khan explored their own ideas about Giselle, they realised that the ballet\u2019s apparently formulaic simplicity was actually its strength, and that its starkly opposed themes of love and betrayal, of reality and the supernatural, provided the power of its narrative bones. Most fruitful to them was exploring the underlying issue of power \u2013 the gulf of money and class that separates the aristocrats from the peasants in the ballet, and that dooms Albrecht and Giselle\u2019s love to tragedy.</p> <p>When Khan and Little began work on the project last year, the news was full of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/the-new-odyssey-patrick-kingsley-cast-away-charlotte-mcdonald-gibson-europes-refugee-crisis-review\">the refugee crisis in Europe</a> and it became obvious that this would be the key to their own 21st-century Giselle. They have set the ballet among a community of migrant workers, who have been sacked from their jobs at a garment factory and are having to eke out a precarious existence in an impromptu camp. The courtly world of Albrecht is replaced by a privileged group of landlords and factory owners, who live apart from their workers behind a high wall.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I danced in it I\u2019d have to be a minor character \u2013 sort of limping and messy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given this harsh new setting, it\u2019s inevitable that the ballet\u2019s heroine has also undergone profound changes. Khan says he found it hard to connect with the passive, childlike Giselle of the original, comparing her to the delicately feminised women in Kathak, who are \u201cnearly always so shy and in awe. I hate that. [The Hindu goddess] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha_Krishna\">Radha</a> today would be chewing gum and holding out her hand for Krishna to write his telephone number on. With Giselle I wanted to create a real woman who has lived life and experienced a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb0a57473f7822ad12df62540b34ec621d1d711d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb0a57473f7822ad12df62540b34ec621d1d711d/0_517_5241_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ENB artistic director Tamara Rojo rehearses Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Visionary doggedness\u2019 \u2026 ENB artistic director Tamara Rojo rehearses Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What defines Giselle for Khan is not her naivety, but her capacity for hope. \u201cShe\u2019s in this catastrophic situation but she still falls in love, she sees beauty everywhere, she\u2019s always hoping for better things, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so vulnerable to Albrecht.\u201d</p> <p>Another character who fascinated him is Hilarion, the peasant gamekeeper who loves Giselle but cruelly forces her to acknowledge Albrecht\u2019s duplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s the most flawed and human character \u2013 he has that inner battle that always interests me.\u201d Khan and Little have expanded Hilarion\u2019s role in the ballet into a fixer, a go-between who works with both migrants and capitalists: \u201cAt one point I got so interested in him I had the idea of having the title as Giselle, then crossing it out and writing Hilarion in blood.\u201d</p> <p>In the process of refashioning the ballet, Khan has been working with a radical rearrangement of the score. Some of Adam\u2019s themes and melodies will be identifiable, but he says that they have been stretched and altered by his composer, <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/company-profiles/beautiful-noise-vincenzo-lamagna/\">Vincenzo Lamagna</a>, into \u201cbeautiful, interesting stuff\u201d. In its own way, Khan\u2019s choreography remains in dialogue with the 19th-century text, for although the dance material is all brand new, he steeped himself in the vocabulary of classicism while he was creating it. \u201cTamara always told me that she wanted this to be a journey for me as an artist,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would have been a waste of time for me if I had made a work for ENB that my own dancers could have done better.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would have been a waste of time to make a work for ENB that my own dancers could have done better</p> </blockquote> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMcHPDN41q0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JMcHPDN41q0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch rehearsals for Giselle</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the most extreme journey Khan has taken is into the language of pointe work.

They were developed for that purpose.\u201d</p> <p>The two principal ballerinas who will alternate in the role of Giselle are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/24/alina-cojocaru-interview-ballet-corsaire-nutcracker\">Alina Cojocaru</a> and Rojo herself. \u201cThey are such great artists and they\u2019ve asked so many interesting questions,\u201d Khan says. \u201cTamara always looks at the whole picture of the ballet; when Alina asks questions, she always looks through the eyes of Giselle.\u201d He would adore to partner the two ballerinas himself, but says he has created a work that is impossible for him to dance. \u201cIf I was in it I\u2019d have to be a minor character \u2013 sort of limping and messy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a68731b9bd6ca8752cd33bb5e5a95880e4a202b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a68731b9bd6ca8752cd33bb5e5a95880e4a202b0/0_0_3069_2188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional \u2026 Agnes Oakes performs Giselle for English National Ballet in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional \u2026 Agnes Oakes performs Giselle for English National Ballet in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His greatest admiration, however, is reserved for the visionary doggedness that Rojo has displayed as artistic director.

  "<p>Earlier this year the Department for Education decided to try to collect nationality and country of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\" title=\"\">birth information for all young people</a> in education in England. As a parent and as a teacher, I feel deeply uncomfortable with this development. No one was consulted on the policy change, which would add this data to the existing national pupil database: not parents, not teachers, not parliament. That database is <a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/pupil_data_sharing_with_the_poli#incoming-846569\" title=\"\">already made available</a> \u2013 including identifying information \u2013 to third parties such as universities, the media, the police and the Home Office. This new information on young people could just as easily fall into the wrong hands.</p> <p>So what\u2019s it for? A government better disposed to helping migrants and their children, you might imagine, could be asking these questions to help support schools in areas where higher numbers of pupils need help with English as an additional language. But, of course, many children who were born abroad or have non-British citizenship speak fluent English, and there are children born here who need that help, so it would be a utterly inaccurate way of getting the right data.</p> <p>Besides, that information is already held elsewhere, and in ways that don\u2019t involve giving away young people\u2019s names and personal data. If this information gets into the system there will be no safeguards against future changes that would turn our schools into border checkpoints or stigmatise all migrants irrespective of status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/26/parents-boycott-requests-childrens-country-of-birth-information\">Parents urged to boycott requests for children's country of birth information</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their explanation is that it will help them to monitor the impact of immigration on our education system. We already know that public services such as education are under pressure. Funding is slow to arrive and inadequate when more people move into an area, whether that\u2019s from elsewhere in the UK or from abroad. Blaming migrants must look like an easier route to take than providing proper funding for those services, but without addressing the real problems they certainly cannot fix them.</p> <p>The post-Brexit referendum climate here is one in which people are legitimately afraid of an upsurge in racist violence. The government has decided to try to appease the people who think migrants are a problem for this country, and they\u2019ve done so in a way that risks a list of named migrant children becoming public.</p> <p>Did ministers even consider what the consequences of their actions would be? Or have they decided that the threat to children\u2019s safety is a price worth paying so they can look tough on immigration? Either way, the campaign to scrap this scheme will only grow.</p> <p>This week, more than 20 organisations have written a <a href=\"https://www.schoolsabc.net/2016/09/letter-justine-greening/\" title=\"\">joint letter to Justine Greening, the secretary of state</a>, arguing for precisely that. They span the British migrants\u2019 rights movement, but they also include civil liberties and privacy organisations like Liberty and Privacy International. Wherever young people were born, whatever their nationality, their personal data should be treated as sacrosanct.</p> <p>Hopefully these concerns will have an effect, but we cannot rely on this government\u2019s compassion or common sense. That\u2019s why I\u2019m supporting <a href=\"http://twitter.com/@Schools_ABC\" title=\"\">Schools ABC\u2019s call for a boycott</a> of this exercise. It\u2019s time to make the system unworkable and the data unusable.</p> <p>As a parent, with one child at primary school and the other at nursery in my local children\u2019s centre, I will refuse to submit this information about my children, as I have a legal right to do. As a teacher, I will refuse to collect this data if asked to do so. If enough people take these small steps perhaps we can force the government to abandon this dangerous and divisive plan.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>The winner: Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</strong></h2> <p>The residual affection for endearingly self-sabotaging singleton Bridget Jones meant it was always likely that a large audience would show up on opening weekend, which it did, resulting in an impressive UK debut of \u00a38.11m. What happened next was always going to be harder to call \u2013 word-of-mouth would play a big factor in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/05/bridget-joness-baby-review-reborn-renee-zellweger-excels-in-fun-romp-heavy-with-expectation\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby</a>\u2019s continued fortunes.</p> <p>On the evidence so far, that audience word is very warm. First, the film held up well in midweek, grossing a nifty \u00a36.65m over the Monday-to-Thursday period, for a seven-day total of \u00a314.77m. Next, Baby declined just 20% on its second weekend, earning another \u00a36.45m for a 10-day tally of \u00a321.22m.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4hzfd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2478289\"            data-video-name=\"Bridget Jones's Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Universal \"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56f2da09e4b03be67b95cae2\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/23/160323BridgetJonesTrailer.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/mar/23/bridget-joness-baby-watch-renee-zellweger-return-new-trailer-video\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby: watch Ren\u00e9e Zellweger return in new trailer \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>While a few films so far this year in the UK have earned money quicker \u2013 notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/22/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-review-ben-affleck-henry-cavill\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush\">Captain America: Civil War</a> \u2013 cracking \u00a320m in 10 days is phenomenal for a film that does not have the benefit of a top-tier superhero. And Baby is already ahead of the total gross of summer blockbusters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/x-men-apocalypse-review-marvel-jennifer-lawrence-oscar-isaac\">X-Men: Apocalypse</a> (\u00a318.35m), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/15/star-trek-beyond-review-zachary-quinto-spock-anton-yelchin\">Star Trek Beyond</a> (\u00a315.95m) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/independence-day-2-resurgence-review-sequel-jeff-goldblum-charlotte-gainsbourg\">Independence Day: Resurgence</a> (\u00a312.10m).

Universal reports that Baby is already the highest grossing film ever released in September in the UK. Top September titles from recent years include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/legend-review-tom-hardy-on-double-duty-in-cartoonish-krays-biopic\">Legend</a> (\u00a318.3m), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/15/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-film-review\">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a> (\u00a314.2m) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/looper-review\">Looper</a> (\u00a310.2m).</p> <p>In the US, takings for Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby are a disappointing $16.6m, but foreign takings are surging ahead with $67.4m so far, boosted by big numbers in the UK and Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1348598,00.html\">Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</a> grossed $40m in the US and $222m in foreign. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/13/helenfielding\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary</a> saw less of a disparity, although foreign ($210m) far exceeded the US total ($72m).</p> <h2><strong>The runner-up: The Magnificent Seven</strong></h2> <p>Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby in its second weekend grossed more than three times its nearest competitor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/the-magnificent-seven-review-denzel-washington\">The Magnificent Seven</a>, which debuted with a decent \u00a32.13m. The western remake likewise opened in the US at the weekend, grossing $34.7m. By rule of thumb, based on the US result, you might expect a UK debut of about \u00a33.5m. However, that yardstick was never likely to apply in the case of The Magnificent Seven. First, westerns are rarely as popular in the UK. And second, lead actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/denzelwashington\">Denzel Washington</a> has consistently proved a bigger star in the US.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RBA0xoaWU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q-RBA0xoaWU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In terms of recent comparisons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/07/the-hateful-eight-review-tarantino-triumphs-with-a-western-of-wonder\">The Hateful Eight</a> kicked off earlier this year with a more muscular \u00a32.78m, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a> began with an almost identical \u00a32.80m. </p> <h2><strong>The family surge</strong></h2> <p>While adult-skewing films typically decay each week at a rate of about 40-45%, that is not the case for virtually all the family titles in the marketplace. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres\">Finding Dory</a>\u2019s gentle dip of just 5% sees it back in the Top 5 in its ninth week of release. After an uncertain start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/kubo-and-the-two-strings-review-animation\">Kubo and the Two Strings</a> is also holding well, with declines of 29% and 16%. It\u2019s in third place, just above Finding Dory. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/the-bfg-review-mark-rylance-steven-spieberg-roald-dahl\">The BFG</a>, down just 3% from the previous weekend, is back in the Top 10, and with \u00a329.8m so far looks certain to crack \u00a330m. Lower down the chart, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/petes-dragon-review-sweet-and-soulful-with-a-bitter-streak\">Pete\u2019s Dragon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ice-age-collision-course-review\">Ice Age: Collision Course</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/secret-life-pets-film-review-family-animation-new-york\">The Secret Life of Pets</a> all posted very strong holds.</p> <h2><strong>The soft debut: The Girl With All the Gifts</strong></h2> <p>For a modestly budgeted, smart British indie genre film such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/22/the-girl-with-all-the-gifts-review-gemma-arterton-glenn-close\">The Girl with All the Gifts</a>, a UK debut of \u00a3433,000 (including \u00a320,000 previews) sounds not so shabby. But a soft site average of only \u00a31,175 tells a different story, and that\u2019s because UK distributor Warners rolled the film out into a broad 368 cinemas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjGkB_oWTe0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HjGkB_oWTe0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s easy to criticise the strategy as likely to dilute the film\u2019s target audience, and a focus on indie cinemas would have given the sector more ownership of the film, and thus boosted the average. But younger genre fans are more likely to be found in multiplex venues, and Warners had every reason to go after that audience.</p> <p>Also in indieland, Taika Waititi\u2019s comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-sam-neill-misfit-kid-kiwi-hit\">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a> posted an encouraging hold, down just 19% at the box office, albeit helped by a modest expansion from 63 to 76 cinemas. The film is performing particularly well in indie venues, and gross so far is \u00a3391,000.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/16/sam-neill-on-hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-co-star-im-grumpy-hes-annoying-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53aft\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2723967\"            data-video-name=\"Sam Neill on Hunt for the Wilderpeople co-star: 'I'm grumpy, he's annoying' \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57dbfca8e4b0df02df202e2e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/16/160916HuntfortheWilderpeoplePressIV_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/16/160916HuntfortheWilderpeoplePressIV_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/16/160916HuntfortheWilderpeoplePressIV.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/16/sam-neill-on-hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-co-star-im-grumpy-hes-annoying-video-interview\">Sam Neill on Hunt for the Wilderpeople co-star: \u2018I\u2019m grumpy, he\u2019s annoying\u2019 \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Brotherhood sets franchise record</strong></h2> <p>Noel Clarke\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/brotherhood-review-silly-gangster-porn-version-of-kids-tv\">Brotherhood</a> fell another 50% at the weekend, is now down at number 18. But it\u2019s the cumulative total that deserves attention: \u00a33.53m, after less than four weeks\u2019 play. In 2008, Adulthood stunned industry commentators when it grossed \u00a33.35m in the UK, up from \u00a3454,000 for 2006\u2019s Kidulthood. Few thought the audience would return in such strong numbers for a sequel arriving so long after the earlier hits. </p> <h2><strong>The Irish hit: The Young Offenders</strong></h2> <p>Irish distributor Wildcard had a hit on its hands when local comedy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4714568/\">The Young Offenders</a> began life with \u00a3118,000 from 65 cinemas, plus previews of \u00a354,000. But the story is now even better, with second-weekend takings of \u00a3143,000 (up 20%), for a total so far of \u00a3415,000. The film stars newcomers Alex Murphy and Chris Walley as two teenage boys who cycle 100 miles on stolen bikes in search of a missing bale of cocaine worth \u20ac7m. A UK release is under discussion.</p> <h2><strong>The future</strong></h2> <p>The lack of major releases meant UK grosses overall were 13% down on the previous session. However, due to the continued powerful performance of Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, takings were 61% up on the late-September frame from 2015, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/everest-review-jake-gyllenhaal\">Everest</a>, Legend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/maze-runner-the-scorch-trials-review-a-ya-franchise-runs-out-of-steam\">The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials</a> held on to the chart\u2019s top places.

Darkness is the realm of possibility and danger, folklore, fear and desire. A policeman stands on the edge of the lake, looking into the dark.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that many of the artists listed above are from northern latitudes, where winter nights can be long and dark. Doig himself was born in Scotland and spent a lot of his youth in Canada. Friedrich, from northern Germany, and Munch, from Norway, are artists whose imaginations turn towards magnetic north, even towards <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich#/media/File%3ACaspar_David_Friedrich_-_Das_Eismeer_-_Hamburger_Kunsthalle_-_02.jpg\">the Arctic itself</a> \u2013 and towards the night.

Geertgen tot Sint Jans\u2019s painting <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night\">The Nativity at Night</a>, a very early Dutch masterpiece from about 1490, uses the inky darkness that surrounds Mary and her child to set off their illuminated holiness. This moving idea, of the nativity in the dark as a glowing moment of fragile humanity pitched against the shadows, would still be a powerful Dutch theme <a href=\"http://web.sbu.edu/theology/bychkov/rembrandt_nativity.html\">in the age of Rembrandt</a>.</p> <p>Yet northern artists were also driven to look beyond the consoling hearthlight, into night\u2019s most dreadful depths. The German Renaissance artist Hans Baldung Grien was obsessed with <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/336235\">depicting witches</a> at their midnight sabbaths. Centuries later in his painting <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_(painting)#/media/File%3AMax_Beckmann%2C_1918-19%2C_The_Night_(Die_Nacht)%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_133_x_154_cm%2C_Kunstsammlung_Nordrhein-Westfalen%2C_D\u00fcsseldorf.jpg\">The Night</a>, the German expressionist Max Beckmann unveils a Weimar Berlin night of madness and depravity.</p> <p>Vincent van Gogh, a northern artist who found himself in the south of France, painted one of the eeriest of all night-life scenes after he fell out with a cafe owner. He told the owner he was going to get revenge by setting up his easel in his cafe and portraying its sleazy atmosphere. The night drinkers and prostitutes enjoyed Van Gogh\u2019s portrayal of their haunt, watching him paint it as a kind of performance art. The result is <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Caf%C3%A9#/media/File%3ALe_caf\u00e9_de_nuit_(The_Night_Caf\u00e9)_by_Vincent_van_Gogh.jpeg\">The Night Caf\u00e9</a>, with its lurid green and red tones and sense of futility and desolation.

The strangest and most marvellous art experience I have had this year involved going into total darkness equipped only with a torch. After clambering over slippery, sharp surfaces and through narrow, claustrophobic apertures, we finally reached a pitch-black gallery where spotlights were turned on to reveal the art. This was not an installation at Tate Modern but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/aug/11/cave-paintings-rock-art\">a cave in the Pyrenees</a>. Here, deep underground, ice age artists drew bison and ibex with charcoal 13,000 years ago. Why did the ice age artists explore such deep, dark places? Why is the oldest art in the world shrouded in permanent night? It has to be that our imaginations crave darkness. Only in the dark can we forget the banal distraction of daylit reality and enter a visionary realm of dreams. Art is a creature of the night.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/exhibition/towards-night/\">Towards Night is at the Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, until 22 January</a>.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>One morning this month the families of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/50-people-snatched-deported-jamaica-uk-immigration\" title=\"\">more than 40 people deported on a private charter flight</a> to Jamaica experienced the overwhelming loss of relatives being taken thousands of miles away from the communities where many had lived for decades.</p> <p>But what\u2019s next? Many on the charter plane were issued with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jul/19/mpsurgery18\" title=\"\">so-called right to appeal after being deported</a>. This is increasingly issued to people removed on an individual basis via commercial flights, and to the many deported to countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Jamaica, Pakistan and Albania. However, while the British Home Office recently commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/british-high-commission-abuja-donates-returns-reception-centre-to-nigeria-immigration-service\" title=\"\">\u201creturns reception centre\u201d for deportees arriving in Nigeria</a>, it offers <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/shinealight/lotte-lewis-smith-and-mark-umunna/special-gift-from-uk-to-nigeria-promoting-human-rights-or-se\" title=\"\">no further support</a> for those who wish to continue their legal battle after removal.</p> <p>Guidance from the Home Office states: \u201cWhen a person brings or continues an appeal relating to a protection claim from outside the UK \u2026 the appeal is to be treated as if the person were not outside the UK.\u201d However, Jasmine Sallis, a founding member of <a href=\"http://rootstoreturn.wixsite.com/home\" title=\"\">Roots to Return</a> \u2013 set up to support individuals pursuing out-of-country appeals \u2013 said: \u201cThe very fact that the individual is appealing from outside the UK means that an out-of-country appeal cannot be pursued, prepared for or processed in the same way that an in-country appeal is.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the Home Office acknowledges explicitly that the government\u2019s approach to out-of-country appeals is to do as little as possible to comply with the European convention on human rights. As is stated on letters to appellants: \u201cAlthough an out-of-country appeal may be less advantageous \u2026 than in country, article 8 [of the convention] does not require that the appellant have access to the best possible procedure, only access to a procedure that meets the essential requirements of effectiveness and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>Once removed from the UK, people often find themselves destitute with little money or job prospects, and no connections or resources to pursue an appeal \u2013 which requires a UK-based lawyer or representative, \u00a3140 to lodge the appeal within the 28-day deadline and access to evidence supporting a human rights or asylum claim. If it is a human rights claim or a family-based one, the evidence will be in the UK \u2013 and thus extremely difficult to gather from abroad.</p> <p>The difficulties are clear from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/nationalities-targeted-deportation-charter-planes-home-office\" title=\"\">Unity Centre</a>\u2019s experiences supporting individuals pursuing out-of-country appeals. One man, claiming asylum in the UK, was forcibly removed to Bangladesh and attempted to pursue an out-of-country appeal. Upon removal, he found himself homeless and severely ill \u2013 unable even to afford a call to a lawyer in the UK, let alone pay the appeal fee.</p> <p>In anther case, a man forcibly removed to Nigeria on a charter flight was unable to pursue his \u201cright\u201d to an appeal because he was in hiding from state officials he had fled from by travelling to the UK in the first place. As it was dangerous to use a phone, he was forced to communicate with us at Roots to Return, through his mother.</p> <p>Just as the Home Office suggests that deportees can maintain connections with their children through Skype, appellants are expected to give evidence at appeal hearings via video link \u2013 for which there is currently a waiting list of up to 18 months. And as organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/01/romanian-sex-workers-challenge-uk-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">the Aire Centre</a> have noted, the logistics of organising these appeals are difficult, and the responsibility and financial costs fall to the appellant.</p> <p>We spoke to lawyers across the UK, and most made it clear that they had little capacity to take on appeals from abroad, noting the practical complications when compared with in-country appeals. The ones that had capacity charged at least \u00a32,500.</p> <p>The success rate for appeals was just 13% in the year up to August 2015, the year in which the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/13/uk-appeal-court-backs-deport-first-appeal-later-policy-for-foreign-prisoners\" title=\"\">Deport first, appeal later</a>\u201d policy came into force. However, two years before, the success rate was twice that, at 26% \u2013 demonstrating an alarming level of poor Home Office decision-making, with so many rulings overturned by the courts. This policy also affects EU nationals, so the legal pressure is likely to increase as European nationals fight to establish their right to remain in the UK after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The very procedure of an out-of-country appeal creates the conditions for these appeals to be unsuccessful \u2013 let alone be lodged in the first place: from July 2014 to August 2015 only 426 (25%) appealed against deportation, a marked drop from the 2,329 who had appealed in the year to April 2013.</p> <p>All this is severely damaging the role of appeals as a vital part of accessing justice in the UK. People forcibly removed are even less likely to pursue out-of-country appeals now that appeal fees for an oral hearing have increased by almost 500%, from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800. The British government imposes this increase despite a consultation exercise in which all but five of 147 responses opposed it.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/immigration-bill-receives-royal-assent\" title=\"\">2016 Immigration Act</a>, the \u201cDeport first, appeal later\u201d policy is to be rolled out to all immigration cases. One of the aims of the legislation was to increase powers \u201cto make it easier to remove people who have no right to be in the UK\u201d. Deporting people before the very appeal that will determine whether they have the \u201cright\u201d to be in the UK or not clearly demonstrates the Home Office\u2019s priority: deportation, regardless of justice.</p> <p>\u2022If you have been deported and want to pursue an out-of-country appeal, please contact <a href=\"rootstoreturn@gmail.com\" title=\"\">rootstoreturn@gmail.com</a></p>",

To those who question whether he\u2019s too young to be a mayor, he responds: \u201cI\u2019ve got all of my political experience from the doorstep, from a grassroots level and from the community I live in. Age doesn\u2019t necessarily equal life experience. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve done [that\u2019s important]: I\u2019ve been involved in scouting for 13 years, I\u2019ve done work in students\u2019 unions and charitable organisations and I know the local area and the people who live here as well as anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s first brush with politics came in 1997, the year of Labour\u2019s landslide victory: his mother took him into the polling station as a three-month-old baby while she cast her vote. It was the tuition fee hike in 2010, however, that marked the start of his political engagement, aged 13. \u201cThe first time I ever got into an argument with a teacher was over what the coalition were doing to education. That was the first time I became political,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Neither his friends nor his parents \u2013 his mother is a taxi driver, and his stepfather works in a hardware store \u2013 are particularly political and Smith attributes his interest to a sense of community gained from being a scout, (he is wearing a scouting badge on the tie of his suit when we meet).</p> <p>When Smith bumped into John Prescott during the former deputy prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-20346472\" title=\"\">doomed bid</a> to become the Humberside police and crime commissioner, Prescott encouraged him to get involved in Young Labour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People always ask why young people aren\u2019t involved [in politics], then criticise them when they get involved</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In January 2015, the local Labour party mentioned that it was looking for candidates to run for seats on Goole council, so Smith stood and won. <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/43206.htm\" title=\"\">With 60 being the average age of a councillor in England</a>, Smith, who was at that time studying for his A-Levels, is highly unusual.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people said I was too young, and asked why I wasn\u2019t out drinking, what on earth I knew about politics,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople always ask why young people aren\u2019t involved [in politics], then criticise them when they get involved.\u201d Smith believes that barriers for young people to participate are increasing. \u201cWe\u2019re juggling study, exams and work, it\u2019s hard,\u201d he points out.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government wanted to increase youth turnout they\u2019d let us vote online: if it\u2019s safe enough for leadership elections, why not for others? I can walk into a polling station with no ID, so why should voting online be less secure?, he asks. While an undergraduate he will live in halls in Hull, the nearest city to Goole, returning regularly to his mayoral duties.</p> <p>Smith campaigned hard for the remain camp in the referendum and admits he is deeply disappointed by the result, though clear on why it happened. \u201cHere, immigration has happened quite quickly in the last 15 years, and people are not necessarily racist, they\u2019re just scared or unsure. It wasn\u2019t a problem we could tackle on the doorsteps,\u201d he says. Goole\u2019s immigration is mostly from eastern Europe \u2013 Poland and Latvia \u2013 and a couple of eastern European shops cluster on one side of the local railway station. \u201cA lot of people were blaming immigration for the NHS failing, the housing crisis, and a lack of school places, when that\u2019s down to the government,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Goole has some of the highest child poverty rates in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and problems with youth unemployment and low pay, therefore attracting EU structural funding. \u201cGoole\u2019s benefited heavily from European Union funding, we\u2019ve had a new link road built, and high-speed internet rolled out,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t care about Goole, but the European Union had to.

  "<p>By traditional standards, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/debate-clinton-trump-recap-presidential-election-hofstra\" title=\"\">first televised US presidential debate</a> on Monday night produced a clear result. Hillary Clinton\u2019s experience, grasp and temperament proved superior qualities to Donald Trump\u2019s forcefulness, rambling and egotism. Fears that Mrs Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia\" title=\"\">recent bout of pneumonia</a> would cause her to stumble proved unfounded. Instead, Mr Trump\u2019s sniffing caused more comment on the night. But the question, in this most unpredictable of elections and in a new media world, is how far traditional standards <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">matter</a> any more.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton repeatedly put Mr Trump under pressure on his finances, his taxes, his climate change denial, Iraq, Russia, Barack Obama\u2019s birth, and race. Mr Trump countered with powerful lines about unfair trade deals and immigration and was both personal and boastful. Mrs Clinton stayed careful but grew more relaxed as the 90 minutes evolved. Mr Trump got angry and repeatedly rose to the bait. To adopt the dismal boxing terminology that tends to be wheeled out on such occasions, neither candidate landed the fabled knockout blow. There were plenty of low punches. But Mrs Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/clinton-trump-debate-analysis\" title=\"\">obviously won</a> on points.</p> <p>Yet traditional responses to the debate may not suffice. Politics is in flux in many democracies, America included. And both these candidates are already very well known. Neither has to introduce themselves to the voters. Most people have an opinion about both of them. Each is also already a very divisive figure, both to the other side and, to an unusual extent in this race, on their own side too.</p> <p>The very fact of seeing two such dissimilar figures together in the presidential debate studio was a reminder of how 2016 is different. On the one hand, Mr Trump, a candidate whose self-confidence has swept him to the Republican nomination on a wave of predominantly white anger without any experience of government whatever. On the other Mrs Clinton, whose conventional qualifications for the top job are beyond question, but whose political instincts seem to date from a different era. The fact that here was the first woman to be taking part in a presidential debate almost passed without notice \u2013 though Mr Trump could not resist some nasty innuendos.</p> <p>The televised debates are always built up as great moments of national attention and decision. Sometimes they are. The reality is that while debates may inform opinion, there\u2019s a question as to whether they shift it dramatically. As the Guardian\u2019s Alastair Cooke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama\" title=\"\">wrote</a> of the first Nixon-Kennedy debate in 1960, the Republicans to whom he spoke afterwards thought Nixon had won, while the Democrats believed Kennedy was the victor.</p> <p>There is still a lot of sense in that more circumspect approach today. Most voters already have a preference going into the debate. They look to the exchanges to confirm them in their judgment. Relatively few voters actually tune in with an innocent mind. Last night was no exception to that. Those who are appalled by Mr Trump will have seen and heard a Clinton victory. Those who cannot abide Mrs Clinton will have seen and heard Mr Trump tell truth to power.</p> <p>The 2016 race may be an exception in other ways. The polls have narrowed in September, both nationally and in the battleground states that will determine the result in November. The debates may therefore make a difference this time. That was a subtext in Monday\u2019s exchanges. Mr Trump name-checked Michigan and Ohio, states he must win, twice in the first 30 minutes. Mrs Clinton aimed a lot of her remarks on criminal justice and police at black and Latino voters, and had sections on the banks and social justice that reached out to wavering supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Both candidates made sure to showcase their well-tested strong messages: Mr Trump to make America great again, Mrs Clinton to question her opponent\u2019s fitness to have his finger on the nuclear trigger. Mrs Clinton certainly missed a lot of opportunities to hit back instantly at Mr Trump\u2019s untruths that a better debater would have seized on. Yet Mr Trump said many things that may come back to haunt him on social media and in campaign ads in the days to come. Mrs Clinton, by contrast, made few gaffes.</p> <p>Some will say neither candidate is worthy. In the end, though, one of them will be president of the United States in January. Mr Trump came into this week\u2019s debate with an opportunity to show that there is more to his candidacy than the recklessness, rudeness, falsehood and appeal to racism that has marked it over the last months. On Monday he blew his opportunity. On the biggest stage of his career he showed he is unfit to rule, that he is a danger to America and to the rest of the world. But will enough voters care? If one thing came clear and undeflected out of Monday\u2019s debate it is that Americans cannot afford not to.</p>",

  "<p>When a South Africa Airways scheduled flight flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town last month, it carried nearly 300 passengers.</p> <p>Neither the passengers or the pilots would have noticed any difference between that flight and any other. </p> <p>But instead of the usual petroleum-based jet fuel, the plane was burning thousands of litres of a clear liquid derived from the oil of nicotine-free tobacco plants grown by farmers on acres of under-used land in the country\u2019s Limpopo province.</p> <p>Boeing, KLM, South African Airways, the Dutch government and others who partnered in the trial were cock-a-hoop with the results, which came as part of something called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.projectsolaris.co.za/\">Project Solaris</a>.</p> <p>It appeared that the fuel was not only efficient, but it was also more or less \u201csustainable\u201d, because it did not take up farmland needed to grow food or lead to deforestation or ecological problems. </p> <p>\u201cIt showed that a low-carbon aviation biofuel could be be grown that will not affect the environment and could reward farmers,\u201d said Joost Van Lier, a director of South African Sunchem biofuel development, one of the project\u2019s partners.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The tobacco fuel used was much more expensive than regular jet fuel, but because many airlines have committed to reducing CO2 emissions and substituting biofuels for some of their jet fuel by 2020, Project Solaris hopes to ramp up the acreage of tobacco grown to eventually produce millions of litres of the fuel in other southern African countries such as Malawi.</p> <p>So far, there have been around 2,500 successful flights fuelled by biofuels.

Los Angeles is following and we expect John F Kennedy and other New York airports to stream from 2019,\u201d said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of aviation industry companies. </p> <p>But despite successful tests and trials with different crops and waste streams, is there any hope in the forseeable future of aviation biofuels taking off on the scale needed to make even the slightest dent in the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=63&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=ww,US,&amp;syid=1990&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=TBPD\">300bn litres </a>of jet fuel used worldwide every year?

But the need for the industry to adopt a global scheme is seen as urgent if there is any hope of meeting the Paris agreement\u2019s aspiration of holding temperature rises to 1.5C. As it is, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-aviations-battle-to-limit-rising-emissions\">the current industry projections</a> expect aviation emissions to quadruple, potentially to account for 22% of global emissions by 2050. </p> <p>Instead of relying on biofuels, governments are pinning their hopes on a UN global carbon offset scheme. This is to be negotiated this week in Montreal when 191 governments meet for the UN\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) summit. A draft scheme is backed by US, Canada, Mexico, EU countries including the UK, and Singapore.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to Transport &amp; Environment, the US wants the new deal to cover as many countries as possible. \u201cIts strategy has been to weaken the agreement\u2019s environmental effectiveness so as to attract more states. China is pursuing a similar strategy, and it has yet to commit itself to signing up,\u201d it said. </p> <p>But there are grave reservations among NGOs that an offset scheme, which could see other industrial sectors cutting emissions to allow aviation to continue growing, is not ambitious enough and may not even work. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The proposal in <a href=\"http://www.icao.int/Meetings/a39/Documents/WP/wp_052_en.pdf\">the draft text</a> released earlier this month defines a voluntary \u201cpilot and implementation\u201d period from 2021-27 after which countries would have to join in. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cOne of the discussions in Montreal will be whether to include Redd [Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation] offsets [offsets based on avoiding deforestation] in ICAO\u2019s offsetting scheme. As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,\u201d says Chris Lang, editor of <a href=\"http://www.redd-monitor.org/\">Redd Monitor</a> which has analysed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/19/what-is-redd-climate-change-deforestation\">UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cNot only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,\u201d he said.</p> <p> The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition. </p> <p> \u201cOffsetting is not a new concept,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: \u201cI am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement\u2014a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.\u201d </p> <p>Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of \u201cvoluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months\u2019 notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,\u201d said the ICSA in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/afc9650e-aaeb-4741-a329-ebcc983e7280/ISCA%20Statement%209.7%20(3).pdf\">a letter to EU commissioners</a>. </p> <p>The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges. </p> <p>Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting.</p> <p>The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\">included aviation for 10 months in 2012</a>. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell \u201cpollution credits\u201d , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation. </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/12/eu-airline-emissions-law\">the EU froze the scheme in November 2012</a> after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes. </p> <p>\u201cThe EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,\u201d said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport &amp; Environment.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

After Brazil won 4-0, Solo walked over to an interviewer in the mixed zone, over the objections of US Soccer PR staff, and ripped the decision to bench her. Since then, one sentence has lived in women\u2019s soccer infamy: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind I would\u2019ve made those saves.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-c9h44U2F0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K-c9h44U2F0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That\u2019s unlikely \u2013 Brazil were simply a class above the USA at the time. But new coach Pia Sundhage worked a miracle to get the team on the same page to win the 2008 Olympics. The wounds were closed, until Solo re-opened them with her memoir after the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Now, coincidentally timed just after Solo\u2019s termination from the national team, Lloyd has revisited the controversy. Solo has long credited Lloyd as her most steadfast supporter through the years, and in Lloyd\u2019s book, she strongly defends her friend.</p> <p>\u201cIn men\u2019s sports, people criticize coaches and managers all the time, call out team-mates too, and it\u2019s not that huge of a deal,\u201d Lloyd writes. \u201cOften the guy speaking out is even lauded for having the courage to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Men who lose their livelihoods \u2013 or at least spend a few days enduring a public slaughter on social media or talk radio \u2013 after being labeled a problem may beg to differ. In retrospect, Solo\u2019s career is similar to that of Barry Bonds, Stephon Marbury or any other controversial male athlete \u2013 their disagreements were tolerated when they were stars, but they were easily jettisoned when the team no longer depended on them.</p> <p>But that\u2019s hardly the only complaint in Lloyd\u2019s scorching book. In her eyes, the US Soccer marketing department never did enough to promote her. The national team \u201cfeels as if it\u2019s a girls\u2019 club, and no, new members are not exactly welcome.\u201d After players convince then-coach April Heinrichs to cancel a fitness session, she gripes: \u201cThe players get their way. People have told me the inmates run the asylum on the women\u2019s national team. Here is the first example of it I\u2019ve encountered.\u201d</p> <p>She caps the complaints with a shocking accusation in the wake of Sundhage\u2019s departure in 2012: \u201cA so-called leadership group of players had a conference call and began to quietly push Sunil [Gulati, US Soccer\u2019s president] to get rid of Pia.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd says she doesn\u2019t want \u201cdrama,\u201d unlike many of her team-mates. \u201cUnfortunately, in a dozen years on the US women\u2019s national team, I\u2019ve been around enough drama queens to fill a royal palace,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>Yet \u201cdrama\u201d is the bulk of this book. And it\u2019s actually much of her career. Prodded by trainer James Galanis, she always has a chip on her shoulder, and she readily admits she plays better with an underdog mentality. She always has to have someone to prove wrong, whether it\u2019s a media critic, an opposing coach (based on whispers of disrespect), or any random person who doubted her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/24/hope-solo-suspended-us-womens-soccer-rio-olympics-loss\">USA's Hope Solo given six-month ban for calling Sweden 'a bunch of cowards'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And she\u2019s wildly inconsistent about those who criticize her. Some merely fuel her anger. But her relationship with Galanis starts when he gives a harsh assessment, saying she has world-class talent but neither the fitness nor the mentality to live up to it, and she appreciates the honesty. She is grateful to former youth national coach Chris Petrucelli for giving her a similar assessment in cutting her from the team. She\u2019s pleased when current US coach Jill Ellis shows her stats proving she had been giving away possession far too easily \u2013 something Lloyd\u2019s critics had noted for years.</p> <p>She recounts a conversation with Abby Wambach, who warns that the team sees her setting herself apart from team-mates, sitting in a corner and texting, not talking with others. She concludes that Wambach is only saying these things to ingratiate herself to veteran players who don\u2019t like Lloyd. But when Galanis tells her roughly the same thing, citing the \u201ctogetherness factor\u201d of a team sport, Galanis is brilliant in her eyes.</p> <p>(Curiously, while Lloyd mentions many of her club teams over the years, she does not mention the 2011 WPS season in which she played for the Atlanta Beat \u2013 under head coach Galanis. That year, the team won one of its 18 league games.)</p> <p>Yet for all the head-scratching moments and petty accusations (the topper: in 2007, when she was nowhere near the player she is today, she gripes that a team-mate isn\u2019t passing to her, and it clearly must be for political reasons), Lloyd\u2019s book has some value. It\u2019s not as directly inspirational as Wambach\u2019s book, in which the prolific goal-scorer recounts her battles with addiction with remarkable self-awareness. But Lloyd undoubtedly works hard. A familiar pattern sets in \u2013 she suffers a setback, then goes home to do such intense training with Galanis that the national team\u2019s fitness coach worries she is overtaxing her body. She comes back fitter, coaches praise her, and she\u2019s back where she wants to be.</p> <p>And along with Wambach\u2019s book, When Nobody Was Watching provides a harrowing account of athletes\u2019 sacrifices. Lloyd\u2019s single-mindedness has undoubtedly put her in a different plane to most people. Recently, she refused to take postgame media questions until a reporter deemed to be asking tough questions was dismissed. She and Galanis are constantly searching for enemies to motivate her, leaving her in a state of perpetual conflict. Worst of all, she\u2019s tells us how she is estranged from much of her family over disagreements on how to handle her soccer career.</p> <p>And yet despite her flaws, by the end of When Nobody Was Watching, the reader is rooting for Lloyd. Not necessarily to add more accolades to a distinguished career, but to salvage what she sacrificed of her life. We root for her to have a happy marriage \u2013 her boyfriend\u2019s charming proposal is one of the few moments of levity in the book.</p> <p>And we root for her to leave behind the world of paranoia and perfectionism in which she has lived for more than 10 years, and we hope that future athletes won\u2019t give so much of themselves in pursuit of glory.</p>",
  "<p>I never intended to write a book. My parents were struggling, impoverished writers and I\u2019d always vowed not to go the same way. But then I stumbled across Lucia Joyce, daughter of James and a dancer in 1920s Paris. I still didn\u2019t want to write a book, but I wanted to know more about her life, her alleged affairs with Alexander Calder and Samuel Beckett, and why she spent the latter half of her life in a mental asylum. When I couldn\u2019t find the answers in her biography, something happened that I still don\u2019t fully understand. I felt a compulsion to uncover and fictionalise her story.</p> <p>I discovered that many of her letters had been purposefully destroyed and this enraged me. At the time, I was intending to become a photographer, but instead I stopped my classes and bought or borrowed every book I could find on Joyce and his circle. Books spilled from every stair, towered from every table-top, squatted in trembling piles on every floor.</p> <p>That should have been a warning sign. The project was too ambitious, too unwieldy. But I couldn\u2019t stop. The story had chosen me and Lucia wasn\u2019t letting go. I\u2019d never been on a writing course and I quickly realised that creating plots, characters and convincing dialogue was far more difficult than it looked. I looked at the roof-scraping stacks of books and panicked. There was no time for a course; I had too many books to read, too many trips to make \u2013 and I had to learn to dance. How could I write about a dancer without learning to dance? </p> <p>I decided to teach myself creative writing and started ordering how-to-write books. The piles grew. The insomnia deepened. I seemed to read all night, every night. And in the grey light of dawn I tossed and turned: Lucia was a very difficult character to construct, and capturing her life was proving more difficult than I could ever have imagined. Still she did not let go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Several people had told me my novel was too highbrow for the ordinary reader and too lowbrow for the Joyceans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As part of my research I started rereading Joyce. Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man were a joy. But then there was Ulysses and \u2013 oh God! \u2013 Finnegans Wake. There they sat, beside my bed, accusatory and demanding. I tried to tell myself this was Lucia\u2019s story, it was not about Joyce. I wasn\u2019t even writing in an experimental style. To no avail. Ulysses and Finnegans Wake started following me round the house like hungry dogs. By this point, several people had told me my novel was too highbrow for the ordinary reader and too lowbrow for the Joyceans. A friendly agent suggested I was trespassing on hallowed ground and should find another story that didn\u2019t involve so many iconic men. Meanwhile, my children were asking for a proper meal and my husband was politely suggesting I move to the spare room. Still, Lucia gripped me.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Finally, I bit the bullet and picked up Ulysses. Within minutes I was panicking \u2013 again. I\u2019d read Ulysses before \u2013 twice \u2013 but I\u2019d clearly wiped the experience from my mind. This was not a book to be read by torchlight in the early hours of the morning. What was I thinking! I googled Ulysses courses and found a six-month salon. I enrolled, read all the background books, listened to the audiobook and scoured the web for sources. But would it help me understand Lucia\u2019s predicament? Would it help me imagine myself into her elusive, shifting character? </p> <p>The answer is yes, it did. Studying Ulysses in a group rather than reading it alone forced me to pause, to scrutinise every line, to search beyond the words to the author lurking behind. Suddenly facets of Lucia that I hadn\u2019t fully grasped began to fall into place. And I became more and more absorbed by some of the thrilling prose, and by the way Joyce built his protagonist, Leopold Bloom. I may not have learned much about plot, pace and tension (which I was determined to have in my novel), but I learned about prose, character and resilience. And so Ulysses ended up being both research into Lucia and a guide to crafting fiction.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mama writhed and twisted in front of the mirror. \u201cThis hat or the black one, Lucia?\u201d</p> <p>Her words floated across the air like vapour. I barely heard them as I stared out of the window, straining in the direction of the rue d\u2019Ulm. The last few leaves clung to the boughs of the trees. And beneath them the street lamps cast ragged circles of light onto the cobbled road. The smell of roasting chestnuts from the braziers on the rue de Grenelle seeped through the ill-fitting window frame, but I barely noticed that either. I moved as though in a dream, unable to feel the floor beneath my feet. All I saw, in every direction, was Mr Beckett\u2019s face \u2013 his cheekbones in the bare branches of the trees, his eyes reflected in the darkening swell of the sky. My skin prickled all over and I felt light and tight at the same time. I said his name, wordlessly, again and again. Mr Beckett. Mr Beckett. Mr Beckett.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>Dancing, declares Lucia, is \u201cthe most important thing in my life\u201d and she has a great gift for it, evoking the euphoria of performing before a rapturous audience. Dancing was her \u201clifebelt\u201d, but when distracted from her vocation, manacled to her father as his muse and fatally attracted to his protege Samuel Beckett, she starts sinking.</p> <p>Here is a powerful portrait of a young woman yearning to be an artist, whose passion for life \u2013 and rage at being unable to fulfil her talent \u2013 burns from the page. \u2013 <strong>Anita Sethi</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/12/the-joyce-girl-annabel-abbs-review\">Read the full review.</a></strong></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>The Joyce Girl is published by Impress Books at \u00a38.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/the-joyce-girl.html\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a36.99</a>.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country, they\u2019re going to Mexico they\u2019re going to many other countries \u2026 Hundreds of hundreds of companies are doing this.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump is primarily talking about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the long-term decline in manufacturing around the US can\u2019t only be attributed to the trade deal. Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></h2> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest. In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>.

Trump has a history of overstating his properties: he has, for instance, told the FEC that a New York golf club is worth $50m but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-briarcliff-manor-golf-course-tax\">argued in court that it is worth only $1.4m</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claimed that his tax plan will be the largest cuts since Ronald Reagan and create jobs, while in his words Clinton\u2019s would create a huge tax hike.</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding trillions to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. He would reduce the business tax rate to 15%, eliminate the estate tax (aka the \u201cdeath tax\u201d), which mostly affects wealthy inheritors, and would reduce revenue from taxes by about $5tn.

Among more than 5m stops during the Bloomberg administration, police found a gun less than 0.02% of the time, according to the report.

Trump is correct in an extremely technical sense: no one has provided 100% proof that Russia was behind the hack, and the Obama administration has proven loath to escalate a hacking war. But security experts have found technical fingerprints that seem to hint back toward Russia, just as they have found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/asia/us-decides-to-retaliate-against-chinas-hacking.html\">links back to Chinese hacks in unrelated cases</a>.</p> <h2>Trump: \u201cPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum\u201d for Isis.</h2> <p>The claim that Obama and Clinton created the conditions for Isis ignores that Isis\u2019s first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/middleeast/in-rise-of-isis-no-single-missed-key-but-many-strands-of-blame.html\">segments</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/us-actions-in-iraq-fueled-rise-of-a-rebel.html\">formed</a> out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">post-invasion civil war</a> in Iraq, while George W Bush was president; that the group took root in Syria\u2019s civil war, where the US did not intervene until 2014; and that Obama withdrew American forces in 2011 under the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html\">timeline</a> agreed on by Bush and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html\">Baghdad</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Trump has claimed that Nato must turn to a directly anti-terror campaign in the Middle East, and that his urging has already influenced the alliance.</strong></h2> <p>But Nato has had <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2014_10/20151029_141007-dat-prog.pdf\">a Defense Against Terrorism program</a> since June 2004, almost a full 12 years before Trump called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d. In July its member nations <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/nato-muscles-up-to-fight-isis-1468968122\">decided to increase efforts</a> against Isis, specifically, in Syria and Iraq, as its leaders had discussed for months.

A few months later, the Trump Organization announced the expected grand opening of the hotel would happen <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/getmedia/74de47aa-15c0-4328-a9cf-82f17624c4ad/GHAOPO/\">at the end of 2015</a>. The Trump Organization said in a third statement in 2013 ... <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/getmedia/7b3402f3-96ff-4a74-ab4a-300f006dad4c/OPODesign/\">completion was expected in late 2015</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, the Trump Organization went back to announcing the hotel would open <a href=\"http://www.trump.com/getmedia/fa325427-ee75-4e6c-b496-31350e8f2ca7/JoseAndresatTIHT/\">in mid-2016</a>.

The money was delivered as foreign currency because US law bars any transaction in US dollars and sanctions make bank transactions difficult.</p> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons. The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear program. Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>. Independent economists have calculated that Iran will free up anything <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-frozen-assets-20160120-story.html\">between $30bn to $100bn</a>. Complicating the math are Iran\u2019s debts: it will have to pay off tens of billions to countries <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/world/getting-china-sanction-iran/p24212\">such as China</a>.</p> <p>There is no evidence that the brief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/iran-releases-us-navy-boat-crews-who-entered-territorial-waters-state-tv\">capture in January of 10 American sailors</a> had any effect on the nuclear deal, which had been finalized five months earlier, although the incident rattled fragile relations between Washington and Tehran. A few days after the sailors were released, UN inspectors <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/world/middleeast/iran-sanctions-lifted-nuclear-deal.html\">confirmed that Iran had complied</a> with the deal.</p> <p>What Iran does next remain an open question \u2013 subject to inspection by UN officials \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s argument in favor of the deal hinges on a degree of good faith that Tehran will comply by the terms of the deal.</p> <h2>Trump: \u201cI was just endorsed by ICE.\u201d</h2> <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a government agency and does not endorse political candidates.

She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior,\u201d on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cwhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also had the sniffles.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China, or bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said. Then Trump agreed with her.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/780599581994209280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\">@HillaryClinton</a> after Trump&#39;s comment about her temperament: &quot;Whew!

To study dusting!\u201d says Will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they teach,\u201d replies Karen.</p> <p>In the show, Karen had supposedly shot at Rosario, but that just became a comment about gun control.</p> <p>\u201cIf Crooked Hillary had her way, I wouldn\u2019t have that gun and I\u2019d have to use my cannon and Rosario would be dead,\u201d said Karen.</p> <p>When Will complains that Trump uses hateful language to talk about people, Karen turns to Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Will\u2019s friend Jack stars as the undecided voter who is considering not bothering to cast a ballot in November.</p> <p>\u201cBut does my vote even matter? How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Grace attempts to appeal as Clinton being the first female president. But Jack isn\u2019t convinced, saying he hasn\u2019t heard \u201cthe one thing that will convince me to vote for one candidate over the other\u201d.</p> <p>But Will knows exactly what to stay to win over the urban gay Jack. \u201cKaty Perry likes Hillary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the end of the \u201cepisode\u201d, the words #votehoney appears.

Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.

According to polling by Pew Research Center, Republicans are much less likely than Democrats to say that \u201ceconomic conditions in the country are excellent\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91de2aa31134794bc7bac32163d6044a798f317b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91de2aa31134794bc7bac32163d6044a798f317b/0_0_1000_813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nielsen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nielsen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nielsen</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T01:43:29.834Z\">at 2.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e9cca2e4b0a785ec48bccc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T01:38:20.144Z\">2.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clinton on Trump's taxes: 'there's something he's hiding'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Clinton gets the mic.

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best.

It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest.

A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he<a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>.

Don\u2019t take my word for it (you probably wouldn\u2019t if I was reading this aloud) - this is based on a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216\">study</a> into human voice pitch research conducted in 2012. The methodology couldn\u2019t be more relevant to this debate.</p> <p>In the study, 10 women and 10 men were recorded saying the phrase \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November\u201d - a sentence that\u2019s about elections and yet is politically neutral. The researchers then manipulated the sounds of the recordings to be lower or higher and played them to a bunch of men and women who were asked which hypothetical candidate they\u2019d vote for.

Such a voter may not react to the same thing the crowd reacts to, the campaigns react to or, needless to say, the media reacts to. Watch and judge for yourself, America ... and the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to start soon. Both candidates arrive onstage as practiced debaters, though Trump does not have any experience facing just one other person. He participated in a dozen primary-season debates this cycle, while Clinton participated in nine \u2026 plus the two dozen she showed up for in 2008.</p> <p>Thank you for reading, and please join us in the comments!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Brb getting Oreos.</p>&mdash; Scott Bixby (@scottbix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/780564439514963969\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:31:12.742Z\">at 1.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e9ba98e4b0593b3cb15008\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:19:31.238Z\">1.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Clinton aide Philippe Reines \u2013 best-known among journalists as the state department spokesman who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/how-philippe-reines-handles-the-press-203496\">told a reporter to fuck off</a> \u2013 playing Trump in a debate prep session:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/780558043457196033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are multiple Trumps.

It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck.</p> <p>But how much do debates matter?

But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).</p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/skeptical-polling-clinton-trump-before-first-debate\">How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e949f3e4b0a785ec48ba9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T17:00:24.328Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monmouth poll: Clinton has 4-point lead over Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eight hours before going toe-to-toe at the first presidential debate of the general election campaign, Hillary Clinton has a four-point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters nationwide, according to a just-released Monmouth University poll. It\u2019s a three-point drop from her lead one month ago, but a more positive position than the latest numbers from Bloomberg, which show Trump taking the lead in race that includes third-party candidates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fce716dbf2ca1c186e9942ceb1fea79f1976488\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fce716dbf2ca1c186e9942ceb1fea79f1976488/0_0_4572_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clinton is currently polling at 46% among likely voters, according to Monmouth, while Trump commands the support of 42% of likely voters. Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson is polling at 8% in the survey and Green nominee Jill Stein is at 2%. Among all registered voters, and not just those most likely to vote in the upcoming election, Clinton leads with 45%, while Trump falls slightly further behind with 40% Trump.</p> <p>Among her compatriots in the Democratic party, Clinton has the support of 91% of party members, while Trump has won 85% of Republicans. This is an improvement for Trump, who previously counted only one-in-four Republican voters in his corner. Monmouth\u2019s polling suggests that independents are cutting right, supporting Trump over Clinton by 39% to 33%, a precipitous drop for the former secretary of state, who held a five-point lead among independent voters in late August.</p> <p>The generation gaps are in keeping with previous polling. Clinton leads among millennial voters under the age of 35 by 48% to Trump\u2019s 28%, while voters 35 to 54 support Trump at and Clinton at 41%. For voters older than 55, support is similarly divided, with 47% supporting Clinton and 46% supporting Trump.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s support has softened since the summer, but she has still managed to grab a share of those who tend to vote Republican,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.</p> <p>The historically unpopular major-party candidates are still viewed negatively by large majorities of the electorate. According to the survey, 36% of voters view Clinton positively, while 54% view her negatively. Trump fares even worse - 32% of voters view him positively, and 57% view him negatively.</p> <p>Three-in-four voters (75%) plan to watch tonight\u2019s debate, but that doesn\u2019t mean the debate will necessarily change minds: Only 48% of undecided voters or those supporting a third-party candidate plan to watch tonight, while eight-in-ten supporters of Clinton and Trump hope to watch.</p> <p>\u201cPundits expect that a lot will be riding on the first debate. The voters? Not so much,\u201d said Murray.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94f7ae4b0a785ec48bab4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-roberts\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:41:34.655Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Five awkward questions Hillary Clinton might field tonight:</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/24/trump-clinton-presidential-debate-styles-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54e38\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2746232\"            data-video-name=\"Trump v Clinton: an analysis of debate styles \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"DNC, RNC, MSNBC, CBS, CNN, NBC, Getty, Fox News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e61353e4b03598d1ce816b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/24/160924debfinal_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572835&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11572835&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/24/trump-clinton-presidential-debate-styles-video\">Trump v Clinton: an analysis of debate styles</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>What single policy should your campaign be known for?<br></strong>Harder than it sounds, or should be, this question gets at a weakness which many critics feels lies at the heart of the campaign. Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?<br></strong>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?<br></strong>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?<br></strong>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-awkward-questions\">10 awkward debate questions to put Clinton and Trump on the spot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94652e4b0593b3cb14e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:15:54.036Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the third-party candidates up to?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4/0_0_3957_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Stein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Stein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only two candidates to participate in tonight\u2019s presidential debate at Hofstra University on Long Island - polling limitations have limited the field to just the two major-party candidates, as has happened in every presidential debate since 1992 - but that doesn\u2019t mean that the other would-be presidents have given up on participating in some capacity.</p> <p>Former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson will watch tonight\u2019s debate from New York City with his running mate, Bill Weld, and will be livetweeting the proceedings from Twitter\u2019s offices in Chelsea.</p> <p>Green party nominee Jill Stein, meanwhile, plans to \u201cliterally insert herself\u201d into the debate tonight, responding to each of the debate questions via Periscope livestream.

He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?<br></strong>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?<br></strong>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?<br></strong>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?<br></strong>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own.

Universities often talk about bringing in the \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d but that can\u2019t really be the aim. After all, there are not enough of the very best to go round. What we need is to bring in staff who are both excellent and rather different from what we already have, to refresh the gene pool and protect against complacency. At the moment we reap the benefit of having one of the most open academic job markets in the world.</p> <p>Internationalisation of UK universities over the past few decades has been staggering, especially at postgraduate student level. To give a sense of the proportions, in <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/publications/students-2014-15/introduction\">2014-15</a>, 71% of full-time master\u2019s level students and more than half of PhD students came from overseas. This now makes it impossible to sustain our present university system on the basis of demand from home students alone. Falling demand will mean course closures, and perhaps even the closure of universities, most likely in those parts of the country that can least afford it, where the university is a major employer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/academics-brexit-research-peat-fears-eu-funds\">Academics feel blight of Brexit \u2013 from cancer research to peat projects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And if the overseas students cannot come to the UK, where will they go? Well, as they tell you at business school, today\u2019s customer is tomorrow\u2019s competition. Universities around the world, especially in the EU, have significant numbers of staff who were educated in the UK, and are fully capable of providing an innovative curriculum in English. In time UK universities would have felt this pressure in any case, but government policy promises our competitors a rosy future.</p> <p>The apparent silver lining, I suppose, is that slackening of demand will make it easier for the rising generation of UK students to get the place of their choice. The cloud, though, is that when they get there, they will find even the best universities to be less interesting, diverse and dynamic places than they may have been expecting.</p>",

Fox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/12/theresa-may-declines-to-endorse-liam-fox-attack-on-fat-and-lazy-uk-firms\">was told off for saying British firms were too \u201cfat and lazy\u201d</a> to be any good at exporting.</p> <p>So it was really only a matter of time for Boris. In an interview in New York, he told Sky News that Britain would trigger article 50 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/boris-johnson-uk-aiming-start-eu-brexit-talks-early-2017\">begin the formal two-year process of leaving the EU \u201cby the early part of next year\u201d</a>. </p> <p>No 10 declined to back him, saying pointedly that the government\u2019s position \u201chas not changed\u201d: in other words, article 50 won\u2019t be triggered before the end of 2016, and beyond that we\u2019re saying nothing. </p> <p>The incident prompted the satirical website the Daily Mash to report <a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/politics/politics-headlines/theresa-may-appoints-minister-for-contradicting-brexit-ministers-20160923114288\">that May had now appointed a minister \u201cspecifically charged with denying all statements by the ministers in charge of Brexit\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Johnson also said Brexit, which he reckoned could take less than two years, would allow Britain \u201cto benefit from fantastic opportunities for greater free trade with our friends in the EU\u201d (he did not say how) and repeated his view that Britain could have its cake and eat it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They\u2019d have us believe there\u2019s some automatic trade-off between what they call access to the single market and free movement.

In Berlin, the French and German finance ministers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/france-and-germany-brush-off-johnsons-eu-baloney-jibe\">Michel Sapin and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, could barely disguise their mirth</a>, exchanging glances before Sch\u00e4uble declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will gladly send her majesty\u2019s foreign minister a copy of the Lisbon treaty.

  "<p>When Sheffield University emailed and offered Fatemeh Roshan Ray a second chance a month before the A-level results were published she couldn\u2019t believe her luck. Fatemeh came to London alone three years ago at the age of 18 seeking asylum from Iran, and studied furiously for science and maths A-levels at Westminster Kingsway College. When Sheffield got in touch she already had an unconditional offer to study biomedical science at another big-name university, King\u2019s College London. But her dream was to study dentistry, one of the most competitive courses to net a place on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/sep/27/university-marketers-try-making-your-message-more-snapchatty\">University marketers: try making your message more Snapchatty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSheffield originally refused me a place for dentistry,\u201d she says. \u201cBut one month before A-level results day, they contacted me to say they would have some spaces in clearing. I had heard dentistry rarely goes through clearing so I wasn\u2019t expecting that. I am so happy to have got a place.\u201d</p> <p>Once the very idea of a Russell Group university such as Sheffield making the running to woo a student on a top course might have seemed preposterous. But senior figures in the sector say this is becoming much more common, as the market in higher education gathers pace and would-be students have more power than ever before.</p> <p>Now that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/13/record-number-university-admissions-cap-a-levels\">cap on student numbers</a> has been removed and fees have increased, many Russell Group universities want to expand. A limited pot of top-grade students to fish from means competition is fierce. The latest Ucas estimates are that there were about 1,000 fewer students with A-levels of ABB or higher this year than the year before.</p> <p>As a result, it seems that more students who dropped a grade or two in their A-level results were still able to get into their first-choice university. A Russell Group vice-chancellor, who wanted to remain anonymous, says: \u201cThere is a real game that is going on in many leading universities. The \u2018sticker price\u2019 may say three As but there is a big difference between that and the actual entry grades of many of the students they end up taking.\u201d</p> <p>A Russell Group spokesperson, while not commenting on this directly, says its universities are not lowering standards or compromising on quality, and recruit only students who can cope with their courses.</p> <p>A change that was highly visible this year was that all but a small handful of the leading research universities put courses \u2013 including some traditionally competitive ones \u2013 into clearing. But what parents and prospective students did not see were the compromises many universities made behind the scenes when they found out which of the applicants they made offers to had missed their grades. Universities admit privately that such compromises have become much more widespread right across the sector. And the \u201ctop end\u201d is certainly not immune. Ucas data shows that the proportion of applicants with BBB or equivalent at A-level being accepted to so-called \u201chigher tariff\u201d universities doubled over five years: from 17% in 2011 to 39% in 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/clearing-courses-record-number-a-level-results-ucas-universities\">Record number of clearing courses available to A-level students</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As one vice-chancellor says: \u201cThe first thing you do once you\u2019ve confirmed all those who met the grades is called \u2018softening\u2019.

A lot of institutions have been picking up a lot of lower-grade candidates through softening and no one knows.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Bloor, head of admissions at Sheffield Hallam University, explains: \u201cMost institutions will have made some decisions previously about what they may be prepared to accept. For instance, if you had a maths course and ask for BBB you might decide if a student has BCC but the B is in maths you would be prepared to take them.\u201d But he adds: \u201cNo one is in the business of recruiting irresponsibly.

The population of 18-year-olds is in decline, as is the number of students leaving school with A-levels. Previously this drop in the population, which began in 2009, was balanced by the increase in the number of students wanting to go to university. But now this growth seems to be levelling out, with the latest statistics from Ucas showing that as of 2 September full-time entry to UK universities is only 1% higher than last year.</p> <p>All this means it is a great time to be applying to university, and if you are likely to leave school or college with a reasonable set of A-levels Ucas says you will be in huge demand. Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, sums it up: \u201cProspective students are in a stronger position now than five or six years ago. Good students are being love-bombed with offers as soon as they send in their applications.\u201d</p> <p>And crucially many experts say students should be reacting to this newfound power by aiming high. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-hillman\">Nick Hillman</a>, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says: \u201cThe smart schools are working out that they need to be as ambitious as possible for their pupils. Then someone who gets BBB with an AAB offer can get on the phone and negotiate. The question is will the university turn a student down when they represent \u00a327,000? It\u2019s unlikely unless they are very many grades down or unlikely to complete the course.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago Ucas used to warn schools and parents that thousands of students were making a mistake in picking an insurance choice with the same high grades as their firm choice \u2013 potentially leaving them with nowhere to go if they missed their grades.

  "<p>Something has gone wrong in Britain, and the EU referendum result showed us \u2013 or at least, those of us who weren\u2019t already aware \u2013 what it is. The campaign and its aftermath exposed a society that has split along lines of class, region, age and culture, with fewer binding threads than at any point in recent history.</p> <p>On the day, huge swaths of the country voted by class and geography. This was hardly surprising, considering how tensions between the classes have been exploited mercilessly by politicians. Social and economic inequalities, particularly between the south-east and the rest of the country, and between major cities and outlying towns, <a href=\"https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/infographic-income-inequality-uk\">have grown</a>, and that growth been tolerated, for decades \u2013 to a point where it now threatens social and political stability.</p> <p>Looking at the coverage of the Brexit result, we were led to believe that the population of Britain can be easily sliced into tribes. The tribes to which the writers of newspaper articles and the producers of television news belong do not have to be named \u2013 they are, simply, \u201cpeople\u201d. Anyone who falls outside the urban, middle-class tribe is a \u201ccommunity\u201d \u2013 usually identified (however erroneously) by race or religion. In the absence of anything other than token representation, people who appear to fall into these groups have to be \u201cunderstood\u201d, rather than making their own case on their own terms.</p> <p>The late Richard Hoggart observed the widely held belief that a \u201cbloodless revolution\u201d had taken place in Britain following the second world war, based on the founding of the welfare state and the slow re-emergence of a consumer economy. But while we have been anticipating the classless society for decades, Hoggart pointed out that what he termed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/class-richard-hoggart-social-media\">the \u201ccoffin\u201d of class</a> remains empty. Now, the coffin has been shoved under the carpet. Anyone can see its outline if they look close enough, yet it stays there because no one knows what to do with it.</p> <p>British politicians have in recent years tended to treat both the idea of a distinct working class and the very words \u201cworking class\u201d as rhetorical poison, and have made strenuous efforts to avoid using them. Instead, they use such phrases as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/working-class-hard-working-families-labour-social-change\">hard-working families</a>\u201d, or \u201cordinary voters\u201d, for fear of alienating both middle-class voters and \u201caspirational\u201d working-class voters. More recently, however, they have found a different way to mention class: by prefixing \u201cworking class\u201d with the word \u201cwhite\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/10/working-class-hard-working-families-labour-social-change\">The working classes don't want to be 'hard-working families' | Selina Todd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People who are perceived to be part of this group, once created and labelled, can be called upon to express an opinion \u2013 for, of course, there is only one opinion \u2013 whenever a reporter or an MP in a marginal seat needs to appear as though they are in touch with a world outside the metropolis. In these circumstances the phrase \u201cwhite working class\u201d comes to mean \u201cpeople who sort of look like us but who don\u2019t seem to be like us, and we can\u2019t work out why\u201d.</p> <p>The idea that, in a group as heterogeneous as the British working class, it is only the white members who have been \u201cabandoned\u201d has proved magnetic to both columnists and politicians. It seems to date back to the electoral surge of the British National party at local elections in the early- to mid-2000s, and at the European parliamentary elections in 2009, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/08/labour-conservatives-condemn-bnp-europe\">it won two seats</a>. When the BNP looked to be on the verge of a breakthrough, public figures in the mainstream of political and media life asked why \u201cthe white working class\u201d \u2013 a loosely defined yet apparently clod-like mass \u2013 was supporting this regressive movement en masse.</p> <p>The assumption is that working-class people, when they feel marginalised, vote for fascists. But to be fearful and resentful is a choice; it does not go away with an increased pay packet. There are legions of well-housed, well-paid people \u2013 working class as well as middle class, and by no means always white \u2013 who consider themselves superior to others based on their skin colour, and countless more badly housed, badly off people who are no more driven to fascism than to veganism.</p> <p>The Labour party has, in its clumsy way, tacitly endorsed the idea of the \u201cwhite working class\u201d as a single electoral bloc in its attempts to address its unpopularity among some working-class voters. Under Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership, two key figures, the Labour peer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/16/maurice-glasman-peer-labour\">Maurice Glasman</a> and MP Jon Cruddas, developed a formula of \u201cconservative socialism\u201d to appeal to working-class voters based on \u201cfamily, faith and flag\u201d. Glasman waded in and out of arguments for limiting \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/19/blue-labour-immigration\">and even stopping</a> \u2013 immigration to Britain.</p> <p>In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Ed Miliband hired Arnie Graf, an American community organiser, as an adviser. Once the election was over, Graf wrote an article for <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2015/08/labours-failure-had-little-to-do-with-organisers-in-the-field/\">the Labour List website</a> telling how Labour\u2019s central staff had found it impossible to find a worker on the minimum wage to speak to Miliband for a press call, because none of them knew any.

It showed that richer people believed themselves to be far closer to the average than they really were.

It might be argued that a primary aspect of working-class experience, a feeling that most defines a certain way of being in the world, is loss. Loss is everywhere: the loss of optimism as experience victory-laps hope; the loss of loved ones to war, workplace accidents or ill health; the loss of a sense of home, going back generations, as families move repeatedly in search of relief from poverty; and the loss of a sense of place in a changing environment, such as when local businesses, which were one major employers, close down.</p> <p>From the 60s, when docks and mines began to close and Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government anticipated the coming death of heavy industry by heralding \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/sep/19/harold-wilson-white-heat-technology-speech\">the white heat of the technological revolution</a>\u201d, Britain began to move from a production model of what it meant to be working class \u2013 the class that makes things \u2013 to a consumption model \u2013 the class that buys things.</p> <p>In theory, this ought to have made the experience of being working class a lot more like the experience of being middle class, in the sense that anyone who had enough money could express their worldview partly through what they bought, and would be freed from some of the more stifling aspects of social interdependence by home and car ownership. Instead, their position, their status, was diminished in three ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/03/high-status-high-income-britains-new-working-class\">High status, high income: this is Britain\u2019s new working class | Lynsey Hanley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, through the dismantling of trade union power, which established and then protected rights and benefits for people who were out of work. Second, through negative propaganda, which sought to isolate the badly off from an upwardly mobile, consumerist working class. Third, through populist policy-making: for example, the right to buy, which divided local authority tenants into the \u201caspirational\u201d and the \u201cnon-aspirational\u201d, depending on whether or not they bought their council house.</p> <p>In the mid-70s, a sociologist named Paul Willis investigated the ways in which a group of schoolboys in the industrial West Midlands town of Wolverhampton subverted all attempts by teachers to get them to accept that they could play a part in a world outside the one they knew. Willis concluded that boys and girls respond in much the same ways to the imposition of values and practices that seem ridiculous to them and merely divert them from ways of life they know to be \u201creal\u201d, settled and achievable.</p> <p>\u201cThe lads\u201d, as Willis called them, worked hard to gain victories on their own terms: they were obsessed with \u201chaving a laff\u201d, which meant getting one over on the teacher, developing a parallel language of in-jokes and shared mumbles, while their work gave no indication of their actual capabilities.</p> <p>I knew those lads. You know, the funny thing is I never sat in the front row at school. I was always at the back: in the same row as the lads, but never with them. I thought they were throwing their lives away. They knew they were throwing their lives away, and yet they refused to acknowledge that that was what they were doing. The cost of one of them saying, \u201cCome on lads, we can have a laff outside of school, we\u2019re here to learn so we don\u2019t have to do jobs we hate later on,\u201d would have been too much for any one of them to stand. In any case, Willis argued, working-class males are trusted so little within the wider social structure, that even if \u201cthe lads\u201d had changed their minds and decided to work hard, there was no guarantee that it would have got them better jobs.</p> <p>Willis wasn\u2019t exactly saying that resistance, in the form of mild yet persistent insubordination, was futile \u2013 more that it was the boys\u2019 own habits of playing up, as much as the unfairness of \u201cthe system\u201d, that led them to become trapped in low-paid and unfulfilling jobs. He concluded: \u201cThere is an element of self-damnation in the taking on of subordinate roles in western capitalism \u2026 however, this damnation is experienced, paradoxically, as true learning, affirmation, appropriation, and as a form of resistance.\u201d Solidarity made sense to the lads because they understood that they were all headed for the same destiny and would need mates when they got there. In this way a survival strategy becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>It needs to be acknowledged that \u201chelplessness\u201d</strong> or \u201cdependency\u201d \u2013 as defined by politicians seeking to blame individuals for structural failings \u2013 is an adaptive stance rather than an innate fact of character. You can express your power, maintain the illusion of autonomy, preserve your dignity, by refusing to comply with what is asked of you by society.

To be \u201crespectable\u201d is to define yourself against that feeling: it is to believe, and to enact, the idea that you have power as an individual, as a household or as a community, in spite of your relative powerlessness in society. In the context of the referendum, \u201crespectability\u201d expressed itself in a sense that Britain \u2013 once proud, autonomous, dominant \u2013 had been taken away by Brussels, and that it was time to \u201ctake it back\u201d. People had a chance to cast a vote that, for once, had equal weight wherever it was placed. That voting to leave might have huge, destabilising consequences \u2013 precisely because of the fact that every individual vote counted \u2013 was beside the point. It was a stab at dignity.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>There is this idea that I keep coming back to: </strong>one of stalled mobility, the long-term psychological and social effect of the limitations placed on working-class people.<strong> </strong>This has nothing whatsoever to do with stunted intellect.

Back and forth it goes, between what we are told (albeit rarely explicitly) we are entitled to in terms of education, social standing, pay and political power, and what we tell others through our cultural choices. These boundaries are remade and reinforced through the places we find ourselves living and the places we tell ourselves we cannot go.</p> <p>In my experience, growing up and being educated in a working-class environment, it went without saying that some things were \u201cfor us\u201d and others were not. My grandparents read the Sun and my parents read the Mirror, while the Daily Mail seemed unattainably posh.

But the meaning attached to such respectability has changed. In the 80s, it was regarded as shorthand for the politically favoured affluent wing of the working class. A split that was already present was deliberately driven open, and to a great extent it worked.<strong> </strong>Organised labour no longer had a chance once you had to pick sides: unambitious council tenant or aspirational owner-occupier, sponging welfare dependant or dynamic entrepreneur.</p> <p>Respectability was recast, through policy and media, not just as a way for individuals and communities to hold depredation at bay, but as a moral crusade. Come the mid-90s, Labour\u2019s ideological spine was of a piece with the individualism of the 80s. But it sought to dress up the blunt Conservative language of \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, mate\u201d with a sophisticated, positive-thinking lexicon based on the persistent meme of \u201clivin\u2019 the dream\u201d. To feel discomfort about constant change \u2013 an emergent feature of globalisation \u2013 was to be inherently rightwing; yet equally, to believe in the strength of collective public institutions \u2013 such as unions, publicly funded health and education systems \u2013 was unhelpfully Bolshevik.</p> <p>For two generations now, the state has presented ever more forcefully the idea that working-class individuals need to change in order to qualify as full citizens. In the words of the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/dec/01/schools.uk2\">Val Gillies</a>, the education strategy of recent governments can be summed up thus: \u201cFor the sake of their children\u2019s future, and for the stability and security of society as a whole, working-class parents must be taught how to raise middle-class subjects.\u201d</p> <p>This process starts early, in accordance with notions of \u201cearly intervention\u201d being imperative for children from poor families if they are not to fail at school. The government offers <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds\">15 free hours of nursery care</a> universally to three-and four-year-olds. Two-year-olds also qualify if their parents are eligible for certain state benefits. While this latter allowance has been heralded as a way for low-income parents to return to paid work more easily, the subtext is that working-class children need to be removed from the malign influence of their working-class parents and educated into middle-class norms as early as possible.</p> <p>By comparison, middle-class parents and their children\u2019s teachers are from the same class, and therefore speak the same language. Whether the symbols of social class are encoded in clothes or hand gestures, or are made explicit through abstractions and vocabulary, they show to each other that they have similar sets of assumptions and the same broad understanding of the world. They will have the same broad set of desires for the child, and will understand implicitly what is required of the child in order for it to progress successfully and reproduce the state of \u201cbeing middle class\u201d.</p> <p>In the education system, as in the workplace, what is at stake for members of each class is represented by the conflict between individual advancement and solidarity with others. The irony is that the middle-class focus on doing well as individuals helps to consolidate the success of the group as a whole, while the relative working-class emphasis on solidarity can serve to increase tension and frustration between individuals.</p> <p>This is the paradox of trying to achieve social mobility through education, which is nothing more than a finely tuned replica of the larger social system it serves. Education is presented as a system in which anyone who works hard enough can achieve their potential,<strong> </strong>as is illustrated by the many cliches used in newspaper-speak and political rhetoric: as a \u201cbright but poor child\u201d on a \u201ctough estate\u201d, you \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and \u201cget on your bike\u201d to places of greater opportunity without waiting to be \u201clifted out of poverty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38a1185ec5ad4bdb58001f4f68bfb99d9d61bfe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a1185ec5ad4bdb58001f4f68bfb99d9d61bfe1/0_0_5184_3445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terraced homes in Oldham, Greater Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The state has long presented the idea that working-class people need to change in order to qualify as full citizens\u2019 \u2026 pictured, terraced homes in Oldham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The late Chris Woodhead, a former chief inspector of schools, believed that middle-class children do better at school because they have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/11/education-policy-class-bias\">better genes</a>\u201d, and felt that any attempt to raise the attainment of working-class children is unlikely to bear much fruit, owing to the simple fact that their teachers will inevitably be working with damaged, dunderheaded goods. <strong> </strong></p> <p>The ability of average-but-privileged people to regard themselves as \u201cbetter\u201d than others may go some way towards explaining why unprivileged students disproportionately avoid elite universities, even when they have the grades to apply for them \u2013<strong> </strong>a tendency that reinforces social disadvantage. The point is that education can break down the defences of class discrimination, but it can also reinforce them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The revolution, it turned out, never happened.</strong> It was stymied by the mechanisms of a class-bound education system, class-segregated housing, a media and cultural landscape that has persistently reinforced class prejudice, and a bizarre historic tendency for members of the British electorate to vote against their own interests.</p> <p>British society is not so much a pyramid as a diamond, with the lives of those at the top and the bottom resembling each other\u2019s in ways not obvious to the wide band in the middle. The contrast, of course, between the conditions at the top and those at stuck the bottom is that the former set you up for a smooth path through life and the latter for an extraordinarily difficult one.</p> <p>But there is a concentration of power at both ends of the diamond: the only difference is the milieu in which that power can be used. In the middle, power is diffused by dint of sheer numbers, and yet it is in the middle that power is aggregated and gets used most effectively. Because of its size it is the middle class, and not the \u201c1%\u201d, that sets the rules. This much larger group has the combined wealth, the qualifications, the social and cultural capital and, perhaps above all, the electoral influence to dictate much of our government policy, from tax to education.</p> <p>It is when people do not care about conforming to the middle-class version of \u201crespectability\u201d, and simply want comfort and security for themselves and their families, that promoters of the creed of social mobility start to worry.</p> <p>Acceptance is available to the socially mobile, but only if they \u201cdo\u201d social mobility the right way. To those on the right who regard social mobility as a good thing in itself, there is almost no point in undertaking upward mobility if it does not involve taking out a wholesale subscription to mainstream values, which often, though not always, means the dominant middle-class set of values.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What does it mean for society when the powerlessness of one class turns into the power to hinder the progress of others?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is dangerous, not to mention naive, to think you can climb easily out of a world from which no one you know has managed to escape.

That\u2019s just what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Another shrugs: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying, because I am no good at anything.\u201d Others point out the injustice of being told not to put your postcode on your CV because it is \u201cthe wrong one\u201d.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why you are more likely to hear a young person in, say, Blackpool or an estate outside Doncaster state that \u201cthere\u2019s no point in trying\u201d because they are \u201cno good at anything\u201d than someone in Bracknell or Tunbridge Wells. It is part of the baggage of coming from a place that is isolated \u2013 or has become isolated \u2013 and has too few decent jobs to go around. This is where a substandard quality of education, housing and transport collude to strike down individuals and areas that are already disadvantaged.</p> <p>In towns marked by the waste of assets, the waste of human potential, it is harder to imagine, against all immediate evidence, that it is possible to live anything other than a scrabbling, scrappy kind of life. People so often suppress anger about their circumstances that it forces itself out like steam at jarring points. It might be argued that this is precisely what happened on 23 June: not so much an incoherent howl of rage as a focused hiss of anger. If the rage of leave voters was expressed in the voting booth, the anger of remain voters boiled over after the result. Communities suffering economic hardship that had voted out of the EU were accused of ignorance, racism, isolationism, even self-sabotage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/07/angry-remain-voter-working-class-division-britain\">Angry remain voter?

The more polarised we become by advantage and its lack, the more thoughtlessly we will walk into parallel worlds of abundance and poverty, trust and suspicion.

So why not?</p> <p>My answers sound cynical, worldly and unworthy in the face of this surge of belief. Why not? Because Corbyn and McDonnell, burdened by their history, will never ever earn the trust of enough voters to make any plans happen. After George <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/17/budget-2015-osborne-austerity-labour-miliband-wavering-voters\">Osborne\u2019s lethally successful branding of Labour</a> as irresponsible, debt-ridden, magic-money-tree feckless borrowers, it will take heavy spadework of reassurance to win back trust. All McDonnell\u2019s plans are popular, but he offers nothing to allay the voters\u2019 fear that Labour doesn\u2019t do \u201ctough choices\u201d.</p> <p>At one conference meeting when a speaker said Labour must win some Tory votes, someone shouted out: \u201cWhy? We don\u2019t want Tories!\u201d So I find myself arguing dry psephology against passionate conviction. It\u2019s depressing, but here\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/under-corbyns-electoral-plan-prospects-for-victory-look-bleak/\">Fabian Society\u2019s analysis</a>: Labour needs 104 seats in England and Wales and 40% of the vote to win. In the marginals, four out every five of the extra votes must come from those who were Tory last time. Even if the young are energised and turnout soars to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/21/scottish-referendum-massive-voter-turnout-means-politics-changed-for-ever\">Scottish referendum heights</a>, it gets nowhere close. Even if every single Liberal Democrat and Green vote went Labour, that only gives 29 seats. Even if Ukip were crushed, its vote divides equally Labour and Tory. As Labour wins radical votes, it risks losing moderate votes to the Tories: 2% went that way last time. Read the research yourself and groan. It hurts.</p> <p>In one fraught conversation after another, I try all this on Corbyn believers but to no avail. No compromise, blocked ears, total denial of electoral facts, a post-truth conviction. You can hear this non-meeting of minds everywhere at this conference, a shutter of incomprehension dividing the two sides. \u201cBut we can convince them! People will listen!\u201d They do think Corbyn will be the next prime minister, because conviction moves mountains.

  "<p>Nobody warned the Hendawis about Canadian girls.</p> <p>Wadah and Raghdaa Hendawi survived the civil war in Syria, fleeing the devastation of Aleppo with their children for the relative safety of Lebanon. For three years their teenage sons missed out on an education while they worked to support the family.</p> <p>Then they hit the immigration jackpot \u2013 Canada.</p> <p>They were greeted at Halifax airport not by immigration officials or social workers, but by their sponsors \u2013 a bunch of well-meaning locals whose fundraising efforts would support the family for the next 12 months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/02/australia-resettles-only-a-sixth-of-promised-syrian-refugee-intake\">Australia resettles only a sixth of promised Syrian refugee intake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so the Hendawis arrived in the small fishing town of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, swaddled in new ski jackets, blinded by the winter sunshine bouncing off fresh February snow. They were the only Syrians in the village, and had no idea what was in store for them.</p> <p>The Rev. Joanne McFadden knew the names and ages of the family she was helping to sponsor, but apart from that she too didn\u2019t know what to expect.</p> <p>She certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for the phone call that came three days after Saed (18), Mohamad (16) and Ahmed (15) started attending Shelburne Regional High School.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I get a phone call from the principal. \u2018Uhhh, Joanne, we have a problem.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the problem, Mary?\u2019 \u2018Well, all the girls in the school are chasing the boys.\u2019 This hadn\u2019t even crossed our mind, right, that this was even a possibility. It was like, pardon me, we\u2019ve got some things to figure out.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Joanne\u2019s telling me this story six months later, over a dinner the Hendawis are hosting for their sponsors, Mohamad helpfully flexes his muscles, as if to explain his magnetic appeal to the local girls. It\u2019s true, all three boys are ridiculously good-looking, and Mohamad in particular knows it \u2013 but his brazen preening is an act put on for your amusement, and you can\u2019t help being charmed by him.</p> <p>With the Hendawi boys\u2019 charm making waves at school, McFadden enlisted the help of a volunteer interpreter (a Lebanese man who owns the local pizzeria) and sat down with Wadah and Raghdaa.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Her face was just ashen while I\u2019m saying, \u2018We have a little concern about the boys\u2019 situation at the school. Your sons are being pursued by all of the girls in the school who sort of want a conquest.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>Fears about young Arab men are not uncommon in Europe, where the refugee crisis and rightwing rhetoric have fuelled cultural tensions. But as I discovered in Nova Scotia, Canadians don\u2019t always follow the standard script.</p> <p>Canada has so much in common with Australia, and yet spending time there with Syrian families and their sponsors felt like stepping through a looking glass.</p> <p>This is a country where politicians tried to outbid one another during the last federal election with pledges to resettle Syrian refugees.</p> <p>It\u2019s a country in which no political party has an anti-immigration platform.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a country where the government, after fulfilling its promise to welcome 25,000 Syrians, was forced to extend the program after protests from would-be sponsors who\u2019d already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and signed leases for homes.</p> <p>More than 30,000 Syrians have arrived since November (excluding Quebec, which has its own settlement program), and almost half of those are being privately sponsored to some extent.</p> <p>While government-assisted refugees are usually settled in cities and large towns, families who are privately sponsored can end up anywhere. In more than 300 communities across the country, locals have banded together to provide housing, English classes, driving lessons, a crash course in Canadian customs (pot luck dinners, poutine) and, most important of all, friendship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107da95f9ccd86338a20ded50b1b2bd60a643ce0/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelburne local Bill Murphy took Wadah Hendawi to meet local fishermen \u2013 making contacts like this in the community may lead to job opportunities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amos Roberts/SBS Dateline</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trigger for this outpouring of compassion was a tragedy that touched people around the world last September \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/alan-kurdi-death-canada-refugee-policy-syria-boy-beach-turkey-photo\">the drowning of three year-old Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach.</p> <p>But unlike Australians, Canadians who were moved to do something actually could.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>When that picture became public, the phones were ringing off the hook,<em>\u201d </em>Naomi Alboim tells me. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep up with the phone calls and emails of people who wanted to help.\u201d</p> <p> Alboim is the co-founder of Lifeline Syria in Toronto, which recruits and trains sponsors, and she\u2019s involved in sponsoring two families herself. She was also instrumental in the first great wave of private sponsorship, which transformed Canada almost 40 years ago.</p> <p>From 1979-81 Canada resettled 60,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and half of those were sponsored. Alboim was the civil servant responsible for the program in Ontario.</p> <p>She says that ever since, sponsorship has become part of the national DNA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think everybody in Canada, and I don\u2019t think this is an exaggeration, was either directly involved or knew someone who was \u2013 their neighbour, their colleague, their friend, their relative, or themselves. People saw the Vietnamese population integrated very, very well. What I find most heart-warming, is that many of the Vietnamese refugees who were privately sponsored have now come forward to privately sponsor Syrian refugees.</p> </blockquote> <p>So are Canadians immune from the sort of fears (and Islamophobia) that are so common in other countries? Not entirely. But when I asked people in Shelburne if there had been any opposition or even unease at the prospect of a Muslim family being settled in their midst, there was precious little prejudice on display.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/british-royals-syrian-refugees-prince-william-kate-middleton-canada\">Syrian refugees in Canada hope British royals will advocate for 'people in need'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were a few concerns about supporting strangers while local families were struggling, and about newcomers taking jobs. And according to Bill Murphy, who\u2019s befriended Wadah Hendawi, there were some politically incorrect attempts at humour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some people would make a kind of wise crack comment you know, \u2018We\u2019ll just check them for vests when they come into the country\u2019. I heard that, but you never hear it now, that was all before the fact.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than six months later, there are now two Syrian families in Shelburne. Wadah surprised his sponsors by accepting a part time job bottling beer in the local craft brewery. And another refugee, Alaa Almanjar, has already opened a barbershop on the main street; as a result, one sponsor told me, \u201cWe have very, very well-groomed men for such a small town.\u201d</p> <p>And what of the Hendawi boys, who\u2019d unwittingly unleashed all those female hormones at the local high school?</p> <p>In the end, McFadden explained, the girls were told to be mindful that the boys had different cultural traditions and to slow down a bit.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that is good for me,\u201d Mohamad pipes up, \u201cbecause I am tired every time.\u201d</p> <p><em>See more of Amos Robert\u2019s story Tuesday night on <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/dateline/story/canadas-open-house\">Dateline</a>, 9.30pm on SBS.</em><br></p>"
