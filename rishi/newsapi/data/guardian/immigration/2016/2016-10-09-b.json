  "<p>Household spending bounced back last month, with people splashing out on theatre trips, restaurants and holidays, according to new figures.</p> <p>UK consumer spending was up 2.4% year-on-year in September, having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/uk-economy-near-standstill-brexit-vote-hits-investment-bcc\">broadly flat in August</a>, said payments company Visa. That was the fastest growth since April.</p> <p>The trend continued in September for people to prioritise spending on experiences over buying things. The fastest spending growth was in the recreation and culture industry followed by hotels, restaurants and bars. Contrasting with that, spending on clothes and shoes was down on a year ago.</p> <p>Taking the latest three months together, Visa said momentum remained subdued as households continued to digest the result of June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt is too early to say whether the growth seen in September will continue, and positive signs return more permanently following the soft patch that began in May,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, UK &amp; Ireland managing director at Visa.</p> <p>The figures, compiled for Visa by data company IHS Markit, showed e-commerce spending increased at the quickest rate since April, up 6% on the year, while face-to-face spending was broadly unchanged from one year earlier, edging up 0.1%.</p> <p>September\u2019s robust spending figures chime with signs consumer confidence also recovered last month, helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/14/uk-unemployment-data-brexit-stock-markets-business-live?page=with:block-57d90a83e4b067ad300878d7#block-57d90a83e4b067ad300878d7\">low unemployment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">record low interest rates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/13/uk-inflation-remains-unchanged-at-06\">relatively low inflation</a>.

Firms say they will have to pass at least some of those higher costs to customers.</p> <p>There are signs of inflationary pressures in a report from Lloyds Bank on Monday. Its survey of businesses in England and Wales found there was another steep rise in firms\u2019 input costs in September, which translated into higher prices charged for goods and services.</p> <p>\u201cThe weaker pound remains a focal point in the survey data. Improved competitiveness has no doubt given added impetus to the post-EU referendum rebound, but increasingly businesses are feeling the impact of higher import costs,\u201d said Tim Hinton, a specialist in banking for small and medium-sized companies at Lloyds.</p>",

It puts Trump in the realm of the irredeemable. Until now, he occupied that particular spot as the pre-redemption character in a feelgood movie. Maybe he was racist because his jet-set lifestyle had never supplied him any Mexican or Muslim friends; he was sheltered, but one day, like Clint Eastwood in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/20/gran-torino-film-review-clint-eastwood\" title=\"\">the movie Gran Torino</a>, he would move in next door to a family of immigrants, and realise they were just as hard-working as he was.

There is no story arc for this man, no journey; he can get no better, and we already knew that he could get no worse. So his narrative is broken. He can no longer be the anti-hero of his own film; he can only be the villain in somebody else\u2019s.</p> <p>If this is the end of Trump, that will be boon enough. But there are wider lessons here, for we\u2019ve now seen what happens to politics when its agents excise, despise or for any other reason fail to recognise the female point of view. This is apparent not just in Trump\u2019s excesses, but in the idiocy of the Brexit debate, its lunkheaded machismo studded with the fictions that become necessary when your authority has no basis.</p> <p>Our own Nigel Farage is, of course, a link between this kind of politics on both sides of the Atlantic and as chief British cheerleader for Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting\" title=\"\">he mounted a spirited defence</a> of his soulmate this weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s not running for pope, he\u2019s running for president,\u201d he said and that revealed much, not least that to Farage, treating women as something other than meat is piety sufficient for sainthood.

First, just because we\u2019re women doesn\u2019t mean we all agree; and the suggestion that we should is a textbook and profound political sexism of its own, rendering us less by denying us the freedom to individuate. Second, a conception of \u201cwomen\u2019s politics\u201d always takes as its starting point a demand for equality, and it makes no rational sense to limit that demand to equality between genders. There is no inequality between genders that isn\u2019t interlaced with inequalities of wealth, race and power, or if there is, it\u2019s not the most pressing. Third, the debating terms, when you talk about \u201cfemale issues\u201d often carry underlying prescriptions about how women should behave, which are themselves regressive and uninspiring. You can make the argument, forcefully, and on very solid turf, that any contraction of the state \u2013 be that in social care or services or public sector pay \u2013 will always fall disproportionately upon women, as they take up the burdens of care that the state once shouldered. While it may be true, that narrative isn\u2019t galvanising; I don\u2019t want to build a generous state on feminist grounds because I, by my nature, would otherwise spend my life mopping, tending and wiping. I reject care as a gendered activity.</p> <p>Nevertheless, everywhere, I see the potential for unleashing a female solidarity that could cut through turgid certainties and redraw ideological fault lines. Freedom from violence and reproductive autonomy are good muster points but don\u2019t go far enough. A constant eye on the future, a calm insistence that not everything of value can be counted, a love of international cooperation and respect for the institutions it has created, a knowledge that some things are too important to be left to the market, an empathy with the dispossessed: there is nothing essentially female about these ideas, yet where no women are, you never hear them. In the vacuum, you hear Trump and others like him.

Yet possibly still within living memory proponents of eugenics in America (and elsewhere) were advocating selective breeding to determine the future of society. It is worth noting that such ideas were grounded in the work of Francis Galton, who was a powerful influence on Cyril Burt, who in turn later developed the 11-plus exams. (His influence might be resurrected in the tests used to determine who is most fit for the new grammar schools we\u2019re promised.)</p> <p>Sally Phillips\u2019 programme does, therefore, offer a timely reminder of the dangers of embarking on a determinist view of society and the risk that selective breeding is acceptable. As Phillips reported, there is a lot of pressure to avoid a potential \u201cburden\u201d as an outcome of the wrong sort of foetus. In America the eugenicists gathered data purporting to show which sectors of society were more (or less) fit for the future. Favoured solutions proposed to avoid a future populated by those deemed to be \u201cunfit\u201d for society included restrictions on immigration and enforced sterilisation. There is much in the history of that movement to warn us of the dangers of a determinist future. It is, therefore, right to have the questions raised: what kind of society do we want; and how kind do we want society to be?<br><strong>Dr Simon Gibbs</strong><br><em>Reader in educational psychology, University of Newcastle</em></p> <p>\u2022 Hadley Freeman, in her opinion piece on A World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome, writes that it is genuinely shocking that BBC 2 decided to screen such a blatantly anti-choice message (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/sally-phillips-woman-unborn-baby-downs-terminate-pregnancy\" title=\"\">Sorry, Sally Phillips, but a woman should be able to know if her unborn baby has Down\u2019s syndrome</a>, theguardian.com, 6 October). Is she advocating censorship? In showing the joy her son with Down\u2019s syndrome brings to her family, Sally Phillips is trying to counter negative headlines and arguments. She is not anti-choice. She wants people to have better information. We mothers who have or have had sons or daughters with Down\u2019s syndrome should not be impeded from saying they enrich our families and lead valuable lives.

  "<p>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit minister, has said immigration is too high and called for it to be reduced as Britain leaves the EU, despite Jeremy Corbyn ruling out any cap on arrivals.</p> <p>In his first interview since being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/labour-reshuffle-jonathan-ashworth-shadow-health-secretary-nec-national-executive-committee\">recruited to the shadow cabinet</a> on Friday, the former director of public prosecutions appeared to disclose a different approach to migration controls to that proposed by the Labour leader in recent weeks. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The MP for Holborn and St Pancras, who has been touted as a future Labour leader, said the number of migrants should be reduced by tackling a skills shortage. \u201cThere has been a huge amount of immigration over the last 10 years and people are understandably concerned about it,\u201d he told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cI think it should be reduced and it should be reduced by making sure we have the skills in this country that are needed for the jobs that need to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he accepted that limits on immigration would mean an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/may-on-collision-course-with-backbenchers-seeking-soft-brexit\">end to free movement</a> and therefore a departure from the EU\u2019s tariff-free single market, Starmer said: \u201cWe have to be open to adjustments of the freedom of movement rules and how they apply to this country. We have to be shrewd and careful.\u201d</p> <p>His views <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\">seemingly contradict those of Corbyn</a>, who last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/28/corbyn-defence-of-immigration-splits-shadow-cabinet-labour\">appeared to rule out</a> a reduction in immigration. The Labour leader told delegates at the annual party conference: \u201cA Labour government will not offer false promises. We will not sow division or fan the flames of fear. We will instead tackle the real issues of immigration \u2013 and make the changes that are needed.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s spokesman went further, saying later: \u201cHe is not concerned about numbers.\u201d Rather than seeking controls on immigration, his spokesman said, Labour would seek to mitigate its effects on low-paid workers by reintroducing a \u201cmigrant impact fund\u201d.</p> <p>Sources close to Corbyn said he believes in trying to reduce the number of migrant workers in the UK, but doing so by ending the undercutting of pay through the exploitation of migrant labour. It is understood that the words attributed to Corbyn\u2019s spokesman, about a lack of concern over numbers, gave a misleading impression, which did not reflect the Labour leader\u2019s view.</p> <p>In the interview, Starmer made clear that he accepted the vote in June to leave the EU, but would challenge Theresa May\u2019s plans not to put the terms for Brexit to parliament. </p> <p> \u201cThe referendum is clear and has to be accepted. We can\u2019t have a rerun of the questions put to the country earlier this year, but there has to be democratic grip of the process. At the moment, the PM is trying to manoeuvre without any scrutiny. That is why the terms on which we are going to negotiate absolutely have to be put to a vote in the house,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He made his comments after it was revealed that the former Labour leader Ed Miliband had held discussions with pro-EU Tory MPs on Saturday and was said to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\">considering tabling an urgent question</a> in the Commons, demanding that May appear before parliament to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/brexit-court-case-government-to-dismiss-claim-that-parliament-must-vote-on-article-50\">explain its future role</a> in Brexit decisions, when MPs return on Monday.</p> <p>The SNP and the pro-EU Conservative MPs Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry were also considering tabling questions, while the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, now the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said it would be \u201cappalling\u201d if MPs did not vote on the detailed terms of Brexit, including the UK\u2019s future relations with the single market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/labour-can-win-immigration-enoch-powell-rachel-reeves\">Labour can win on immigration \u2013 but not by channelling Enoch Powell | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/mps-demand-vote-hard-brexit-single-market\">Speaking to the Observer</a>, Miliband said: \u201cHaving claimed that the referendum was about returning sovereignty to Britain, it would be a complete outrage if May were to determine the terms of Brexit without a mandate from parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no mandate for hard Brexit, and I don\u2019t believe there is a majority in parliament for [it] either. Given the importance of these decisions for the UK economy \u2026 it has to be a matter for MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer challenged the language <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/tory-plans-to-make-firms-list-foreign-staff-worse-than-trumps-muslim-ban\">used by the home secretary</a>, Amber Rudd, when she proposed that companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/amber-rudd-defends-proposal-to-make-firms-reveal-foreign-staff-numbers\">should list the numbers</a> of foreign workers they employ, but said the proposals themselves were neither xenophobic nor silly. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we shouldn\u2019t do is fan the flames of division.

Every game has something to reflect on,\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cAnd tonight it was about winning your individual battles, staying tough, waiting for the moments to shine. But most importantly, tonight was about team.\u201d</p> <p>Badji scored Colorado\u2019s first in the 12th minute from a lovely pass on the turn from Dillon Powers, but Manotas equalised just before half-time when he turned in Sheanon Williams\u2019s cross.</p> <p>But nine minutes into the second half, the Rapids went ahead for a second time: Powers showed some great feet to send Badji clear, and he clipped a finish over Joe Willis. Gashi made it three with a left-footed strike from 20 yards after another Houston turnover.</p> <p>Colorado were missing Kevin Doyle and Jermaine Jones, and Mastroeni had only positive words for their replacements.</p> <p>\u201cGuys have stepped up when the other guys haven\u2019t been here.\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cWhat that does, is it builds an incredible amount of camaraderie in the locker room.

If we relied on two or three players, we\u2019d be dead in the water.\u201d</p> <p>Wade Barrett, Houston\u2019s coach, praised his team\u2019s fight, but admitted the defending could have been better.</p> <p>The game could have really gone south after that point [Rapids third goal] so I\u2019m impressed with the fight from the group to get it back to 3-2,\u201d Barrett said.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to be competitive in every single game we play. We want to get to the last 10 minutes, to the last kick of the game with a chance to get something from every single game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust disapointed with the way that we gave the goal up,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cBut it\u2019s collective.

  "<p>If the US presidential campaign conveys a flavour of unreality, that may be because it is rooted in fiction. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis sat down to write a novel about political radicalisation and social upheaval in the depression-ravaged US. What emerged after four months of feverish work was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here\">It Can\u2019t Happen Here</a>, a runaway bestseller that quickly sold more than 300,000 copies.</p> <p>Lewis was alarmed by what was taking shape in the country. The New Deal had delivered a false sense of optimism to the Federal Reserve, if not to the millions queueing at the soup kitchens. The money supply was tightened in anticipation of a sustained rally, government spending was cut and taxes were raised. As a result, the US was pushed to the cusp of a double-dip depression, with manufacturing back to its 1934 level and unemployment up by 5%.</p> <p>This created fertile ground for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin\">Father Charles Coughlin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long\">Huey Long</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst\">William Randolph Hearst</a> and other fanatics to spread the gospel of bigotry. It was no fleeting backlash: on the eve of the second world war, the German American Bund <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gU9op16rjQ\">packed more than 20,000 militants into Madison Square Garden in New York for a pro-Hitler rally</a>. To wild applause, their leader, Fritz Kuhn, derided the US President as Franklin D \u201cRosenfeld\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"266d3cee065b072c66a344d392e408ca1d1a7634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/266d3cee065b072c66a344d392e408ca1d1a7634/110_0_2402_3000/801.jpg\" alt=\"Huey Long\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controversial Louisiana senator Huey Long, who was accused of being a demagogue, was assassinated in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis\u2019s antihero is the ignorant demagogue Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip, who wins the 1936 election with the support of millions of impoverished and angry voters.

We want Buzz!\u201d</p> <p>Windrip could count on a number of real-life champions who appear in the novel, such as the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. In 1935, the man widely regarded as responsible for goading the US into the Spanish-American war proclaimed: \u201cWhenever you hear a prominent American called a fascist, you can usually make up your mind that the man is simply a loyal citizen who stands up for Americanism.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s hero, the New England journalist Doremus Jessup, attends a Windrip rally in Madison Square Garden. Jessup reports that Windrip\u2019s rhetoric was irresistible to his thousands of downtrodden admirers. He later can\u2019t remember a word Windrip said. But it doesn\u2019t matter: if Windrip contradicts himself, backtracks on policy or simply spews out a torrent of lies, he tells them what they want to hear. Every American will be guaranteed a minimum income of $5,000 ($88,000 in today\u2019s money), US-hating Mexico will be severely dealt with and Jewish bankers will be punished for landing the country in this mess.</p> <p>Windrip unveils his 15-point manifesto, which includes \u201cprison or the death penalty\u201d for anyone advocating communism and the recognition of Jews as \u201cfully Americanised\u201d, so long as they continue to support \u201cour ideals\u201d. Substitute \u201cMuslim\u201d for \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cHispanic\u201d for \u201cJew\u201d and there emerges an uncomfortable picture of what is taking place in the US today.</p> <p>Windrip wins the election. He orders the invasion of Mexico, after which his victorious militia returns singing When Johnny Comes Marching Home. Political opponents are herded into concentration camps, while a flood of refugees flee across the border to Canada.</p> <p>In the end, though, it is only a work of fiction \u2013 and millions of Americans cling to the belief that it will remain so.

The attack has been condemned by the UN, the European Union and the United States. </p> <p>The issue is embarrassing for the US since it has decried the Russian failure to be more open about its role in the air attack on a UN aid convoy in Syria, and it will face allegations of double standards if it allows the Saudis to delay an inquiry. </p> <p>The US, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/07/mps-poised-to-call-for-suspension-of-uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\">like the UK</a>, supplies arms to Saudi Arabia and practical military advice, even though the precise extent of that advice is disputed.</p> <p>White House national security council spokesman Ned Simon said: \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by reports of [the] airstrike on a funeral hall in Yemen, which, if confirmed, would continue the troubling series of attacks striking Yemeni civilians. US security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank cheque. </p> <p>\u201cEven as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defence of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged. In light of this and other recent incidents, we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen\u2019s tragic conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The UK foreign office minister Tobias Ellwood also called for the Saudis to urgently investigate. Reuters quoted Saudi officials as denying any strike and insisting its air force has clear instructions to avoid such targets. The Foreign Office has insisted UK arms export licences to Saudi Arabia do not need to be revoked since there was no serious risk of a breach of humanitarian law.</p> <p>In an unexpected twist, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks even though it is thought the deaths were caused by an air raid, and Isis has no access to aircraft.</p> <p>The Saudi-led coalition issued a statement saying it was aware of reports about the \u201cregrettable and painful\u201d bombing of the Great Hall in Sana\u2019a. The coalition expressed its deepest condolences and support to the families of the victims of hostilities in Yemen since 2014.</p> <p>The statement added: \u201cThe coalition confirms that its troops have clear instructions not to target populated area and to avoid civilians. The coalition will immediately investigate this case along with Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) in Yemen.\u201d</p> <p>A call for an independent UN-led investigation into general breaches of humanitarian law in the 18-month conflict were last month fended off by Arab states at the Human Rights Council in favour of a compromise that allows the UN to advise a national inquiry.

It has faced repeated accusations that its campaign has breached international humanitarian law and last month the Guardian published data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/third-of-saudi-airstrikes-on-yemen-have-hit-civilian-sites-data-shows\">more than a third of the coalition\u2019s airstrikes had hit civilian sites</a> such as schools, hospitals, markets, mosques and economic infrastructure.</p> <p>The Houthi rebels are also accused of human rights violations, including the use of landmines and indiscriminate shelling.

It had taken many of them down with it, but had emptied others into the Mediterranean.</p> <p>That day, the Mennas and their friends rescued 47 desperate people from the water, pulling them aboard their yacht made for 10.

Though a small book, just 120 pages between its hard sea-blue covers, this is no extended exercise in reportage. Instead, Kirby tells it as a moral tale, following events through the eyes of the fastidiously ordinary optician never named in the text and thereby transformed into an everyman.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/refugee-rescues-continue-winter-greece-agathonisi\">'Help, we're sinking': aboard a refugee rescue boat in the perilous Greek seas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the days before the rescue, he watches at a distance as migrants arrive&#xa0;on his island, staying briefly before being transferred to the mainland.

  "<p>The outlook grows ever grimmer for Bristol. They did at least manage a second bonus point of the season, courtesy of a determined second-half comeback, but they remain seven points adrift at the bottom of the league they have fought so long and hard to return to. Already it looks a yawning gap, notwithstanding a solid pack of forwards, who if anything had the better of things throughout. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough games,\u201d said Andy Robinson, Bristol\u2019s director of rugby. \u201cThere\u2019s belief. When we stuck to task and structure today we looked a good side. We need players to be able to sustain that for the whole 80 minutes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/exeter-rob-baxter-jack-nowell-england-eddie-jones\">Exeter\u2019s Rob Baxter slams England training camp after Jack Nowell injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aye, there\u2019s the rub. The 80-minute thing has been a serious problem for Bristol. That said, the 80-minute thing works both ways. Dean Richards bemoaned the same of his side and the way they let Bristol back into the contest, before declaring that very few teams can keep it up for a whole match. </p> <p>Bristol\u2019s problem is the damage they suffer during the inevitable lulls, which in their case seem to last entire halves. Here it was the first when they looked out of their depth against opponents who can play a bit, which means pretty much everyone they will face in the Premiership. </p> <p>Newcastle are disappointed they did not register a bonus point themselves, of the try-scoring variety, but with this win they float serenely into the top six. They were mesmeric at times in the first half of a free-flowing contest, despite losing two members of their back division to injury, in the 10th and 11th minutes. Dom Waldouck, the second of those, staggered across the artificial turf in spectacular fashion after a blow to the head, and Bristol lost their fly-half, Tusi Pisi, at the same time. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, it was the hosts who handled the disruption better. They were 5-0 up already, but through it they may just have stumbled upon a bewitching cocktail of creativity. </p> <p>It probably won\u2019t work so well if placed under more defensive scrutiny than here, but the new axis of Mike Delany, Juan Pablo Socino and Joel Hodgson worked sweetly in attack. Not that there is any significance to that running order, other than the shirt numbers they happened to be wearing. The Falcons ended up, effectively, with three fly-halves on the field, and Bristol were indeed bewitched. </p> <p>Socino scored that first in the fifth minute, when he capitalised on a mix-up between Ryan Edwards and Jack Tovey down Bristol\u2019s left, which Robinson ruefully highlighted as the difference between the two teams, come the end. Socino, certainly, could play anywhere across the midfield, a bundle of pace and power, but Hodgson was as good to watch in a blonder, willowier way. </p> <p>The former, taking a turn at first receiver off an attacking scrum, put the other through a gap in the outside-centre channel for try No3, just before the break. Before that, Socino, Delany and maybe a few others had combined in a dazzling exchange of passes down the right to set up position, before Will Welch finished a series of drives at the posts for try number No2. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/leicester-worcester-premiership-match-report\">Telusa Veainu try illuminates dominant Leicester win over Worcester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 19-0 down, Bristol were in trouble. If there was hope, it lay in their set piece. They had the edge at scrum time in the first half, at least, and at the start of the second, the lineout got going too. A powerfully driven example set up Jon Fisher for their first try, in the 50th minute. Ten minutes later, they struck again, Fisher to the fore once more in a series of punchy phases, paving the way for Mitch Eadie to stroll over, and Bristol had hope at last. </p> <p>They could draw no closer. Newcastle had the better of the final exchanges, during which Hodgson missed a penalty, which would have deprived the visitors of a bonus point. Both sides lost a prop to the sin bin when Wayne Barnes very suddenly lost patience at a late scrum. A sour note on which to finish a fine match.

  "<p>Home secretary Amber Rudd does not want to be called a racist. \u201cDon\u2019t call me a racist,\u201d she said last week. To be fair, very few people, including the majority of racists, like being called racist. You have to be really very racist not to mind the label. Racist voters, while they often like racist policies and racist politicians, don\u2019t, in general, like them to actually call themselves racist. They\u2019re not comfortable with it being openly proclaimed. For now. Things haven\u2019t got that bad.</p> <p>I think maybe lots of racists don\u2019t think they\u2019re racist. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m racist, so maybe I\u2019m racist. Maybe everyone is, to some extent. Maybe it\u2019s a spectrum. But not thinking they\u2019re racist is almost certainly an attribute that many non-racists and racists share. Then again, liberal guilt being what it is, some non-racists probably think they\u2019re racist \u2013 as, obviously, do the more self-aware racists. So, whichever way you look at it, there\u2019s loads of common ground.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can hardly think of a more damning slur on the British workforce than this proposed policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is Amber Rudd racist? That\u2019s the key question. Unless racism is a spectrum, in which case it\u2019s \u201cIs she <em>too</em> racist?\u201d There would have to be a specific point on that spectrum beyond which the level of a person\u2019s racism became unacceptable, and before which you\u2019d sort of have to go along with it for practical reasons. In the end, it all just reverts to the binary. It\u2019s a black and white issue.</p> <p>So, is the home secretary racist? I feel like, the more I ask the question, the more racist she seems. Well, it\u2019s her fault for saying \u201cDon\u2019t call me a racist.\u201d She put it in our heads \u2013 it\u2019s almost saucy. After all this, to conclude she\u2019s not racist would feel like a bit of a shame. Like a whodunnit where the denouement is that it was natural causes.</p> <p>But I suppose we should look at the evidence. Where did all this talk of suspected racist Amber Rudd\u2019s suspected racism come from? Well, she made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\">a speech at the Conservative party conference</a>. \u201cAh well, that explains it!\u201d you\u2019re probably thinking but, in fact, there\u2019s even more to it than that. There was an issue with the contents of the speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5c899db58bf98820134e3e84ef1278e0aeb9989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5c899db58bf98820134e3e84ef1278e0aeb9989/0_0_1884_2664/707.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of a giant hand singling out one man among many\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is surprising as, having watched some of it, I found it very difficult to discern what the contents were. It\u2019s the rhetorical equivalent of small print. She reads it in a sort of bland lilt, like a recorded voice in a lift. The actual words are extremely hard to grip on to. You can hear the audience dutifully applauding every so often, from which I concluded that a rather undramatic cricket match was being played at the other end of the hall.</p> <p>Nevertheless someone managed to work out what the contents were. Perhaps they played a recording through a speech recognition app, printed the text out in bold, capitalised Comic Sans and then read it next to a blaring smoke alarm after an overdose of ProPlus. And what she apparently said was that firms should be forced to reveal what percentage of their workers are foreign \u2013 initially just non-EU but, post-Brexit, non-UK \u2013 and to make greater efforts to employ, or to train and employ, British workers, instead of recruiting abroad.</p> <p>This threat to \u201cname and shame\u201d companies that hire lots of foreigners went down very badly with many people. Labour said it would \u201cfan the flames of xenophobia and hatred in our communities\u201d, the SNP called it \u201cthe most disgraceful display of reactionary rightwing politics in living memory\u201d and LBC\u2019s James O\u2019Brien said it was <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/james-amber-rudds-speech-echoes-mein-kampf/\">\u201cenacting chapter two of <em>Mein Kampf</em>\u201d</a>.</p> <p>This, in turn, caused Rudd to clarify that all this was just part of a \u201creview\u201d and \u201cnot something we are definitely going to do\u201d, but also to assert that \u201cpeople want to talk about immigration, and if we do talk about immigration, don\u2019t call me a racist\u201d. I don\u2019t think I can agree to that. We\u2019ve all long since wearily acknowledged the old Nigel Farage cliche that mentioning immigration doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re racist. But, let\u2019s be honest, if you could take out an insurance policy against being racist, mentioning immigration would put your premiums up.</p> <p>But obviously, whether Amber Rudd is racist (or, perhaps more pertinently, xenophobic) or not depends on what she\u2019s actually saying about immigration. And she\u2019s basically saying that, for a British company, employing a non-British national should be a last resort. Companies should do all they can \u2013 with advertising and training \u2013 to fill jobs locally, in the knowledge that if they fail too often, the percentage of foreigners they employ will be made public. In short, they shouldn\u2019t employ a foreigner just because he or she happens to be the best person for the job. Given time and effort, they should be able to find someone British who\u2019ll do.</p> <p>So, no, I don\u2019t really think Amber Rudd is xenophobic. It\u2019s not foreigners she despises, it\u2019s the British. I can hardly think of a more damning slur on the British workforce than this proposed policy. It takes British workers\u2019 inferiority as a given, as its premise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/amber-rudd-sofa-factory-boss-disappointed-criticism-staffing-collins-hayes\">Sofa factory boss 'disappointed' by Amber Rudd's staffing criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is already harder for firms to employ foreigners than locals \u2013 foreigners either have to get here or, if they\u2019re already here, be allowed to stay. That\u2019s not an issue with a British worker. English may not be their first language, which can cause problems. That\u2019s not an issue with a British worker. Laws already in place mean that companies have a considerable incentive to employ locally if they can. But Rudd has looked at the British workforce and decided they need much more help.</p> <p>A fair criticism of foreign labour is that it can undercut the cost of British workers \u2013 that it drives wages down; that, frankly, people from poorer countries are willing to work for less than the British are. If that\u2019s the concern, a sound government response would be to raise the minimum wage, not to threaten to expose companies as unpatriotic if they don\u2019t voluntarily inflate their own labour costs.</p> <p>This threat of exposure is what illustrates Amber Rudd\u2019s anti-Britishness most shockingly. She is convinced that revealing to the public that a firm employs a high percentage of foreigners will be disastrous to its image. She thinks this nation which so many peoples over the centuries, from Celts, Romans and Angles to Jamaicans, Bangladeshis and Poles, have made their home, will no longer stand for the employment of immigrants. She may not be racist, but she certainly thinks we are.</p>",

All the vignettes, which satirise social norms and embrace all things taboo, collide in the final scene of each episode.I\u2019ve never seen such a daring and conceptual sketch show since.</p> <h2>5 | Food</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/texmex\" title=\"\"><strong>Tex-Mex</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a00d85e87a08e85ed2efe2c1a87cb7b07243dd70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a00d85e87a08e85ed2efe2c1a87cb7b07243dd70/0_208_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tacos filled with migas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tacos filled with migas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leigh Anne Meeks/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some woefully misinformed people consider Tex-Mex to be a corruption of Mexican food rather than a glorious hybrid&#xa0;cuisine influenced by indigenous tradition, war, immigration and limited resources.

Jeanne Dielman is a woman stuck in a banal cycle of housekeeping, making meals for her son and prostituting herself in her tiny flat. The film takes place over three days and there isn\u2019t much difference in each day\u2019s regimen of tasks; as a viewer, you\u2019re forced into the severe and relentless dullness that is Jeanne\u2019s life. It\u2019s hard to recommend a film that has very little dialogue, and is essentially three hours of a woman cleaning a small apartment, but for those brave enough to see it through to the climactic final scene, it was possibly the most exhilarating experience I\u2019ve had in a movie theatre. Worth it? Absolutely.</p> <h2>7 | Music video</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chidzbKpd68\" title=\"\"><strong>Hot Heads by Terry</strong></a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chidzbKpd68\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chidzbKpd68?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chidzbKpd68\">Watch the video for Hot Heads by Terry.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://terryhq.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Terry</a> is a band of four wonderful and talented Aussies.

  "<p>\u2018We\u2019ll have eight beers, a jug of fermented mare\u2019s milk and a plate of the horsemeat sausage please.\u201d As apr\u00e8s-ski rounds go, it\u2019s an unusual one. But then a truck stop in rural Kyrgyzstan is far from your average slope-side bar. And instead of the Alpine offering of <em>vin chaud, </em>tartiflette and herbal liqueur <em>g\u00e9n\u00e9pi</em>, it serves <em>Kymyz</em> (also called <em>kumis</em>, a bitter, alcoholic concoction made of horse\u2019s milk) and <em>be\u015fbarmaq</em> (horse sausage served with noodles). The clientele, mostly lorry drivers, seem slightly bemused by our presence, and grin as we take turns trying the strange fare.</p> <p>But if the restaurants around the Suusamyr Freeride Lodge lack the sophistication of those in Alpe d\u2019Huez, the area makes up for it with the quality of the skiing. Our group of 15 have enjoyed fresh powder every single day. Each morning, we\u2019ve tackled a different zone of the mountain range around our lodge and we\u2019ve come across no one\u2019s tracks but our own.</p> <p>Kyrgyzstan\u2019s extreme continental climate means that the snow that falls on this former Soviet state is particularly light and fluffy. This, combined with the country\u2019s mountainous geography, makes it something of a paradise for powder-loving backcountry skiers and snowboarders.</p> <p>Until recently, though, the problem was getting to it. If Kyrgyzstan\u2019s Tien Shan range lags behind the Alps or the Rockies when it comes to apr\u00e8s facilities, it\u2019s arguably even more backward in terms of resort infrastructure. There are a few ski hills scattered around but their lift systems, often relics from the Soviet era, are limited. However, in the past few years several pioneering operations have sprung up, offering solutions to this lack of access.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each morning we\u2019ve tackled a different zone of the mountains around our lodge and we\u2019ve seen no one\u2019s tracks but our own</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are maybe five or six piste-bashers in Kyrgyzstan,\u201d says Azret Daniiarov, owner and manager of Suusamyr Lodge, \u201cand we have two of them.\u201d His lodge is the first (and, so far, only) outfit in the country to offer \u201ccat-skiing\u201d \u2013 using modified piste-bashers with passenger cabins to shuttle groups of skiers and snowboarders up the hill. Dubbed \u201cthe poor man\u2019s heli-skiing\u201d, the system was invented in North America, where piste-bashers are known as snowcats. It makes perfect sense here in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the broad Suusamyr valley, where relatively gentle slopes make cat access easy.</p> <p>In fact, the site wasn\u2019t picked with skiing in mind, Azret says. He and his father built the lodge as a paragliding base for the summer season. But their first snowcat, imported three years ago, proved popular with their friends and, last winter, their first full season in operation, they had around six or seven groups from Europe. \u201cMost came from Germany, some from Norway. Some of those Norwegians, they were really crazy,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9be516197ace74d6374fbe2c105c92d7cf3f2a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9be516197ace74d6374fbe2c105c92d7cf3f2a8/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suusamyr Lodge uses modified piste-bashers with passenger cabins to take groups of skiers to the piste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suusamyr Lodge uses modified piste-bashers with passenger cabins to take groups of skiers to the piste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Medhurst</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like my group, the Germans and Norwegians were doubtless attracted not just by the promise of incredible snow and the sense of adventure, but also by the price. Our group is big enough to fill the place and so the week, including six days\u2019 cat time, food and accommodation, comes to just \u00a3620 a head. With flights, the whole adventure costs around the same as an average chalet holiday in the Alps, once lift-passes have been factored in.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not quite the luxury Canadian cat-skiing experience. The lodge, which Azret helped build himself, is functional rather than stylish. But the rooms are warm and cosy and the central area, with its TV, ping-pong, and table football, is a fun place to spend the evenings.</p> <p>The food is similarly simple \u2013 hearty Kyrgyz fare with lots of rice, noodles and kebabs \u2013 but it\u2019s tasty and exactly what you need after a day on the hill. And there are always the three \u201crestaurants\u201d (two of them are little more than shipping containers) clustered around the petrol station down the road, if you fancy an equine-flavoured alternative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dubbed \u201cthe poor man\u2019s heli-skiing\u201d, cat-skiing makes perfect sense in a country with few ski lifts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our evening in the truck stop certainly reinforces how remote Suusamyr is but, of course, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. If anything, the feeling is more pronounced up the mountain. The cat-access areas that Azret uses on regular rotation offer fairly easy riding and are relatively safe as far as backcountry goes (although carrying avalanche safety equipment and knowing how to use it are essential).</p> <p>On the penultimate day, however, a small, experienced group of us decide to hike higher than the cat can drive in search of steeper, more challenging terrain. This whole stretch of mountains is so remote that the lines we\u2019re taking are not just unridden this week, they\u2019ve never been ridden by anyone before.</p> <p>In a more popular (or populous) mountain range, only the very best skiers would get to open up new routes. Yet out here, they\u2019re there for the taking. There are real dangers though. When I trigger an avalanche on the second-to-last run down, it\u2019s a scary reminder of how far we are from home \u2013 or the nearest hospital.</p> <p>If that slide serves as a bit of a wake-up call, it doesn\u2019t put the group off their stride for long. Our final day sees us back in the cat, riding until the sun dips behind the western ridge, but still clamouring for more as we head homewards.</p> <p>As long as you\u2019re careful, the snow in Suusamyr is simply too good not to enjoy. And if those apr\u00e8s shots taste like gone-off yoghurt?

  "<p>\u2018How to talk about it? That\u2019s been a struggle from the start.\u201d Jeff Edwards, 58, pauses and shifts his weight in the armchair. We\u2019re sitting in the front room of his house in Aberfan where for the past hour Jeff has been describing for me some of the difficulties experienced by the village in trying to negotiate the ongoing tightrope between memorial and healing, between sharing and silence, in the wake of the disaster that befell them 50 years ago. \u201cPersonally I found speaking about it better for me,\u201d he continues, \u201cin terms of my recovery. But other people, well, they just cannot speak about it at all.\u201d</p> <p>It was the last Friday before half term \u2013 21 October 1966 \u2013 and, like hundreds of other children across Aberfan, Jeff set off for school that day looking forward to the holiday ahead of him. School would finish early, at midday, after which lay the promise of a whole week of playing with his friends in the orchards and farmed fields on the slopes above the village. A heavy autumnal mist was still lying thick in the valley when Jeff left his home for school. From early on, however, Aberfan had made itself heard, if not seen. Children who lived at the bottom end of the village, near the \u201cblack bridge\u201d, would have woken to the colliery hooter at Merthyr Vale pit sounding the change of shift, and to the rattling of the \u201cjourneys\u201d too \u2013 drams [trucks] on tracks carrying coal waste, tailings and grit up to the top of tip No 7, looming on the mountainside above the rows of terraced houses.</p> <p>Children who lived at the other end of town would have woken to more rural sounds: cockerels, the bleating of sheep on the hill or dairy farmers bringing their herds in for milking. Jeff lived in the middle of the village, on Aberfan Road next to the chapel, so it was sounds of commerce rather than industry or farming that greeted him of a morning: shopkeepers letting down their awnings, deliveries being made, stock being put out on display.</p> <p>As he did every school day, Jeff met up with his friends Robert and David and together they made their way through the ash-lined \u201cgullies\u201d, the back lanes of the village, up towards Pantglas junior school, stopping in at Anderson\u2019s sweet shop to buy some shrimps and flying saucers. Elsewhere in the village, other children were travelling to Pantglas by bus; Mrs Jennings, the headmistress, was waiting, as she always did, at the top of the school steps; Jack-the-Milk was doing his rounds up Moy Road; Mr Benyon, a towering rugby player of a teacher, was preparing his classroom; and on the top of tip No 7 a crane driver had discovered that the point of the tip had slipped, shifting his crane tracks out of position. The telephone wires into the valley had been stolen, so the driver sent a slinger down to let the charge-hand know instead. The mist was still so thick that within a few feet of his descent the slinger had faded out of sight. Not long after he\u2019d gone, a farm woman, out on the hill to feed her stock, noticed the telegraph wires disappearing into the mist towards Merthyr were shaking wildly, as if they\u2019d been grabbed \u201cby a giant hand\u201d.</p> <p>Down in Pantglas school, assembly had finished and the children were in their classrooms settling at their desks, or in the hall, collecting dinner tickets. Janet Bickley and Bernard Thomas, both in a classroom at the front of the school, remember hearing a gathering rumbling sound, like thunder, as they got out their books and began reading. But unlike thunder, this sound became louder, like a massive approaching train. And then louder still, like an aeroplane diving. Seconds later the collapsing tip No 7 broke through the canal bank and over Pantglas school and a row of houses along Moy Road, enveloping and crushing them under thousands of tonnes of slurry, coal waste and tailings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b12133b19172219fb98fa047ad1dbf8cccbd3ea0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b12133b19172219fb98fa047ad1dbf8cccbd3ea0/0_97_2878_1886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Edwards, aged eight, photographed a few days after being rescued in October 1966\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Edwards, aged eight, photographed a few days after being rescued in October 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IC Rapoport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within hours the site of the slippage was crawling with rescuers searching for people trapped in the still-moving slurry and the name of Aberfan, which had woken unknown that morning, was spreading across the world as news of the disaster broke.</p> <p>Initially the rescuers were people from the town. Family members, shopkeepers, bank clerks, digging with their hands and garden tools, the chimneys of the houses still smoking through the rubble. Then the fire brigade came, then miners from the pit, volunteers from across the country, an NCB rescue team, the army. Every few minutes the frantic digging would pause as the teeming rescuers stopped to listen for sounds under the waste. Around 11 o\u2019clock Jeff Edwards was pulled from the wreckage of the school. He was the last child found alive. After that, each bout of listening was only ever met with silence. Within a few days\u2019 time that silence had a figure: 144 people had been killed, 116 of them children aged between three months and 14 years old. The majority had been in the classrooms at the back of the school, aged between eight and 10.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My idea was to begin with a single voice, then to have the voices of the village grow exponentially to a climax of 144</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How to talk about it? From the moment Bethan Jones, an executive producer at BBC Wales Drama, asked me to write a piece for TV to mark the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster, echoes of Jeff\u2019s question have haunted me. The prospect of trying to shape dramatically and render the nature of the village\u2019s loss seemed emotionally daunting and fraught with difficulty, which it has been. For 50 years, from the day tip No 7 collapsed, Aberfan has had to grieve publicly over every parent\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 the death of their child \u2013 and the sudden loss of a great slice of their community. Interwoven with this grief has been anger, recrimination and a sense of injustice. And it hasn\u2019t been a grief allowed to rest either. Every anniversary has, to varying degrees, attracted the attention of the media and the wider world. Time is a natural smoother of grief\u2019s roughest edges, but for many in Aberfan a gradual submersion of their bereavement under the years has been denied them, the pressure of anniversarial attention regularly drawing their sorrow to the surface, and with each breaching back into the air, returning them afresh to the point of their loss.</p> <p>With the weight of this particular history in mind I found myself questioning whether Aberfan\u2019s story should be told again at all. From what I could tell, and quite understandably, some in the community would rather move on from the disaster now and look forwards, not back. Most of the survivors, parents and rescuers are still alive, so any attempt at a conventional dramatic reconstruction, especially given that the story has been told before, seemed inappropriate. Similarly, although there were injustices and negligence at the root of the disaster, these too have been well documented. Perhaps most significantly though, as a writer, I sensed a destabilising tension at the heart of the endeavour, between the dramatic need to take an audience into the unflinching core of the story and the potential, in so doing, for emotional exploitation at the cost of those who had lived and lost through the disaster.</p> <p>The worries of this tension never left me throughout the writing of what became <em>The Green Hollow</em>, and that I embarked on it at all was, in the end, more to do with concerns about the present than about the past. As I researched the details of what happened at Aberfan, I realised this was a historical story with a deeply urgent contemporary resonance: a story of what can happen when a community is run by a corporation. It is also a story known along generational rather than geographic borders, as is evidenced by the many plaques and memorials throughout the village from countries across the globe: a plaque in the community centre from the city of Florence, a dedication and statue in the cemetery from the people of South Africa. In 1966 world television news was in its ascendancy and images and reports of the disaster were broadcast on every continent. Together with the nature of the village\u2019s loss, this has meant the story of Aberfan is surprisingly well remembered and known across the globe. In nearly every country to which I\u2019ve travelled, I\u2019ve found people who can tell me where they were, and what they were doing, the moment they heard about the fate of Pantglas school. Just recently, in Mexico, an elderly woman told me how she\u2019d been working with Pablo Neruda in Chile when his secretary had knocked on her door one afternoon to tell her \u201csomething terrible has happened in Wales\u201d.</p> <p>Whenever I meet these people they are always of a certain age, either old enough to remember hearing about the disaster themselves or, like me, to have parents who recall it and who can pass on that memory. Ask people in their late 20s and early 30s about Aberfan and even close to home in Wales, I\u2019ve found increasingly the reply to be a shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulders.</p> <p>Although this generational erosion in the collective memory was a further spur to say yes to the BBC\u2019s offer, and so hopefully deepen knowledge of the disaster, it was perhaps secondary to a growing desire to try to retell the story to those who already knew it. The more I researched Aberfan, the more I realised that such disasters, especially when they occur in small communities, are anonymising and dominating. A place\u2019s character becomes defined in relation to the disaster, with both its past and its present increasingly occupied by outsiders\u2019 perspectives of the event. The disaster imposes itself upon the physical and psychological identity of a community until a reversal occurs in the traditional process of geographic nomenclature and the event appropriates the name rather than the other way round \u2013 place and disaster become synonymous. Look at the phrase I wrote earlier in this paragraph: \u201cthe more I researched Aberfan\u201d. This should mean the village in its entirety, in every dimension, geographical, historical, societal. But we know that what I was referring to, and what if you\u2019re familiar with the story you probably read, was \u201cthe more I researched the disaster\u201d.</p> <p>Was it possible, then, to create a piece for TV marking the 50th anniversary of the collapse of tip No 7, while also attempting to broaden the field of vision in respect to the village? To paint a portrait not just of what happened, but also of what was lost? What was Aberfan like in 1966? What were the interests of the people, the social life, the sporting obsessions, the bands of the day? What was the deeper history of the place? Why had it become the mining village it was, and what had it been before the discovery of coal under its soil? Perhaps most significantly, what was Aberfan like today? What other influences beyond the disaster have shaped its contemporary character, and how do those who call it home with no connection to the disaster view the village and the area now?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"222c3edb8e4ef7548be047aab359db4ad7b7aae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/222c3edb8e4ef7548be047aab359db4ad7b7aae8/0_385_2030_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescuers queue for tea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescuers queue for tea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In trying to answer some of these questions my hope was to create a piece that was both tribute and descriptively expansive; that embraced the disaster but could also be a point of departure, of moving on. I wanted to present the disaster within the broader life and history of Aberfan. To allow it to live in the public conversation more in the manner that it exists within the lived experience of the community today \u2013 as a resonating echo, a part of the village, rather than the village as a part of the event.</p> <p>Although I knew what I wanted to achieve, I still had to answer the \u201chow\u201d of Jeff\u2019s question \u2013 in what form and style would these aspirations be rendered in such a way as to keep on the right side of that tension between dramatic need and emotional exploitation?</p> <p>The approach I felt to be the most instinctively appropriate was already suggested in the question \u2013 \u201chow to talk about it?\u201d Talking, voice, voices. Despite this commission being for TV, a visual medium, it was through voice I wanted <em>The Green Hollow </em>to discover its shape and tone. I wanted the village to speak, and given the communal nature of the disaster a choral quality to the angle of entry seemed appropriate.</p> <p>My initial idea was to begin with a single voice, then to have the voices of the village grow exponentially to a climax of 144 voices, before tapering again to a single voice. The shape would be like that of a growing double wave with a tremor of genesis in the voice of a child in 1966, before bellying in both directions at its widest point to create a climax around the disaster of depth, height and weight, then a gradual reduction and focusing to a single, final voice in the present.</p> <p>From early on I\u2019d envisaged these voices as being attached to particular characters and stories, but also being temporally fluid, able to move between younger and older versions of people, between then and now, with youthful voices appearing in the mouths of elderly people, and vice versa.</p> <p>As with most early concepts in the process of writing, these initial ideas soon lost their definition and became necessarily blurred in the creation of the piece. Enough of them survived, however, to lend the finished work its three-part structure of the morning of the disaster, the disaster itself and then a closing third act set in Aberfan today. The voices still move across these time frames and swell towards the centre of the piece as well. They also gather, I hope, a progression of ownership. The first part is voiced and acted entirely by actors playing characters. The second is acted again, but consists of stories of rescuers and other \u201coutsiders\u201d who were drawn to the village that day \u2013 Gwyneth, a young council worker, Sam, a local journalist, Dave, a local bank clerk and Mansel, a young medical student who happened to be travelling to Aberfan that day. The real Gwyneth, Sam, Dave and Mansel are present in this second part, observing their younger selves being acted. In the third part the actors\u2019 voices are joined by voices from the Aberfan community today \u2013 the headmistress of the junior school, a shopkeeper, the schoolchildren.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c27165e03b368b48f5693b21605cd4ebf802abd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c27165e03b368b48f5693b21605cd4ebf802abd4/0_0_5480_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devastated miners still digging, 25 October 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devastated miners still digging, 25 October 1966</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was beginning with the idea of voice \u2013 of giving Aberfan a voice \u2013 that led me towards the style of the piece, a form of verse drama created from first person accounts; a series of rhythmically driven dramatic monologues underpinned by internal and line-end rhyme and half-rhyme. This is a form I\u2019d first developed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/12/pink-mist-review-owen-sheers-intense-spare-theatre\"><em>Pink Mist</em></a>, a play about young wounded soldiers and the emotional aftermath of conflict. I knew, therefore, that a heightened speech inherited from everyday language would create a quality of restrained energy that I\u2019d need if the interwoven stories of <em>The Green Hollow </em>were to be sustained through an hour of television.</p> <p>I also knew what such a form offers in terms of rendering traumatic and disturbing material in a manner that is, at one and the same time, lyrically distancing yet emotively true. Most of the characters in <em>The Green Hollow </em>are telling us their stories, not \u201cshowing\u201d them. Their perspective is often retrospective, a reporting back from the other side of the crucible. Because they are speaking in a form of poetry though, I hope they are also \u201cshowing\u201d us their experiences through the nature of their imagery, rhythm and patterns of rhyme and echo. In such a way moments of emotional trauma might be excavated not through the dramatic immediacy of visual representation or action, but via the deeper, subterranean channels of spoken music.</p> <p>This lyric reportage allows language to be, at times, beautiful. This might be a strange word to conjure when discussing a piece of writing about Aberfan, but the more time I spent on <em>The Green Hollow</em>, the more I became convinced of the necessity of beauty in the work. Not to gild, or as euphemism, but as memorial. The truth of what happened that day in October 1966 was brutal, cruel and ugly. But as well as truth, the other two foundations of poetry are, I believe, the song and the prayer. So I hope it\u2019s been possible to both acknowledge that cruelty and ugliness in a piece of writing, while also discovering the song and the prayer in the witness and experience of those who endured the sorrow of the disaster. As the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam once wrote, \u201cIn time I too will craft beauty from this sullen weight\u201d and that, I suppose, became my guiding principle when embarking on <em>The Green Hollow </em>\u2013 to make something beautiful from the sullen weight of Aberfan.In doing so I hope that what we\u2019ve made is not just a tribute of memory, but also of beauty. Otherwise, what else is art for?</p> <p>The voice of a piece like <em>The Green Hollow </em>can only be created and drawn from original voices; from the memories and language of those at the heart of the subject. Even when the language or content of the writing travels far from these original voices, when the observations, images or phrasing are mine, none of it would exist without that initial fuel of first-person witness. In practical terms this meant that however much I might conceive and plan structures and style, nothing was going to happen without my first going to talk to the community in Aberfan.</p> <p>Over a period of seven months, together with BBC producer Jenna Robbins, I travelled to Aberfan to interview survivors, parents who had lost children, rescuers and current residents. This process was, by turns, harrowing and uplifting. However much survivors or rescuers told me they were fine, that enough time had passed for them to talk about their experiences, still, there was always a moment when the awful horror of that day would break upon them. Sometimes it would be no more than a reddening of the eyes and an intake of settling breath. At others the tears came hard, through shuddering sobs. Always, I felt a sharp guilt. It is one thing to be able to recall an event in general, and quite another to have someone ask you to walk them, step by step, moment by moment, through your memories, describing them in detail as you go.</p> <p>There were moments when the archival research also caught me unawares. Coming across a handwritten list of the dead and its accumulation of single-digit ages filling a column. Or reading a local newspaper report of an inquest into the deaths of 30 of the children, and of the moment when, after one name was read out and the cause of death given as asphyxia and multiple injuries, a father stood and responded with \u201cNo, sir, buried alive by the National Coal Board. That is what I want to see on record.\u201d</p> <p>I read that report in the archives of Merthyr Library, which is where I also came across a set of correspondence that explained the root of that father\u2019s anger and which, in turn, left me simmering with sad indignation for weeks. The neatly typed letters were addressed from DCW Jones, the Merthyr Borough and Waterworks engineer, to Mr D Roberts, area chief mechanical engineer for the National Coal Board, and TS Evans, the town clerk. They are dated back as far as August 1963, and all carry the same subject line: \u201cDanger from Coal Slurry being tipped at the rear of the Pantglas Schools.\u201d</p> <p>In these letters, DCW Jones clearly outlines the reasons why tip No 7 shouldn\u2019t continue to be used. He cites previous movements after heavy rain and the fact that the absorption of storm water would counter any attempt to de-water the slurry before it is tipped. He also prophesies, in restrained, official language, what would happen if the tip did collapse. In August 1963 he signs off with the line, \u201c\u2026if they were to move a very serious position would accrue\u201d. In December of the same year he warns again that \u201calthough the current solution at Pantglas may be difficult it will not by any means be as difficult as would apply in the event of the tips sliding in the manner that I have envisaged\u201d.</p> <p>In March 1964, DCW Jones received a reply from the National Coal Board stating that with regard to the disposing of slurries they \u201cwould not like to continue beyond the next 6/8 weeks in tipping it on the mountainside where it is likely to be a source of danger to Pantglas school\u201d. Tip No 7 remained in use for the next two-and-a-half years, until 20 October 1966. When an official tribunal into the Aberfan disaster reached its conclusion, no member of the NCB resigned or was asked to leave their position. The disaster had been caused, the tribunal stated, not by \u201cwickedness but ignorance, ineptitude and a failure of communication\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107b64c8251ca54a5c882b72486e82db269e56c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107b64c8251ca54a5c882b72486e82db269e56c9/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poet and playwright Owen Sheers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poet and playwright Owen Sheers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The difficulties and darkness of much of my research were often countered by the best of the human condition. Accounts of extraordinary acts of effort and kindness at the moment of the disaster and in its aftermath; spending a morning in the thriving maelstrom of the local mother and toddlers group, or among the infectious curiosity and energy of pupils in the impressive Ynysowen primary school. Nearly every interview, too, however upsetting, would also give way at some point to humour, optimism and generosity of spirit, and nowhere more so than in my visits to the Young Wives Club.</p> <p>Originally formed by mothers and wives from the village in the wake of the disaster as a place to \u201claugh, cry, speak and be heard\u201d, this organisation has grown over the past 50 years into a general social club of invited speakers, theatre trips and weekly gatherings in a room above a chapel. Many of its members lost children in the disaster and perhaps this was why I\u2019d been particularly daunted by the prospect of visiting the club; of sitting before bereaved mothers and explaining that I wanted to try to tell their story. What I hadn\u2019t expected was to spend so much of my evening at the club (which, with an average age in the 70s had just voted to remove the \u201cyoung\u201d from their title) laughing. But I did. The women I spoke to were open about their losses, and about the difficulties of coping with such a public grief, but they were also one of the most life-affirming group of people I\u2019ve ever met; a living manifestation of the kind of place Aberfan had been in 1966. Many of the survivors I\u2019d interviewed had spoken about the village\u2019s vibrancy at that time. With full employment in the mine and local factories, its streets were thick with shops and tradesmen, boasting two butchers, two fishmongers and even two cinemas. The village\u2019s cultural life was similarly active, with well-supported drama societies, bands and choirs and the swinging dance halls of Merthyr just down the road.</p> <p>Walking down Aberfan\u2019s high street today I\u2019d often found it difficult to imagine this version of the village. Over the past 50 years, as well as the disaster, Aberfan has also had to take all the other body blows inflicted upon the south Wales valleys by the late 20th century \u2013 the miners\u2019 strike and closure of the pits, Thatcherism, unemployment, poverty, alienation, then Osborne\u2019s austerity. The busy high street of traders is gone, and employment is largely elsewhere now, at the EE call centre in Merthyr, or further afield in Cardiff. In spending time with the Wives Club, though, I felt I\u2019d visited that other village, the Aberfan of 1966, full of possibility, energetic intelligence and vibrant life, alive not just in their memories but also in them, their actions, attitudes and humour.</p> <p>The last time I visited the Wives Club was to read to them from the script of <em>The Green Hollow</em>. Having decided that this piece would begin with voices and the sharing of voices, the producers and I felt it was only right that the circle be completed, and that those I\u2019d spoken to should have the opportunity to hear the \u201cvoice\u201d of the script. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand before those women and read to them, but I\u2019m sure it was much harder for them to sit before me and listen. But they did listen, an act of generosity in itself for which I am hugely grateful.</p> <p>And then so did many others, as the script went on its collaborative journey of compromise and creation that is the process of film-making. The director, Pip Broughton, the actors, the cameramen, the crew. As each person listened, then made their contribution to the finished film, so the original voices with which I\u2019d begun became increasingly distilled through the voices of others. Which is how it should be, I think. Because distillation is not the same as diffusion, it\u2019s about purifying, about capturing an essence, and with voices that capturing can only be achieved through listening first. Which is, perhaps, another possible answer to Jeff\u2019s question of \u201cHow to talk about it?\u201d By listening as well as talking, as completely as we can. By listening as the members of the Wives Club did when they first came together to support each other \u2013 as an act of sharing, an act of tribute.</p> <p><em>The Green Hollow will be broadcast by BBC1 Wales on Friday 21 October, 9pm, and on BBC4 on Sunday 23 October, 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>Few space missions can claim to be as dramatic as the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta\" title=\"\">Rosetta comet\u2011chaser</a>. Launched in 2004, it captured the public\u2019s attention in November 2014 because of its placing of the Philae lander on the \u201cduck-shaped\u201d comet <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/14615-comet-67p/\" title=\"\">67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a> in search of the chemicals that made life possible on Earth.</p> <p>ESA project scientist Matt Taylor is the public face of the mission. Born in Manor Park, north-east London, the son of a bricklayer, he has become instantly recognisable thanks to his tattoos. We spoke to him shortly before Rosetta completed its final task, crash-landing on to the comet\u2019s surface.</p> <p><strong>How are you feeling now it is the end of the&#xa0;mission?</strong><br>It\u2019s the end of the operational mission, but the science is continuing and it will continue for many years. Some of the people here [at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany] today are PhD students. They will continue their careers working on Rosetta data \u2013 there is so much of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Certain rock singers should have stopped when they were fully functioning, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with Rosetta</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Rosetta is being commanded to plunge into its target comet \u2013 why destroy it?</strong><br>Science. That\u2019s what this is all about. That\u2019s the reason for doing this. It wasn\u2019t to give my colleagues here in ESOC a toy to play with to fly around a comet, although they have done a very good job. It was for the science and that is what we are celebrating here. This final plunge is allowing us to get to a region above the comet that we would never have been able to get to otherwise. The plunge is the only way to get this low \u2013 to where the ice becomes the gas. It was one of the goals of the mission to study this and this is how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Couldn\u2019t you have put it into hibernation and revived it in five years\u2019 time?</strong><br>It\u2019s like rock bands: I\u2019ve seen certain rock bands with certain singers who can\u2019t sing any more. They should have stopped when they were fully functioning and that is what we were doing here. If we were talking about going into hibernation again, we don\u2019t know whether the spacecraft will come back. We don\u2019t know how it is going to function when it comes back, we don\u2019t know what the quality of its voice is going to be or how rheumatic its hands are going to be when playing guitar. This way, we are getting something unique during the descent. So what better way to go out?</p> <p><strong>Why now?</strong><br>Rosetta has been in space since 2004. It is ageing. Even when we came out of hibernation, we noticed some issues with the thruster system and the reaction wheels. So we were looking at different options for when we went out away from the sun again. The power is dropping fast; we\u2019ve already switched off a number of payload items. This weekend [1-2 October], we start to move into conjunction [where the sun blocks the signal from the spacecraft]. The signal from the spacecraft will drop through the floor to 1kb/s. It\u2019s only 41kb/s now [domestic fibre optic broadband can be 1,000 times faster than this]. This weekend is the wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbbb0356dc1865871ad4129c721d9748d877731d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbb0356dc1865871ad4129c721d9748d877731d/74_0_2456_3070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Taylor\u2019s Rosetta-themed thigh tattoo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Taylor\u2019s Rosetta-themed thigh tattoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s been the most surprising result from the mission?</strong><br>That\u2019s a tough one, because I should try to balance everything and keep everyone [on the individual instrument teams] equally happy. We\u2019ve analysed this comet from kilometre scales down to micrometre and nanometre scales now. We are linking from the dust grains at the very smallest scales to the way these stuck together to make the comet as a whole. We have got that tracked now.</p> <p><strong>It is actually two comets stuck together, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br>The orientation of the layers can tell you when you have two different bodies. I make the analogy to onion skins: the \u201cduck shape\u201d of this comet can only be formed by two of these onions coming together. You could not get this shape by getting a big onion and chewing out the middle bit. This has to be two objects that have come together.</p> <p><strong>The mission set out to determine whether comets brought water and the organic, carbon-rich molecules necessary for life to Earth. What did the mission reveal?</strong><br>It says that comets were not the dominant mechanism for delivering water to Earth. It does not say that they never hit the Earth, but they did not bring the majority of the Earth\u2019s oceans. That water matches what we find in asteroids, so they did the majority of that delivery. But when you look at the other stuff in the comet \u2013 the really cool stuff \u2013 the amino acids and other organics that we have detected, this could have come to Earth from comets. It\u2019s like when someone first invented beer: they put some water and other stuff together and it fermented. I think it\u2019s like that for life on Earth. Asteroids bring the water, comets bring the funky&#xa0;organics.</p> <p><strong>Does the existence of water on comets make human exploration of space any easier?</strong><br>Any time you put anything in space, you learn from it. It might not be directly applicable, however, to landing humans on Mars. It costs a lot to launch stuff into space, but what if that stuff is in space already? Comets contain water and all the material to make fuel, but are just a bit too difficult to use as a fuel stop, I think. They travel really fast and are difficult to orbit around, as demonstrated by Rosetta. However, they are all pieces that you can learn from. But can you connect Rosetta to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\" title=\"\">Matt Damon on Mars</a>? Not directly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/rosetta-zip/giv-1406z1RKqHNgmAGi\" data-alt=\"Rosetta mission graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/rosetta-zip/giv-1406z1RKqHNgmAGi\">Rosetta mission graphic</a> </figure>  <p><strong>You were offered the job of Rosetta project scientist in summer 2013, just before the most active phases of the mission. Did you expect there to be so much public&#xa0;interest?</strong><br>In terms of the mission, we knew it was going to be big. We knew it was special; it was exploration, it was danger. But we did not conceive that we would have this level of interest. In terms of myself, I didn\u2019t expect this, I don\u2019t welcome it, but it is part of my job to promote the mission, to tell everyone why this mission is important and to tell everyone why their tax money has gone into this.</p> <p>The interest in me personally is something that I wasn\u2019t expecting. My family didn\u2019t expect it and don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t particularly like it, but it is part of the job now. And that, I expect, will go away, frankly. Although the mission will continue scientifically, there will not be that level of interest because we haven\u2019t got a live spacecraft. I will not be sorry to see it reduce. Maybe I\u2019ll&#xa0;turn <a href=\"http://twitter.com/esa_rosetta\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> off in the next couple of months and say, that was just part of the operational phase of the mission. There is something about the operational phase that makes it feel current.</p> <p><strong>What do you remember of Rosetta\u2019s wake-up in January 2014?</strong><br>Wake-up was the first milestone. We went from nothing to something. It was the anticipation of whether we have a mission at all. All the years of preparation and work was dependent upon those eight hours of the spacecraft autonomously warming itself up and finding Earth to re-establish contact. One of my memories was looking around and seeing one of the guys who was responsible for writing the hibernation exit software and that guy looked very relieved. I remember a lot of going: \u201cYeah, yeah!\u201d but then thinking: \u201cOh God, we\u2019ve got all this work to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2014/nov/13/rosetta-mission-philae-landing-site-comet-67p-pictures\">Rosetta mission: Philae's landing site on comet 67P \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is ESA looking at a follow-on mission?</strong><br>We\u2019ll see what comes in during the <a href=\"http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/call-for-m5-missions\" title=\"\">M5 call</a> [an opportunity to propose medium-size missions to ESA that closed on 5 October]. Maybe some of those will be minor body missions. We have yet to return samples from a comet, but maybe that\u2019s too hard to do. The material is really volatile and needs to be kept really cold, \u2013150C, all the way down to Earth. That is a real challenge. There are ideas being studied, but we wait for the scientific community to propose them. I leave it to them to give me a job, if they want me.</p> <p><strong>So what\u2019s next for you?</strong><br>I stay on Rosetta for a couple of years. This is the archive phase, where we make sure the data is the best quality. And I try to encourage my colleagues to continue to work together for the continued goal of science. My job will be to set up workshops and get people together and generate the momentum to keep this going.</p> <p><strong>Any regrets?</strong><br>I think I will only be able to answer that question fully in a couple of years. I don\u2019t think many of the mission\u2019s milestones will sink in and process properly until then. There are parts that I can\u2019t even remember clearly \u2013 maybe that is a psychological defence.</p>",
  "<p>This abrasive cop comedy is the cinematic equivalent of spending time with a very charming psychopath.

But when the two most corrupt cops in the state take on the most unsavoury criminal in town, they find themselves out of their depth. The always excellent Pe\u00f1a is well suited to the role \u2013 he already partnered in a similar, if less dissolute, dynamic in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/25/end-of-watch-review\" title=\"\"><em>End of Watch</em></a>.

  "<p>Henri and Catherine are old friends of mine and, in between flats, they are staying with me for a month. They are also French. On Tuesday, after home secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/04/conservative-conference-theresa-mays-morning-broadcast-interviews-politics-live\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd\u2019s speech</a> at the Conservative party conference, Henri was visibly shaken. \u201cWhen we came here we felt welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of an open society. Now we don\u2019t. Not only are we now foreign \u2013 we are made to <em>feel</em> foreign. Not wanted. Unwelcome. Alien.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd is not racist, but words matter \u2013 and she finds herself the home secretary in a Ukip-lite party whose overwhelming drive is to keep its promise to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. She \u2013 and the prime minister \u2013 wanted the headlines last week about British jobs for British workers, signalling a willingness to clamp down on the foreign other in our midst.</p> <p>Rudd was quick to qualify the part of her speech \u2013 that companies should be forced to disclose how many foreign workers they employ \u2013 as only an option as the hostile reaction mounted, especially from business. But her speech won the headlines. It also came with a string of measures that will turn us into a nation of mini-commissars, compelled to snoop on those who look and sound different.</p> <p>Landlords who knowingly rent out property to people \u201cwho have no right to be in Britain\u201d will be now committing a criminal offence, declared Rudd. Immigrant checks will be a mandatory requirement for those wanting to get a licence to drive a taxi. Banks will have regularly to check that they are not providing banking services to illegal migrants. EU nationals who commit minor crimes are to be deported immediately. Family members of foreign students will not be allowed to work. There will be new restrictions on entry for foreign students.</p> <p>It was a broadside of initiatives that cumulatively created the impact that so disturbed Henri. Britain is to change from being a society tolerant of immigrants and accommodating \u2013 sometimes celebrating \u2013 the resulting diversity, even while it tries to manage the numbers, to a society vigilant and hostile to any sign of otherness.</p> <p>Everyone knows why. Ukip won four million votes. The EU referendum was lost. The new conventional wisdom, driven home with demagogic genius by Nigel Farage, is that an out-of-touch elite has indulged a transformational increase in immigration that has put untold pressure on public services, depressed wages, and denied jobs to the indigenous. It should not be racist to talk about this. Left-behind, fed-up Britain has sent an unmistakable message. It must be heard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/06/uk-theatres-call-for-urgent-help-for-child-refugees-in-calais\">UK theatres call for urgent help for child refugees in Calais</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So it must \u2013 but quite like this? Ukip 10 years ago sought an apology from David Cameron, who described it as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/04/conservatives.uk\" title=\"\">\u201cbunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u201d</a>; campaigning for an EU referendum offered a veneer of respectability that disguised the mix of nativism and semi-racism that bound it together.</p> <p>But Cameron was right. Now the referendum cause is removed, Ukip is disintegrating. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/06/ukip-leadership-favourite-steven-woolfe-collapses-in-european-parliament\" title=\"\">Friday morning\u2019s picture of Ukip\u2019s Stephen Woolfe</a> on the floor in the European parliament after an altercation with a fellow Ukip MEP told its own eloquent story.</p> <p>The Tory party \u2013 and the wider political establishment \u2013 can and should be braver. May is right to champion worker rights, industrial policy and stakeholder capitalism. She can extend that to a more nuanced approach to immigration. What was unnerving about the conference was watching the near-delight with which a party \u2013 once the reliable friend of an open, tolerant , outward-looking Britain \u2013 embraced Ukip\u2019s creed even as Ukip shows ultimately that it leads nowhere. Whether fervently applauding Rudd, or at fringe events eagerly deploring all things European, this felt like a party deserting what it had once been. Once, it could castigate Enoch Powell for his rivers of blood speech. That would not happen now.</p> <p>One excuse is that Ruddism represents the new patriotism behind which a liberal elite refuses to rally, but that is gravely to traduce the multiplicity of strands that lie behind pride in Britain. The patriotism of many of us \u2013 at least the 16 million who voted to remain, and I believe many who voted to leave \u2013 is a pride in being the country of Shakespeare, Wilberforce and Darwin, a country that embraced religious tolerance and democracy before others, was open to great European scholars like Erasmus and has welcomed Huguenots and Jewish refugees alike. We do not want to unleash the darker side of a small minority, permitting bigotry and insults at anyone betraying a hint of foreignness. It\u2019s not what Britain, or any society, should ever be.</p> <p>If there are hard-pressed public services in areas of high immigration, invest more. Explain that immigration and openness enrich us. Train our people so that they are equipped to work wherever. Invest in social housing. Explain that the impact on wages, apart from a few towns and a few trades, is minimal. Celebrate the myriad ways that immigrants benefit us, from path-breaking research in our universities to toiling in night shifts in the NHS.</p> <p>Certainly let\u2019s have emergency triggers to create pauses in excessive immigrant inflows, and make benefits contingent on having made contributions. But stamp on racism and offer no means through which it can be expressed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s stand up for a vision of an open, tolerant, outward-looking country that is proud of all it has given the world. We are not a nation of wannabe Ukippers.</p> <p>Henri, stick with us. There is a better Britain. A vast majority welcomes you being here.</p>",
  "<p>Midway through her conference speech, Amber Rudd paused and waited for the applause. At first, her announcement that only the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/04/rudd-announces-crackdown-on-overseas-students-and-new-work-visas\" title=\"\">\u201cbrightest and best\u201d foreign students </a>would be welcome in British universities, and that those wanting to join \u201clower quality courses\u201d should be kept out because they would be economically unproductive, drew none. She smiled expectantly, and then came a ripple. Was her Tory audience a little confused? Was this really the same Amber Rudd who only weeks before had warned that Brexit would do untold damage to the nation and cause an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/24/energy-secretary-electric-shock-eu-referendum-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201celectric shock\u201d to the UK economy?</a> The same Amber Rudd who had said before the EU referendum that Boris Johnson was not fit to run you home after a party, never mind run anything else? The same person who had appeared on TV over the summer fulminating against those misguided, narrow-minded Brexiters?</p> <p>Last week\u2019s Tory conference required everyone to clear their memory banks and delete all such inconvenient details of recent history. Never mind what Rudd had believed so passionately in June. Here was the new-look home secretary embracing a hard Brexit as a fantastic opportunity to slash immigration, keep young foreigners out if they were judged second-rate, and shame British companies who signed up too many overseas workers and not enough Brits. \u201cWork with us, not against us, and we\u2019ll better control immigration and protect our economy,\u201d was her message now. When Theresa May spoke the following day, Rudd and Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s surprise choice for the post of foreign secretary, were new best friends, sitting side by side, glancing approvingly at one another time after time as ovation followed ovation.</p> <p>In party political terms, the Conservatives will look back on their four days in Birmingham as a success. Unity was what mattered most, not consistency. In the insulated confines of Birmingham\u2019s International Convention Centre, it seemed to matter little that the pound was diving on world markets or that representatives of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\" title=\"\">UK car industry</a> were touring the bars warning that Nissan and other big companies might well decide to move their plants to Slovakia within months because a hard Brexit would be a disaster, and a soft one little better. \u201cWe can see no outcome for us from all of this that is better than what we have now,\u201d said one senior car industry figure.</p> <p>Most Brexit-supporting Tory MPs seemed not the least bit alarmed by such talk. They convinced each other that it was all going very well indeed. \u201cWe are resetting the dial on British politics,\u201d one remarked. \u201cMarkets fluctuate. The pound will recover. Look what the falling pound is doing for our exports!\u201d While most Conservatives wore looks of cheery optimism that bordered in some cases on smugness, Labour, the supposedly pro-EU party to which the forgotten 48% who voted to remain are looking to for reassurance and hope, was notably quiet.</p> <p>After his own difficult party conference the week before, Jeremy Corbyn was pictured walking in Northumberland with his wife as the Tories got under way in Birmingham. Later in the week he was more concerned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/07/labour-reshuffle-jonathan-ashworth-shadow-health-secretary-nec-national-executive-committee\" title=\"\">reshuffling his shadow cabinet </a>than commenting on the country\u2019s future in Europe.</p> <p>The frustration of those who want to fight against hard Brexit and who are tearing their hair out at Labour\u2019s divisions on issues as central to the Brexit debate as immigration was perhaps best exemplified by news that an exasperated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/tony-blair-political-comeback-labour\" title=\"\">Tony Blair was considering returning</a> to some role in front-line politics. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a tragedy for British politics if the choice before the country is a Conservative government going for a hard Brexit and an ultra-left Labour party that believes in a set of policies that takes us back to the 60s,\u201d Blair told <em>Esquire</em> magazine. \u201cDo I feel strongly about it? Yes, I do. Am I very motivated by that? Yes. Where do I go from here? What exactly do I do? That\u2019s an open question.\u201d</p> <p>He and others could see that the Tories were wide open to challenge but were being allowed, by the lack of effective opposition, to run what he called a \u201cone-party state\u201d and drive the UK out of the EU in a way that much of the business community regards as hugely risky and without regard to the concerns of the almost half of voters who backed Remain on 23 June.</p> <p>The Conservatives had two objectives last week and the more they tried to deliver on both, the more the tensions and contradictions that Labour failed adequately to expose became evident. The first was to convince their own party \u2013 and as much as possible the country \u2013 that they would deliver the will of the people and make a success of getting out of the European Union. Having concluded that immigration was the main factor behind the narrow Leave win, they felt they had to be crystal clear that Brexit would be both hard and clean, and that they would be ready to leave the EU single market, which the Conservative party has championed for decades, if that was what was needed to control immigration. The \u201cliberal elite\u201d who tried to soften Brexit and spoke up for the benefits of immigration and working with our partners were dismissed as sour, bad losers flouting democracy.</p> <p>The second aim was to showcase the personal vision of prime minister May, allowing her to explain how she intended to create \u201ca country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-consigns-cameron-to-history-in-populist-speech\" title=\"\">May\u2019s first conference speech </a>as prime minister shunned the individualism of Margaret Thatcher and the shrinking-state Conservatism of her successors, including David Cameron, replacing all that with a commitment to an active state that would intervene wherever and whenever it could to help people \u201cacross the line\u201d. \u201cWe succeed or fail together,\u201d said May, recalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/19/alistair-brownlee-jonny-world-triathlon-series\" title=\"\">one Brownlee brother dragging the other across the finishing line</a> in their recent triathlon success. \u201cWe achieve or fall short together. When one of us falters, our human instinct is to reach out our hand and help them over the line. There is more to life than individualism and self-interest,\u201d she declared, in what was intended to be a defining section of her speech.</p> <p>But just as budgets can unravel fast, so can conferences that play too much to the party gallery and then crash into reality. The hard Brexit lines looked like a pitch for Ukip votes. Ukip\u2019s main donor, Arron Banks, said the Tories had morphed into Ukip itself. Business was alarmed. The anti-immigrant dog whistling certainly did not sit easily with May\u2019s softer themes, her appeals to the centre ground, her talk of a global Britain, her pledges to help everyone succeed.</p> <p>On several occasions May and her ministers went too far and had to backtrack. No sooner had she suggested that foreign doctors would have to return home from 2025 once enough extra home-grown ones had been trained than she retracted it, saying this would not in fact be the case. The morning after Rudd had intimated that ministers would \u201cname and shame\u201d companies that employed too many foreign workers, she went on BBC radio to say this was \u201cnot something we\u2019re definitely going to do\u201d. The Tories were pulling to the right then to the left then back.</p> <p>Within Conservative ranks, fissures were exposed. Former minister Nick Herbert warned of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/beware-brexit-three-blind-mice-nick-herbert\" title=\"\">dangers of \u201cBrexit fundamentalism\u201d</a> while former education secretary Nicky Morgan said that hard Brexit would encourage people \u201cto say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry\u201d.</p> <p>Some Tories, and even the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, worried that the party might lose the support of business. The day after the conference, as the pound plummeted in reaction to all the Brexit noise and May\u2019s conference speech, in which she spoke of the \u201cbad side\u201d of low interest rates and quantitative easing, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, gave an interview in New York to row back a bit on the nationalist tone of his colleagues. Clearly worried, he made it clear that the UK was not shutting the door completely to the single market or free movement of labour. The British people had certainly voted, he told the Bloomberg news agency, not to have full \u201cfree movement\u201d of people. \u201c[But] that is not the same as \u2018we will not allow any people from the EU to come into the UK. It\u2019s about controls and processes,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hammond also went out of his way to counter the delusion among many Tories that the economy was enjoying some sort of post-referendum boom, questioning the wisdom of papers such as the <em>Daily Mail</em> that had claimed day after day that all was wonderful in Brexit land. \u201cSadly, there is a part of the British press saying precisely that. The answer, of course, is that the data that the media is mostly focused on is backward-looking data, which tells us a very good news story, that the UK economy was more robust than we thought in the first half of this year.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday the pound suffered more dramatic and alarming fluctuations, including a short-term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/theories-emerge-for-pounds-flash-crash-against-dollar\" title=\"\">flash crash</a>\u201d with analysts blaming concern over the UK government\u2019s approach to Brexit. Hammond appealed again for calm.</p> <p>The party conference season south of the border is over (the pro-EU SNP will meet in Glasgow this week). Tories have been sent back to their constituencies with simple hard Brexit messages. Some see through them to difficult times ahead. On Sunday former chancellor Kenneth Clarke will appear on the BBC\u2019s <em>Andrew Marr Show</em> and make clear his worries about leaving the single market. Other Tories are anxious about May\u2019s promotion of an active state and her new \u201cborrow to build\u201d approach. MPs in all parties want a vote in parliament on any decision to leave the single market. The CBI is on the warpath. But with Labour divided and incoherent on Europe, Jeremy Corbyn a lukewarm defender of the single market, and the Lib Dems struggling to be heard, the forgotten 48% lack a champion they can trust to hold back the Tory charge to the exit.</p> <p>Polling released on Sunday by the New Economics Foundation (Nef) shows that among Remain voters, 68% say they are likely to vote at the next general election according to how political parties deal with Brexit. Some 77% agreed that issues such as tax avoidance, climate change, international security and global poverty can only be tackled by working with other countries and that it would be bad for Britain if its government retreated from these global relationships. Marc Stears, Nef\u2019s chief executive, said the conferences had concentrated inevitably on the interests of those who wanted to leave. \u201cNo one has been very interested in the views of Remain voters. But the findings of this poll show that any political leader who turns their back on the 48%, seeking to diminish and jettison values like tolerance and internationalism, does so at their peril,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the end of her speech on Wednesday, May appealed to the entire country to back her. \u201cTo everyone here this morning \u2013 and the millions beyond, whether Leavers or Remain \u2013 I say: come with me and we\u2019ll write that brighter future.\u201d She may have done enough to unite most if not all in her own party last week, but to many others outside it, including much of the business community, the future she spoke of looks darker than it did a week ago.</p>",
  "<p>Call off the search \u2013 as far as many Tories leaving Birmingham were concerned, the spiritual heir to Margaret Thatcher has finally arrived. The Conservative party has produced populists who weren\u2019t popular (Iain Duncan Smith, William Hague, Michael Howard) and finally a moderniser popular enough to get elected (David Cameron). Its secret anxiety has been that, throughout its post-Maggie journey, the party has lacked a convincing champion and a leader instinctively in touch with the fears and aspirations of working-class and lower middle-class people outside London. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\" title=\"\">Inside the hall, </a>Theresa May needed to announce Usain Bolt Brexit \u2013 as quick as humanly possible \u2013 to shore up party support.</p> <p>May\u2019s target outside the hall was a far broader one. She is appealing to a widespread feeling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/theresa-may-brexit-conservative-party-conference-speech-tories-centre-ground\" title=\"\">liberal elites have become complacent about the impact of immigration and globalisation</a> \u2013 and she has a point. If such elites are resolutely peevish about her tub-thumping language, it is in part because they recognise that their view was less persuasive than they hoped. Simply calling a phenomenon \u201cpopulism\u201d with a knowing sigh is a long way from having a vigorous response to it.</p> <p>The referendum result has cratered a wide political territory where liberal conservatism met rightwing social democracy. But it leaves the victrix in No&#xa0;10 searching for the right balm to offer the discontented multitudes on either side. The result is May\u2019s \u201cred Tory\u201d brew: heady and promising but also confusing. Her aides speak openly of the problems of \u201cworking-class voters\u201d \u2013 a phrase Cameron and Tony Blair tended to avoid.</p> <p>The remedy features economic nationalism (far less laissez-faire on which UK assets can be sold to China and with more pronounced securocratic tendencies). It embraces, at least rhetorically, the optimistic view that shaming employers into taking British workers will automatically result in them finding a willing and able workforce in the right places for the roles they need.</p> <p>A rallying cry for \u201ctax justice\u201d sounds very nice indeed \u2013 but recalls a slightly smug Ed Miliband fused with a punitive Jeremy Corbyn. What is fair tax, for whom and on what terms, will be as contested at the end of the May era as it is now. This is where more libertarian Tories, though out of fashion, have a point when they fret that May is overdoing the born-again statism. She will need policies that can address Mike Ashley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Sports Direct work practices</a>, Philip Green\u2019s staff pension raids, internet search engines reluctant to hand over data to governments, cartel-like behaviour by energy companies \u2013 and balance the free-market dynamism that the UK will badly need to offset Brexit damage with more worker protection. Quite a to-do list \u2013 and each part of it will be fiercely contested.</p> <p>The promises of energetic interventionism \u2013 house-building and a Keynsian infrastructure boost \u2013 recall a mix of Michael Heseltine and parts of Blairiness. The difference? May thinks she can do it better, a very Maggie instinct. We should not underestimate the acumen of a woman who craftily played the referendum schisms to reach No 10, having been regarded by her predecessor as a member of the chorus line, rather than a star of the show.</p> <p>But confusion already reigns, over whether missteps like the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/05/government-faces-backlash-from-business-leaders-over-foreign-workers\" title=\"\"> unpleasant flirtation with lists of foreign workers</a> were the result of a clumsiness or a harsher, more parochial undertone to May-ism. Politically, May knows her goal, which is to shore up support in a party that will shortly squabble over the Brexit recipe \u2013 by attracting wider appeal in the country. Hence the mix of anti-elite rhetoric and daring raids into those parts of the centre-left consigned to the bench in the Corbyn era. The appointment of Matthew Taylor (my fellow panellist on the BBC\u2019s <em>Moral Maze</em> and ex-Blair adviser) to an inquiry on how to improve workers\u2019 experience of today\u2019s changing employment patterns, is symbolic. Her team talk enthusiastically of \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d and worker representation on boards. Irony check: no sooner has Britain started to leave the EU than the Conservatives are embracing a German slurry of social and Christian democracy.</p> <p>Attacks on an excess of free market orthodoxy remind us that TM is more ideologically flexible than Mrs T. Her speech was a Merkel-esque grab at left-of-centre themes of discontent about under-addressed market failures, married to the \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d notion of mutual responsibility. (The May inner team has a slightly churchy feel, with a vicar\u2019s daughter at the helm.)</p> <p>But successful challenges to modern capitalism, as Miliband discovered, are not achieved by running an extended seminar on discontents. What matters is what can be done. Some May commitments are already overblown: threatening an expanded, all-powerful tax crackdown in the language of the Terminator: \u201cWe\u2019re coming after you,\u201d invites disappointment.</p> <p>Broader objections will coalesce around distaste at her hard-Brexit approach, an over-compensation for the prevalence of remainers on her top team. An afterlife role for George Osborne may soon open up here.</p> <p>May thinks she can combine the electorally useful (grabbing swing Labour voters who are not going to embrace Corbyn\u2019s far-left ideology), with her instinctive distaste for the \u201cenrichez-vous\u201d end of Conservatism. \u201cThere is more to life than individualism,\u201d was to every trained Tory ear a riposte to Thatcher\u2019s \u201cthere is no such thing as society\u201d. There surely is. But the state, while a powerful instrument, has a patchy record of success in many of the areas she wishes to address.</p> <p>Just as the foreign workers\u2019 lists was always a bad idea that was never going to be implemented, quite a lot of the notions expounded in Birmingham will not happen, or are more likely to dwindle into symbolic tweaks than revolution. Red Toryism is an intriguing hybrid, but a sprawling, contradictory one. For the May supremacy to flourish, she needs to decide which parts of it matter more to her than others.</p> <p><em>Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist</em></p>",

  "<p>Corporate multiplex weepies can do strange things to your emotions. The effective ones \u2013 and <strong>Me Before You </strong>(Warner, 12) is certainly one of those \u2013 tickle your tear ducts without mercy for the two hours you sit with them. The second they\u2019re over, however, you care not a whit about the plastic people you\u2019ve just watched love, cry and/or die, and you\u2019re principally thinking about what to have for dinner.

For better or worse, it\u2019s entirely wrapped up in the subjective personal yearnings of its petal-faced young lovers, so dewily played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/25/sam-claflin-interview-i-hate-being-offered-heart-throb-roles\" title=\"\">Sam Claflin </a>and Emilia Clarke that you wind up rooting for their prettiness in the absence of other clear human dimensions.

Among the finest and flintiest in the recent spate of films tackling the European migrant influx, Jonas Carpagnino\u2019s serenely confident debut (not a documentary, though there\u2019s little narrative varnish here) tracks two friends from Burkina Faso as they make a new life in Italy, sparing us no complication or point of frustration in the adjustment process. It\u2019s not expressly political film-making: Carpagnino invites viewers to consider his two subjects (beautifully played by Koudous Seihon and Alassane Sy) not as symbols or statistics, but as lively, imperfect people in even less perfect circumstances: amid the broader crisis, they bicker, bruise and rock out to Rihanna. Deservedly a big deal on the festival circuit last year, it\u2019s quietly slipping straight to DVD here.</p> <p>StudioCanal\u2019s giving the same low-key treatment to <strong>Shelley</strong> (StudioCanal, 18), also well worth rescuing from the shelf: Iranian director Ali Abbasi\u2019s Danish-set film is a refreshingly humane, slow-simmering spin on the often lurid pregnancy-horror genre. Soberly following the eerie fallout when a wealthy liberal couple employ their immigrant maid as a surrogate, the film adds all manner of complex social stitching to its velvety atmospherics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944/269_0_2503_1502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s already among the bigger flubs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/09/summer-blockbuster-season-bad-box-office-suicide-squad\" title=\"\">bleak summer for blockbusters</a>, so I shan\u2019t spend too much time telling you what you\u2019ve already heard about Duncan Jones\u2019s optimistically titled video-game adaptation <strong>Warcraft: The Beginning </strong>(Universal, 12): a turgid corned-beef hash of multiple familiar fantasy realms and aesthetics, it might just be the most biliously ugly film ever to cost \u00a3125m. I\u2019m not going to make any great claims for <strong>Race</strong> (Spirit, PG), but it\u2019s a film with some time for beauty. A diverting if overly smooth-sanded Wiki-biopic of trailblazing Olympic athlete Jesse Owens, the film gazes in gilded awe upon his aesthetic prowess, though invites more questions than it perhaps expects to answer when a half-formed subplot semi-celebrates Hitler\u2019s favourite film-maker Leni Riefenstahl for doing the same at the 1936 Munich Olympics.</p> <p>Two of this week\u2019s re-releases are rather special. The Criterion Collection\u2019s latest addition is a double bill: <strong>The Emigrants</strong>/<strong>The New Land</strong> (Sony, 15) gives bright new life to Swedish director Jan Troell\u2019s ravishing yet largely unromanticised 19th-century family saga of a Sm\u00e5land clan journeying to Minnesota. Though they met with Oscar-approved crossover success in the 1970s, the films seem to have fallen out of fashion a bit among cinephiles, but their stately muscularity has aged very well. Meanwhile, the Quay Brothers, the most spookily singular force in stop-motion animation, get the Blu-ray retrospective they deserve in the short film omnibus set <strong>Inner Sanctums \u2013 Quay Brothers: The Collected Animated Films 1979-2013</strong> (BFI, 15) \u2013 which includes, beyond the obvious and treasured content, a new, short Christopher Nolan documentary on the duo\u2019s curious workings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d/0_269_2650_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-50-percent-content-original-programming-cfo-1201865902/\" title=\"\">drive towards having 50% original content</a> is gathering pace.

Thinly scripted but technically hale-and-hearty, it\u2019s a slab of action history that looks entirely cinema-ready.</p>",
  "<p>As traders caught their breath on Friday morning, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/confusion-as-pound-falls-10-in-insane-asian-trading-and-no-one-knows-why\" title=\"\">the pound\u2019s dramatic overnight plunge</a>, one strategist came up with a neat way of explaining the market forces at play. HSBC strategist David Bloom said: \u201cThe currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, ministers at the Conservative party conference hint at a hard Brexit and the pound weakens, reflecting widespread fears the UK economy will suffer long-term losses and slip down the global rankings.</p> <p>It is a new world for a currency once happy to bend itself to simple rules: generally, strong economic data boosted the pound, weaker indicators hurt it. Now, as Bloom points out, the pound has become a political and structural currency. As the Brexit drama plays out, sterling is subject to the utterances of divided UK ministers and EU officials, and to worries about Britain\u2019s global standing.</p> <p>Bloom also has an explanation for the pound\u2019s path since the vote, which saw it take a dive, stabilise and then, in the last week, another lurch lower. \u201cTo us, the foreign exchange market is exhibiting an uncanny resemblance to the five stages of grief,\u201d he wrote in a research&#xa0;note.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, following the Brexit vote came the denial \u2013 theories circulated whether a second referendum would have to take place. Second was anger \u2013 claims the vote was unfair. Third was the bargaining \u2013 arguments maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, what if the UK followed the Norwegian or Switzerland model. Now, the fourth \u2013 a gloom is prevailing over the pound.\u201d</p> <p>That gloom stems from worries that the government will put a crackdown on immigration above all else in Brexit negotiations. The price it will pay will be to end up shut out of the single market. The upshot is foreign investors find the UK less attractive, home-grown businesses face costly trade barriers, and the lack of access to skilled workers from overseas compounds their problems.</p> <p>Economists see this as a frightening prospect for an island economy reliant on inward investment. Bank of England governor Mark Carney summed up the risks when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">he warned in January that Brexit could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d</a> that the UK relies on to fund its hefty current-account deficit.</p> <p>These worries are best expressed in the pound, which hit fresh 31-year lows against the dollar on Friday. Even after recovering from a short-lived \u201cflash crash\u201d to $1.1841 in Asian markets, it was still down more than 1% at $1.2450 as a torrid week came to a close. On the day of the Brexit vote, 23 June, it was just below $1.50.</p> <p>Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, <a href=\"http://www.uk.daiwacm.com/research-zone/research-blog/posts/2016/10/sterling-%E2%80%93-far-from-flash\" title=\"\">noted sterling was the world\u2019s worst performing currency over the last week</a>. \u201cEven over a longer time period, sterling now sits among a sorry band of currencies in terms of performance \u2013 since the start of the year only the currencies of Angola, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Venezuela, Mozambique and Suriname have fallen by more.\u201d</p> <p>And there is worse to come, he warns. \u201cSterling\u2019s all-time low against the dollar was $1.05 \u2013 if the government keeps careering headlong into a hard Brexit, a return to those lows is not unimaginable.\u201d Bloom sees the pound at $1.10 by the end of 2017.</p> <p>There are silver linings of course. Tourists have flocked to Britain\u2019s luxury boutiques to buy cheaper watches. For exporters, the weak pound makes their goods more competitive.</p> <p>But to focus on the boon to overseas sales is to forget that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/07/uk-industrial-output-manufacturing-trade-deficit-office-national-statistics\" title=\"\">the UK imports more than it exports</a>. And those imports, from foods to metals, have become pricier on the pound\u2019s fall. British factories will pass those higher costs on to consumers, and sterling\u2019s weakness will be felt at the tills.</p> <p>And so to the fifth phase of grief: acceptance. Currency traders have already reset their expectations for the UK outside the EU. It\u2019s time the public joined them in accepting a vote for Brexit was a vote for a weaker pound \u2013 and all that comes with it.</p> <h2>To QE, or not to QE</h2> <p>So, farewell then quantitative easing, aged seven-and-a-half. It was seen as the solution to the economy\u2019s problems during the dark days of early 2009, but <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/may-says-unorthodox-monetary-policy-had-some-bad-side-effects\" title=\"\">Theresa May thinks QE is doing more harm than good</a> and has killed it off.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. There are certainly side-effects associated with the Bank of England\u2019s asset-purchase programme, which will be expanded to almost \u00a3450bn as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\" title=\"\">new round of stimulus announced by Threadneedle Street</a> in August. The object of QE is to drive down interest rates on safe government bonds and encourage investors to move into riskier assets such as shares and property. Not surprisingly, prices of these assets have gone up, enriching those who hold them. But those with assets in a bank or building society savings account have long been getting rotten returns thanks to rock-bottom interest rates.</p> <p>May\u2019s point is that the better-off have milked the benefits of QE while small savers have been hurt by the policy. The message from her speech to the Conservative party conference could not have clearer: this is not good enough and will have to change.</p> <p>Yet when pressed in Washington about whether this meant the government was contemplating changing the Bank\u2019s remit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/06/pound-sterling-chancellor-hammond-wall-street-charm-offensive-business-live\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond was unambiguous: it had no such plans</a>.</p> <p>Nor does the Bank share May\u2019s view about QE. It accepts that there are distributional effects from asset purchases, but says that without QE, the economy would have grown more slowly and unemployment would be higher. It doesn\u2019t accept that there are winners and losers from QE, rather that some gain more than others.</p> <p>Given that this is the Bank\u2019s strongly held view, it is not hard to envisage circumstances during Brexit negotiations in which Mark Carney tells Hammond that he wants more QE and needs the Treasury to indemnify the Bank against possible losses from the trades. In theory, Hammond could say no. But the smart money would be on him saying yes.</p> <h2>Tesco must tread carefully</h2> <p>Tesco\u2019s latest offer for investors is a perplexing one \u2013 enjoy an increase in your share price, but then see your credit rating fall. The supermarket group\u2019s share price surged last week after it reported a 1% increase in like-for-like sales in its half-year results, and chief executive Dave Lewis targeted a 3.5% to 4% operating margin by 2019/2020, well ahead of the present 2.2%.</p> <p>However, ratings agency Moody\u2019s swiftly warned that Tesco could face another downgrade to its credit rating \u2013 which is already at junk level \u2013 because of its \u00a35.9bn pension deficit.</p> <p>Despite Tesco\u2019s recovery under Lewis, the deficit looms over the company. Given the repercussions from the BHS scandal \u2013 which saw the failed company left with a \u00a3571m deficit \u2013 and Theresa May\u2019s tough talk on corporate governance, Tesco faces a delicate balancing act if it is to invest in its shops, make payments to directors and shareholders, and repair its pension scheme.</p>",
  "<p>It was the late 70s, and I was dancing with a revue in <a href=\"http://www.surfersparadise.com/\">Surfers Paradise, Australia</a>. The show was modelled on those at the Lido and Moulin Rouge in Paris. Topless girls, feather plumes and jazzy choreography. I\u2019d been in Australia for a couple of years, initially with a ballet company, and this was a change of pace. I was having a good time.</p> <p>One day, a bunch of surfers hit town. There was a big contest up the coast and some of them came to see the show. Afterwards, they came to a party at the apartment block at the place where we lived. One of them, word went round, was taken with Amanda, a lead dancer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Abellira had a distinctive stance, very low over the board, carving his turns with streamlined precision</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the surfers arrived, I stared. The guy who fancied Amanda was not some local hotshot, it was <a href=\"http://renoabellira.com/\">Reno Abellira</a>, one of the most stylish wave riders in the world. I\u2019d seen him on film, inscribing long, flowing lines on the Hawaiian North Shore. He had a distinctive stance, very low over his board, carving his turns with streamlined precision. And he was brave. Four years earlier, in what some still consider the greatest big-wave contest ever, he had won the <a href=\"http://www.surfline.com/surf-news/great-moments-in-surfing-history-reno-abellira-wins-the-1974-smirnoff-pro-1_112610/\">Smirnoff Pro on a thunderous day at Waimea Bay</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/63131845\">charging down the near-vertical face of a 30-footer</a> to snatch the victory from fellow Hawaiian Jeff Hakman.</p> <p>And here he was, on a sweltering night in Queensland, surrounded by thirsty, excitable dancers. Amanda was slim as a willow wand, with red hair cascading down her back. A few years later, she would be principal dancer at the Lido in Paris. Reno was all muscle, with a down-turned 70s moustache and skin tanned the colour of Pacific mahogany. He was a handsome guy and a surf god, but this cut no ice with Amanda. She was lovely, with a wicked sense of humour, but when the occasion demanded she could summon a cool ballerina hauteur. She was polite to Reno, but that\u2019s as far as it went.</p> <p>Seeing Reno standing alone, I joined him. I asked him what it felt like to drop into a giant wave like those at Sunset and Waimea, and he told me you felt the fear, but did it anyway. As we talked his eyes followed Amanda, who was prowling around the apartment like a restless jaguar. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s interested,\u201d he said, with the ghost of a smile. \u201cHang in there,\u201d I told him, but it wasn\u2019t long before he left.</p> <p>The next day Amanda and I were warming up before the show. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d she told me. \u201cI really, really liked Reno.\u201d But the surf tour had moved on.</p>",
  "<h2>Wild West: America\u2019s Great Frontier<br> 8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It\u2019s vista television time, as Auntie explores the great American wilderness. In the first of three episodes, that means visits to places where rain rarely falls: the deserts of Nevada, the cactus-dotted landscapes of Arizona, and California\u2019s heat-blasted Mojave. Along the way, we learn how creatures such as mustangs and desert tortoises have become adapted to environments where getting enough food and water to survive is a constant issue. <em>Jonathan Wright </em></p> <h2>Sir Chris Hoy: 200mph At Le Mans<br> 9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Competing in the Le Mans <br> 24-hour race was one of Chris Hoy\u2019s childhood dreams. And since he\u2019s struggled with the empty hours opened up by his retirement from cycling, giving it a go seemed only logical. This film tracks his entry into motorsport, but the racing itself is less interesting than the insight into Hoy\u2019s self-absorbed restlessness; presumably a characteristic he shares with other sporting high-achievers. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Victoria<br> 9pm, ITV</h2> <p>The heavily pregnant Victoria strives for a bit of autonomy in the final episode. \u201cLook!\u201d she beams as their carriage clip-clops through the throng, \u201cHow happy people are to see us!\u201d Which obviously doesn\u2019t include some proto-Farage, who rushes her coach to free her from the \u201cGerman tyrant\u201d. Or, indeed, the man from the Young England Society who shoots at the royal couple. Can the script shoehorn in a \u201cWe are not amused\u201d? It surely can. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls<br> 9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Things you never thought you\u2019d see happen, even in your weirdest reality TV dreams: Karen Danczuk is chasing down a crocodile. Yes, it\u2019s the final episode of the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising show, and the celebrity inhabitants are getting desperate. After a relaxed day off, the hungry mob are on the verge of eating each other, so Danczuk leads a hunting party in the hope of catching a croc. Will they survive or perish for a good cause? <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Trump vs Clinton Live: US Presidential Debate<br> 1.35am, Channel 4</h2> <p>After Donald Trump\u2019s sub-prime performance at the first debate \u2013 where he bloviated, sniffled and later muttered darkly about his microphone \u2013 the Republican nominee will be hoping to appear stronger in round two. Whether tonight\u2019s lectern-free town-hall format, with the candidates fielding questions from floating voters in St Louis, will play to his unique oratorical strengths remains to be seen. <em>Graeme Virtue </em></p> <h2>Hitler: The Rise And Fall<br> 9pm, More4</h2> <p>Adolf Hitler embodies a warning from history that cannot be overlooked, but this is far from the first series analysing his rise to leave one wondering if there is much left to be said. It\u2019s the standard assemblage of solemn experts, silly reconstructions, portentous voiceover, familiar archive footage and pompous soundtrack. This second episode chronicles the Nazis\u2019 emergence as a genuine political force in early 1930s Germany. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Robbie Coltrane\u2019s Critical Evidence<br> 10pm, CI</h2> <p>Having been on the other side of the (fictional) justice fence of late as a popular entertainer accused of sexual assault in National Treasure, Robbie Coltrane\u2019s now firmly back on the right side of the law with this new series on crime-scene forensics. This first episode sees him explore a 2002 murder in Cambridgeshire, where a tiny scrap of paper proved a crucial piece of the puzzle.

  "<p>A new age is dawning. Whether it is a wonderful one or a terrible one remains to be seen. Look around and the signs of dizzying technological progress are difficult to miss. Driverless cars and drones, not long ago the stuff of science fiction, are now oddities that can occasionally be spotted in the wild and which will soon be a commonplace in cities around the world.<br></p> <p>With a few flicks of a finger, we can use our phones to order up a meal, or a car, or a translation for a waiter\u2019s query in a foreign country. Gadgets such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/26/amazon-echo-alexa-voice-recognition-superfans\">Amazon Echo</a> are finding their way into living rooms, where they sit listening, ready to comply with a voice command.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, one could dismiss the digital age as consisting of little more than social networks and cat videos; no longer. Yet at the same time, many of the world\u2019s fundamental political institutions look dangerously unsteady. Britain is preparing to crash out of the European Union. In America, Republicans have nominated for president a man with no regard for global norms and little enough for the American constitution. </p> <p>What is important, but far from obvious, is that these two trends \u2013 this careening toward a new digital age on the one hand and this descent into political darkness on the other \u2013 are closely related. </p> <p>History suggests that periods of great economic change are also times of political and social difficulty. We must recognise that the present is no exception. It is our failure to recognise and address the difficulties created by the digital revolution that has helped usher us to this troubling political moment. There could be more trouble ahead. The digital revolution is beginning to teach us what a tectonic economic transformation feels like. It is putting us in the shoes of our great-great-grandparents: those who first experienced the transmission of a human voice across an electrical wire, who watched as the time to travel from one city to a distant other shrank from weeks to hours and who found themselves displaced as smiths or farmhands by fantastic new technologies. We have all found our working lives altered by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44dbb44f65e2f1d386341e374751bbe2cb01500/0_336_2971_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Today\u2019s technology is disrupting life, just as the machines of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the work patterns of our great-great grandparents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s economic revolution produces concern and not simply about the uncertainty of employment in the years to come. Those of us who currently appear to have job security can more than likely look forward to making less in the future than we had once hoped we might. Over the last couple of decades, wages, adjusted for inflation, have scarcely grown throughout a broad range of rich countries, longer in some cases. And this wage stagnation has occurred alongside other distressing trends. The share of income flowing to workers, as opposed to business and property owners, has fallen. And, among workers, there has been a sharp rise in inequality, with the share of income going to those earning the highest incomes increasing in an astounding fashion.</p> <p>Then there is the sobering data on employment. In America, the share of adult men of prime working age who are working or actively looking for work has fallen steadily, in some cases dramatically, over the last generation. Among all men, the rate of participation in the workforce dropped from about <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160620_cea_primeage_male_lfp.pdf\">76% in 1990 to 69% in 2015. </a>That may not sound especially worrying, but it corresponds to a difference of about 9 million men.</p> <p>And those squeezed out of work often find their lives upended. Stuck in atrophying communities with few prospects, many struggle to find purpose and satisfaction in life; indeed, recent research has turned up an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/02/death-rate-middle-aged-white-americans-aids\">alarming rise in mortality since the late 1990s among middle-aged white Americans</a>, mostly accounted for by an increase in suicides and in drug and alcohol abuse. The authors see economic insecurity as a contributing factor.</p> <p>This trend is not limited to America and neither can it be explained away as the product of ageing and retirement. In Europe, one in five adults under the age of 25 is unemployed. Across the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), 12% of people aged between 15 and 29 are neither in school nor work. Some are engaged in illicit activity or are in jail; others are in their parents\u2019 basements playing video games. Much the same is true of the long-term unemployed, many of them older men without much education, who drift around, often drinking to pass the day, lacking much, if any, connection to society at large.</p> <p>For an awful lot of people, work has become a less certain and often less remunerative contributor to material security. But work is not just the means by which we obtain the resources needed to put food on the table. It is also a source of personal identity. It helps give structure to our days and our lives. It offers the possibility of personal fulfilment that comes from being of use to others and it is a critical part of the glue that holds society together and smooths its operation. Over the last generation, work has become ever less effective at performing these roles. That, in turn, has placed pressure on government services and budgets, contributing to a more poisonous and less generous politics. Meanwhile, the march of technological progress continues, adding to the strain.</p> <p><strong>Either society will develop ways to shore up work or find substitutes</strong><br></p> <p>The digital revolution alters work in three ways. The first is through automation. New technologies are replacing certain workers, from clerks to welders, and will replace more in the future, from drivers to paralegals.<br></p> <p>At the same time, the digital revolution has supercharged a second force: globalisation. It would have been nearly impossible for rich western firms to manage the sprawling global supply chains that have been wrapped around the world over the past 20 years without powerful information technology. And while China and other emerging markets might have become better integrated in the world economy even without companies such as Apple scattering production across the globe, such growth would have been much slower and less dramatic. Instead, global employment grew by over a billion jobs over the last generation, with most of the growth occurring in emerging economies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41cfe51e84d520e67fbd8df459e0a6c1ede19180/0_243_3453_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Globalisation of western companies has helped the growth of China and other emerging economies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, technology provides a massive boost to the productivity of some highly skilled workers, allowing them to do work that it might previously have taken many more people to accomplish. Technology enables small teams of money managers to run vast funds; it is increasingly allowing highly skilled instructors to build courses that can be taken and retaken by millions of students, potentially replacing hundreds or even thousands of lecturers. New technology is allowing fewer doctors and nurses to observe and treat many more patients, fewer lawyers to pore over vastly more trial-related evidence and fewer researchers to sift through massive amounts of data and test more hypotheses more quickly.</p> <p>These three trends \u2013 automation, globalisation and the rising productivity of a highly skilled few \u2013 are combining to generate an abundance of labour: a wealth of humans. In its struggle to digest this unprecedentedly enormous ocean of would-be workers, the global economy is misfiring in worrying ways. And the institution of work \u2013 apart from family, our most important piece of social infrastructure \u2013 can no longer be counted on to fulfil its many crucial roles, from the ordering of our days, to the allocation of purchasing power, to the strengthening of the social ties that are nurtured when individuals feel as though they are contributing positively to the community. Workers are unlikely to take these woes lying down. Something has to give. Either society will find ways to shore up work or develop substitutes for it or workers will use the political system to undermine the forces disrupting their world.</p> <p>This should be a good problem for mankind to have. An abundance of labour is arguably the point, to the extent that there is one, of technological progress. It is the beginning of the end of the need to work hard to stay alive. A system in which people actively seek out labour they would strongly prefer not to do \u2013 manning call centres to handle the complaints of unhappy customers or carrying packages around a boiling warehouse, for example \u2013 is not one society ought to aim to preserve any longer than technologically necessary.</p> <p>Yet the hardest part in finding utopia is not the figuring out of how to produce more. We\u2019ve managed that. The hard part is the redistribution. Crafting a balance of work and redistribution that is sustainable is incredibly difficult. The rich and privileged don\u2019t want to subsidise the poor. The poor may conclude that what redistribution the rich offer leaves an impossibly huge, even unfair gap in the incomes of the haves and have-nots. The poor may also not be content with an economy in which they are effectively unnecessary, kept at peace by a hand-out from the state. If redistribution is managed too clumsily, the incentive for clever or ambitious individuals to work to improve the economy might be lost, leading to stagnant growth and too little social surplus with which to provide all members of society with a rising standard of living.</p> <p>The battle lines of the great social upheaval are already being drawn. Their defining questions: who deserves credit for generating economic bounty and who has the right to claim a share of that bounty once it has been generated? Many of those earning top incomes, in individualist America in particular, believe they are the overtaxed \u201cmakers\u201d in society. But a makers-and-takers conception of the world is one that neglects the social foundation on which wealth is built. We aren\u2019t merely divided into makers and takers. We are participants in societies, operating according to a broad social consensus. When that consensus breaks down, the wealth goes away. Society either agrees a way to share its riches that most members find acceptable or the system fractures and the social wealth available to everyone shrinks.</p> <p>The social nature of wealth, always important, is increasingly critical. The long process of cultural development that eventually yielded the Industrial Revolution was in many ways the process by which humanity learned ever better ways of structuring society in order to foster the emergence of complex economic activity. The digital revolution is increasing the importance of social wealth in two key ways.</p> <p>First, new technologies increase our potential productivity and output as a society; because we are capable of becoming richer thanks to digital technology, the economic return to economically important social institutions, such as a government capable of enforcing private property rights, is rising. The gap between the incomes of societies capable of supporting these institutions and those that cannot is growing. In 1980, Americans were 30 times richer than residents of the Central African Republic. In 2015, they were 90 times richer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The better countries become at sharing social wealth, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And second, the small-scale economic processes that generate new knowledge and turn it into profitable, welfare-enhancing activity are also becoming more social, and less individual, in nature. The value-generating pieces of successful companies were once satisfyingly tangible, consisting of buildings and machines, patents and people. That is ever less the case. Company cultures, which shape worker incentives and determine how a business reacts to changes in the marketplace, have become much more important in the digital age. Today, more than 80% of the value of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 firms is \u201cdark matter\u201d: the intangible secret sauce of success; the physical stuff companies own and their wage bill account for less than 20%, a reversal of the pattern that prevailed in the 1970s.</p> <p>A large proportion of that dark matter is an amorphous \u201cknow-how\u201d: the culture, incentives and tacit knowledge that make a modern company tick. Successful companies, be they Goldman Sachs or BuzzFeed, evolve a way of gathering, processing and acting on information that is critical to their success and which cannot easily be replicated. The value generated by a firm\u2019s culture, just like the value generated by networks of people within cities, or by a country\u2019s economic institutions, is social rather than individual.</p> <p>As social wealth becomes more important, fights about who belongs within particular societies \u2013 and can therefore share in that social wealth \u2013 will intensify. To take full advantage of its promise, countries must become better at sharing social wealth. Yet the better countries become at sharing social wealth among members, the greater the pressure to shrink the circle of social membership.</p> <p><strong>Separatist and nationalist political parties are on the rise across Europe</strong><br></p> <p>Today\u2019s political disturbances reflect the opening exchanges in a long societal negotiation over just what the state and the economy ought to do, and for whom, in the digital era. If the industrial era is any guide, this negotiation will last for decades to come and will occasionally result in dramatic, and possibly even violent, changes to the structure of global politics. Political systems are stubbornly resistant to change. Political parties are massive social institutions that persist for decades or centuries by building and maintaining connections with collections of smaller interest groups and individuals. Those people and interest groups come to define their political identity through their association with the party. Identities are not rewritten on a whim. Yet long-term changes in economic fundamentals do eventually force change.<br></p> <p>In America, where the political structure strongly favours a two-party system, the rise of fundamentalist factions has led to partisan polarisation. Intense, intra-party battling could eventually lead to irreconcilable differences, prompting a major party shake-up (or break-up). Such shifts are extremely rare in American politics, however. It is more probable that ascendant ideological camps within the Republican party, such as those with nativist passions, will come to dominate the party leadership, displacing the former establishment bosses. And the former establishment will then mostly accommodate itself to the new order, an easier trick, for most partisans, than flipping to the other side of the aisle entirely.</p> <p>Separatist and nationalist parties are on the rise across Europe. Le Pen\u2019s Front National is ascendant. Radical parties in Hungary and Poland are pushing for significant political change: to undermine existing democratic institutions and to edge away from the EU. In Britain, nationalist political elements, within the Ukip and the Conservative party, astonished the world by calling and winning a popular vote to remove Britain from the EU. Brexit will encourage Scottish nationalists, who may ultimately demand to leave the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Radical factions and parties battling for supremacy each have at their heart a particular conception of the \u201cgood life\u201d. Writers and thinkers, like me, try to imagine post-work utopias, in which, for example, sensibly structured social safety nets could free people of the constraints of the typical job. These people could then offer their services by the hour or the job on newfangled market-making apps, among other things, or they could even abandon labour markets altogether, as new forms of social institution encouraged them to volunteer their time to the community or otherwise engage in pro-social behaviour \u2013 while also living alongside people from vastly different backgrounds and perhaps nationalities, if some of us get our way.</p> <p>But that is possibly not what the typical rich-world citizen would consider the \u201cgood life\u201d, however much we might want that to be the case. We should instead anticipate that voters in many countries, rich and poor alike, will want something more predictable than life governed by supply-and-demand matching apps; more structured than life on the perpetual dole; more comfortable and familiar than life surrounded by people who do things in different ways, speak different languages and worship different deities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae141403c84fba58dfee476c3c5884a80c114fc8/0_221_4074_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Violent opposition to migrants in countries across Europe, including Poland, are forcing political change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcin Obara/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any future in which technology frees workers of the need to spend most of their daytime hours on the job, many people will opt for much more down time, often spent in rather aimless fashion. Yet people of all backgrounds also seem to value narratives of personal ambition and responsibility. People wish to have control over their economic lives and to be seen as contributing both to society and to the wellbeing of their families. People desire agency. They do not wish to be forced into unpleasant work by the need to feed their families, but neither do they want to be written off \u2013 or assigned meaningless work as the price of a generous welfare cheque. It isn\u2019t clear that the digital economy can provide the working conditions needed to extend the possibility of bourgeois comfort and status to a broader class of people. That will not stop them desiring it.</p> <p>The conflict between what people want and what economic and political systems are able to provide will play out in the political arena. Political battles will increasingly feature narratives about how to restore us all to a world in which people work at purposeful jobs for good pay. Those narratives will be thick with bogeymen: the malevolent forces denying voters access to that \u201cgood life\u201d. Conniving foreign governments, job-stealing immigrants, greedy bankers and incompetent politicians all star in such roles. Demagoguery can be a compelling political force.</p> <p><strong>Generous welfare policy will struggle to emerge in ethnically diverse regions</strong><br></p> <p>Reformers can compete in this arena. There will be room for leaders willing to say that the \u201cgood life\u201d of misty memory cannot be brought back; who promise instead to push forward modest, incrementalist policies, such as more generous state benefits and increased investment in training and infrastructure.<br></p> <p>The difficulty the reformers will face is that the global economy will tend to punish such effort. Labour abundance and structural demand weakness are not the sorts of things national politicians working in isolation can fix. They can ameliorate the worst effects, but that will leave voters disappointed. Moderate reformers will find themselves losing ground to politicians keen to unpick elements of the era of moderation, from the move towards freer trade and capital flows to the elimination of labour-market protections.</p> <p>Could there be a constituency for a more radical set of policy innovations: for generous, universal basic incomes, for example? Political interest in these sorts of reforms is growing. Yet generous welfare policy might struggle to emerge outside of places where political units are more ethnically or nationally coherent: where an absence of tribal suspicion facilitates the sharing of social wealth. It is no wonder that experimental, generous welfare policy has tended to emerge in Nordic countries, where ethnic and communal ties are strong (but where openness to immigration has begun to tear at the social consensus).</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of such communally coherent groups in an effort to protect social safety nets often seems to be the point of the new nationalist politics. What separatist quasi-nations seem to want is a world in which they enjoy the economic benefits of global integration, but in which critical political and economic decisions are made by societies with a high degree of national or ethnic coherence: a future of Irelands and Estonias rather than of Britains and Spains: larger states with more diverse populations. The institutions of the EU or, indeed, the world economy as a whole are not built to handle waves of fracturing nations.</p> <p>Italian, Belgian and even German leaders are understandably reluctant to sign off on Catalan independence, given the damage regional separatism could do to their own states. Rich-world ethno-nationalism could destroy the economic integration on which its prosperity depends. Even if it doesn\u2019t fail before it begins, the model of highly redistributive, ethno-nationalist mini-states will depend for its success on the exclusion of outsiders, condemning much of the world\u2019s population to poverty.</p> <p>Some time in the future, a wonderful new politics might well emerge that provides a robust minimum standard of living to all regardless of race or nationality, which supports a multitude of different conceptions of the \u201cgood life\u201d and which does not rely on some underlying fear of some outside other to maintain its popularity. We are not yet able to conceive of such a system or to understand what balance of political forces needs to emerge to bring it into existence and sustain it. And so, for the time being, we are stuck in a world of nasty political trade-offs. We can but hope this era will prove a fleeting one. History suggests it will not be. But perhaps we will get lucky.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/284165/the-wealth-of-humans/\">The Wealth of Humans</a> <em>by </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ryanavent\"><em>Ryan Avent</em></a><em> is published by Allen Lane, \u00a325</em><br></p>",
  "<p>Seeking sustenance in a Brummie cafe to get me through the Tory conference, I heard myself request \u201ca full English Brexit\u201d. That\u2019s what it does to your head: several days of close confinement with Conservatives salivating over departure from the European Union.</p> <p>Back in the conference hall, the full English Brexit was being served up by Theresa May and all the mini-Mays in the cabinet as they sought to satisfy the audience\u2019s appetite for the starkest form of rupture with our partners of the past four decades. There are several possible ways of exiting the EU. They range from amicable separation to bitter divorce. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\" title=\"\">Tory gathering in Birmingham</a> set Britain on a course that leads to the most turbulent, disruptive and hazardous form of departure. It was the working assumption of all the cabinet ministers I spoke to, and this was so regardless of which side they took during the referendum, that it is now near inevitable that Britain will cease to be a member of the single market. Among those Tories who have always yearned for that outcome, I found them talking as if it was a given. Even more significantly, ministers who would once have recoiled in horror from that prospect now sound resigned to it.</p> <p>This is hugely significant and how we got to this point needs some explanation. In June, it was not a given that Britain would do Brexit the hard way. Out had won, but only narrowly. There was much room for interpretation of what that meant. There was quite a lot of talk from leading Outers about needing to respect the 48% who voted the other way. Once the forces of Remain had recovered from the shock of their defeat, they initially remustered around the cause of preserving British membership of the single market and with it the trade and investment on which so many livelihoods depend. They could cite the Tory party\u2019s election manifesto. This had clearly suggested that, even if Britain voted to leave the EU, a Conservative government would sustain membership of the single market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\" title=\"\">The manifesto promised</a>: \u201cWe are clear about what we want from Europe. We say: yes to the Single Market\u201d. That, Remainers declared, was the trench where they would dig in.</p> <p>That trench is still there, but I found very few people left defending it in Birmingham. The Tories are plunging towards hard Brexit and a riven Labour party is not in a fit condition to stop them. After an initial period of complacency, investors are waking up to the prospect that Britain could lurch out of the EU without reliable access to her most important markets. The more loudly her activists cheered Mrs May, the faster came the plunge in the pound. By the end of the week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/07/flash-crash-in-pound-spooks-investors-business-live\" title=\"\">sterling had dropped so vertiginously </a>that one pound didn\u2019t buy one euro at bureaux de change. As it has become clearer that Britain\u2019s government is tilting towards the Full Monty Brexit, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/08/eu-leaders-line-up-to-insist-uk-will-pay-a-high-price-for-brexit-stance\" title=\"\">European leaders have hardened their language</a> about the penalty that will entail.</p> <p>Why has this happened? A large part of the explanation is Mrs May and how she is choosing to resolve the paradox of being a prime minister tasked by the voters to deliver an outcome that she campaigned against. Many of the hardline Tory Brexiters were highly wary when she first moved into Number 10 because she had been a Remainer, albeit a near-invisible one, during the referendum campaign. Now the Brexiters speak of Mrs May in glowing terms. \u201cIt turns out that having a Remainer as prime minister has worked perfectly for us,\u201d one remarked to me. \u201cShe has to keep proving to us and the party that she is serious.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She threw them three big lumps of meat. One of those announcements was really spin disguised as meat. Her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/02/theresa-may-great-repeal-bill-eu-british-law\" title=\"\">Great Repeal Act</a>\u201d will in reality transfer EU law into British law, to then be removed or amended at a later date. Her more substantial announcement was that she would trigger article 50, the formal notification to the EU that Britain wants a divorce, no later than March next year. This creates an unforgiving timetable for what will be a horrendously complex and fraught negotiation.</p> <p>Even some of the Brexiters in the cabinet are starting to sober up to the reality of it. To describe the inundation of papers on the subject that he is consuming, one minister adopted an Americanism and told me it was \u201clike drinking from a fire hydrant\u201d.</p> <p>That negotiation will not be made easier by the prime minister\u2019s third, and most significant, act. That was to set a firm face against trying to find any accommodation with EU countries over freedom of movement. \u201cWe are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration again,\u201d she declared. One of her cabinet confirmed to me that they plan to approach the negotiations by telling the EU that freedom of movement is simply not on the table; they only want to talk about trade. If you believe that the Out vote was powered by opposition to migration, then the only form of Brexit that respects the referendum result is a mode of departure that ends freedom of movement. This position has a logic to it and some of the recanting Tory Remainers contend that this logic is too powerful for them to argue with it. Resistance, they say, is futile. It is impossible to reconcile rejecting freedom of movement and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice with continued membership of the single market. So Britain will be left to gamble on trying to get some sort of tariff deal with EU countries at a time when they are in no mood to do us any favours.</p> <p>Stockholm Syndrome describes how some hostages become traumatically bonded with their kidnappers. Remainers in the cabinet often sounded like they were the psychological captives of the Brexiters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/amber-rudd\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a>, a liberal Tory who was a star of the Remain campaign, was one of the ministers who made a hostage-video sort of speech to the conference. The home secretary announced that companies would be forced to declare how many foreigners they employed, as if attracting skilled people from abroad was a mark of shame. In her setpiece at the end of the conference, Mrs May denounced \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d. That was a clever applause line with unclever implications for a country that thrives by attracting overseas talent and investment. It is this that will be noted by the rest of the world, not fatuous rhetoric about Britain \u201cgoing global\u201d. The conference resounded to the slam of doors being shut.</p> <p>There were a few voices of resistance. One was the effervescently gobby former minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Anna Soubry.</a> Another was the former cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicky-morgan\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan</a>. They stood out so much because those prepared to argue openly for a softer Brexit were so thin on the ground in Birmingham. Tory resistance to hard Brexit has been badly weakened by what has been happening in the Labour party since the referendum. In its immediate aftermath, Labour MPs declared that they would battle to preserve membership of the single market. Then they examined the vote in their party\u2019s traditional heartlands in Wales, the north of England and the Midlands and grew terrified by the strength of the Out vote there.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\" title=\"\">Labour conference in Liverpool </a>was notable for the number of prominent MPs from its centrist wing declaring they could no longer defend unrestricted freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn has another position again. He is hostile to the single market but in favour of unlimited migration. The net result is that the Tory soft Brexiters do not think that they can rely on support from the main opposition party.</p> <p>Business and the City are becoming increasingly agitated that Brexit will not be the soft landing they hoped for. Representatives of manufacturers at the conference spoke of becoming more depressed by the day. But the mood of the times is not sympathetic to business arguments. It was striking to witness a Tory conference eagerly applaud a Tory prime minister lacerating corporate Britain. Some Tories say publicly, and more will say privately, they are willing to sacrifice some prosperity if that is the price of curbing immigration. This made it especially ironic that the Tories met in Birmingham, a melting-pot city whose prosperity was built on entrepreneurship and trade. Never has the Conservative party sounded less like a friend of business. Never has the Conservative party sounded more hostile to liberal free markets. Were the Labour party under a different form of management, the Tories might be more nervous of alienating business by taking the hard route to Brexit. But not in a century of Sundays are the CBI and the City going to ally themselves with Mr Corbyn.</p> <p>Free-market liberals still have some champions in government, notably at the Treasury, which thinks the economic impact of a hard Brexit will be severe and long lasting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Philip Hammond</a>, the chancellor, told the conference that the referendum result was not a vote to make Britain poorer. That he would not have said unless he feared his colleagues are pushing in a direction that will leave Britain very much the poorer. The chancellor sounded like a man losing the battle. Lost it will be unless he finds some more friends and quick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6272f2a04d1d124356e1c94b601560ecf78185ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6272f2a04d1d124356e1c94b601560ecf78185ce/0_38_2077_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, was one of few Tories prepared to call for a softer Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, was one of few Tories prepared to call for a softer Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>"
