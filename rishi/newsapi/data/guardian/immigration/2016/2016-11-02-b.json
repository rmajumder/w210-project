I was happy because I finally got a job but, the other side of it, [I] felt so bad.\u201d</p> <p>Dacho\u2019s second stroke of good fortune came 12 months ago when he attended a networking event for refugees with IT skills \u2013 <a href=\"https://techfugees.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Techfugees Hackathon</a> Australia \u2013 and met Anna Robson, who became his cofounder and the chief executive of Refugee Talent.</p> <p>Robson had spent 10 months working at the Nauru detention centre as an adult recreation officer and the two of them bonded over their desire to help refugees get work experience. Robson decided to join forces with Dacho to build an online platform to connect refugees to employers. The site launched in February.</p> <p>The third time fortune smiled upon them was in March this year when Robson, moonlighting as an Uber driver, started chatting about her venture with an investor she was taking to the airport.</p> <p>That passenger was Jason Yat-Sen Li, the<strong> </strong>chairman of Vantage Asia Holdings, a diversified investment group with offices in Beijing and Sydney and interests in real estate, mining, financial services and technology.

  "<p>It will certainly help to energise and focus the Brexit process if the high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/high-court-decision-trigger-brexit-government-parliament-due-thursday-article-50\">rules tomorrow</a> that parliament, not the government, has the authority to trigger the process. As longtime critics of the system under which the royal prerogative is exercised by ministers alone rather than by ministers in parliament, this newspaper would welcome such a ruling. In any truly modern state, the consent of parliament should be necessary in a major treaty change, which Brexit unquestionably is, just as it is now in practice necessary, since Iraq, in any major UK military commitment. Yet although tomorrow\u2019s verdict will be constitutionally significant (and may well be appealed against), the reality is that to give greater authority to parliament, though welcome, is only truly meaningful if parliament wants to use it. At the present moment, that seems far from the case.</p> <p>That has to change. Brexit is the most important immediate problem facing Britain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/moodys-warns-uk-credit-rating-downgrade-brexit\">The prosperity of the country depends on it</a>. The place of Britain in the world hangs on it. Even the survival of the United Kingdom as a functioning entity relies on it being sensibly handled. Our party politics are being reshaped by it. Brexit will be the most consequential international arrangement made by this country in generations.</p> <p>Yet most of Westminster continues to act as spectators to the Brexit process not as participants in it. Again today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/nov/02/pmqs-may-corbyn-chilcot-hammond-to-adopt-flexible-fiscal-targets-in-autumn-statement-politics-live?page=with:block-5819d8c9e4b029b92ca44b29#block-5819d8c9e4b029b92ca44b29\">Theresa May was barely challenged on the subject at prime minister\u2019s questions</a>. It is as though the referendum vote has become the totemic one-off unchallengeable source of all political authority on Britain\u2019s future to which every other question must defer in all conceivable circumstances, however dangerous. This may be what the Brexit fanatics want, as they hound sceptics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-theresa-may-bank-of-england-tory-conference\">such as the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/mark-carney-brexit-bolsheviks-new-target-chancellor\">the chancellor, Philip Hammond</a>. But it is bad democracy, bad government and bad politics. It needs to be resisted and stopped.</p> <p>Today, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/theresa-may-irish-pm-enda-kenny-no-hard-border-with-north\">the government of Ireland called a conference</a> of politicians, business leaders and civil society representatives in Dublin. It was held to discuss the Brexit implications for Ireland\u2019s delicate north-south settlement, and for the future of the open border that Britain and Ireland have broadly enjoyed in one form or another since 1923, as well as before Irish independence itself. The maintenance of that common travel arrangement is a policy that all citizens of the UK should be concerned about. Though opposed to Brexit, the Irish government has been exemplary in attempting to publicise and codify the many complex issues that arise for the island as a result of the referendum vote. Yet the British government has not produced for British voters a tenth of the useful public material that its counterpart in Dublin has been providing.</p> <p>It was one thing for a new British government to require a bit of time to sort out how to proceed on Brexit following the vote. But that is four months ago now. British government and politics is increasingly living in a fool\u2019s paradise about Brexit and its implications, as well as about the timetable that will be triggered by a formal decision to start negotiations. The scale of some of the reality was made clear in <a href=\"https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Brexit%20%26%20Beyond_0.pdf\">a new report on Brexit from a group of independent academics and political scientists</a>. Its conclusion is that the process, with or without the parliamentary vote on the initial triggering of article 50 on which the high court will rule tomorrow, is as complex as it is unpredictable. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/02/brexit-politicians-senior-academics-the-uk-in-a-changing-europe\">experts</a> are clear that the process \u201cwill test the UK\u2019s constitutional and legal frameworks and bureaucratic capacities to their limits\u201d.</p> <p>Theirs is exactly the sort of sober and factual document that the UK government is derelict in its duty by not producing for the British public. It performs the practical educative service of spelling out many of the choices facing Britain. These range from when article 50 should be triggered (as late as possible, in our view), whether it can be revoked (yes), how many negotiations are required (it\u2019s hard to avoid several), whether there will need to be a transitional period (almost certainly), the form of consent needed at the end of the process (parliament or maybe an election, in our view) and even the explosive issue of whether the referendum is binding (in practice yes, but in law no). The fanatical anti-EU press has a vested interest in not publicising any of these. MPs and parliament have no such vested interest. Their job is hold the executive to account and to govern Britain. It is time they did so.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2016. An earlier version used the word \u201cproving\u201d where \u201cproviding\u201d was meant.</p>",

We are going to see people acting on those fears if the pound worsens in value against the euro never mind the deplorable villification [of EU migrants].\u201d</p> <p>He said that workers and employers needed the government to provide reassurance about the future position of EU nationals in the UK labour market. \u201cIt is all very well the government saying they want to keep their cards close to their chest but people are deciding with their feet.\u201d</p>",

The statement comments that \u201dthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u201d while adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the line that it wants to \u201cwait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u201d. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.</p> <p>Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news.

When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

Clearly given the importance of Anglo-Irish relations, the border with Northern Ireland, the billions in trade across the Irish Sea, the government in Dublin is worried about the prospect of a fresh diplomatic war breaking between the EU and the UK whenever Theresa May triggers article 50.</p> <p>Another significant part of the Taoiseach\u2019s contribution today during the all-island summit on Brexit in Dublin was Kenny suggesting that his British counterpart might press the exit button before the spring. Was Kenny hinting that pressure to get to an earlier Brexit from within the Tory Party was pushing the UK out the EU door before the Spring of 2017? Or indeed was the Irish premier sending a warning signal to London about the perils of doing so without negotiations having been properly started and exit strategies properly thought out?</p> <p>The main absentees from the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former military hospital and now the museum of modern art in Ireland, were the unionists. Neither the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionists or the pro-remain Ulster Unionists attended. Both parties have argued that today\u2019s conference went beyond the remit of the agreements that established devolution, power sharing and north-south bodies under the island of Ireland: the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the 2006 St Andrews Agreement. In a sense they are right because the main business between all the political traditions on the island regarding Brexit will be done at the next North-South ministerial council, which will take place on 18 November in Armagh city. </p> <p>Away from the rhetoric there appears to be a willingness between unionism and nationalism to hatch a pragmatic deal that will not destabilise peace or plunge the island economy into the abyss. This cross-border body was established under the Good Friday peace deal and brings together ministers from Dublin to Belfast to discuss all island matters. Which obviously would include how do both states on the island cope with Brexit.</p> <p>Another important meeting takes place next week in Downing Street when Theresa May again invites the leaders of the devolved parliaments in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff to Number 10 to discuss Brexit negotiations and plans ahead to deal with the 26 EU states.</p> <p>Today\u2019s conference now seems to have been a means by which Dublin sent out two messages to London and the other EU capitals. It was a warning to Britain that exit-talks with Ireland\u2019s European partners are going to be messy and perhaps even a little brutal. To their fellow Europeans, Kenny\u2019s suggestion that the other EU states should not get obsessed over what Britain gets is also a warning that if other countries start to issue specific demands of their own as pay-off to London then the entire European project could be put in peril. In both scenarios the entire political establishment in Dublin acknowledges Ireland has a lot to lose. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa53bb94f5fd0b9c59ad2e02880c8e2928e33723/0_162_4928_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enda Kenny speaks to the media on arrival at the all-island summit in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0e5be4b07ceadb3a1ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:04:45.970Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing has adjourned for at least 15 minutes because the MPs have to take part in a vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0cb2e4b029b92ca44c69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:57:43.054Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chilcot says the cabinet should have received formal written advice from the attorney general about whether the war was legal.

It is probably fair to say that a British politician can never go wrong whacking Fifa - with left or right, tabloid or broadsheet - and May milked this for all it was worth. It was an easy hit, but you can\u2019t blame her for taking it.</p> <p>Should Jeremy Corbyn have asked about Fifa? If Alastair Campbell was in charge of his PMQs planning, doubtless it would have been question number one. But this is not Corbyn\u2019s style and, if he had tried to set himself up as a Fifa-bashing poppy patriot, it would probably have sounded phoney.</p> <p>Instead Corbyn focused on welfare, highlighting cuts to universal credit, benefit sanctions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/27/benefit-sanctions-food-banks-oxford-university-study\"> the research showing their link to increased demand for food banks</a> and Ken Loach\u2019s film, I, Daniel Blake. Some of his questions were quite effective, but others, less so. (For example, given that he was asking about universal credit, why didn\u2019t Corbyn point out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/28/iain-duncan-smith-challenge-theresa-may-universal-credit-cuts\">even Iain Duncan Smith wants these cuts to be reversed?) </a></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s best moment was probably when, referring to sanctions, he urged May to stop \u201cthis institutionalised barbarity against often very vulnerable people\u201d. But May seemed comfortable with Corbyn\u2019s questions because she was able to condemn Labour\u2019s stance on welfare. She told the Labour leader:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You have a view that there should be no assessments, no sanctions and unlimited welfare. I have to say to you that the Labour party is drifting away from the views of Labour voters. It\u2019s this party that understands working-class people.</p> </blockquote> <p>The moment Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader probably became inevitable in 2015 was when he was the only candidate to vote against the welfare bill. The other three candidates abstained on the bill, which included welfare cuts, in line with the Labour whip. But abstention was Labour\u2019s official position because Harriet Harman, the acting leader, took the view that being seen as soft on welfare spending had contributed to the party\u2019s election defeat. PMQs today confirmed that Corbyn does not accept this view, but it remains to be seen whether he has found a way of selling Labour welfarism to the electorate. May sounded like someone who thinks that he hasn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5afng\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2865607\"            data-video-name=\"May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs \u2013 video highlights\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5819f826e4b0d073c27d0b04\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/02/161102PMQs2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/nov/02/may-and-corbyn-clash-over-benefits-at-pmqs-video-highlights\">May and Corbyn clash over benefits at PMQs</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:37:04.209Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819e361e4b029b92ca44b61\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:02:20.448Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May tells Fifa to 'sort their own house out' before giving orders to UK over poppies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May has launched a blistering attack on football\u2019s governing body Fifa, which has turned down a request from England and Scotland players to wear armbands featuring poppies when the sides meet on Remembrance Day.</p> <p>Speaking at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, May said the stance taken by Fifa was \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d and said the strength of feeling across the House of Commons was clear.</p> <p>\u201cOur football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Her response was prompted by a question from Steve McCabe, Labour\u2019s MP for Birmingham Selly Oak who was born in Inverclyde. \u201cWill she tell the respective associations [England and Scotland] that in this country, we decide when to wear poppies and they\u2019ll be wearing them at Wembley?\u201d</p> <p>May said the decision should lie with the respective associations but said \u201ca clear message is going from this House.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa, has been mired in a long-running corruption scandal, should be more concerned with its own affairs, May went on. \u201cI should say to Fifa before they start telling us what to do they jolly well ought to sort their own house out.\u201d</p> <p>The footballing body normally bans any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts.

Corbyn used all six questions to ask about welfare, but he moved from one topic to another, with varying success. May was at her weakest at the start, when Corbyn asked about cuts to universal credit which are coming down the line, which will effectively undo the tax credit cuts U-turn announced by George Osborne, but these calculations are complex, and hard to explain, and although May did not address the point at all, Corbyn did not drive his point hard home. He was more passionate, and effective, on benefit sanctions, but at this point May may had a solid response which involved accusing Labour of being opposed to any form of sanction or fiscal discipline in welfare spending. Corbyn finished with a dignified plea on behalf of parents who had difficulty affording funeral costs for children who die, and this prompted a semi-consensual response from May, who said funding was already available. So, overall, a bit of a draw.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgxEglC73aA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MgxEglC73aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T13:16:40.063Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5819d814e4b029b92ca44b1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T12:15:03.482Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the housing benefit bill is going up.

  "<p>I often post pictures of my food online before I have tasted it. I take the photo, adjust the brightness, contrast and saturation, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ruby.tandoh/?hl=en\">upload it</a> to my social media accounts and rejoice in how amazing it is. Sometimes, when I go on to eat the food in front of me, I don\u2019t even like it. That pretty orange and pistachio thing I made is bitter because the oranges have gone rancid. The photogenic Italian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfogliatella\">sfogliatella</a> pastry, which I bought more or less entirely to take a photo of, is actually pretty tough. I am left chewing the pastry long after the \u201clikes\u201d have stopped trickling in. The interaction was sweet while it lasted, though.</p> <p>We love to share our food. Not necessarily in the physical sense, because that would mean giving away something substantive and delicious. That gesture is still reserved for the people around us who we love and care about. But for the rest of the world \u2013 the school pals and the random followers and our prying family friends \u2013 we share our food online. We are sharing more food in this way than ever before, and a huge amount of this hungry, food-centric media revolves around food photography and short videos on platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dea4819a27ec2ea6220aa7297af3299b67026532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dea4819a27ec2ea6220aa7297af3299b67026532/0_0_885_885/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mouthwatering: a blueberry zoothie bowl\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mouthwatering: a blueberry zoothie bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: healthyeating_jo/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/hawaiian-salad-watermelon-juice-2017-food-trends-waitrose\">Waitrose food and drink report</a>, released on Wednesday, focuses on the way in which food has become social currency thanks to how we share and discuss it online. It is impossible to wade through the quagmire of social media without segueing into virtual treasure troves of #foodporn, #instafood and proudly #delicious content.</p> <p>According to the report, one in five Brits has shared a food photo online or with our friends in the past month. We have managed to forge what looks like a rare pure corner of social media, where pleasure is the order of the day. No matter the poster or the politics, food shines bright as something that all of us can aspire to, if only we curate our lives and our diets carefully enough.</p> <p>Most of us who document our meals online are amateurs, but there exists a sizeable, and hugely profitable, industry of professional food bloggers and Instagrammers, whose pristine food styling sets the tone for a whole aesthetic movement.</p> <p>Take Sarah Coates who, off the back of the success of her blog <a href=\"http://www.thesugarhit.com/\">The Sugar Hit</a> and her 36,000 followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesugarhit/\">Instagram</a>, has <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sugar-hit.html\">released a cookbook</a> and shaped a particular niche for herself in the online baking world. Hers is a self-avowedly saccharine, indulgent kind of food. Unlike much of the more earnest online food world, her photographs are bright, flooded with light and popping with flashes of colour, vibrancy and life. Punchy tones and patterns give the photos a kind of levity, in spite of the (wonderfully) butter-heavy, cloying sweetness of the food itself. Certain foods become emblems with a life of their own: waffles made in a round waffle-iron; doughnuts glazed or rolled in sugar; funfetti sprinkles. These posts amass huge amounts of interaction from followers, and spawn food trends of their own. First come the savvy Instagrammers, then the foodie public, and then, once we have all moved on to something new, the traditional food press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"309a83822d20be9a7f68cafa63e26b808275b328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309a83822d20be9a7f68cafa63e26b808275b328/0_0_803_1003/801.jpg\" alt=\"Glazed doughnuts from the Sugar Hit blog\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glazed doughnuts from the Sugar Hit blog.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: thesugarhit/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once these Instagram-friendly foods go viral, they can completely change the way we eat. Breakfast, for example, has shifted from a decidedly unphotogenic cereal or marmalade on toast to the bright hues of avocado toast (there are nearly 250,000 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/avocadotoast/?hl=en\">#avocadotoast hashtagged photos</a> on Instagram) and smoothie bowls. Even the humble fry-up has been rebranded, in the hands of the <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com\">Hemsley sisters</a>, as an oven-baked, meticulously arranged, \u201chealthier\u201d big breakfast. <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/recipe/one-pan-full-monty-breakfast/\">It looks great</a> and presumably tastes awful, the oven tray divided into neat strips of colour, from leathery lean oven bacon to overdone eggs.</p> <p>Among the foods billed to gain traction in 2017, today\u2019s Waitrose report points to Hawaiian poke and even, in an alarming twist, vegetable yoghurts. No doubt these will be helped along in the likability stakes with their colourful, snappy Instagram vibe.</p> <p>There is a big generation gap in this movement, though. According to the Waitrose report, 18- to 24-year olds are five times more likely to share photos of their food online than the over 55s \u2013 and that is certainly reflected in the types of cuisine, styling and tone that are popular in the online food world. So you are unlikely to find photos of old-fashioned sherry trifles, unpretty Irish stew or traditional meat-and-two-veg meals, unless it\u2019s in a shrewdly ironic way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e9b72b17c94b45766d1aaef522ddebaabb243c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e9b72b17c94b45766d1aaef522ddebaabb243c0/0_0_2228_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stack of multicoloured macaroons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stack of multicoloured macaroons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, there are fun, irreverent Instagram food circles, all funfetti and ice-cream sandwiches, and \u2013 in a twist that is so very 2016 that it makes my soul scream \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHmJwAdATjz/?tagged=flamingocake&amp;hl=en\">flamingo pool float-shaped cakes</a>. But just as popular are the serious, aspirational channels popularised by accounts such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/violetcakeslondon/?hl=en\">@violetcakeslondon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/skye_mcalpine/?hl=en\">@skye_mcalpine</a>. Here, you will find beautifully shot, intricately staged photographs of the food and, crucially, the lifestyles of successful, creative thirtysomethings. These are wishful odes to how serene and perfect your life could be, if only you had the money, the \u00a350 ceramic platters and the time. Perhaps in keeping with the broader asymmetry between the numbers of social media users in different generations, there\u2019s a lot less to be seen of older people, or past food fashions, in this smart, moneyed, and overwhelmingly young world.</p> <p>And yet it would be wrong to assume that this online culture doesn\u2019t bleed through to tint the ways that real people cook and eat. For every wildly successful professional food blogger, there are countless amateurs posting the minutiae of their gastronomic day online. Meals that are Instagrammable \u2013 take, for instance, Borough Market\u2019s Bread Ahead doughnuts, of which there are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/breadahead/?hl=en\">nearly 5,000 tagged photos on Instagram</a> \u2013 become viral content in their own right. These foods become the must-eat and, more importantly, must-document meals of the moment. Restaurants such as London\u2019s <a href=\"https://baolondon.com/\">Bao</a> keep punters queuing out the door just through the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bao_london/?hl=en\">photogenic strength</a> of one good dish. (For what it\u2019s worth, I went to Bao to try their cloud-soft steamed buns and they were as good as they looked).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a103d9a997bc6e216dfc65134974bf8ad7876f9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a103d9a997bc6e216dfc65134974bf8ad7876f9a/0_0_3328_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avocado and guacamole\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going green: fresh avocado and guacamole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Increasingly, we are being influenced not just in the types of food that we eat, but how we cook and eat that food. The Waitrose report also states that almost half of us take more care over a dish if we think a photo might be taken of it, and nearly 40% claim to worry more about presentation than they did five years ago. We might include a garnish of picked thyme leaves to bring a pop of colour to a lemon drizzle cake, even if that thyme doesn\u2019t really stand strong against the punch of the citrus. I am guilty of weeding out the messy and the misshapen from a batch of doughnuts or muffins before I take a photo. I might add a glaze that nobody wants, just because it will make the afternoon sun catch and glint in the furrows of the churros I just fried. It\u2019s aesthetic first, taste later and, quite often, no taste at all.</p> <p>The old saying that we eat first with our eyes rings true here. If people, in the process of preparing their food with extra care, or receiving a perfectly presented plate, are able to savour that food and that moment a little bit more, all the better. If a home cook can derive a little extra pride from posting their meal online, that\u2019s great. Of course, a photograph can never tell the whole story when it comes to something as tactile, personal and intimate as food, but this isn\u2019t about having it all. It is about having fun.</p> <p>Posting food on social media can reframe the ways that we interact with food on a fundamental level. When we document the food we eat, taking time to relish, share and even be proud of it, we also destigmatise it. Although #cleaneating, weight loss and #cleanse food photographs on Instagram have created a shaming, toxic subculture of foodphobia and guilt, there is a still greater faction of foodie social media that rallies against that nastiness. People in recovery from eating disorders are able to chronicle their recovery and celebrate each morsel of food that they are able to eat. In the absence of positive depictions of plus-size people in the mainstream media, social media affords fat people a place where they can subvert the expectations of embarrassment, shyness and prescribed dieting foisted upon them by a fatphobic world. Posting your meals online \u2013 whether they are healthy, unhealthy or none of your goddamn business \u2013 can be a freeing act.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e771c0ddec3a5800ce264e822cbaaeda3d7a2525\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e771c0ddec3a5800ce264e822cbaaeda3d7a2525/0_0_800_1001/799.jpg\" alt=\"One of Ruby Tandoh\u2019s pictures on Instagram\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A perfect meal for two \u2013 and thousands of followers. One of Ruby Tandoh\u2019s pictures on Instagram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ruby.tandoh/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want to post your meal online, post away. Upload a picture of that sausage and mash. Don\u2019t worry that the light is dim, that the gravy sloshes in a swampy pool across your plate. Sharing is a generous act, but perfectionism smothers that goodness. Upload the unfiltered, ugly pictures of your failed birthday cake, or your fish and chips in grease-soaked paper. Or, if you want to fuss over the exact positioning of four blueberries on top of a smoothie bowl for an hour before you tuck in, do that \u2013 but don\u2019t forget to enjoy your food. Eat what, and how, you want.</p> <p>I keep a food diary. It is only a list in Biro on narrow-ruled paper, in a notebook embossed with a gold hotdog. Everything that has really made my tastebuds sing goes on the list. Hot and sour red lentil soup; a mint chocolate Magnum; hot crumpets with butter and Marmite \u2026 the words alone create their own kind of moreish poetry. No great meal goes forgotten and, in theory at least, no culinary mishap is repeated. (Though, truthfully, I have made the same rubber-boot pancakes once a month for the past two years.)</p> <p>This is Instafood v1.0, the analogue version of the slick, glitzy food media that has taken root online. There is a world of difference between my garish notebook and that good-looking social-media culture, but their function is one and the same. Taking the time to enjoy and to document the meals we eat is a cathartic luxury. It is almost as nourishing as the food itself.</p>",
  "<p>Schools in England receive no recognition for their \u201cincredible achievement\u201d in helping immigrants integrate successfully into society, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector has said, after likening the education system to England\u2019s football team.</p> <p>Sir Michael Wilshaw rubbished \u201ctabloid claims\u201d that British children suffer as a result of immigration, saying non-immigrant pupils do better as a result of having immigrant peers, and described the government\u2019s plans to open more grammar schools as a \u201cmonstrous mistake\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/sir-michael-wilshaws-speech-at-the-fasna-autumn-conference\">speech in London</a>, the outgoing head of Ofsted mixed familiar criticisms of state schools with high praise for their role in educating and integrating recent arrivals into British society, which Wilshaw claimed \u201chas largely gone unnoticed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe regularly castigate ourselves \u2013 rightly \u2013 for the poor performance of white British pupils.

We look forward to seeing the plans that the government has now committed to bringing before the House as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said May had been clear the UK did not want to see a return to borders of the past. \u201cThe arrangement that currently exists has served both sides of that border extremely well and we have no desire, and neither does the Irish government, to change that.

  "<p>The refugee crisis may have divided Germany and sown discord in family households, but it could ultimately help the country be more at ease with its new-found liberal identity. That is the optimistic thesis proposed by the country\u2019s first refugee-themed comedy.</p> <p>Willkommen bei den Hartmanns (Welcome to the Hartmanns\u2019), which features some of Germany\u2019s biggest stars and opens in cinemas on Thursday, tells the story of Diallo, a Nigerian asylum seeker who is taken in by a family in a posh district of Munich after mother Angelika, a retired headteacher played by Senta Berger, visits a local refugee shelter.</p> <p>The newcomer\u2019s arrival triggers a series of domestic dramas \u2013 father Richard\u2019s late-life crisis, daughter Sophie\u2019s failed love life, workaholic son Philip\u2019s burnout and grandson Basti\u2019s poor grades \u2013 which are eventually resolved in a rollicking finale involving clashes between Pegida-style \u201cpatriotic citizens\u201d and leftwing activists outside the Hartmanns\u2019 home.<br></p> <p>The arrival of over a million migrants and refugees in Germany since the start of 2015 has until now mainly inspired films of a darker nature. In February, long-running German TV crime franchise Tatort ran an episode with a plot line that evolved around the death of a group of migrants who had suffocated in the back of a lorry, echoing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/migrants-found-dead-inside-lorry-in-austria\">real-life tragedy</a> on a motorway in Austria in 2015.</p> <p>At the start of this year, Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/fire-at-sea-berlin-film-festival-golden-bear-gianfranco-rosi-migrant-crisis\">Fire at Sea</a>, observing the refugee crisis through the eyes of Lampedusa locals, also won the top prize at the Berlinale film festival.</p> <p>But Willkommen bei den Hartmanns is the first to try to gain some comic mileage out of recent events. Director Simon Verhoeven does so by directly incorporating some of the stories that have dominated the news in Germany and around Europe over the last year.</p> <p>A taxi driver begins stalking Sophie after rescuing her from what he believes to be a sexual assault of the kinds perpetrated in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve, while the Hartmanns\u2019 tensions with their crucifix-wearing, Polish-surnamed neighbour come across as a direct nod to recent diplomatic standoffs between western and eastern European countries.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough for Frau Merkel to invite the entire third world into our country \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do the same in our home as well,\u201d says Richard, initially dismissing his wife\u2019s desire to take in a refugee as borne of a \u201chelper\u2019s syndrome\u201d. \u201cBetter than an asshole syndrome,\u201d his daughter Sophie quips back.</p> <p>Verhoefen, who started developing the film\u2019s screenplay before Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to keep open Germany\u2019s borders to thousands of refugees stranded in Budapest last September, however tries to be even-handed when drawing up caricatures.</p> <p>Pensioners at Munich\u2019s refugee shelter engage in absurd one-upmanship over their volunteering with \u201cmy refugees\u201d. One of the asylum seekers auditioning for a bed at the Hartmann residency is a man in his 40s, claiming to be an \u201cunattended minor\u201d.

The approval rating for Nigerians applying for asylum in Germany currently lies at about 8%.</p>",

The backlash was so intense that it caused Belamire to suspend her Twitter account.</p> <p>Can you be sexually assaulted in virtual reality? And can anything be done to prevent it? Those are a few of the most pressing ethical questions technologists, investors and we the public will face as VR grows. </p> <p>And growing it is. According to Digi-Capital, there <a href=\"http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/04/arvr-investment-hits-1-7-billion-in-last-12-months/#.WBjCGJMrI_V\">was</a> $1.7bn worth of augmented reality/virtual reality investments in the 12 months to Q1 2016. Goldman Sachs Group <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-13/goldman-sachs-has-four-charts-showing-the-huge-potential-in-virtual-and-augmented-reality\">has estimated</a> that by 2025, the VR industry could be worth $80-$182bn.</p> <h2>A big ethical question</h2> <p>To understand the importance of VR in our future, we need to think of it not as an industry but as an interface, a new way of interacting with the world. We\u2019ve gone from desktops to mobile computing; the next step-change is VR. It can be hard to see this now: VR is still in its infancy and can be easily dismissed as gimmicky, or just for gamers. However, as the technology scales, the potential of VR is enormous. It could change our economy, our media, and how we live our lives. </p> <p>What excites people about VR is its immersiveness. VR doesn\u2019t just give you the opportunity of being in other places, it lets you put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes. As such, it\u2019s often been described as an \u201cempathy machine\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Bailenson, director of Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, has said that \u201cfeeling prejudice by walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes is what VR was made for\u201d. Charities are leveraging VR\u2019s empathy equity to help people understand what it\u2019s like to be a refugee. The NFL is using it for diversity training. As such, VR has enormous potential for good. But, as Belamire\u2019s experience also illustrates, it also has potential for very real harm. Think about the harassment that women and minorities are routinely subject to online today. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To understand VR, we need to think of it not as an industry, but as a new way of interacting with the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now think about that in virtual reality. If we\u2019re not careful we could end up amplifying the divides and inequality in the real world in a virtual one; we could effectively make VR a no-go area for anyone who isn\u2019t a privileged straight white man.</p> <p>If we want virtual reality to have a positive impact on our actual reality, we need to start designing for this now, anticipating the potential for harassment and discrimination in VR and finding ways to stop them. We need to avoid the mistakes that were made when social media networks were developed. </p> <p>The most important way to do that is ensuring that the people who are creating VR technology and content are from a diverse set of backgrounds. After all, what we get out of VR depends on what we put into it.</p> <p>Amelia Winger-Bearskin, a technologist, says we are at a turning point with VR \u201cwhere the way we interact computationally with the world is going to shift. If we don\u2019t have diverse people in the beginning of that conversation then we will just increase this gulf that we have between people who are able to be part of that conversation and those who aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>A bug in the matrix</h2> <p>Diversity has been a bug that an overwhelmingly white, male Silicon Valley has been trying to fix for several years, so far unsuccessfully. Defending themselves against their dismal diversity numbers, tech companies often like to focus on the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem: that there simply aren\u2019t enough skilled minorities to hire in the first place. </p> <p>However, they don\u2019t have that excuse with virtual reality. Because VR is in its infancy, it\u2019s still a fairly flat playing field when it comes to who is equipped to break into it. We\u2019ve got a chance to fix that pipeline from its start. And, to be fair, tech companies seem to be rising to the occasion. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/04/techies-photography-project-silicon-valley-diversity-helena-price\">Picturing 'techies': photo project captures the unseen diversity of Silicon Valley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year Oculus, the Facebook-owned VR company, announced a diversity program called Launch Pad to attract the development efforts of \u201cwomen, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community\u201d. Winger-Bearskin was selected to be one of around 100 Launch Pad fellows and took part in a virtual reality bootcamp in May. Since then Oculus has mentored the fellows via online forums and will be announcing scholarships for select fellows in the next couple weeks. </p> <p>Apart from a spate of food poisoning that, one fellow told me, had large numbers of the diversity fellows violently vomiting in the Facebook bathrooms during the bootcamp, all seemed to be going very well with the Launch Pad program. Many of the fellows praised it as an example of how Silicon Valley should be thinking about and going about diversity. Diversity programs can often feel superficial or tokenistic but Launch Pad \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like a charity\u201d, said Aliah Darke, a diversity fellow. \u201cIt felt like \u2018we have all these questions in VR and we need as many people solving these questions as possible\u2019. It felt like they understood the value of diversity in helping to come up with novel ideas.\u201d </p> <p>Then on 22 September, news broke that Palmer Luckey, Oculus\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-palmer-luckey-funding-trump-reddit-trolls\">had been secretly funding</a> a pro-Trump organization called Nimble America, a shady organization (which has now erased itself from the internet) dedicated to swaying the election Trump\u2019s way through \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts\">shitposting</a>\u201d. </p> <p>This basically involves troll armies overwhelming online conversations with inane memes. The idea being to derail conversations and, therefore, shut people up. It\u2019s the opposite of an open internet. It\u2019s the opposite of empathy.</p> <h2>Hitting back at the bro-gammer culture</h2> <p>Many people in the VR community look up to Luckey, idolize him even.

A number of the diversity fellows started to wonder how serious Oculus really was about diversity. </p> <p>It didn\u2019t help that, shortly after the news about Luckey broke, Amy Thole, Oculus\u2019s diversity manager, emailed Launch Pad participants to say she was leaving the company. She was replaced by Ebony Peay, who had spent two years at Oculus as an executive assistant. It\u2019s not clear whether this had anything to do with Luckey; neither Thole nor Peay responded to multiple requests for comment. Shortly after, Oculus also announced that it was delaying the announcement of the Launch Pad scholarship and the fellows have been frustrated at the lack of communication from Oculus since.</p> <p>Some of the diversity fellows began to wonder whether it would feel right taking Oculus\u2019s money anyway. Darke wasn\u2019t one of these people. \u201cMy answer was, taking money from powerful white men that I disagree with is my happy place,\u201d she told me over Skype. \u201cI don\u2019t think that marginalized people should deny themselves opportunities because of something foolish that a young white guy did.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, however, is whether marginalized people might end up being denied opportunities because of something a privileged white guy did. When influential people align themselves with extreme views, they help normalize them. </p> <p>Jeris JC Miller, who at 60 is one of the oldest fellows on the Launch Pad, told me she believes that Luckey\u2019s actions set \u201ca precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK\u201d. This has real ramifications on the working culture in tech which has a knock-on effect in diversity in tech and VR. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging to live and create in a bro-grammer culture. It\u2019s hard. There\u2019s an ethos and an ethic and a style of relating that in many cases is quite painful for women and minorities.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Palmer Luckey's actions set a precedent that misogyny, sexism, racism, implied racism is OK</p> <footer> <cite>Jeris JC Miller, Facebook diversity fellow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, Luckey is just one man. While he appears to still be employed by Oculus (neither Facebook nor Oculus responded to repeated requests for comment) he doesn\u2019t necessarily represent their values, as Luckey made clear in an apology he posted after the news first broke. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, at the Oculus Connect developer conference earlier this month \u2013 from which Luckey was conspicuously absent \u2013 Oculus (and by extension Facebook) announced it would be spending $10m to fund diversity programs for VR.</p> <p>At the same time that Facebook is throwing money at diversity and distancing itself from Luckey, however, it has found itself dealing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-peter-thiel-support-facebook\">Peter Thiel\u2019s support of Trump</a>. Thiel, an influential board member of Facebook, recently gave $1.25m to the Republican presidential nominee. As this donation came in the wake of multiple sexual assaults allegations against the nominee, it was construed by some as condoning Trump\u2019s actions. </p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg has stood by Thiel; defending Thiel\u2019s donation in an internal Facebook post, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/19/peter-thiel-support-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg\">framing it as a question of \u201cdiversity\u201d</a>. Diversity of points of view, he said, was as important as diversity of background.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s reframing of diversity is worrying sophistry. Everyone is entitled to their viewpoint, of course. But most people don\u2019t have the resources, power and influence that the likes of Thiel and Luckey do. </p> <p>These are the people at the helm of building the infrastructure of tomorrow, who are leveraging technology to create a virtual world to their tastes. If Trump loses in November, his followers may well just build an alternative Trumpmenistan in the virtual world. And that will have a real effect on us all.</p>",

Now, I know the notion of what even constitutes \u201ca woman\u201d is up for debate \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 but I think we can probably all agree that a cisgendered, self-identifying man is a fair way off the mark.</p> <p>At least in this instance the man with the golden glasses was photographed alongside his fellow <a href=\"https://www.one.org/international/about/\" title=\"\">ONE</a> campaigners \u2013 including lifestyle blogger Jane Maynard, fashion student Alicia Lowe, mental health campaigner A\u2019Driane Nieves, founder of the Pudding Truck Carrie Cohen, Berkeley university\u2019s Mazelle Etessami, another food truck owner Diana Lamon and <a href=\"https://www.desertaidsproject.org/\" title=\"\">Desert Aids Project</a> campaigner Sue Lowe \u2013 who are all, in their own way, working to promote the new <a href=\"https://www.one.org/us/take-action/poverty-is-sexist/\" title=\"\">Poverty is Sexist</a> campaign.</p> <p>As someone who has spent her life picking up emails, appointments and awards for the typo alter ego Neil Frizzell, I, like you, assumed that Bono\u2019s nomination was a result of some sort of hilarious administrative fuck-up. Someone had mixed up their Woman of the Year tabs with their Stack-Heeled King of Pseudo-Religious Bore Rock tabs on the Glamour spreadsheet again. We\u2019d better call Johnny Depp and Cliff Richard before the mess spreads any further.</p> <p>And yet, perhaps we\u2019re wrong to call bullshit on this one. Perhaps, dare I say it, Bono has a point when he said that \u201cgender equality can\u2019t be won unless men lead it along with women\u201d. Because, as he points out, \u201c[men] are largely responsible for the problem, so we have to be involved in the solutions\u201d.

He also, it should be noted, encouraged George W Bush to pay for life-saving Aids drugs in Africa, campaigned to wipe out the debt of the world\u2019s poorest countries and pointed out on International Women\u2019s Day, no less, that young women apparently account for 74% of all new Aids cases among adolescents in Africa. Because it\u2019s true that women tend to suffer the effects of poverty, war, sexual violence, disease and natural disasters more keenly than men. It\u2019s true that poverty is sexist.

  "<p>The Rep seems the right place for a play about Enoch Powell, since it was at Birmingham\u2019s Midland hotel that he delivered an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1968/apr/22/mainsection.ianaitken\">incendiary speech</a> about race relations in 1968. But, while Chris Hannan makes it clear that we are still obsessed with immigration and the nature of Englishness, his play is much better at exploring the paradoxes of Powell than those of the surrounding culture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/31/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-play-what-shadows-ian-mcdiarmid\">Back to the rivers of blood: Enoch Powell returns to a divided Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Hannan uses a dual timeframe. In 1992 we see Rose, a black Oxford academic, recruiting Sofia, a former don she once vilified, to join her in writing a book about English identity. Part of Rose\u2019s mission, accomplished in the final scene, is to interview the aged Powell. But the play flashes back to the late 1960s to show the influences that shaped the two main characters. Growing up in Wolverhampton, Powell\u2019s constituency, the young Rose found herself at odds with her mixed-race Barbadian mother. Meanwhile Powell, despising the Tory leadership and deploring the national silence on immigration, made his infamous speech, which we get to hear in full.</p> <p> There is no doubt that Powell is a fascinating dramatic character. A working-class grammar-school boy who became a classical scholar and wartime brigadier, he exudes intellectual arrogance. As Tony Benn wrote in his diary the day after the Birmingham speech: \u201cHe has to have somebody to look down on.\u201d But in Hannan\u2019s fair-minded interpretation, the key to Powell lies in his romantic attachment to the England of \u201csunken lanes in Shropshire\u201d, Warwickshire cemeteries and the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/a-e-housman\">poetry of Housman</a>. Ignoring a friend\u2019s argument that multiculturalism is part of our national fabric, Powell becomes monomaniacally obsessed with immigration. When you listen to his Birmingham speech now, what you notice is the slipperiness with which he moves from the anecdotal to the apocalyptic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55f610e18d82986394e04dca26ea59930045e37d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55f610e18d82986394e04dca26ea59930045e37d/181_71_2040_1224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Scroggs and Br\u00edd Brennan in What Shadows.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Scroggs as Rose and Br\u00edd Brennan as Sofia in What Shadows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellie Kurttz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Powell, whatever you think of him, is complex; his principal antagonist, Rose, is simply confusing. I can see that Hannan wants to explore the conflicted nature of identity, but he overdoes it by making Rose a mother-hating, suicide-prone alcoholic with both impeccable radical credentials and a guilty secret. In portraying the Wolverhampton of the 1960s, which provided the fuel for Powell\u2019s speech, Hannan also creates too many characters who fulfil a purely symbolic function \u2013 in particular the bigoted white war-widow who ends up improbably married to a bustling Pakistani.</p> <p> In <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/apr/18/roxana-silbert-director\">Roxana Silbert</a>\u2019s production, the play comes alive when Powell is on stage, thanks to a fine performance from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/23/portrait-ian-mcdiarmid-actor\">Ian McDiarmid</a>, who subtly conveys the character\u2019s mix of superciliousness and sensitivity, nostalgia and naivety. Rebecca Scroggs, to her great credit, finds a measure of consistency in the identity-obsessed Rose and there is good support from George Costigan as a liberal journalist and Br\u00edd Brennan as both Powell\u2019s wife and Rose\u2019s unlikely accomplice. The play takes its title from Edmund Burke\u2019s line \u201cWhat shadows we are and what shadows we pursue\u201d, but I felt Hannan was infinitely more at ease in dealing with the documented facts of Powell\u2019s life than with the fictions of his own imagination.</p> <ul> <li>At Birmingham Rep until 12 November. <a href=\"https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/whats-on/what-shadows.html\">Box office</a>: 0121 236 4455.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> </ul>",

  "<p>There are many things in football that are incredibly beautiful. Lionel Messi at full flow. A Dimitri Payet free-kick. Or, indeed, a simple toe poke, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O3otJu2FWE\" title=\"\">such as Ronaldinho\u2019s against Chelsea back in 2005</a>.</p> <p>The list is long. We can marvel at warm-ups (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vashrNoXTE\" title=\"\">Diego Maradona with Opus in the background is a classic</a> ), crossfield passes or even sliding tackles. Not to mention nutmegs. Wonderful things.</p> <p>But for some reason we seem to find it more difficult to appreciate a clinical goalscorer. Take Miroslav Klose, the Germany striker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/01/miroslav-klose-retirement-germany-coaching-staff\" title=\"\">who announced his retirement</a> from football this week to go into coaching. He scored goals throughout his career: an astonishing 71 in 137 games for Germany, beating Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s 40-year-old record in 2014 to become his country\u2019s best marksman of all time.</p> <p>He scored 121 times in the Bundesliga in 307 games for Kaiserslautern, Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich before adding another 55 goals in 139 appearances for Lazio in Serie A \u2013 an unstoppable, lanky goal machine who could be relied upon to win games week in, week out.</p> <p>Yet for all the goals he will never be considered as one of the best in the world by the wider public. It seems a little bit harsh because, after all, goals are the most important thing in football, the one thing that <em>actually</em> decides who wins a game.</p> <p>Klose\u2019s achievements, however, has probably been undermined by the fact that his goals \u2013 or in fact his whole game \u2013 were not all that aesthetically pleasing. His goals were tap-ins, they were close-range headers \u2013 they were scrappy.</p> <p>But to dismiss Klose\u2019s goals as ugly is to ignore the beauty of a goalpoacher\u2019s best attributes: finding space and anticipating where the ball will drop. Fewer and fewer players seem capable of appearing behind a defender\u2019s back to knock in the ball from two yards.</p> <p>There are exceptions of course and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, whose Bayer Leverkusen face Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley in the Champions League on Wednesday night, is one of those players who has a wonderful sense of being in the right place at the right time.</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez is in his second season at Leverkusen now and has scored 22 times in 36 league games. This season he already has seven from 13 games in all competitions. And every time you look at those stats you wonder what on earth possessed Manchester United to first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/01/javier-hernandez-real-madrid-manchester-united-loan\" title=\"\">loan him out to Real Madrid</a> for the 2014-15 season and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/31/javier-hernandez-manchester-united-bayer-leverkusen-move\" title=\"\">sell him to Leverkusen</a> the following summer. For \u00a37.3m.</p> <p>True, there were times when \u201cChicharito\u201d was given a chance in United\u2019s starting XI and did not impress but the overall figures from his time at Old Trafford are 59 goals in 156 games. That puts him in the top 10 of United strikers when it comes to goals per minutes in the league over the past 20 years. How Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could use a poacher with Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s strike rate at the moment.</p> <p>Is Hern\u00e1ndez, too, a victim of football\u2019s inability to appreciate natural goalscorers? Would he have thrived at Old Trafford if Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes or Louis van Gaal had given him an extended run in the team? His performances for Leverkusen suggest he would have done.</p> <p>He arrives in London for the game against Spurs at Wembley as Leverkusen\u2019s focal point in attack, a threat to Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s hopes of making it through to the knockout phase. At Leverkusen he has finally found a home in Europe where he feels appreciated.</p> <p>The Leverkusen sporting director, Rudi V\u00f6ller, said after the Mexican\u2019s hat-trick against Mainz in September that \u201che certainly doesn\u2019t win every tackle but he has an incredible sense of where the ball will end up\u201d. His team-mate, Kevin Volland, who joined from Hoffenheim in the summer, said: \u201cI have never seen a player who is so good in front of goal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f955021ff55558ac5865174d58b3e376070f7ef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f955021ff55558ac5865174d58b3e376070f7ef9/19_212_3886_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Hern\u00e1ndez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Hern\u00e1ndez is \u2018a much more complete player than people think\u2019, according to the Bayer Leverkusen manager Roger Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Pfeil/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is not to say that the Leverkusen manager, Roger Schmidt, allows Hern\u00e1ndez just to wait around in the opposition\u2019s penalty area for the ball to drop. In the 2-2 draw against CSKA Moscow earlier this season Schmidt was furious with Hern\u00e1ndez and Hakan Calhanoglu for not helping out defensively and hauled them both off at half-time.</p> <p>But overall Schmidt could not be happier with his main goalscorer. \u201cThe goals are obviously important but he is a much more complete player than people think,\u201d he has said. \u201cHe works hard for the team and he goes deep to pick up the ball and has really clever movement.\u201d</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, continues to work hard \u2013 and rely on his intuition. Asked in <a href=\"http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/05/31/chicharito-mexico-javier-hernandez-bayer-leverkusen\" title=\"\">an excellent interview with Sports Illustrated</a> how he knows where to run in the penalty area, he said: \u201cIf you\u2019re inside the box and a cross is coming, sometimes you need, as we say in Spanish, to <em>smell</em> the intuition, to smell where the cross is going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou play this sport in the mind, not only on the field,\u201d he added. \u201cOn crosses, sometimes I make my move one or two seconds before the ball is coming because I\u2019m trying to guess that the ball is coming there. It\u2019s intuition. So I run. Sometimes the ball comes \u2026 sometimes not. But that intuition is working.\u201d</p> <p>Hern\u00e1ndez, in fact, is a wonderful player to watch. Like Schmidt says, he makes the best possible runs to open up space for himself and for team-mates. Yet there are no fan-made compilations on YouTube of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s best runs or movements in the penalty area. Maybe there should be.</p>",
  "<p>Just in time for Halloween the news has broken that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/27/scientists-discover-first-fossilised-dinosaur-brain-tissue\">fossil dinosaur brain</a> (well, part of one) has been discovered in the UK. This is a truly remarkable find but in some ways not as exceptional as you might think. Certainly the fossil record is dominated by hard parts of animals (bones, teeth, shells, etc.) but the soft tissues (skin, muscles, and all manner of internal organs) do turn up from time to time and in quite a variety of different guises.</p> <p>Such finds are incredibly important to palaeontology as inevitably there is a limit to what information can be extracted from bones alone. This can actually include plenty of information about soft tissues since there are some inevitable correlates at play \u2013 the eyeballs have to sit in the orbits, the brain inside the skull and so on. (As an aside many vertebrates have what is essentially a second mini-skull inside the head the encloses the brain so for example we know quite a bit about the size and shape of dinosaur brains from these). Bones also have scars on them where the tendons attached to hold muscles in place giving an idea of their size and how they operated the joints. <br></p> <p>To go into greater detail though we really need some direct evidence of soft tissues and thus discoveries like the brain are therefore extremely informative. Some animals of course are made up of little more than soft tissues (there\u2019s not too much that is very tough about the average jellyfish or octopus) so it\u2019s not just about filling in details like the feathers on a fossil bird but can relate to entire organisms. We know that some groups are extremely ancient but have left almost no fossil record behind making it hard to say much about their origins or evolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"add25e690f85051d63ec1a3449f9274ea5a9967c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/add25e690f85051d63ec1a3449f9274ea5a9967c/110_310_4053_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of rare fossil jellyfish from the Jurassic of Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of rare fossil jellyfish from the Jurassic of Germany</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately it all comes down to the decay of tissues. The reason that bones, teeth and shells (and for that matter wood) are common as fossils is that they decay only very slowly. Carnivores and scavengers don\u2019t tend to eat bones (and if they do, the bones might still survive the process) and bacteria don\u2019t break them down effectively. As a result, they can hang around for decades or centuries and have greater opportunities to be buried and potentially turn into a fossil. Soft tissues tend instead to be eaten so would need to be buried soon after the animal died in order to have a chance to be fossilised (and even here the bacteria or fungi may get to them). A more effective method of preservation though is to be in an environment where decay does not tend to occur.</p> <p>This can happen in a number of different ways, but ultimately it comes down to slowing or stopping the breakdown of the organic material. Very dry environments like deserts can lead to a form of mummification where the moisture is sucked out and nothing can digest the dehydrated remains. These animals can end up rather shrunken (like mummified humans from the deserts of South America) but it means plenty of soft tissues can survive and be preserved, especially if the skin was still present to hold them intact. There are even a few dinosaur mummies like this where muscles and even internal organs are preserved, though it\u2019s rather hard to get to them without damaging the outer layers and CT scanners big enough to take a whole dinosaur are few and far between.</p> <p>Rather more common are those that are in water but in conditions where bacteria are limited because of the water chemistry or lack of oxygen. Peat bogs are a favourite here though most things preserved in them are, although ancient, not fossils. This may however be the origin of the dinosaur brain \u2013 effectively pickled in the acidic peat waters and then later fossilised. Similarly, animals like mammoths frozen in the permafrost of Siberia are not actually fossils but the lack of decay means they preserve animals right down to their last meals still in their stomachs. Anoxic (oxygen free) waters can also be good for this and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2015/apr/29/bird-yi-qi-the-dinosaur-evolution-flight-feather-nature\">spectacular feathered dinosaurs finds</a> are from these kinds of conditions where the presence of fine volcanic ash in the waters also helped bury bodies quickly and with great fidelity producing some incredible finds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2da35a3de4aaf578864eb274e750ab162fea928e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da35a3de4aaf578864eb274e750ab162fea928e/0_0_2750_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A specimen of the non-avian dinosaur Anchiornis with the feathers preserved as black stains on the rock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A specimen of the non-avian dinosaur <em>Anchiornis </em>with the feathers preserved as black stains on the rock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Bristol/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, some things can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/12/how-did-the-velvet-worm-cross-the-world-the-answer-lies-in-amber\">preserved in amber</a>. Glued into tree sap that then fossilised, there\u2019s no possibility of decay and whole animals (even quite large things like lizards) and even spider silk can last tens of millions of years like this.</p> <p>Even without these forms of preservation, soft tissues can still sneak into the fossil record as impressions. Footprints will often be clear enough to show the pattern of soles of animals\u2019 feet, including the sizes and shapes of any scales or pads. Things like feathers or the membranous wings of pterosaurs may decay, but not before they have left an impression of where they were. Some of these can be very detailed (the feathers on <em>Archaeopteryx</em> for example are actually mostly impressions and not fossilised feathers) and provide a great deal of information.</p> <p>Despite all these routes to preservation, the fossil record (and more recent things like ice mummies) remain rare for extinct animals. However, they are not vanishingly rare as many might think, and in particular some areas are producing huge numbers of preserved animals with various soft tissues intact. These might not always be in the best condition and examining or interpreting them may be difficult, but even a patch of skin or a bit of a brain has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/10/ancient-pigments-reveal-evolutionary-history-of-our-eyes\">enormous potential</a>. Plenty of contentious areas have been resolved from such finds as well as opening up new areas of research (like<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/jun/25/dinosaurs-fossils\"> the colours of extinct animals</a>) and they promise much for the future and so the excitement around even partial finds.</p>",

  "<p>Buses have started taking the remaining asylum-seeking teenagers from the Calais refugee camp to undisclosed locations around France, as officials began the final stage of clearing the site.</p> <p>Two UK Home Office workers were understood to be on each bus, taking the young people to juvenile centres across France where their applications for asylum in the UK and France were due to be processed. No details were revealed about the destinations of the buses.</p> <p>The Calais prefecture had informed the camp\u2019s last residents on Tuesday that no further applications for asylum in the UK would be dealt with in Calais. Among the camp\u2019s remaining population most appeared to be teenagers, possibly aged between 14 and 17, although there were a handful of much younger children.</p> <p>UK officials, wearing hi-vis jackets marked \u201cImmigration Enforcement\u201d, joined UNHCR staff as children were led on to buses shortly after 8am. Large numbers of riot police lined the road from the fenced-off area, where an estimated 1,500 people have been sleeping in repurposed shipping containers for the past week, but the first 14 buses left without incident. </p> <p>By Wednesday evening 1,616 young refugees had been taken away on 38 buses. French officials said around 300 women and children would be taken from a neighbouring building on Thursday to centres around France.<br></p> <p>Several dozen new reception centres had been opened in the past few days, set up in holiday camps, youth hostels, disused retirement homes or former military bases. Children were told where they would be going when they got on the buses. They were not given a choice about their destination, but they were allowed to stick with friends and other children from their countries of origin.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to create these reception centres. There was some local opposition. But the idea was to split the minors into smaller groups so that they could receive more personalised attention as they pursue applications to go to the UK, or are helped to be reconnected with family elsewhere in Europe,\u201d Steve Barbet, a spokesman for the local regional government, said. \u201cSome may decide to stay in France. Others may decide to return to their own countries.\u201d </p> <p>French media have reported that a large number of children sent to children\u2019s homes around France have subsequently run away to continue attempting to come to the UK illegally.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/28/where-next-the-last-days-of-the-calais-refugee-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59k29\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2848995\"            data-video-name=\"Where next?

The last days of the Calais refugee camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But Fabienne Buccio, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region and the most senior local official in charge of the operation, said she hoped that the presence of UK Home Office staff accompanying these children on the buses would convince them that their cases were being treated seriously, and would help persuade them to remain. </p> <p>About 60 Home Office officials were in Calais on Wednesday morning and they were expected to remain in France, with the smaller groups of children, until the applications of all minors hoping to come to the UK were processed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that the British are there on the buses, accompanying the minors, showing their engagement with the whole process,\u201d Buccio said. \u201cThis is the result of long ministeral-level negotiations. This is much more personalised than the adult evacuations. The aim is to have no one left here.\u201d</p> <p>She said she expected several hundred more children to join the 300 refugee children who were taken to the UK last month.</p> <p>By mid morning more than 14 buses had left, with 600 children on them. Officials hope to finish the clearance on Wednesday. The shipping containers would be removed as soon as they were empty, Buccio said. </p> <p>The lack of information about where the buses were going had prompted anxiety and uncertainty among the younger residents of the camp. Just a few hours before they left, some children still thought they were being taken to England.</p> <p>\u201cAre people going to the UK?\u201d Afsar Khan, 12, from Afghanistan, asked, still confused about the dispersal plans. His friend Wali Tajek, 16, from Kabul, who was given a different bus number, was disappointed not to be going to Britain. \u201cMy uncle lives in Halifax. He has a pizza shop. He said he will support me, but they don\u2019t let me go,\u201d he said. He said he left Afghanistan because his parents were both dead, and because of the Taliban.</p> <p>\u201cI had an interview a month ago. The French person said they would tell me in two weeks, but there was no answer,\u201d he said. The period of confusion had unsettled a lot of the teenagers. \u201cThere are a lot of fights. People are always angry.\u201d</p> <p>Garbled reports of the diplomatic standoff between France and Britain over the fate of the young people had been picked up on by many but with muddled accuracy. Many had heard the French president\u2019s request to the UK that they should accommodate all the remaining children, and assumed that this would happen.</p> <p>A 16-year-old from Sudan, who was due to get on bus No 33, said he had hoped to go to the UK to try to find his brother. \u201cWe were so happy last week when we heard that the UK will take all the under-age people. We were so happy but now we are so worried. Everybody is going crazy.\u201d He said he would get on the bus on Wednesday, but if he had another chance to go to the UK in the coming weeks he would take it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57q8c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2814168\"            data-video-name=\"Refugees' hope and despair in Calais camp \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58049584e4b047a4eaafd52d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2_V4.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/17/161117CalaisTensions2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/refugees-hope-and-despair-in-calais-camp-video\">Refugees\u2019 hope and despair in Calais camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>While more than 6,000 adults and children have already left the camp to claim asylum in France, those who remain are mostly people who have a strong reason to want to go to the UK \u2013 family members or friends who are there, or they speak very good English. Charity workers have spent months explaining that remaining in France is a more sensible option (particularly for older children from Afghanistan, who risk being sent back to Afghanistan from the UK when they turn 17-and-a-half).</p> <p>Volunteers who work with some of the small charities that have grown up over the past year to help look after the minors said they were taken aback by the speed of the decision to move the young people on to accommodation elsewhere in France. While there was relief that young people were being moved out of containers where water supplies were said to be inadequate, and where there was no provision of food, except charity handouts, there was also concern that there was no time to hand over details of which children needed extra support.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some with learning difficulties, mental health problems, long-term health issues.

  "<p>The federal building code attached to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill would decrease apprentices on building projects and increase workers on 457 temporary skilled worker visas, the McKell Institute has said.</p> <p>The progressive thinkthank has produced an analysis of the building code reframing it as \u201chighly prescriptive red tape\u201d that could increase strikes because existing agreements must be renegotiated.</p> <p>The code, if passed, would stipulate that construction companies cannot bid for government work unless they exclude a wide range of otherwise legal clauses from industrial deals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

ordinary hours worked per day, guarantee rostered days off including public holidays, discourage discrimination against mature workers, and set stable rosters.</p> <p>The report noted that at the end of 2015 there were 278,600 apprentices and trainees in training, 11.8% fewer than at the end of 2014.</p> <p>It said \u201cthe only instrument that guarantees the number of apprentices to a workforce can be found in suitable enterprise agreements that mandate safety and apprenticeship ratios\u201d, a practice the code would ban.</p> <p>The report argues that since the cost of training apprentices outweighs their output for the first two years, the building code will encourage employers to source skilled labour from overseas instead.</p> <p>Companies that choose to train Australian workers \u201care at a competitive disadvantage compared to those who avail themselves of the 457 [skilled temporary work visa] worker\u201d, it said.</p> <p>The code would apply to enterprise agreements struck after 24 April 2014, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/michaelia-cash-criticised-over-industrial-relations-bill-with-retrospective-powers\">gives it retrospective effect because it bars builders</a> from government work based on deals struck before the code was in place.</p> <p>The McKell report said that, in order to comply with the code, some building companies would need to renegotiate their workplace deals which \u201ccould lead to further and significant industrial disputation\u201d.</p> <p><a

\u201cexcessive\u201d pay rises</a>, because it bans coercion to win above-award pay rises.</p> <p>The McKell report argued the ABCC and building code were unnecessary because \u201cthe productivity of the building and construction sector still outpaces most other sectors and the industry is still healthy and growing\u201d.</p> <p>It said since the ABCC was abolished in 2008 labour productivity in the construction sector has grown annually by an average of 4.81% and in the heavy and civil engineering sector it grew by 6.38%. </p> <p>\u201cThis compares to the average for all industries of

site except where they were exercising statutory rights to check work health and safety complaints.</p> <p>The report said the code would \u201cdisproportionately affect women, older workers and unions\u201d because it banned any form of affirmative action for certain categories of workers and banned union presence at staff inductions and safety talks.</p> <p>Employment law expert and Adelaide law school professor Andrew Stewart has told Guardian Australia the code <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/26/michaelia-cash-criticised-over-industrial-relations-bill-with-retrospective-powers\">is a source of significant concern in the construction industry</a>.</p> <p>\u201cVirtually every major builder will be non-compliant,\u201d he said, in reference to the broad range of deal content barred by the code and its retrospective effect.<br></p> <p>He said the code could be changed to only bar agreements struck after it passed, in which case it would have \u201cminimal practical effect\u201d, or it would apply retrospectively and \u201cforce building companies to renegotiate their enterprise agreements simultaneously causing industrial mayhem\u201d.</p> <p>Stewart said the code barred \u201cany clauses with any impact on productivity, or the right of companies to manage their business\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt essentially gives [Fair Work Building and Construction director] Nigel Hadgkiss or whoever is the director of the ABCC discretion to object to any union agreement on a very wide number of bases.\u201d</p> <p>The McKell report noted that the code was silent on whether builders with poor safety records, a history of bankruptcies and \u201cphoenixing\u201d activity should be excluded from government work.</p> <p>Although the code is currently attached to the ABCC bill, the McKell report suggests that, since it is a regulation, it is still subject to disallowance by the Senate.</p>",

  "<p>Late in the afternoon of 23 July, four white men walked into the middle of a quiet road on the outskirts of Monroe, Georgia, blocking the path of a bright yellow Chevrolet sedan.

Malcolm and Hester had both grown up in Monroe, a major cotton-farming town in Walton County, 40 miles east of Atlanta. As children, they had even played together on the Hester family farm. But now they were separated by a vast gulf: Hester was white and owned land, from which he profited handsomely; Malcolm was black and worked the land, from which he eked out a living. Like many black citizens of Georgia, Malcolm was determined to leave soon and head north to Chicago in search of better employment and social mobility.</p> <p>Malcolm, a notoriously short-tempered man, had come to believe that his common-law wife, Dorothy, was having sex with Hester. Drunk and furious, Malcolm confronted Hester in front of his house. In the scuffle that ensued, Malcolm took out a knife and stabbed him. The fight was witnessed by several other members of the Hester family, who were inclined to kill Malcolm on the spot. But they demurred. \u201cYou would have to serve time,\u201d counselled Ida Hester, Barnette\u2019s mother, according to one account. \u201cYou let the others do it.\u201d</p> <p>Hester was sent to a local hospital. Malcolm was locked in the local jail. Eleven days later, when it was clear that Hester would survive his wounds, a white cotton farmer named Loy Harrison came downtown to secure Malcolm\u2019s release, notionally bailing him out in exchange for future labour. Such arrangements were widespread in the south. In Monroe, especially during the cotton harvest, it was common for local sheriffs and police to spend Saturdays making sure the jail was stocked with cheap workers for the week to come.</p> <p>Dorothy Malcolm had a brother, George Dorsey, a veteran of the second world war who lived and worked on Harrison\u2019s farm with his wife, Mae Murray Dorsey. Together, Dorothy, George and Mae Murray had lobbied Harrison to post Malcolm\u2019s bail. He would be safer, they thought, as a source of white profit than as a black man sitting in a poorly guarded jail in the centre of town. Dorothy, George, and Mae accompanied Harrison on the journey to pick up Malcolm.</p> <p>Shortly after he had collected Malcolm from jail and driven out of downtown Monroe with both Malcolms and both Dorseys in his car, Harrison came to a stop just before the wooden slat bridge that crossed the Apalachee River. Up ahead, there was a group of white men blocking the road. They had guns. A few minutes later, the Malcolms and Dorseys were dead, each of their bodies shot multiple times with pistols and shotguns at point-blank range. Either before or after the shooting started, someone tied a noose around Roger\u2019s neck, but he was not hanged.</p> <p>The lynching of black citizens had been common ever since the emancipation of slaves, and the failure of the post-war Reconstruction programme designed to enforce racial equality in the former Confederacy. But the nature of these murders had evolved over the years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d00a86bea9af415384953adfcf2d5f94e5efb7a/9_0_1725_1725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loy Harrison (right), Coroner WT Brown (center) and Sheriff JM Bond (left) at Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge in Georgia on 26 July 1946, a day four black people were killed there by a lynch mob.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1880s and 90s were characterised by \u201cspectacle lynchings\u201d, as historians came to call them: public events at which white people gathered by the hundreds to watch victims, typically black men, get tortured, set on fire, hanged, castrated and/or dismembered on their way to death. (Often, spectators would get caught up in the frenzy of the moment and join in the violence.) In the early 20th century, as activists and journalists drew attention to the persistence of racist mob justice across the south, national outrage grew. But lynchings did not stop: they decreased in number, and they went underground. Now the murders were carried out quickly and quietly by small groups on lonely back roads, where no one could see. The style was different, but since lynchings were never prosecuted, the message was the same: <em>watch what we can do</em>.</p> <p>The men who lynched the Malcolms and Dorseys in 1946 did not advertise ahead of time in local newspapers, as their predecessors did, or encourage their neighbours to attend with families and picnic baskets in tow. No one cheered or took pictures while it happened. No photographs appeared on the front page of newspapers the following day. Like so many others, they were confident that the protective shield of the white power structure would keep them safe so long as they weren\u2019t too ostentatious.</p> <p>This confidence was more than warranted. Local police did not even launch an investigation into the murder of the Malcolms and Dorseys. On all four death certificates, the coroner wrote the bureaucratic phrase that, for years, had been listed as the cause of death for victims of lynchings across the country: \u201cAt the hands of persons unknown\u201d.</p> <p>FBI agents came to Monroe two days after the murders, looking to see whether a federal prosecution might be possible. But they quickly realised that none of the white residents of Walton County wanted to help them \u2013 some because they were too scared, others because they were helping with the cover-up. Lamar Howard, a black 19-year-old who had witnessed a conversation between the plotters at the ice house where he worked, was brave enough to come forward and testify. In return, two white men beat him to within an inch of his life.</p> <p>From the perspective of the killers, the lynching could hardly have been more successful. News of the deed spread almost instantly through the entire county by word of mouth, searing the threat of extrajudicial violence into the consciousness of all who heard about it.</p> <p>At the same time, its specific details \u2013 who, exactly, played what role; who tied the noose; who pulled the triggers; who lied to protect the guilty \u2013 were already slipping through the fingers of anyone who tried to grasp them. The killers must have been confident that, as time passed, the story would only grow fainter, and the facts of the crime would be forgotten. Only the fear would remain.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>But then something unexpected happened. Two days after the lynching, news of the killings reached Walter F White, the head of the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, who had spent decades investigating lynchings across the country firsthand. White was black, but could pass as white \u2013 something he had used to his advantage over the years while interviewing proud lynchers about their exploits. A canny publicist, he felt that the Monroe lynchers\u2019 decision to kill Dorothy and Mae Murray along with their husbands might mobilise public disgust. (Women were lynched relatively rarely.)</p> <p>White sent graphic briefings on the case to news outlets across the country. Reporters started flocking to Monroe, bringing America news that lynching \u2013 which many white people thought of as a relic of the past \u2013 was alive and well.</p> <p>In cities across the country, people took to the streets in protest. In Atlanta, a teenage Martin Luther King Jr was inspired to write <a href=\"http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_460806_000/\">a letter to the editor of the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>. (In his letter, King refutes the commonplace argument that lynchings were an attempt to protect white women from the sexual aggression of black men: \u201cIt is fair to remember that almost the total of race mixture in America has come, not at Negro initiative, but by the acts of those very white men who talk loudest of race purity.\u201d) The Justice Department was flooded with mail expressing shock and frustration that such a crime could go unpunished in 1940s America. At the White House, a deluge of outraged telegrams demanded that President Harry Truman take action.</p> <p>Truman had never displayed much concern for racial justice. But like many other observers of the Monroe lynching, he was particularly disturbed that one of the victims, George Dorsey, had spent more than two years of the second world war fighting for the US in the South Pacific \u2013 risking his life for his country, only to be gunned down by white supremacists at home. In September, Truman invited White to Washington to give a talk on the state of racial violence nationwide, including the case in Monroe. When the presentation was over, the president\u2019s face was pale. \u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea it was as terrible as that.\u201d Three months later, he created <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/pccr.htm\">the President\u2019s Committee on Civil Rights</a>, which played a key role in ending the racial segregation of the federal workforce and the US military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6280b60886e81b1c502d631629bbc8d67149f9/0_15_8431_5059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The grave site of George and Dorothy Dorsey, who were killed in the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But back in Monroe, the murders stayed in the shadows. \u201cIf anyone would be fool enough to talk about the lynching, they would also be killed,\u201d one white man told the FBI. Others proudly declared that, even if they did know something, they wouldn\u2019t say so. A grand jury of white citizens, many from Walton County, failed to approve charges against a single suspect. Decades passed. The suspects began to age and die. For as long as he lived, Loy Harrison \u2013 the farmer who had secured Roger Malcolm\u2019s release from jail \u2013 insisted, increasingly implausibly, that he had not been part of the lynching plot, and that he had not recognised any of the killers. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m as mad as anybody, the way they killed my niggers,\u201d he told the FBI during their original investigation. \u201cI need all the nigger hands I can get.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI investigation closed. The reporters went home. In Walton County, people \u2013 white and black \u2013 talked about the lynching behind closed doors or not at all, and those who remembered that it had happened started to die and move away. Some told their children the story, but many preferred to avoid the subject. (Roger Malcolm\u2019s own son from an earlier marriage, who was spirited out of town on the night of the murders, only learned the full story of his father\u2019s killing decades later.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/26/truth-and-reconciliation-is-coming-to-america\">Truth and reconciliation is coming to America from the grassroots | Fania E Davis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after 45 years of silence, a witness came forward. In 1991, a 55-year-old white man named Clinton Adams walked into the FBI field office in Panama City, Florida. When he was 10, he said, he had witnessed the lynching by the Apalachee River from a nearby field. He had seen some of the lynchers\u2019 faces, he said, and knew who they were. Adams claimed to have been intimidated into silence by a decades-long campaign of harassment that had followed him from state to state. His dramatic story unleashed a wave of media interest, including newspaper stories, television reports, an interview with Oprah Winfrey, and an eventual book.</p> <p>Had Adams not come forward, the case might have fallen even further into obscurity. Instead, it became a symbol of the scars that racial violence had left on the American psyche \u2013 and the ways that rigorously enforced white silence, both past and present, had been integral to distorting and sanitising the history of that violence. The FBI, which had recently reopened a spate of cold cases from the civil rights era, added the Monroe lynching to the pile.</p> <p>The excitement of Adams\u2019s revelations did not last long: the FBI had lost much of the original evidence, and his testimony was riddled with contradictions and chronological errors that made it practically useless. But, whatever his motivations, he had successfully brought the story back to life.</p> <p>A few years later, in 1997, a small group of activists in Georgia, both black and white, began searching for ways to engrave the memory of the lynching on to the history of Walton County. Calling themselves the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee (after the bridge that crosses the Apalachee River by the site of the lynching), they began to hold community forums in which people could share their memories of the lynchings, and their experiences of racial violence. (For many decades after the end of Reconstruction<strong>, </strong>the county had been among the worst places in the country to be a free black American.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c083c9fa21eccc0c57f20ae6b4758d2802c7a212/0_258_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The historical marker sign at the roadside near the site of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists pushed the state of Georgia to erect an official roadside sign to mark the site of the killings, which was put up in 1999. They combed through abandoned cemeteries until they found the victims\u2019 graves. That same year, they held an approximation of the military funeral George Dorsey had never received. (Lamar Howard, who had been beaten after daring to testify against the lynchers 53 years earlier, attended the service.) The activists received a steady trickle of death threats and hate mail, but they also slowly won local allies, including some white people.</p> <p>In 2005, Tyrone Brooks, a veteran of the southern civil rights movement who had become a Georgia state legislator, approached the activists in Monroe with a quixotic idea: a re-enactment. Just think, he urged the group, of how much media attention that would bring to the case \u2013 of the pressure it would put on the FBI.</p> <p>In the south, re-enactments are used primarily to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">the battles of the civil war</a>. They are often imbued, to varying degrees, with nostalgia for the \u201clost cause\u201d of the slaveholding Confederacy. So the suggestion that the activists might perform a lynching instead was \u201ca very mischievous idea\u201d, said Mark Auslander, an anthropologist who studies memorial rituals and has attended the Monroe event several times. \u201cRe-enactments are, in many ways, the prime currency of memorialisation in the south.\u201d But \u201cthey don\u2019t mention slavery, they don\u2019t mention Jim Crow, they don\u2019t mention lynchings\u201d. On the surface, each traditional re-enactment is an exercise in remembering; taken together, they represent a collective forgetting, in which the Confederacy is defined by nothing but the brave spirit of its soldiers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-civil-war-re-enactors\">Civil war re-enactors on the Confederate flag: 'It's complicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of performing the lynching tore the Moore\u2019s Ford Memorial Committee apart, a split that was particularly painful because it occurred largely along racial lines. Many black members of the group (though certainly not all) found themselves drawn to the re-enactment. Most white members found the idea viscerally repellent: a confrontational spectacle unlikely to serve the cause of reconciliation. \u201cWe thought it was a step too far,\u201d Richard Rusk, one of committee\u2019s founding members, told me. \u201cMany steps too far. Totally inappropriate, too divisive. I mean, can you name one other place in the world where people get together to act out a horrible, disgusting piece of racial violence with absolutely no element of uplift? Can you?\u201d</p> <p>The first re-enactment took place in July 2005, an improvised and emotional performance for an audience that included <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/us/group-lynching-is-recreated-in-a-call-for-justice.html?_r=0\">a reporter for the New York Times</a> and civil rights luminaries such as Jesse Jackson and Joseph Lowery, Martin Luther King\u2019s successor as the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It has been staged every year since.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Among the many logistical challenges of re-enacting a lynching, the greatest might be recruiting white cast members. Based on the available evidence, there were at least a dozen white men involved in the original crime. In recent years, the organisers have been lucky to get five or six. \u201cMost white people just refuse,\u201d Cassandra Greene, a 57-year-old Atlanta minister who has directed the re-enactment for the last eight years, told me. (She is black.) \u201cI ask everyone. I ask my white friends. They all say no. They all say: \u2018Oh, I could never do that.\u2019\u201d In the first year of the re-enactment, the four white men who had volunteered to portray the killers backed out at the last minute; the lynch mob was played by young black men wearing white plastic masks.</p> <p>Casting the black roles is only slightly easier, Greene told me. Some people she approaches act enthusiastic, then never show up for rehearsal. Some rehearse, but then back out before the actual performance. Some perform for a year or two, then drop out. \u201cI mean, I get it,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt hurts. It fills your mind with hurt. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years, and why not? Because I\u2019m thinking about all this instead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b9e11f13b13c555192b1d4ab5ba069fd9cd7647/0_319_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Lynching reenactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cassandra Greene, director of the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching reenactment.

It used me up.\u201d</p> <p>Two nights before this year\u2019s re-enactment, most of the cast gathered to rehearse at <a href=\"http://sightsandsoundsmuseum.org/\">Sights and Sounds</a>, a single-room museum of black American cultural artefacts \u2013 from fugitive slave posters to Jackson 5 records \u2013 housed in a moribund shopping mall in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta about an hour\u2019s drive from Monroe. In its early incarnations, the cast was drawn mostly from Monroe \u2013 today a town of about 13,000 \u2013 and Walton County. But over the years, local participation has steadily declined. This year, every member of the all-volunteer cast was an Atlanta resident.</p> <p>The Malcolms and Dorseys were played by young actors trying to break into professional film and theatre. Only one had participated in the re-enactment before, and none had heard of the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching until Greene contacted them asking for their help. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7747276/\">Darrius Bradshaw</a>, who played Roger Malcolm, told me that during rehearsals \u2013 which, he reminded me, consisted largely of older white men calling him \u201cnigger,\u201d tying a noose around his neck, and pretending to shoot him repeatedly \u2013 he sometimes sank into depression, and sometimes flared into sudden fury. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201clater, out in the real world, I\u2019d find myself back in those feelings, not even realising at first where they came from.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/25/mike-brown-shooting-jim-crow-lynchings-in-common\">Mike Brown\u2019s shooting and Jim Crow lynchings have too much in common. It\u2019s time for America to own up | Isabel Wilkerson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the actors and the audience alike, it was impossible to ignore the charged significance of re-enacting the state-sanctioned murder of innocent black men and women at a moment when one candidate for president was running a campaign of undisguised racism \u2013 and police across the country were still killing unarmed black men with numbing regularity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even sadder this year,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7551305/\">Lisa Searcy</a>, who played Mae Murray in 2015 and Dorothy this July. \u201cYou read the script, you rehearse, then you go home and turn on the news and you can\u2019t stop the tears.\u201d She did not mean to suggest, she quickly added, that 2016 was the same as 1946. \u201cBut the history really weighs on you hard.\u201d</p> <p>At last year\u2019s re-enactment, Searcy met a woman who introduced herself as a descendant of a man named <a href=\"https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/emorycoldcases/maceo-snipes/\">Maceo Snipes</a>. Five days before the lynching in Monroe, Snipes had been murdered in Taylor County, 100 miles to the south \u2013 for the offence of exercising his right to vote. (The winner of that election, Governor Eugene Talmadge, campaigned on a promise to ensure that Georgia\u2019s black population, then the largest in the nation, would never have access to the ballot box.)</p> <p>Later that night, when Searcy mentioned the story to her parents \u2013 who had family roots in Taylor County \u2013 they suddenly went silent. It turned out that she, too, was related to Snipes; her parents had never told her. At the time, Searcy told me, she couldn\u2019t understand their reticence. \u201cBut the more I thought about it, the more I got it,\u201d she said \u2013 especially once this year\u2019s rehearsals started. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I can understand now. I can feel this part of myself that would maybe turn away and not say anything. It\u2019s just too terrible. You don\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6782d6d3ae3389a79f7f36a8431c45b26662faf3/0_1580_5687_7108/800.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the Moore\u2019s Ford lynching reenactment this year.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Darrius Bradshaw, who played the role of Roger in the reenactment this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the white cast members were not actors at all. One longtime participant, Bob Caine, is a descendant of <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/08/100-year-anniversary-of-the-hanging-of-leo-frank/\">Leo Frank</a>, a Jewish man who was lynched in Atlanta in 1915, after being sentenced to life in prison for a crime he likely did not commit. Unhappy that Frank had not received the death penalty, a group of prominent white people (including a former governor of Georgia) broke into the prison where he was being held, abducted him and hung him from a tree.</p> <p>Wade Marbaugh, a 67-year-old journalist who for years has played the lynching crew\u2019s ringleader (and whose wife and daughters have also participated), smiled ruefully as he recalled his efforts to recruit his white neighbours and coworkers for the lynch mob. \u201cAt this point, they just ignore me. If it\u2019s email, they don\u2019t respond. If it\u2019s conversation, they cut it just as short as they can. These are people I\u2019ve known for years.\u201d</p> <p>This was frustrating, he said, but not impossible to understand. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not a TV show where the bad guys are the bad guys, and they\u2019re on the screen and you\u2019re in your chair.\u201d While preparing for his first performance, he drove out to Monroe and made his way to the site of the lynching. \u201cIt was just staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt knocked me down. I wept and wept.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>A crucial feature of the re-enactment is that, by the standards commonly used to judge realist drama, it isn\u2019t particularly accomplished. The actors are either amateurs or apprentices still finding their way to whatever dramatic powers they might possess. It is hard for them to all get together to rehearse, especially because people drop out so frequently. Often, secondary members will have joined the production just a few days before the re-enactment.</p> <p>The budget hovers reliably around zero dollars, occasionally supplemented by infusions from Greene or other supporters. This means lots of 21st-century touches in the costumes; it means guns that look and sound like the plastic toys they are. The yellow Chevy \u2013 which is more 1950s than 1946 \u2013 is only rented for the day of the performance, so the cast doesn\u2019t get to use it in rehearsals. As a result, the key scene where the Malcolms and Dorseys are pulled from the car is marked by pauses in which the cast tries to pretend it isn\u2019t pausing to figure out who needs to reposition themselves where in order to keep the action moving.</p> <p>In stage plays and films, imperfections such as these can break the carefully cultivated spell of realism, or stop it from being cast in the first place. But as I watched the Malcolms and Dorseys get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame more intense than any film could elicit. In the weeks leading up to the performance, I had heard stories of audience members crying, sobbing and calling out in pain. Even fierce critics of the re-enactment had admitted to me that, after attending out of curiosity, they had found it unexpectedly moving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9d7c22a3c26c18d02fcb41c90f496e1493aabc2/0_579_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As I watched them get pulled from the yellow Chevy, I felt a claustrophobic flush of fear and shame\u2019 \u2026 the Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge lynching re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In conversation after conversation, the same phrases kept popping up: like a dream; like a nightmare; slow-motion; unreal; super-real. And still I was shocked by the ragged intensity of my reaction. The scene in front of me wasn\u2019t a careful or tasteful copy of the past: it was a live, messy attempt to drag a heavy memory up into the light of day. Not so it could be changed or fixed \u2013 the moment was trapped in terrible amber; the Malcolms and Dorseys would not be saved \u2013 but simply to insist it could not be denied.</p> <p>The audience was almost entirely black, with a sprinkling of white people (myself included). Some of those present were old enough to remember the reign of the lynch mobs, and a small handful had actually been in Monroe on the day of the murders. Joseph Hunter, an 81-year-old black man who was visiting relatives near Monroe in the summer of 1946, approached me at a gathering held at Monroe\u2019s First Baptist Church before the re-enactment. What he remembered, he told me, was being suddenly yanked inside by his aunt when she got the news. \u201cShe closed the shades, she locked the door, and she said: \u2018Stay.\u2019\u201d His mother was in Connecticut, more than 800 miles away. As soon as she heard what had happened, she got in the car and drove continuously until she reached Hunter and his siblings the next day. \u201cShe had to have us close,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He has attended the re-enactment every year since it started, he said. But he couldn\u2019t always watch the whole thing: \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for me to imagine black people getting shot.\u201d The first few years, as the climax approached, he reflexively turned his back on the scene and walked away. \u201cI know it\u2019s not real,\u201d he told me. \u201cI know. But \u2026 \u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>As the crowd followed the re-enactors off the road for the final scene, I watched Hunter pause and stare at the ground. After a few seconds, he lifted his head and slowly walked toward the river.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The final moments of the re-enactment<strong> </strong>took barely a minute to play out, but they were were its slowest and most excruciating.</p> <p>The lynching crew tied their victims together and forced them onto the patch of fake turf. They stepped back, raised their plastic toy guns, and aimed. The ringleader counted down \u2013 three, two, one \u2013 and then the white men squeezed their triggers. In some past years, people have set off fireworks in the woods to simulate the gun shots; in others, the shooters have yelled \u201cPow! Pow!\u201d This year, there was no sound at all. The victims fell on to the patch of fake turf that had been laid out for this purpose. (In the past, actors who fell directly on the ground were painfully bitten by red ants in the grass.) As they collapsed, they burst bags of fake blood secreted in their shirts.</p> <p>For a moment, everyone \u2013 the shooters, the victims, the audience \u2013 was completely still. The victims, still bound by the ropes that had been tied around them, were pressed together on the ground.</p> <p>In 2005, when the re-enactment began, this was the moment where it concluded. But in the years since, more scenes have been added. Most of the new scenes take place earlier in the day, before the lynching itself, in spots around Walton County. The audience sees Roger Malcolm stab Barnette Hester, listens to gubernatorial candidate Eugene Talmadge froth at the mouth about the disgrace of black suffrage, and visits the victims\u2019 graves. But one addition has been tacked on after the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f42656209e86764ba42437071debb2d35fc861/0_528_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectators and camera crew at the final scene of the re-enactment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Rollins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bob Caine, the white re-enactor descended from Leo Frank, walked over to the dead bodies, and, after peering at them for a moment, bent down over Lisa Searcy and pressed his hands into her abdomen, as if he were cutting her open. When he stood up, he was clutching a plastic doll of a black baby, dripping with syrupy fake blood. A woman in the audience shrieked, and the rest watched \u2013 or kept filming \u2013 as Caine held up the baby for all to see, trying his best to look triumphant instead of sickened.</p> <p>There is no firm evidence that Dorothy Malcolm was pregnant when she was murdered (and strong evidence to suggest that she wasn\u2019t). But the rumour has always lurked around the edges of the story, and similar acts of foeticide have been documented in other lynchings. To many regular participants in the re-enactment, the unborn Malcolm baby has become a rich, central symbol: of the severity of racial violence, of the futures it made (and still makes) impossible, of the particular ways it did and does target black women. To others, though, the role of the unborn child is distasteful, even sickening. Several years ago, a group of white feminists involved in the re-enactment \u2013 including the previous director \u2013 left after failing to convince their castmates that the child should be removed from the script.</p> <p>\u201cThe re-enactment has a very complex relationship to what scholars call historical veracity,\u201d said Mark Auslander. \u201cOn one hand, it appears to be about honouring and remembering exactly what happened in this particular spot in this particular day. On the other hand, it\u2019s about the creation of resonant myths and rituals. Re-enactors might say that they\u2019re doing it to educate, or to push the FBI to prosecute. That\u2019s not untrue, but it\u2019s a partial explanation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe summon up the spirit and presence of the dead for all kinds of reasons,\u201d Auslander continued. \u201cWe do it to get to know the dead, to spend time with them, to continue life in the face of death. That\u2019s what gives the re-enactment its force, its aliveness, and that\u2019s what makes it so draining for everyone who touches it.\u201d</p> <p>Racism in America has always been a matter of power \u2013 to enslave, to kill without consequence, to oppress, to segregate, to silence. But it has also been about the power to determine which memories the country sanctifies and which it discards. White America\u2019s preference \u2013 the preference of power, that is \u2013 has been for stories of progress and redemption, of national injury stitched up and healed over. The re-enactment in Monroe is a different type of story: an open wound that has festered for 70 years of repression and neglect. This what makes it necessary for some people, and unbearable for others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/16/suspects-1946-moores-ford-bridge-georgia-mass-lynching-alive\">FBI investigates claim suspects in 1946 Georgia mass lynching may be alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technically, the case remains open. In 2008, local newspapers reported that FBI agents were digging up land in Monroe to look for guns used in the lynching. As recently as last year, federal agents were conducting interviews in the area. But even the most impassioned activists admit that no charges are likely to materialise.</p> <p>Every year, the re-enactment concludes with a song, performed while the victims lie motionless on the ground. This year, an Atlanta jazz singer, Ja\u2019Naan, sang Strange Fruit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/16/protest-songs-billie-holiday-strange-fruit\">the haunting protest song</a> about lynchings made famous by Billie Holliday. Two days earlier, at the final rehearsal, I watched her deliver the song with practised poise. Now, her voice cracked and her body shook. The victims tried their best to remain completely still. Cassandra Greene, the director, watched from the sidelines, sobbing.</p> <p>On 25 July 1946, just hours after the Malcolms and Dorseys were murdered, white people from Monroe and the surrounding towns started driving to Moore\u2019s Ford Bridge. They had heard through the local rumour mill about what had just happened, and now they wanted souvenirs, like the spectators of lynchings past. Policemen had already snatched up most of the bullets and rope for their own personal collections, but there were still some scraps of clothing at the scene. One college student found a tooth, which he gave to a female friend, who put it on her charm bracelet. Many people took pictures, posing with bloodstains or bullet holes in the trees nearby.</p> <p>When the singing came to a stop, the audience did not turn away. They moved closer, walking toward the victims, holding their phones and tablets aloft, to claim these images as their own.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism like the Long Read is difficult and expensive \u2013 but supporting us isn\u2019t.

The bad news? This series is heading back to Progressive Field and the Cubs have zero margin of error, one loss to the Indians and this series is over.</p> <p>It should be a great pitching matchup today, with the Cubs starting last year\u2019s Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta (18-18, 3:10) against Josh Tomlin (13-9, 4.40), who has allowed just 4 runs in 3 postseason games. <br></p> <p>This might be the most important game in Cubs history since 1945, although that distinction would change should they force a Game 7. Heck it might also be the most important Indians game since 1958.</p> <p>I know I keep on saying this every liveblog, but we strongly encourage everyone to share their thoughts, questions, jokes and any-and-all vaguely baseball-related things to us, either via email (to <a href=\"mailto:Hunter.Felt@theguardian\">Hunter.Felt@theguardian</a>) or by Twitter (to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>). We\u2019ll be sharing them in this liveblog throughout the game.</p> <p> Okay, enough chatter, it\u2019s the Chicago Cubs vs. the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field for Game 6 of the World Series.

According to the ABC/Washington Post tracking <a href=\"http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1184a102016ElectionTrackingNo10.pdf\">poll</a> published on Tuesday (conducted October 27-30), the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind Donald Trump, on 45% to her Republican opponent\u2019s 46%. The polling <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a> calculated by RealClearPolitics, a much better indication of national sentiment, shows Clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points, down from 5 percentage points a week ago.</p> <p>Those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative \u2013 polling won\u2019t neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/oct/29/voter-turnout-us-election-2016-register\">turnout</a> - especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/31/polls-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-unpopularity\">close in terms of unpopularity</a>. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Donald Trump reportedly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303034-trump-aide-we-have-three-major-voter-suppression\">revealed</a> last week that \u201cwe have three major voter suppression operations under way\u201d intended to reduce votes for Clinton among African Americans, white liberals and young women.<br></p> <p>Even though election day is still a week away, we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups \u2013 because more than <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">25m</a> ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million Americans are <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/Market/2188/What-will-be-2016-voter-turnout-for-the-presidential-election\">predicted</a> to vote in the 2016 election, so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total.</p> <h2><strong>Higher turnout than at this time in 2012</strong></h2> <p>Of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots, North Carolina, California and nine other states report <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/31/us/elections/earlyvoters.html?_r=0\">more</a> early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. Ohio, Nevada, Colorado and Iowa showed a decline in early voting, and those declines were small.</p> <h2><strong>Early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young voters</strong></h2> <p>The early results offer mixed news for Clinton. Early votes suggest that young voters \u2013 who are much <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/\">more likely</a> than older voters to lean Democratic \u2013 might be staying at home. In 12 states, fewer Americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for Clinton if this group is indicative of a broader \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1031867576877207/\">Bernie or bust</a>\u201d sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for Clinton.<br></p> <p>Young voters aren\u2019t the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states \u2013 especially in North Carolina, a state that yields <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/allocation.html\">15 of the 270</a> electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests Clinton is in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton-5538.html\">close contest</a>. If Trump\u2019s strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote, that makes a lot of sense \u2013 those voters could be crucial for Clinton to secure the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/01/clinton-trump-polls-election-voter-turnout-suppression\">Election polls tighten \u2013 but turnout is the real key to Clinton v Trump</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58192559e4b07ceadb3a169c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-01T23:31:01.602Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Donald Trump predicted \u201can unprecedented constitutional crisis\u201d if Hillary Clinton were to be elected president.</p> <p>\u201cThe work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt,\u201d Trump said, and \u201cshe is likely to be investigated for years, likely to be concluded with a very large-scale criminal trial.\u201d</p> <p>The audience chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d in response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a message for any Democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton and have a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a few states - Wisconsin included - where early ballots can be reversed before election day. \u201cA lot of stuff has come out since you\u2019ve voted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can change your vote to Donald Trump - we\u2019ll make America great again, okay?

The practice has devastated the environment, according to Earthworks and locals, turning thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves into wasteland and rendering turgid the once-crystal waters of the highlands.</p> <p>The tailings from the Grasberg mine are so rich with ore that Papuans walk for as long as a week to get here. Crowding the length of the river and the delta wasteland, thousands of unlicensed panners shore up small sections to slow the river\u2019s flow and dig into the thick sediment on the side.  </p> <p>Although some of these panners are located within Freeport\u2019s official mining operations, they are not evicted or controlled in any way, they said.

Under Indonesian law, Freeport is a designated \u201cstrategic industry\u201d, which mandates that external security for the mine, its access roads and its pipelines all be provided exclusively by Indonesia\u2019s security forces. Freeport has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">never been implicated in any human rights</a> abuses allegedly committed by the Indonesian military in Papua. </p> <p>Freeport McMoRan, based in Phoenix, Arizona, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </p> <p>The company\u2019s website defends its method of disposal of tailings at Grasberg, managed by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), an affiliate company: \u201cPTFI\u2019s controlled riverine tailings management system, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the mountainous highlands near our mine to transport tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and other sediments are managed in a deposition area.\u201d </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org/2012/world/global-gold-rush-the-price-of-mining-pursuits-on-water-supply/\">2009 report by the company</a> says it utilises levees to contain tailings in the deposition area, and that the tailings management programme costs Freeport McMoRan $15.5m (\u00a312.7m) each year. According to the report, company monitoring of aquatic life in the rivers found that fish and shrimp were suitable for consumption, as regulated by Indonesian food standards, while water quality samples met Indonesian and US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for dissolved metals. In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14417718\">2011 BBC report</a> on alleged pollution in the area surrounding Grasberg, the company says that the tailings management method was chosen because studies showed the environmental impact caused by its waste material was reversible.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere on its website, the company says: \u201cWe are committed to respecting human rights. Our <a href=\"http://www.fcx.com/sd/pdf/hr_policy.pdf\">human rights policy</a> requires us (and our contractors) to conduct business in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to align our human rights due diligence practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).\u201d</p> <p>The company also emphasises its work with indigenous people in West Papua. A 2015 Freeport McRoRan report on working towards sustainable development said: \u201cPTFI has engaged with indigenous Papuan tribes for decades, including through numerous formal agreements to promote workforce skills training, health, education and basic infrastructure development \u2026 In 2015, PTFI continued to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate options for Kamoro community members whose estuary transport routes are impacted by sedimentation associated with the controlled riverine tailings management system. Provision of smaller sized boats, in addition to 50 passenger vessels, for route flexibility as well as additional local economic development programmes were identified as additional mitigation measures during the year.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the area surrounding the Grasberg mine, many Papuans, struggling for work, find themselves pulled into the bar and sex industries that cater to the miners, particularly around the highland village of Banti. Here brothels and bars line up side by side, allegedly with help from the Indonesian military, who are said to supply sex workers and alcohol, according to a Freeport source who wished to remain anonymous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d89c3b955d48c4b2445d4a472061e1a7be97ebe8/0_66_3984_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua.

  "<p>Forget suppers of heat-and-eat pizza washed down with a glass or two of red wine. In 2017 Britons will be snacking on Hawaiian raw fish salad and American-style vegetable yoghurts while quenching their thirst with watermelon juice. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The predicted new eating trends are contained in an annual survey of how Britons shop, eat and cook which lists the food fads of 2016 as churros, seeds, seaweed and Asian steamed buns. </p> <p>The report, conducted by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose\">Waitrose</a> among shoppers who use all supermarkets, also reveals that a third of those aged 18 to 34 regularly post pictures of their meals on social media. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-breweries-on-rise-craft-beer-sales-surge\">Number of UK breweries rises as craft beer shows no signs of going flat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 130,000 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_cook/\">pictures of food </a>are shared on Instagram every day in the UK, and the survey found that nearly half of consumers make more effort with their cooking if they think a photo of it is likely to be shared.</p> <p>The grocer\u2019s managing director, Rob Collins, said posting pictures of dinners online means that meals have become a form of self-expression, in the same way as \u201cthe clothes people wear, the cars they drive and the music they listen to. Food is today\u2019s hottest social currency. \u201d</p> <p>The survey also highlights the continuing shift in shopping habits.

Instead, shoppers are opting for naturally lighter and fresher food than they did five years ago. An 18% jump in aubergine sales this year, says the supermarket, is the result of shoppers substituting them for \u201ccarbs\u201d such as lasagne sheets or roasting them as \u201cchips\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Healthy chia seeds and grains (including ready-prepared grain bags), coconut flour, cactus water \u2013 a berry-tasting low-sugar alternative to fruit juice \u2013 and seaweed and a \u201cveggan\u201d diet (vegan but including eggs) all emerged as top food trends of 2016. </p> <p>For next year the retailer is tipping more unlikely items such as cold-pressed watermelon juice \u2013 which in the US has the star backing of Beyonc\u00e9, who recently bought a stake in the WTRMLN WTR brand. Vegetable yoghurts flavoured with carrot, beetroot, sweet potato and tomato are also expected to be a big new seller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5c4d1621a7d89b76435f76069b1433089ccdf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5c4d1621a7d89b76435f76069b1433089ccdf5/0_252_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Gourmet\u2019 food kits such as Hello Fresh are growing in popularity, Waitrose said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Gourmet\u2019 food kits such as Hello Fresh are growing in popularity, Waitrose said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marie-Louise Avery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sushi could be elbowed aside by Polynesian food \u2013 notably Hawaiian poke, a raw fish salad marinated with lime, soy and sesame.

Rochelle Venables, editor of the Good Food Guide, said photogenic food pulls in diners: \u201cRestaurants today tend to have one dish on the menu that is really Instagrammable and people often go to a specific restaurant just to say they have had that dish.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Going up \u2013 in favour in 2016</h2> <p>Seaweed</p> <p>Churros (Spanish-style doughnuts)</p> <p>Wonky vegetables</p> <p>Cactus water</p> <p>Seeds and grains</p> <p>Charred food</p> <p>Coconut flour</p> <p>Picanha (Brazilian rump steak)</p> <p>\u201cVeggan\u201d diet</p> <p>Bao (Asian steamed) buns</p> <h2>What we\u2019ll be eating and drinking in 2017</h2> <p><strong>Watermelon juice: </strong>Pop star Beyonc\u00e9 bought a stake in WTRMLN WTR in May \u2013 a drink said to be like sticking a straw into a melon and sipping.
