  "<p>A government pledge to spend \u00a310m on English tuition for Syrian refugees in Britain, while ignoring those from other countries, is \u201cmadness\u201d, according to the charity advising the Home Office on how to integrate refugees.</p> <p>The government is making the pledge as it confirms that the local authority places needed to deliver on its commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 have been found.</p> <p>The commitment was undertaken a year ago after photographs of Alan Kurdi, a drowned three-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach, shocked the world.</p> <p>Latest figures show that some 2,800 Syrians have arrived in more than 100 local authority areas under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) since it began, putting the government on course to meet its commitment, according to the home secretary, Amber Rudd.</p> <p>\u201cSecuring the 20,000 pledges within 12 months is testament to the immense goodwill and generosity of the British people and the effort and determination of local authorities across the UK,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cWe are on track and delivering our commitment to help the most vulnerable Syrians displaced by the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>The new \u00a310m funding package to boost English tuition will mean all adults arriving under VPRS will receive an extra 12 hours a week of lessons for up to six months.

  "<p>A British warship will arrive off the Libyan coast in the next few days in a dramatic attempt to intercept and arrest people smugglers as the flow of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean for Italy reaches record levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/libyan-navy-admits-confrontation-charity-rescue-boat-msf\">Libyan navy admits confrontation with charity's rescue boat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The unprecedented and risky intervention comes as Europe steps up its efforts to deal with the growing crisis, which has seen Libya become the primary route for migrants, following the closure of Greece\u2019s borders to refugees last spring. The smugglers last week sent record numbers of migrants to sea, with more than 13,000 people being picked up by charity rescue boats and the Italian coastguard.</p> <p>At least 100,000 men, women and children have crossed the sea to Italy from north Africa since the start of the year, leading to more than 3,100 deaths from drowning. But fewer than 100 traffickers have been arrested in international waters.</p> <p>HMS Diamond, a Type-45 destroyer equipped with a 4.5-inch gun, missiles and fast-firing cannon, will join an EU flotilla, Operation Sophia, tasked with catching smugglers at sea. Formal authorisation for the mission was given by Brussels in June. Last week the mission was widened to include intercepting weapons traffickers and training Libya\u2019s coastguard.</p> <p>But the plan to deploy HMS Diamond was met with scepticism by Crispin Blunt, head of parliament\u2019s powerful foreign affairs committee, who is due to grill British officials about Libya policy later this week.</p> <p>Blunt said that without Libyan cooperation naval forces could achieve only partial success, with the smugglers having impunity to operate inside coastal waters. \u201cThe smugglers are taking advantage of the fact there is no coherent government in Libya,\u201d Blunt told the <em>Observer.</em> \u201cUntil there is a political settlement in Libya that encourages a Libyan government to accept assistance in its territorial waters, I fail to see how this can be effective.\u201d</p> <p>His comments echoed a House of Lords report in May that questioned whether the operation could ever deliver its mandate to prevent people smuggling, with suggestions that the search and rescue operation actually increased the number of crossing attempts. Operation Sophia began last year and until now has concentrated on rescues and intelligence gathering. Its ships arrested 71 smuggler suspects who are now being dealt with by the Italian courts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c27a9fab98dbba00babc85c24be544cd25abc5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c27a9fab98dbba00babc85c24be544cd25abc5e1/0_6_3639_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Diamond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>HMS Diamond will join more than a dozen EU vessels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ison/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change to targeted interception has been delayed for months as Libya\u2019s new government refused permission for warships to enter its territorial waters, or to provide forces of its own to arrest smugglers on land. The new strategy carries a risk of armed confrontations in the Mediterranean \u2013 the Operation Sophia commander, Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino, warned in a leaked report earlier this year that interception missions meant that warships should operate in pairs: one to intercept, the other to return fire.</p> <p>HMS Diamond joins HMS Enterprise, which last week rescued 700 migrants off Libya, and more than a dozen EU vessels. Enterprise is a survey vessel which began working with GCHQ officers to identify networks in June 2015.</p> <p>Operation Sophia has used electronic eavesdropping over the past year to build up a picture of migrant smuggling, which is concentrated on the west Libyan coast either side of Tripoli. Mobile phone conversations between gang leaders are tracked, and the Italian-led force is able to identity \u201cblooms\u201d in conversations, indicating that smugglers are poised to send large numbers of migrants to sea.</p> <p>But in a cat-and-mouse game, the smugglers have changed tactics. After EU navies began seizing wooden smuggling boats, the smugglers have deployed rubber rafts imported from Europe and Turkey. The Operation Sophia report noted one consignment of 20 rubber boats, found in Malta, was allowed to go to Libya because Maltese customs had no powers to seize it. At sea, Credendino says that the smugglers now employ \u201cjackals\u201d \u2013 gang members in fishing boats acting as sentinels, tipping off the smuggling boats if they spot naval units in the vicinity.</p> <p>Libya\u2019s waters are already filling with foreign warships, with the American assault ship USS Wasp mounting airstrikes in support of Libyan forces battling Islamic State at its main base in the coastal town of Sirte. Libyan naval officials are suspicious of western operations in the Mediterranean, with coastguards involved in a confrontation with a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res rescue vessel.</p>",
  "<p>In the picturesque hamlet of Brachay, in scorching late summer heat, Marine Le Pen was preaching to the politically converted. \u201c<em>Marine, pr\u00e9sident</em>\u201d, they chanted. \u201c<em>On va gagner</em>\u201d (we\u2019re going to win). A banner stretching the length of one of the stone buildings overlooking the village square read: \u201cMarine: Save&#xa0;France.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen\u2019s stump speech was the most closely watched and significant campaign launch of <em>la rentr\u00e9e</em>, the national return to work after the long summer holidays, and the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National was welcomed like a conquering hero.</p> <p>Le Pen has been largely absent from the political scene for several weeks and has refrained from adding her 10 cents\u2019 worth to the raging polemic over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/the-burkini-ban-what-it-really-means-when-we-criminalise-clothes\" title=\"\">burkini</a> and rows about security following deadly attacks by Islamic fundamentalists, both fertile ground for her party.</p> <p>In the meantime, the country\u2019s governing Socialists and centre-right opposition Les R\u00e9publicains have engaged in what one FN heavyweight described with schadenfreude as a \u201cbloodbath, left and right\u201d.</p> <p>The Parti Socialiste is bitterly split and in turmoil over whether Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, with his calamitous popularity ratings will, or indeed should, stand for a second term. The alternative, to stand down, would be unprecedented for a serving leader. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/frances-economy-minister-emmanuel-macron-resigns\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the finance minister who resigned last week, might be the rabbit that the party pulls out of the hat, but he is disliked by the PS\u2019s leftwing, which is fielding its own candidates. In any case, Macron has not said whether he will even throw his hat into the presidential ring.</p> <p>On the right, things are scarcely more harmonious. The deadline for Les R\u00e9publicains candidates is Friday, and already former president Nicolas Sarkozy, mayor of Bordeaux Alain Jupp\u00e9 and former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon have either announced they are standing or are expected to do&#xa0;so.</p> <p>Amid this political free-for-all, Le Pen is trying to throw off the party\u2019s divisive reputation and market herself as a politician above and beyond the fray of the same-old-same-old French elite: a new, unifying, patriotic force who will break the shackles of Europe, end \u201cmass immigration\u201d and give France back to the French. Her slogan is <em>La France apais\u00e9e</em> \u2013 a soothed France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76a4ad832a38d58e63950a0dc85399f8bfdc6f3/90_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in burkini and two friends in bikinis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Pen kept out of the controversy over banning burkinis on French beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was, she said grandly from a hastily constructed stage in Brachay\u2019s main square, speaking for \u201ca forgotten France, a France abandoned by the self-appointed elite who either don\u2019t see it or view it with a kind of condescension\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey describe places like Brachay as <em>la France profonde</em> [deepest France]. I prefer to think of it as deeply patriotic France,\u201d she said to more cheers.</p> <p>\u201cThe presidential campaign that is opening is unlike any other. The coming eight months will decide the fate of our nation, not just for the five years to come, but much longer. Maybe even for ever.\u201d</p> <p>Brachay mayor G\u00e9rard Marchand had likened Le Pen\u2019s appeal for his villagers \u2013 all 61 of them \u2013 to the popularity of the Beatles and there was a similar element of hero worship.</p> <p>Even by the standards of rural France, Brachay is a backwater. The road to the pretty hamlet, 200 miles south-east of Paris in the newly created Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region \u2013 renamed the Grand Est \u2013 a few kilometres from Colombey-les-deux-Eglises, where General Charles de Gaulle is buried, winds through gently rolling farmland for as far as the eye can see. Brachayens, as they call themselves, boosted by party supporters, some of whom had been bussed in, cheered and clapped wildly and waved the tricolor as Le Pen spoke and they jostled bad-temperedly with the media. Her speech was punctuated by cries of \u201cit\u2019s true\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s why we need you\u201d. Reporters on the other hand, seen as being party to a political elite hostile to the FN, were branded <em>collabos</em> (collaborators).</p> <p>One exchange between FN supporters and the <em>Observer</em> set the tone: \u201cWhat are you writing, is that Arabic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, shorthand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like Arabic. Anyway, all journalists write lies and propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>Le Pen said she was happy to be among rural French people with real concerns in the real France, far from the salons and sophistication, what Le Pen calls the \u201cbrouhaha\u201d of Paris.</p> <p>These are people, the FN leader refers to almost poetically, as \u201cthe forgotten French\u201d. They may not remember the last time, if ever, they saw a migrant in their midst and nobody has ever turned up in Brachay wearing a burkini. The European Agricultural Fund for rural development allocated \u20ac202m for the period 2014-2020 to the region. But Le Pen pledges to wrest sovereignty back from Europe, like the \u201ccourageous British who, despite dire warnings, chose their destiny\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49165287a369473e2240e4da7552f950f22f18d/0_218_4560_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Front National supporters wear T-shirts emblazoned with the first sentence of the French National anthem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Nascimbeni/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brachay may be small, but it perfectly encapsulates the FN\u2019s target audience and has become a totem in the party\u2019s campaign. In the first round of the last presidential election in 2012, Le Pen won her highest score, 72% of the votes \u2013 31 out of the 43 votes cast. Back then, the PS and the UMP, predecessor of Les R\u00e9publicains, failed to get a single Brachay vote.</p> <p>Marchand admitted there was very little crime in his village, and no foreigners, but there were cases of severe poverty \u201cmostly among those who work and who earn less than those who don\u2019t and get benefits\u201d, he said.</p> <p>If locals were angry with the press, it was because journalists had \u201ccome here, taken pictures of them washing their socks in the sink\u201d and assumed they were all know-nothing country bumpkins, he explained.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest Le Pen could win 28-29% in the first round of the presidential election next year. It seems likely that, unless the PS can come up with a stronger candidate than Hollande, who is scraping the bottom of the popularity barrel, Le Pen will be up against a centre-right opposition candidate, most likely Jupp\u00e9 or Sarkozy in the second round.</p> <p>That Le Pen will be there seems hardly to be in doubt. All of the last 38 opinion polls carried out in France suggest she will be in the second round.</p> <p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, director of the opinion pollsters Ifop, said Le Pen\u2019s discretion after the summer terrorist attacks in Nice and near Rouen had played well with the public.</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t needed to speak out because the news, from Brexit to the attacks and on to the row over the burkini \u2026 have worked in her favour. There was no point in her spoiling this momentum with even tougher proposals,\u201d Fourquet told <em>Les Echos</em> last week.</p> <p>In Brachay, like many other communities in <em>la France profonde</em>, Le Pen has already said more than enough to gain their unwavering support.</p>",
  "<p>One of the islands that makes up Papua New Guinea is called New Ireland. But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland \u2013 the island formerly known as Great Britain.</p> <p>In the wake of the European commission\u2019s ruling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\" title=\"\">Ireland must reclaim \u20ac13bn plus interest in taxes</a> from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> put it in an editorial: \u201cIf Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.\u201d Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland \u2013 as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed.</p> <p>It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland\u2019s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations \u2013 not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery.</p> <p>For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU\u2019s ruling on Apple\u2019s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland\u2019s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit?</p> <p>There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers.</p> <p>There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer \u2013 it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>In an interview with Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. \u201cWhen you are accused of doing something that\u2019s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that\u2019s how we feel,\u201d he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the \u20ac13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged \u2013 up to a point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/852c75573920644ac34890975c3e497c86169681/1394_0_2133_2667/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br>Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple\u2019s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: \u201cWe\u2019re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.\u201d</p> <p>So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn\u2019t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable \u2013 in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society.</p> <p>Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes \u2013 ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: \u201cWe went into Ireland in 1980. We didn\u2019t go there to seek advantages on taxes \u2013 we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.\u201d</p> <p>This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it\u2019s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true.</p> <p>The Brexiters\u2019 fantasy of stealing Ireland\u2019s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons \u2013 a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world\u2019s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw.</p> <p>This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU\u2019s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious \u201cdouble Irish\u201d strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they\u2019ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in \u20ac6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with \u20ac4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\" title=\"\">\u201cdouble Irish\u201d</a> was announced.</p> <p>And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.)</p> <p>The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled.</p> <p>So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland \u2013 what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland\u2019s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations?</p> <p>The key point about Ireland\u2019s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn\u2019t an ideological principle \u2013 it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed.</p> <p>This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country.</p> <p>Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/752841032870551552\" title=\"\">\u201cleprechaun economics\u201d</a>. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/irish-economic-growth-revised-figures-foreign-investment-aircraft\" title=\"\">grew by an incredible 26.3%</a> in 2015. Literally incredible \u2013 the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless \u2013 the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check.

And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes \u2013 on somebody&#xa0;else.</p> <p>It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them.</p> <p><em>Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</em></p> <h2>FIAT <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ae999d94cf80ca7cc8440c0bfa94af7f303fd/181_0_4499_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker\u2019s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated.

  "<p>As any young Earth creationist will confirm, the BBC occasionally fails in its objective of due impartiality. Only last week, it reported on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/31/oldest-fossils-on-earth-discovered-in-37bn-year-old-greenland-rocks-stromatolites\" title=\"\">fossil find in Greenland</a>, without bothering to balance this with a contribution from a fundamentalist Christian, such as Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence.</p> <p>If the US might seem like a long way to go for comment, the BBC\u2019s referendum coverage demonstrated that, when balance is at stake, a contributor\u2019s passion can be quite as compelling a qualification as his or her expertise, reputation or, even, connection with the subject under discussion. Moreover, Pence has a long acquaintance with creationism.</p> <p>It was never clear, at least to this listener, why Steve Hilton, a US resident who once fell out with the last prime minister, became one of the anti-EU stars of the BBC\u2019s Brexit coverage, to the point of assisting with analysis on referendum night. But in line with BBC impartiality guidelines that are enforced, arguably to the point of misrepresentation, when the corporation feels threatened, he was no doubt balanced by a yet more embittered \u2013 but pro-Remain \u2013 ex-Cameron adviser with a similarly touristic stake in the outcome.</p> <p>To be fair to Mr Hilton, he could hardly be blamed for embracing a dazzling career in EU punditry when the BBC pressed it upon him, nor was his inexplicable prominence the most bizarre or regrettable aspect of the coverage which, according to polling by the Electoral Reform Society, played the biggest part in the referendum in keeping the British public informed. Throughout a debate the ERS describes as \u201cdire\u201d, the BBC was the source of information most commonly cited as important. The final level of public understanding, after a four-month campaign, is well illustrated, says its new <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/publication/Its-good-to-talk-2016-EU-Referendum-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>, by the great spike on 24 June in the number of people googling \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d \u201cWe would argue,\u201d say the authors, \u201cthat the levels of knowledge reported by members of the public were too low throughout.\u201d This, despite demonstrably high levels of public interest and lavish airtime for the individuals they describe as \u201cbig beasts\u201d.</p> <p>Among their recommendations for better informed plebiscites, as referendums become more commonplace, are longer campaign periods and an independent body empowered to correct misleading statements such as the untruth \u2013 holy writ according to Gisela Stuart, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u2013 that Britain sends a weekly \u00a3350m to the EU. Further public understanding might be achieved, it says, if broadcasters attempted more \u201cdeliberative\u201d as opposed to tit-for-tat coverage of the type that infuriated complainants to the BBC\u2019s <em>Feedback</em> programme long before they could be written off as sore losers.</p> <p>If there are pointed lessons here for some BBC programme-makers, who must bear partial responsibility for the final level of public bafflement, maybe they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for submitting to management orders, issued when the now forgotten escort fan and culture secretary, John Whittingdale, was emitting worrying noises. The EU referendum <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidelines/appendix8/due-impartiality\" title=\"\">guidelines</a> effectively ordained that BBC coverage would adhere, in the aim of impartiality, to traditional, binary practices, despite this being a non-party political debate to which any number of non-affiliated, non big beasts might have more insights to contribute than Westminster\u2019s in-fighters. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSavoiFxyE\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s case</a>, these amounted to: \u201cWe export French knickers to France...

They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said, \u2018Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor me,\u201d writes Professor John van Reenen, formerly of the LSE, now at MIT and one of the economists thus likened by Gove to an antisemitic, government-owned Nazi, \u201cit simply capped off a frankly disgusting campaign, one where the Leave side simply impugned the motives of \u2018the experts\u2019 rather than seriously engaging with the substance of the economic debate.\u201d</p> <p>But the Leave side might not have got away with this ugliness, nor Remain with prattling about imminent apocalypse, had not the BBC, as well as enabling an often asinine level of argument, allowed its obsession with balance to dictate that any carefully argued observation on Brexit, deserving of analysis, be promptly followed by its formal opponent\u2019s unsubstantiated bluster.</p> <p>Similarly, no more attention would be devoted to a striking near-consensus of economic opinion than to its negation by a speaker representing a groupuscule of eight. Admittedly, this was tough on the eight. Professor Patrick Minford was working hours to which no elderly economist should be subjected. But that\u2019s just one of the costs of the BBC\u2019s \u201cregulated <a href=\"http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-3-news/regulated-equivocation-the-referendum-on-radio\" title=\"\">equivocation</a>\u201d, as its critics call a habit that has previously embarrassed the corporation when applied to climate change and the MMR. Until recently, it considered the climate change denier Nigel Lawson as fine a match for peer-reviewed research as it now believes him a trusted guarantor of post-Brexit glories, possibly forgetting his earlier history of shadowing the deutschmark.</p> <p>In his 2011 <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">report</a> on BBC science coverage, the geneticist Professor Steve Jones criticised the \u201cover-rigid\u201d insistence on due impartiality that could give \u201cundue attention to marginal opinion\u201d. But once again, in referendum coverage, the corporation actively required its journalists to supply this phony balance, even when that meant, as Jones put it on science, allowing rhetoric \u2013 say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/michael-gove-likens-uk-remaining-in-eu-to-hostage-situation\" title=\"\">Gove\u2019s \u201chostages\u201d in a car</a> \u2013 \u201cto give the appearance of debate\u201d.</p> <p>As with climate change, implicit in extreme BBC impartiality is a distinctly un-BBC like, post-truth proposal that, since all opinions merit equal coverage, the public might as well give up on evidence-based argument. So much was plainly stated by <em>Today</em>\u2019s Nick Robinson when he assured voters who were, in huge numbers, seeking information from the BBC that the debate was all \u201cclaims and counterclaims\u201d, \u201cguesswork\u201d. \u201cNo journalist,\u201d he declared, \u201cno pundit, no expert can resolve these questions for you.\u201d Whether the imaginary \u00a3350m claimed by Johnson and Gove would ever be imaginarily spent on the NHS was not, it presumably followed, a lie for the BBC to repeatedly expose, but \u201ca matter of judgment\u201d.</p> <p>Whichever side you were on, the BBC\u2019s coverage was not, as the ERS is not the first to point out, such as to create unalloyed confidence in the outcome. Even the winners would discover, shortly after voting, that one big beast (Gove) had never meant it about the NHS\u2019s \u00a3350m; that another (Hannan) saw no connection with reduced immigration. That ERS idea, the official fact checker, has already been derided as a \u201cstuck-up quango\u201d. But would the ERS be asking if the BBC had done its job?</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May will tell the leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful economies that the United Kingdom wants to strengthen its economic ties with countries beyond the European Union, as she lays out her vision of a post-Brexit Britain at her first big international summit as prime minister.</p> <p>Attending the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit\"> G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, </a>May will address the opening session saying that, as the UK heads out of the EU, it remains \u201copen for business\u201d and is seeking to build new and stronger trade relations with countries across the globe.</p> <p>But diplomats past and present warned that she faces a huge test as a novice on the world stage, and will have to perform a delicate balancing act as she seeks to sell the UK to global leaders, while avoiding giving the impression that Britain is about to become a marginal player on the European stage.</p> <p>In a sign of her determination to show that the UK is embarking on a new phase in its diplomatic and economic relations, May will hold four bilateral meetings with the leaders of the US, China, Russia and India, but none with EU leaders.</p> <p>British officials have denied that she is cold-shouldering the Europeans, and stressed that since becoming prime minister she has already met the leaders of France and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/20/germany-uk-brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-politics-live\">Germany</a> to address the challenges of Brexit. The G20, they said, is her chance to convince other world leaders that the UK is a \u201cdependable\u201d partner which will \u201ccontinue to play a bold confident and outward-looking role as it leaves the EU\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC1\u2019s <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> on Sunday morning, recorded before she left for the G20, May said the economic figures were not as bad as some had predicted after the EU referendum vote. \u201cWhat is important for us now is that we maintain that policy of ensuring economic stability and a strong economy for the future. Part of that is going to be, as we come out of the European Union, ensuring we\u2019ve got trade deals around the world. I want the United Kingdom to be a global leader in free trade.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is emphasising the role that we will be playing in the world, but also in a number of the discussions I\u2019ll be having, with President Obama, for example, prime minister Modi, prime minister Turnbull \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>A bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, after the official summit proceedings close on Monday, will arguably be May\u2019s sternest test. Her decision, shortly after entering Downing Street, to delay a go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, on which China has committed to spend billions of pounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit\">has severely strained relations with Bejing</a>.</p> <p>The former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the <em>Observer</em> that the G20\u2019s Chinese hosts would be \u201csurprised and puzzled\u201d by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, but would probably be more attentive to May as a result. \u201cAlthough they will think that we are slightly barking for wanting to leave the EU, they will in some way see us as more interesting and needing more of their attention. We will be the second biggest economy in Europe, a permanent member of the UN security council, and a strong military power with the willingness to use that power.\u201d</p> <p>However, Rifkind said the Hinkley Point issue would hover over the summit. \u201cWhatever the wider and longer-term issues, Hinkley is the immediate test. The Chinese president and UK prime minister will be sizing each other up. Hinkley Point is directly relevant to China\u2019s global economic ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we drop Hinkley Point, and even if we stress that this is for economic reasons alone, the Chinese will see it as a major defeat for their ambitions. We will be seen as joining with the US and Australia in rejecting China as a partner, and that will not be helpful for relations. This may be the right decision for the UK to take, but there will be a price to pay.\u201d</p> <p>May told Marr: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the Hinkley decision, but it\u2019s about how I actually approach these things. I look at the evidence, I take the advice, I listen to that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing. I\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be a decision in September.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Wood of Anfield, a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown, said May would be thrown in at the deep end of international diplomacy at a crucial moment in the UK\u2019s history. There was a risk of being seen as a bit player in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has a tricky combination of challenges this week. In the wake of Brexit, she has to show that Britain\u2019s relationship with Germany, France and Italy is not suffering,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe has to show that European \u2018caucusing\u2019 prior to and during the G20 is still alive and well. Any hint of Franco-German-Italian cosiness that excludes her risks suggesting we are on the way to becoming a second-tier G20 country. She will also need to consider the appropriate mixture of robustness and conciliation to adopt in her dealings with Vladimir Putin.\u201d</p> <p>On her meeting with Barack Obama, Wood added: \u201cShe will have to show that Britain still matters to an outgoing president who has been increasingly speaking his mind, and whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\">advice on Brexit</a> was conspicuously rejected by the British electorate.\u201d</p> <p>Before boarding her plane for China, May insisted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/theresa-may-writes-letter-reassurance-chinese-president-xi-jinping-hinkley-point-c\">UK-China relations have a bright future</a>. \u201cThis is a golden era for UK-China relations, and one of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China. But I\u2019ll also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the globe and how Britain wants to seize those opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Global security and the fight against terrorism will also be high on the prime minister\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former foreign policy adviser Lord Powell of Bayswater said he expected May to approach the G20 in a much more cautious manner than his former boss, who would have piled in with her demands and views. May would be more concerned with \u201csignals\u201d than substance.</p> <p>\u201cIn one day to be seeing Obama, Putin, and Xi Jinping is quite a scorecard. She will want to show that she believes the UK can make a success of Brexit. It will be a case of signals more than getting down to any definitive business.\u201d</p> <h2>ENEMIES ABROAD?<br></h2> <h2>Xi Jinping <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"914c701ce10bfd98482ae5af3f70e280adbcda82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914c701ce10bfd98482ae5af3f70e280adbcda82/807_1143_995_597/500.jpg\" alt=\"Xi Jinping.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xi Jinping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s president said on a state visit to London last year that he hoped Britain would be a \u201cgateway to Europe\u201d for his country.

Now, with Britain heading out of the EU and doubts over whether Theresa May will go ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, into which China has agreed to pump billions of pounds, relations are tense. China has already made clear that it would regard abandonment of the project as a snub. After the summit, May will have a bilateral meeting with Xi at which she will make clear that the decision will be for the British government alone.

The Russian president is almost certainly the only G20 leader who will have welcomed and seen overall benefits for his country from Britain\u2019s intended departure from the EU. Russia sees it as a sign that the bloc on his doorstep is no longer such a cohesive force and threat to his interests. Putin will also see potential for closer economic ties with the UK and may be looking for indications that the EU\u2019s resolve behind sanctions against Russia will now weaken. But May will not want to risk angering the US or her EU counterparts, with whom she must negotiate Brexit, by cuddling up too much to Moscow.</p> <h2>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971/0_113_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francois Hollande.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Hollande facing presidential elections next year, he is sending a tough message to the British prime minister about future relations with Europe.

Hollande fears that this would merely encourage backing for anti-EU campaigner Marine Le Pen and the Front National, who will say that the French would also be better off out of the EU. France\u2019s Socialist president\u2019s message will be that there is a stiff price to pay for Brexit. Concerns over immigration and the future role of UK border guards in Calais may also be discussed.</p> <h2>RELATIONSHIPS TO WORK ON<br></h2> <h2>Angela Merkel<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67/419_436_1243_746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theresa May has already been to Berlin for a meeting with Merkel since becoming prime minister and relations between Europe\u2019s two most powerful women were reasonably warm. No bilateral has been planned for the G20, however, signalling the UK\u2019s wider ambitions post-Brexit. As the EU\u2019s power broker, the German chancellor, who like Hollande is facing elections next year, has a balance to strike between remaining close to the UK while preserving the EU intact. Germany fears that the UK will try to bolster its economy post-Brexit by trying to lure in foreign investment through low corporate and other taxes. Berlin wants to make clear that if this is the route it chooses then its access to the EU single market, particularly for the sale of financial services, which represent more than 10% of the UK economy, will not be possible.</p> <h2>King Salman<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e/1080_279_545_327/500.jpg\" alt=\"King Salman.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Salman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saudi Arabia has spent \u00a33bn on arms from the UK since the start of 2015, with critics voicing concerns that weapons may have been used against civilian targets in Yemen.

It is also concerned that with the UK outside, EU support for sanctions against Russia over Ukraine will weaken. Obama said before the Brexit vote that the UK would go \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d in trade talks if it left the bloc.

The Canadian prime minister and May will no doubt exchange notes on how possible and desirable a similar arrangement will be for the UK, and how they could work together on the shape of future world trade. One problem is that Canada\u2019s deal does not cover financial services, which contributed \u00a3126.9bn in gross value added to the UK economy in 2014. So the Canada model is no panacea. It has also taken almost a decade to strike and has yet to come into force.</p> <h2>Malcolm Turnbull</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"92e06972457c8f1f07f5fcc71bb6146ef35748f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e06972457c8f1f07f5fcc71bb6146ef35748f8/819_294_1957_1174/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australia has already called for a free trade deal with Britain following its exit from the EU \u2013 a move that May described as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d.

The charity condemned the attack, saying: \u201cThis was a serious and worrying attack, with shooting towards our boat which could have put our staff in acute physical danger.\u201d</p> <p>It is not the first time Libya\u2019s navy has threatened rescue boats. In April, warning shots were fired prior to the boarding of a vessel from the German charity Sea Watch. \u201cThey fired shots in the air and entered our ship.

A deal cut in the spring between the EU and Turkey has blocked the route to Europe used by 900,000 migrants last year. As a result, smuggling gangs have switched gear, channelling Middle Eastern migrants through Libya to join the growing number of Africans making the same journey. \u201cThe Turkey deal was done in March, it takes some time to change routes, but this is changing right now,\u201d says Neugebauer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't want to pick people out of the water while a naval vessel is there with all guns blazing</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Sweetnam, MOAS</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is apprehension among the rescue crews about the coming armed intervention by combined EU navies, authorised last week by Brussels.

After the MSF attack, we improved our communications; it\u2019s a reminder of the element we are working in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The growth of the flotilla of rescue ships from charities across Europe has seen tens of thousands saved from drowning, but the August attack has put a question mark over how long unprotected vessels can continue operating. \u201cIf the security situation deteriorates further, I don\u2019t think the small NGOs can continue,\u201d says Cusumano. \u201cAs for the bigger boats, these boats are chartered.

  "<p>Indigenous peoples in Peru are demanding to be consulted about a proposed electricity transmission line that would run for approximately 586 kms through the Amazon. The stated aim of the line is to connect Iquitos in Peru\u2019s northeast, often described as the world\u2019s largest city or town without road or rail access, to the national grid.</p> <p>Doing so would mean crossing the territories of numerous indigenous peoples, including the Achuars, Kandozis, Kichwas, Kukamas-Kukamirias and Urarinas. Representative organisations are expressing serious concern about the project\u2019s potential impacts and say they have not been consulted about it despite the government\u2019s obligation to do so under Peruvian and international law. </p> <p>The proposed line would also run through the Abanico del Rio Pastaza, a huge wetlands complex stretching across the border into Ecuador. In 2002 3.8 million hectares of the Abanico were declared a Wetland of International Importance, or Ramsar Site, under the Ramsar Convention, making it the largest Ramsar Site in Latin America and the eighth largest worldwide out of a total of 2,241.</p> <p>According to ORPIO, an Iquitos-based federation representing 15 indigenous peoples, the potential impacts of the line include the destruction of 874,000 tonnes of trees, the release of 424,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, massive biodiversity and game loss, conflict, the resettlement of indigenous communities, and encouraging the entrance of colonists, illegal loggers, gold-miners and coca farmers.</p> <p>ORPIO is taking legal action against the Energy Ministry (MINEM) and government agency ProInversion in an attempt to suspend construction of the line, filing a lawsuit in Iquitos arguing they have not been consulted about it.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge that our request for prior consultation, according to the International Labour Organization\u2019s Convention 169 and other current national and international legislation, is respected, given that the Moyobamba-\u00ccquitos Transmission Line will directly affect our rights,\u201d ORPIO wrote to MINEM in August.</p> <p>CORPI, a federation representing nine indigenous peoples, is also demanding that the right to prior consultation, as the process is termed in Peruvian law, is respected. </p> <p>\u201c[The proposed transmission line] directly affects [indigenous peoples\u2019] collective rights and will impact their access to their subsistence resources and therefore threatens their physical existence, cultural identity, quality of life and spiritual links with the land they have occupied ancestrally,\u201d read a CORPI statement released in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4155322fefdb084eb3170c651422912837eb99e0/0_0_2091_2570/814.jpg\" alt=\"A Kichwa woman from the River Tigre, Peru, demanding in 2015 to be consulted about oil operations.

The law states that the \u201cconstruction and maintenance of public service infrastructure\u201d doesn\u2019t require prior consultation if \u201cit is intended to benefit\u201d and is done \u201cin coordination\u201d with indigenous peoples - and since the proposed transmission line is a \u201cpublic service\u201d and \u201cwould benefit indigenous populations in the project\u2019s area of influence\u201d, MINEM claims no consultation is necessary.</p> <p>That argument has been dismissed by Peru\u2019s state ombudsman, the Defensoria del Pueblo, which recommended, on 20 May, that MINEM carry out prior consultation. It claims that the legal loophole isn\u2019t applicable in this case because, among other reasons, the proposed line will <em>not</em> directly benefit the indigenous peoples living in the region. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the population of Iquitos that will be the beneficiary of this project, while the indigenous territories will just be an area through which the transmission line will pass,\u201d the Defensoria\u2019s Daniel Sanchez wrote to MINEM.</p> <p>MINEM\u2019s response to Sanchez, in August, was that indigenous organizations could have appealed its initial decision to forgo prior consultation, made in October 2015, but didn\u2019t do so. It also argued that its interpretation of the 2012 law is in line with that of the Culture Ministry (MINCU), the ministry responsible for indigenous peoples which - conveniently - issued its own interpretation of the loophole in the 2012 law just seven days after Sanchez wrote to MINEM in May.</p> <p>To the Guardian Sanchez described MINEM\u2019s interpretation of the law as \u201cloose and wrong\u201d, \u201cperverting\u201d the right to prior consultation and making the process meaningless. </p> <p>\u201cPrior consultation emerged as a way of promoting indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in projects affecting them [but] I think that a certain sector within MINEM still sees it as an obstacle,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cSo they\u2019re opposed to its implementation. This is counter-productive because it has been shown that what indigenous peoples want is to be taken into account, to influence and above all to participate in decision-making. Of the 17 extractive projects - hydrocarbons, mining and infrastructure - that have been subject to prior consultation to date, not one of them has been opposed by indigenous representatives.\u201d</p> <p>The opinion that indigenous peoples have the right to prior consultation about the proposed line is shared by lawyer Henry Carhuatocto from NGO IDLADS, which is supporting ORPIO in making its demands heard by the government and media. Carhuatocto calls MINEM\u2019s argument \u201cfrankly lamentable\u201d and agrees the line will not directly benefit indigenous peoples but will instead mean clearing almost 600 kms of forest and indirectly facilitate \u201cinvaders and colonists.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, we need to make it clear that any legislative or administrative measure affecting the lives of indigenous peoples must be subject to prior consultation,\u201d Carhuatocto told the Guardian. \u201cSecond, prior consultation is not an obstacle to economic development, but a space to comply with human rights agreements and an opportunity for the state to take more of an interest in indigenous peoples, to be able to discuss the impacts of the project with them, to reach agreements in good faith, and for them to give their consent. This is an opportunity for the state to do things right by indigenous peoples and we hope that in this instance it doesn\u2019t fail to take it.\u201d</p> <p>Juan Carlos Ruiz Molleda, from NGO Instituto de Defensa Legal (IDL) which is part of the legal team supporting ORPIO\u2019s lawsuit, makes another argument: that the 2012 law, irrespective of how it is interpreted, is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to government functionaries, especially those in MINEM, ProInversion and even MINCU, you always hear the same argument: \u201cBut that\u2019s what it says in the regulation, that\u2019s what it says in the law.\u201d What\u2019s forgotten, however, is that a law can be unconstitutional and therefore invalid,\u201d Ruiz Molleda wrote in a recent article.</p> <p>The Environment Ministry (MINAM) has expressed grave concern about the proposed line and, in a report sent to MINEM in February, recommended considering an alternative route that would have less impact on the Abanico del Pastaza. It also stated that the peat bogs in the region, together with those south of the River Maranon, sequester approximately 50% of Peru\u2019s entire carbon reserves, which it called \u201cextremely relevant\u201d \u201cgiven Peru\u2019s commitments to reduce carbon emissions in order to combat climate change.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, MINAM\u2019s report argued that Peru\u2019s 1993 Constitution states that treaties form part of national law, meaning that the Ramsar Convention is legally binding on Peru. As a contracting party to the Ramsar Convention, which entered into force in the country in 1992, Peru committed to \u201cdesiring to stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future\u201d, and to \u201cpromote the conservation\u201d and \u201cas far as possible the wise use\u201d of wetlands.</p> <p>\u201cThe Abanico del Pastaza is one of the best conserved areas in the Peruvian Amazon, home to almost intact animal populations and plants of enormous relevance for the functioning and integrity of eco-systems and for the economy of the indigenous peoples and riberenos living there,\u201d MINAM\u2019s report stated.</p> <p>The company planning to build the line is Lineas de Transmision Peruanas, owned by Spain-based Isolux Cors\u00e1n. In May MINEM decided against approving an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project because it failed to adequately address numerous environmental issues, among other reasons, but that decision was appealed by the company and then effectively annulled by Vice-Minister of Energy Raul Perez-Reyes Espejo.</p> <p>\u201cThe Vice-Minister has opened up the possibility that the EIA could be approved,\u201d ORPIO, IDLADS and CORPI announced on 16 August. </p> <p>The justification for the line, according to the EIA, is that it will be a more efficient and less costly way of providing electricity to Iquitos, allowing residents to enjoy a service similar to other cities in Peru already connected to the national grid. </p> <p>\u201cCurrently, Iquitos\u2019s entire electricity supply comes from its thermal power plant which has a total output of 48.4 MW,\u201d the EIA states. \u201cThe oil is transported there by river which means that the supply is subject to high risk because of the difficulties in navigation, weather conditions and environmental implications.\u201d</p> <p>When Isolux Cors\u00e1n won the contract in 2014 the then Vice-Minister of Energy, Edwin Quintanilla Acosta, claimed the proposed line would save 38 million gallons of oil a year and \u201cdinamize\u201d the economies of various Amazon regions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Amazon, 130 years after electricity was first used in Peru, will have clean energy to power its economic take-off,\u201d MINEM reported Quintanilla saying. \u201c\u201cThat enables us to see the future of the country with great optimism.\u201d\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Serra Vega, an engineer specialising in energy and the environment who has conducted environmental and economic analyses of the proposed line, argues it would be an \u201cenvironmental disaster.\u201d He claims 8.5 million tonnes of biomass from mostly primary forest could be destroyed, 4.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide could be released, 1000s of colonists could \u201cinvade\u201d, and the territories of eight indigenous peoples would be directly impacted.</p> <p>Serra Vega claims it would be an \u201ceconomic disaster\u201d too, estimating it will raise electricity prices and could cost Peruvians over a billion dollars. He says that consumers in Iquitos pay less than in Lima for electricity and another company, Genrent, is already building a new thermal power plant in Iquitos that will have 70 MW capacity - when the city\u2019s current maximum demand is 56MW. </p> <p>\u201cThis line isn\u2019t necessary and will cause a prejudice to Peruvian electricity consumers superior to 600 million dollars during the 30 years of its concession,\u201d Serra Vega told the Guardian. </p> <p>The EIA states the line will cost approximately US$500 million and take three years to build, with the preliminary stages employing roughly 800-900 people maximum.

At least 55 countries must also formally join the agreement for it to take effect.</p> <p>Everything you need to know about the Paris agreement is on <a href=\"http://climatenexus.org/about-us/paris-agreement/factsheet-entry-force-process-paris-agreement\">the Climate Nexus website.</a> The key points are as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Paris Agreement was adopted by all Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015, but there are several formal steps to go through before the agreement enters into force in international law.</p> <p><strong>The first step:</strong> is for countries to sign the agreement. Signing signals that country\u2019s support for the Paris agreement and its intention to align its domestic policies with the agreement terms and start the process of formally joining the agreement.</p> <p><strong>The second step:</strong> undertake domestic processes to formally join (or accept/approve/ratify) the agreement and \u2018consent to be bound\u2019 by its terms and deposit the appropriate paperwork with the UN Secretary-General.</p> <p><strong>The third step:</strong> the next phase starts when a sufficient number of countries (55) covering a certain percentage of emissions (55%) have formally joined the Paris agreement. When these two thresholds are met the agreement will enter into force.</p> <p>Once the conditions of the third step are met, entry into force will occur 30 days after the dual thresholds are achieved. Upon entry into force, the Agreement will become binding international law and countries that have formally joined will be subject to its provisions.

But the ACA relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that is dwindling.</p> <p>Under the ACA, health insurance marketplaces, also called health exchanges, were set up to facilitate the purchase of health insurance in each state. Customers are free to choose from a set of standardized healthcare plans from participating insurers, and those policies are eligible for federal subsidies.</p> <p>But insurers have been fleeing the exchanges, arguing that they are loss makers and the types of people attracted to them make the risks too great for the insurers  to provide affordable (and profitable) policies.</p> <p>David Howard, an associate professor at Emory University\u2019s department of health policy and management, said the ACA included provisions to keep the marketplaces stable, but some of those were watered down in the push to get the deal through Congress, and in other cases the provisions have not been enacted in the way people expected. \u201cSo that means the exchanges are potentially on the cusp of falling apart,\u201d Howard said. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/the-perils-of-turning-26-when-us-millennials-lose-their-parents-healthcare-cover\">The perils of turning 26: when US millennials lose their parents' healthcare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The marketplaces are unstable in part because they are new, and all the parties involved \u2013 from insurers to those who need insurance \u2013 are trying to figure out where they fit into the equation.

In April, UnitedHealthcare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/20/united-health-insurance-obamacare-exit-pr-problem\">left most of the 34 state marketplaces it participated in</a>.

  "<p>The Yarrow looks unremarkable. OK, the building is Grade II-listed and has an interesting history: it was built in 1894 as a convalescent home for children, by shipbuilder Sir Alfred Yarrow, who declared Broadstairs the healthiest place in Britain. But heritage buildings are turned into hotels every five minutes; we don\u2019t seem to know what else to do with them. On the inside, too, it ticks the boutique boxes without much wow factor.</p> <p>But appearances can be deceiving. This hotel is the only one in the country owned by a further education college and run by its students. What a brilliant idea by East Kent College! Why farm out students for work experience when they can graft right on campus, and bring in a few quid? After years of cuts, cash-strapped colleges need all the help they can get (though the government\u2019s Skills Funding Agency did chip in for the \u00a311m refurb).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6539d70a34c40236b4fe4a268b5ddc5a6d0b24bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6539d70a34c40236b4fe4a268b5ddc5a6d0b24bd/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student in Yarrow kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As well as a hotel, the Yarrow is a restaurant, salon and spa, so catering, hair and beauty students can learn on the job, too. About 70 students work here each year, first on unpaid work experience and then as paid apprentices. Some will go on to full-time jobs at the hotel. A handful of former students are already working in the kitchen and front-of-house, overseen by fully trained staff. Executive chef Ben Williams, for example, used to work at two-Michelin-starred The Square in London.</p> <p>At check-in, we didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. At dinner, though, it was obvious who was a pro and who wasn\u2019t. Waiting staff were flustered and overattentive. We were asked more than once for our drinks order, and repeatedly whether our food was OK. When a young waiter arrived with some \u201cpre-starters\u201d and I asked what they were, he turned bright red, blurted \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and practically ran away. They were clearly nervous and doing their best \u2013 far nicer than being ignored by complacent or too-cool-for-school staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ce475edb8b52797476348943f0ec2945a433386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce475edb8b52797476348943f0ec2945a433386/0_472_7086_4252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the junior suites at The Yarrow hotel, Broadstairs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the hotel\u2019s junior suites</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Dodd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The food was good, occasionally verging on great. Those pre-starters were a nice touch (cheese beignets, mushroom crostini and a gorgeous vichyssoise, for the benefit of my waiter). The main-course Kentish lamb was very pink, with deep green broad beans and bright green pea puree, and the beef fillet came with fancy-sounding oxtail croustillant. These turned out to be meat-stuffed mini yorkies \u2013 delicious. The dessert was even better, an eggy sponge with plump, boozy cherries, a lemon curd-filled sugar cigar and vanilla ice-cream. We paired it with a glass of Chapel Down Nectar, a lovely light, sweet wine from Kent \u2013 the wine list is strong on local vineyards, and the food menu changes every few weeks.</p> <p>Even after a huge meal, the climb up to our room was surprisingly easy: the oak staircase is the original, with small steps for little feet. This was an added bonus as my friend was recovering from open-heart surgery \u2013 a place where children, and later soldiers, had convalesced seemed a fitting place for his first outing. (Coincidentally, he is also an FE lecturer, and quizzed the poor students endlessly.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d416f46f43073418f935458a3ac041b08969d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d416f46f43073418f935458a3ac041b08969d1/0_1628_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HOT CANAPES\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our room, one of five suites (there are also 23 double/twin rooms) was quite plain, but high ceilings and windows, and a coastal colour scheme of pale blue, white and cream, gave it an airy feel. A cast-iron fireplace and a half-staircase up to the bathroom, which had a rolltop bath and separate shower, were nice features. Some rooms have sea views.</p> <p>In the morning, I tried out the spa, which has treatments by junior therapists (massage from \u00a312, manicure from \u00a36). My masseuse was a former beauty student, now working full-time at the hotel; another success for the scheme. Breakfast meant the same overzealous table service and some truly terrible coffee, but again we gave them full marks for effort.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df02afb15ab3be5370f8a45b3487aac3e8fef34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df02afb15ab3be5370f8a45b3487aac3e8fef34/0_0_7108_4265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SOLARIUM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The hotel hasn\u2019t entirely shaken off its institutional feel. Plus points are the wide hallways (to give the children room to play on rainy days), the cavernous lobby with honeycomb tiles and chandelier, and the fat houndstooth-check carpets. They could do better with the plasticky bar and matchy-matchy furniture \u2013 perhaps they should draft in some art students to breathe a bit of life.

According to author Shelina Janmohamed, they are proud of their faith, enthusiastic consumers, dynamic, engaged, creative and demanding. And the change they will bring about won\u2019t depend on the benevolence of others: instead, the Muslim pound, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/27/pink-pound-gay-tourism-1999-archive\">pink pound</a> before it, will force soft cultural change by means of hard economics.</p> <p>To demonstrate all that, the cover image was crucial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Muslims in particular, but actually people of religion in general, the images you get are really quite depressing,\u201d she says over coffee and baklava in her garden in the outer suburbs of London. \u201cBut I think this really captures it. It\u2019s bold, it\u2019s vibrant, the woman\u2019s got so much attitude. They are exactly the kind of people I\u2019m writing about.\u201d</p> <p>Janmohamed recalls going into a bookshop some years ago. \u201cThey had this display of books about Muslims, and it was all misery memoirs of women in veils with cast-down eyes who\u2019d been kidnapped and sold, and people riding on camels in faraway deserts,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBut young Muslims are crying out for a voice to say this is not what we\u2019re like, we do ordinary things like everyone else, and we have interesting things to say \u2013 particularly when the conversation is about Muslims.\u201d There are precious few mainstream publications about the experience of being a young Muslim, beyond politics and theology, she says.</p> <p>Generation M are the Muslim millennials, the global generation born in the past 30 years, but with a twist. Unlike their Christian counterparts in the US and western Europe, most of whom are turning their backs on organised religion, Generation M has \u201cone over-riding characteristic, which is that they believe that being faithful and living a modern life go hand in hand, and there is absolutely no contradiction between the two,\u201d says Janmohamed.</p> <p>In the book, she writes: \u201cTheir faith affects everything, and they want the world to know it. This is what sets them apart from their non-Muslim peers.

In 2010, there were 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, a figure forecast to grow by 73% in the next four decades \u2013 more than double the general rate of growth. By 2050, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>, there will be 2.8 billion Muslims globally, more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14d0afcd270694f32fcb0aecc6e0dfa907fd48c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14d0afcd270694f32fcb0aecc6e0dfa907fd48c8/277_449_4053_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working in Bahrain \u2018opened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim,\u2019 says Janmohamed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working in Bahrain \u2018opened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim,\u2019 says Janmohamed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the <a href=\"http://next11.se/next-11-emerging-markets/\">11 countries expected to join the world\u2019s largest economies this century</a>, six have overwhelmingly Muslim populations and two have big Muslim minorities. <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/21/by-2050-india-to-have-worlds-largest-populations-of-hindus-and-muslims/\">By 2050, India will have the largest Muslim population in the world</a>, at an estimated 311 million, although they will still be a minority among the country\u2019s vast numbers. Muslim minorities in Britain, Europe and North America are young, affluent and growing. One-third of all Muslims are under the age of 15, and two-thirds under 30.</p> <p>The Muslim middle class is expected to triple to 900 million by 2030, driving consumption as well as social and political change. Their spending power is enormous: the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Khidr/thomson-reuters-state-of-global-islamic-economy-201516-report-53540682\">most recent State of the Global Islamic Economy Report</a> forecasts the halal food and lifestyle industry to be worth $2.6tn by the end of this decade, and Islamic finance is on a similar trajectory. Muslim travel could be worth $233bn. In 2014, Muslim fashion was estimated to be worth $230bn, and $54bn was spent on Muslim cosmetics.</p> <p>\u201cThrough their sheer numbers, their growing middle-class stature, the shift of economic and political power towards the Middle East and Asia, home to most of the world\u2019s Muslims, through the Muslim minorities that act as influential and well-connected leaders, by the inspirational force of their faith and their refusal to accept the status quo, Generation M are determined to make change. And what a change it\u2019s going to be,\u201d writes Janmohamed.</p> <p>She charts the beginnings of this change. The demand for halal (permitted) products has been the impetus for growth in a range of businesses, such as food, fashion, cosmetics and travel. Among dozens of entrepreneurs cited in the book are the Radwan family, who started an organic halal farm in Oxfordshire; the producers of non-alcoholic beer \u2013 a sector that grew 80% in the five years to 2012, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/08/economist-explains-3\">according to the Economist</a>; Shazia Saleem, who launched <a href=\"http://www.ieatfoods.com/\">ieat</a>, a range of halal ready-meals including shepherd\u2019s pie and lasagne, which are now sold at Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco; and \u201ca whole new Muslim fashion industry\u201d, incorporating online retailers, video bloggers, catwalk shows and haute couture.</p> <p>But Generation M, according to the book, wants to go beyond halal to <em>tayyab</em>, which roughly translates as \u201cethical and wholesome\u201d. They want the entire supply chain of production and consumption to have integrity. \u201cResources must be properly respected, workers in primary industries must not be exploited. Sustainability and renewability are part of the Islamic idea of \u2018stewardship of the Earth\u2019, which Generation M eco-Muslims \u2026 are championing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a43c0ccbd73444b46109717649cf96476960080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a43c0ccbd73444b46109717649cf96476960080/28_104_3433_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lutfi Radwan with his family on his organic halal farm near Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lutfi Radwan with his family on his organic halal farm near Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Janmohamed, this Muslim millennial generation has been shaped by two monumental factors. One is the events of the past 15 years, since 9/11, and the global response to Islamic extremism and terrorism; the other is the internet, described in the book as \u201cthe glue that binds [Generation M] together and creates the critical mass that turns them into a globally influential force\u201d.</p> <p>The internet has also, she tells me, \u201cgiven space for [traditionally] marginalised voices within the community \u2013 younger Muslims and women \u2013 to express their views\u201d.</p> <p>Among those views are frustration and resentment at being defined by their hijabs or being told they are oppressed by their faith. Janmohamed quotes Azra, 20: \u201cI\u2019m a young Muslim woman. I am not oppressed by my hijab, I\u2019m liberated by it. If you don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s completely fine, you don\u2019t need to \u2026 The emotion you\u2019re seeing in my eyes is not a plea to \u2018help me\u2019 but one for you to take your self-righteous bullshit and shove it up your arse.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/31/why-we-wear-the-burkini-five-women-on-dressing-modestly-at-the-beach\">Why we wear the burkini: five women on dressing modestly at the beach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than being downtrodden and subjugated, Muslim women are experiencing increasing empowerment in education, employment, public life, marriage and childbearing, says Janmohamed. \u201cIf we were to pick a face that captures the global pace of change, it would most likely be a Muslim woman \u2013 she is part of the largest population, in nations where change is happening fastest, and in the segment where change is most potent. In short, Muslim women are where it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Although beyond the cusp of Generation M at 42, Janmohamed in many ways embodies the young Muslim woman she describes.</p> <p>She was born in London to immigrant parents who arrived in the UK with a suitcase and \u00a375 in cash, and she went to a school at which there were few non-white faces. \u201cReligion was important in our family \u2013 I remember my parents praying and fasting, going to the mosque was extremely regular; the Muslim community they were part of was the foundation of the family\u2019s social life. But at school, I spent my time hiding my hennaed hands, not telling people I was eating curry at home, being very shy about being Muslim.\u201d</p> <p>Only when she went to Oxford did she start to wear a headscarf. \u201cI found university a liberating experience. I got to explore who I was, and part of that was my Muslim identity, which had been very suppressed at school.\u201d</p> <p>After university, she joined a graduate trainee scheme in marketing, and later spent a year working in Bahrain, which \u201copened my eyes to the global experience of being Muslim\u201d. She returned to the UK shortly before 9/11, and following the London bombings in July 2005, began writing a blog \u201ctalking about what it\u2019s like to be British and Muslim and a woman. It felt like that conversation, about someone who straddles different heritages and feels comfortable in all of them, just wasn\u2019t being heard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3621ac425ff9a27ee32d7e1d0b0a6560159e8fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3621ac425ff9a27ee32d7e1d0b0a6560159e8fb4/915_1039_6300_3779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A catwalk show at the Saverah expo in London this year \u2013 a fashion, lifestyle and networking event billed as Muslim women\u2019s \u2018ultimate day out\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A catwalk show at the Saverah expo in London this year \u2013 a fashion, lifestyle and networking event billed as Muslim women\u2019s \u2018ultimate day out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blog led to a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Headscarf-Muslim-Woman-Seeks/dp/1845135490\">Love in a Headscarf</a>, published in 2009, about her 10-year quest for love via the route of a traditional arranged marriage. Janmohamed was headhunted to help launch <a href=\"http://www.ogilvynoor.com/\">Ogilvy Noor</a>, a division of advertising and marketing agency <a href=\"https://ogilvy.co.uk/\">Ogilvy &amp; Mather</a>, which advises brands on engaging with Muslim consumers.</p> <p>Ogilvy hired her when she was eight months pregnant with her first child, and Generation M was largely written during her second pregnancy and since the birth of her younger daughter 18 months ago. In the book\u2019s dedication, Janmohamed writes: \u201cTo my girls. Because you can do anything. Take it from Mummy.\u201d</p> <p>Generation M, she says, has high aspirations. \u201cThey want to be astronauts, you\u2019ve got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/ibtihaj-muhammad-fencing-olympics-2016-bronze\">fencers at the Olympics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zahra-lari-figure-skating-olympics_us_5706817ae4b0b90ac27169e7\">ice skaters going to the Winter Olympics</a>, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/royal-brunei-airlines-first-all-female-flight-deck-crew-lands-plane-in-saudi-arabia-where-women-are-a6931726.html\">female air crew for Brunei airways</a> \u2013 these are young people who are really battling the fact that they have aspirations that should be unfettered versus a reality that is trying to confine them to a particular box.\u201d</p> <p>But, she acknowledges, not all young Muslims are Generation M. Inclusion does not depend on disposable income or level of education, but sharing the characteristics of faith and modernity. \u201cTheir counterparts might be called the Traditionalists \u2026 more socially conservative, believing in maintaining harmony, more deference to authority and, as their name suggests, trying to hold firmly on to what they see as the good elements of family, community and tradition,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>And a few young Muslims, of course, become radicalised, hijacking Islam for violent extremism and hatred, the polar opposite of Generation M.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/14/international-modest-fashion-week-coverup\">Stylish cover-up: inside International Modest fashion week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I ask her who the book is aimed at. One of her goals was to offer a platform for Generation M, she replies, \u201cfor people to have their voices heard\u201d. \u201cSo there\u2019s a recognition of their own identity, a consolidation of who they are, how they talk to one another.\u201d</p> <p>Then, she adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a conversation for the wider Muslim community to have, to understand some of the dynamics that are happening within it, some of the challenges young Muslims are facing and how they can be resolved.\u201d</p> <p>But the book is also \u2013 and perhaps mainly \u2013 for a wider audience. \u201cPeople who work in business, politics, culture, development. The UK [Muslim] population is just shy of 3 million, the European population is 50 million and growing, there\u2019s a worldwide population of 1.6bn.

Muslims are saying: \u2018Hello, we\u2019ve got lots of money to spend, we\u2019re young, we\u2019re cool, please can you deal with us in the same way you deal with everyone else?\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Society%20%20social%20sciences/Society%20%20culture%20general/Cultural%20studies/Generation%20M.aspx?menuitem=%7B17B4B2FB-4BE9-4860-8B17-73C2D7F6AC68%7D\">Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World</a> by Shelina Janmohamed is published 6 September by IB Taurus.</em></p>",
  "<p>Elon Musk\u2019s solar company has its sights set on replacing 5m rooftops in the US with traditional roofing materials integrated with solar cell technology.<br></p> <p>SolarCity\u2019s plans, announced last month, to develop traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/19/elon-musk-tesla-solar-panel-roofs-solarcity\">roofs made entirely from solar panels</a> are part of a goal to make sustainable homes more aesthetically appealing, convenient, and ultimately affordable to the average homeowner. It\u2019s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company\u2019s solar cell option because it won\u2019t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home.</p> <p>In an August conference call with investors, company chairman Elon Musk said people are forced to postpone solar adoption when they know a roof replacement is imminent and that \u201cthere is a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity.\u201d He added that the company\u2019s solar cell roofing \u201clooks way better\u201d and \u201clasts far longer than a normal roof\u201d.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57b2c62590d360aa449ff994b561b477d87b32ab/0_0_4148_2761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk, chairman of SolarCity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rashid Umar Abbasi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By integrating a SolarCity roof with Tesla battery packs, it believes those homes could operate on solar power 24-hours a day. The lingering question, however, is whether mainstream homeowners will be able to afford that initial investment.<br></p> <p>A SolarCity representative was tightlipped on costs, saying they could not share details about the product at this time. </p> <p>Some industry players doubt the product can be affordable to most homeowners. Previous versions of photovoltaic roofs \u2013 also called \u201csolar shingles\u201d \u2013 have cost <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.seac.cc/fileadmin/seac/user/doc/SEAC-SUPSI_report_2015_-_BIPV_product_overview_for_solar_facades_and_roofs_1_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to a third more than traditional solar panels</a>, were less efficient, and were far more pricey to install.</p> <p>\u201cWhat [the company is] talking about is a paradigm shift, not just a small leap,\u201d says Scott Franklin, owner of Lumos Solar, which specialises in solar panel architecture and design. \u201cSolarCity is known for being a low-cost, fast installer. Now they\u2019re talking about developing an entirely new product and becoming roofers? In terms of cost, they\u2019re going from selling solar leases to telling somebody they have to replace an entire roof. That\u2019s a dramatic cost difference.\u201d<br></p> <p>In 2009, US multinational Dow Chemical began developing solar shingles. Yet at a price of more than $20,000 per roof, the technology <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/dow-chemical-sheds-solar-shingle-business\" rel=\"nofollow\">was not commercially viable</a> and Dow discontinued the product in June 2016. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the battle \u2013 the cost factor,\u201d says Bill Ellard, an economist for the American Solar Energy Society. \u201cBut if SolarCity works with some of the major homebuilders and they can invent their own systems, I think there\u2019s a play there.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But even if it succeeds in creating an affordable product, can SolarCity match the success of other eco-home innovations?<br></p> <p>Smart home devices such as Google\u2019s Nest thermostat are more affordable, and going down in cost each year. Thermostats and energy monitoring systems have taken off in recent years in part because they allow homeowners to cut energy use without changing their behaviour.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57cb9d397b43071d7bb0068fe14fa9840669c19e/0_0_2610_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s Nest thermostat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s Nest thermostat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHomeowners don\u2019t want to think about efficiency; they want it just taken care of,\u201d says John Quale, a sustainable home design professor at the University of New Mexico. \u201cWe are not great about closing curtains or opening windows when we should. That\u2019s why technologies that do things for us are so appealing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Brian Abramson, cofounder of sustainable homebuilder Method Homes in Seattle, Washington, says smart home technology is becoming more mainstream, lower cost, and accessible. \u201cWe probably do Nest thermostats and basic lighting control on 80% of our houses; a couple of years ago there weren\u2019t any smart thermostats, and lighting control was only in 20% of our homes.\u201d<br></p> <p>Success in the residential solar market, by contrast, is heavily dependent on friendly government policies, a model that has proved challenging when tax incentives threaten to expire, or when monopoly utility companies are allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada\">change</a> the way they reimburse solar panel owners for energy put into the grid. <br></p> <p>By entering the home roofing market, SolarCity is also tacitly acknowledging that aesthetic concerns also hinder solar panel adoption. <br></p> <p>\u201cAesthetics are a big deal,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cThe first wave of solar adoption was driven by economics or environmental concerns. Now people are already past the \u2018I think it\u2019s a good idea\u2019 phase. They want to do it, but it has to look good and add to the value of a home rather than just be a bolted on addition.\u201d<br></p> <p>The company\u2019s announcement that it will unveil its solar cell roof \u201cin the coming months\u201d followed news that Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/elon-musk-sells-solar-power-company-solarcity-to-tesla-motors\">will acquire SolarCity as part of a master plan</a> to integrate the solar panel company with Telsa battery products. That marriage between power production and storage could be the difference <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/A-Note-to-Elon-Musk-And-The-Brothers-Rive-on-The-Integrated-Solar-Roof\" rel=\"nofollow\">between failures of the past</a> and what Musk hopes to achieve, Quale says.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the aspirations of Tesla and SolarCity, they have huge potential. Elon Musk is really talking about getting to the masses, and those companies could very well be an important driver in reducing costs,\u201d he says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe conventional glass panel arrays have come down substantially in cost in the last five years and there\u2019s no reason to think these roofing materials couldn\u2019t fall into that as well.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<h2><strong>BEST FOR AUTUMN SUN: CADIZ</strong></h2> <p>The old town poking into the Atlantic like a finger is (famously, photogenically, obviously) ancient, but thanks in part to entrepreneurial <em>Gaditanos</em> (Cadiz natives) returning home after the crisis, the place has an invigorating, youthful, playful spirit and some cute retro bars. It may be synonymous with waves of cruise-ship daytrippers, but you don\u2019t have to arrive by boat: Seville and Jerez airports are 1\u00bd hours and 40 minutes\u2019 drive away respectively, and it linked by rail as well.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>A flurry of inventive gastronomic activity has earned Cadiz a place among Rick Stein\u2019s latest Long Weekend destinations.

Yes, there are the usual oysters, and squid with seaweed salad, but also spicy <em>patatas bravas</em> (\u20ac3.75), butter-soft <em>chicharrones</em> or scratchings (from \u20ac5) and a <em>guiso</em> (stew) of the day (\u20ac6.80).</p> <h2>Where to drink</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6778d96058fa5bb3bf9778968b33cadac2216f91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6778d96058fa5bb3bf9778968b33cadac2216f91/0_92_1129_823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taberna la Sorpresa, Cadiz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taberna la Sorpresa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cadiz is in the middle of the sherry triangle, so <em>finos</em>, <em>olorosos</em> and other nectars from El Puerto, Sanl\u00facar and Jerez fill the barrels and bottles on dusty shelves in dark bars and wine shops in the old town\u2019s narrow streets. <a href=\"http://www.lamanzanilladecadiz.com/\">Taberna la Manzanilla</a> has the air of an apothecary; drinking here is an initially daunting, though ultimately pleasant business.

Accommodation is in hammocks (from \u20ac10 with breakfast), dorms (from \u20ac18) and private doubles (from \u20ac39). Even closer to the great baroque landmark is <a href=\"http://hotellacatedral.com/\">Hotel La Cathedral</a> (doubles from \u20ac88 B&amp;B).

It\u2019s also the beating heart of Finland\u2019s legendary design scene \u2013 and with careful planning it needn\u2019t be extortionately expensive. A visit to the home of famed architect and designer <a href=\"http://www.alvaraalto.fi/aaltohouse.htm\">Alvar Aalto\u2019s</a> offers a crash course on his architecture and the Finnish lifestyle in general.

Recently the B-Smokery restaurant expanded and opened a cosy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bsideHKI/\">B-Side Bar</a>, the perfect place to start the evening, with a changing selection of beers and all sorts of American whiskeys.

Luckily for budget travellers, Airbnb offers over 2,000 rooms and apartments at average of 50\u20ac a night. High living standards mean you\u2019ll find lots of nicely decorated places. To stay in a unique historical setting, the <a href=\"http://www.hostelhelsinki.fi/en/services/hostel/\">Hostel Suomenlinna</a> (dorm beds \u20ac24, doubles from \u20ac65) is a former Russian schoolhouse on the world heritage island of the same name, a 15-minute ferry ride (\u20ac3,50) from the main market square. In this clifftop setting in the south-west corner of the island, it is hard to remember you are in a capital city.<br></p> <h2><strong>If you do just one thing</strong> \u2026</h2> <p>Visit a sauna. Before modern bathrooms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/28/finland-helsinki-lapland-health-spa-sauna\">neighbourhood saunas were the way to keep clean in Finland</a>. There are still a few original saunas left, and lately several new public saunas have opened. A real gem is <a href=\"http://kulttuurisauna.fi/\">Kulttuurisauna</a> (\u20ac15).

When you tell people you live here, the response is immediate: \u201c<em>Parma, che bella!</em>\u201d. Then they\u2019ll tell you that the Parmigiani are aloof and unfriendly. The city is compact and easy to navigate by foot, and you can travel further afield by bike or on the reliable, cheap bus network. A tour of the historic centre \u2013 starting with the duomo, baptistry, and painted ceiling at San Paolo convent, then heading over the river via Palazzo della Pilotta to the Palazzo Ducale \u2013 is fascinating and not too demanding.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d9e2afa7b564239dd6b28a8e510a1b267064811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d9e2afa7b564239dd6b28a8e510a1b267064811/0_73_5119_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The platter of tiny meats \u2026 a plate of salumi di Parma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The platter of tiny meats \u2026 a plate of salumi di Parma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether it\u2019s prosciutto, pasta or parmesan cheese, this city is defined by its food. Even the United Nations says so \u2013 last year Unesco declared Parma a Creative City of Gastronomy. Yes, you can find gourmet burgers, sushi bars and street food \u2013 but Parma is not really cut out for food fads. The best way to see how food is celebrated here is to visit one of the <em>sagre</em> (festivals) that take place all year round. <a href=\"http://www.golagolafestival.it/\">Gola! Gola!</a>, a slickly organised event with TV chefs and celebrity authors, launched in June this year on the back of the Unesco stamp, and is likely to become an annual fixture. In autumn the action moves beyond the city to the <a href=\"http://www.festivaldelprosciuttodiparma.com/programma/\">prosciutto festival</a>, the<a href=\"http://www.fieradialbareto.it/la-fiera/programma/\"> mushroom festivals in the nearby Val di Taro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tartufonerofragno.it/\">black truffle month</a> in Calestano and <a href=\"http://novemberporc.it/it-IT/home-page.aspx\">November Porc</a>, four weekends of pigging out in the <a href=\"http://www.consorziodelculatellodizibello.it/index_eng.html\"><em>culatello</em> towns</a> along the river Po. Most can be reached easily by bus or train for a handful of euros. If you don\u2019t have time for an excursion, join the queue of students and office workers for a blow-out sandwich at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/clinicadelpanino/\">Walter Clinica del Panino </a>or the legendary <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pep%C3%A8n-Official-1394613000797861/\">Pepen</a>, both a few metres from the central Piazza Garibaldi. Another \u20ac20 will get you a plate of <em>salumi di Parma</em> (cured ham, cooked shoulder of pork, salame, pancetta, lardo\u2026) followed by fresh tortelli (pasta stuffed with squash or chard) at <a href=\"http://www.trattoriacorrieri.it/\">Trattoria Corrieri</a> or <a href=\"http://www.osteriadellozingaro.it/\">Osteria dello Zingaro</a>. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Trattoria-DA-Antonia-253596378057641/\">Da Antonia</a>, a 10-minute walk from the centre, is one of the few surviving traditional workers\u2019 <em>trattorie</em>. Always packed and with a great atmosphere, it\u2019s only open at lunchtimes and serves fresh, affordable (\u20ac15-20) three-course meals. And of course, if in doubt, roll it out: the best pizzeria in town, <a href=\"http://www.pizzeriaorfeo.it/\">Orfeo</a> does a simple but delicious thin-crust pizza of tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala with prosciutto crudo (\u20ac8).</p> <h2>Where to drink</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b13745387864e4f5a75ab10d7ea88b86af5871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b13745387864e4f5a75ab10d7ea88b86af5871/0_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bastian Contrario, Parma\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bastian Contrario.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Perotti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At some point in the recent past the Italians started drinking beer. Then they started making it. Now it seems they can\u2019t stop doing either.

And there are now several decent bars in which to drink their products, mostly west of the river in the Oltretorrente, where <a href=\"http://www.birreriavecchiemaniere.it/\">Vecchie Maniere</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bastiancontrarioparma.it/\">Bastian Contrario</a> lead the way.</p> <p>For a decent spritz Campari (Aperol?

Then there is lambrusco. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/lambrusco-uk-wine-review-fiona-beckett\">rebirth of the fizzy red</a> is not big news any more, but if you want to see where the revolution was hatched, Parma is a short bike ride from the organic vineyards of <a href=\"http://www.camillodonati.it/index.php?filosofia\">Camillo Donati</a> and Azienda <a href=\"http://www.quarticello.it/en/\">Quarticello</a>, where they will sell you a bottle for \u20ac6-\u20ac7.</p> <h2>Where to stay</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.hotel-torino.it/\">Hotel Torino</a> is bang in the centre with doubles from around \u20ac90.

But there\u2019s a vibrant \u201calternative\u201d scene behind its conservative facade. The Reeperbahn is its infamous party and red light district, but just a few streets away is a rich bistro and street food scene as well as cool cafes, bars and clubs. Dig further and there are lots of hip hangouts such as the occupied former theatre Rote Flora in the Sternschanze district, the artists\u2019 quarter <a href=\"http://das-gaengeviertel.info/\">G\u00e4ngeviertel</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.pudel.com/\">Golden Pudel Club</a> (pudel.com), recently resurrected after a fire.</p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p>Hamburg is still Germany\u2019s most important port, and with international trade have come international cuisines. Try the Indian bistro Badshah (Bremer Reihe 24, no website) in colourful St Georg. It\u2019s not romantic, but the paneer and lentil curry is a must (\u20ac6.50). Din Hau, on the other side of Hamburg\u2019s main station, is a simple place, but serves possibly the best Cantonese roasted duck you\u2019ll ever taste (\u20ac8.50). For street food, brothers Koral and Onur Elci opened <a href=\"http://www.focacceria-bonassola.com/\">Focacceria Bonassola</a> earlier this year close to Altona station\u2013 just looking at the golden foccacia with spinach, gorgonzola or spicy<em> salsiccia</em> is a sensual experience.</p> <h2>Where to drink</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46e793e0b5bd4e8daca66b592dec245fabc437f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46e793e0b5bd4e8daca66b592dec245fabc437f3/0_0_1486_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockers bar HAMBURG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockers bar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: clockers Bar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The practice of \u201ccornering\u201d has been around for a couple of summers now: crowds gather by kiosks or in front of bars to start the night off by downing a \u20ac1.50 beer. Try the Tabakb\u00f6rse kiosk in Sternschanze. If the weather\u2019s bad, the streets between Sternschanze and St Pauli are full of great bars, such as the <a href=\"http://thewalrusbar.de/\">Walrus Bar</a>) or <a href=\"http://www.clockers.hamburg/\">Clockers</a>, a tiny gin bar that has a tree growing in the middle and moss on the walls, and produces its own spirits.

  "<p>I\u2019m sorry. The thing is that you stared at me a little bit too long. I have grown used to people staring at me, but not as long as you stared. It was Sunday morning. I was the woman behind you in the queue for the photo machine. I was the one wearing the headscarf. It seemed to catch your attention as you stared at it for some time. Unflinchingly.</p> <p>I was the one who looked at the floor, waiting and waiting for you to stop. But you carried on staring. I had no choice but to speak.</p> <p>I asked you, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>No. Let\u2019s be honest. I shouted it at&#xa0;you.</p> <p>It was instinctive and angry. It sounded alien. I\u2019m afraid I had no choice on the delivery. It served its purpose as it jolted you out of staring at me. You didn\u2019t answer. You just turned and left.</p> <p>I left too, with a bag of shopping, a lump in my throat, a red face and a racing, embarrassed heart. And then I cried. Not because of you, Tesco lady \u2013 you didn\u2019t make me cry. <em>It</em> made me cry. The <em>what</em> made me cry.</p> <p>I have grown used to wearing a headscarf, as have my astonishing family and friends, the parents, teachers and children in the playground. My milkman doesn\u2019t look surprised when he sees me. Neither does the lovely man in the shop I visit every morning. And everyone at work? Well. After the initial shock of seeing me in my headscarf for the first time and once they understood that I wasn\u2019t dying, that it was alopecia, they have all been tremendous.</p> <p>Most importantly, my daughters don\u2019t even see it any more. In fact, a lot of my youngest child\u2019s teddies now have headscarves too. Her choice, her game, her way of normalising \u2026</p> <p>But gosh, I think it might be quite nice to be you. Refreshing almost. Not paying attention to social graces, not adhering to what you \u201cshould\u201d do or how you \u201cshould\u201d behave. How does that feel? Because I feel exhausted a lot of the time, what with all the respecting and observing of other people\u2019s feelings and emotions. That can be tiring.</p> <p>But this reflection back to when I met you has got me thinking \u2013 what if I hadn\u2019t shouted? Would you have carried on staring?</p> <p>What you could have done was walk away and say to your companion, \u201cPoor girl\u201d, which is a favourite reaction to me. That and the side-cock of the head manoeuvre with sad eyes, swiftly followed by the obligatory, \u201cHow <em>are</em> you?\u201d I have grown accustomed to responding appropriately: a deep breath in and out as I hear \u201cPoor girl\u201d and a bright and breezy \u201cI\u2019m fine! Great, in fact! How are <em>you</em>?\u201d</p> <p>So, I am sorry. I was rude to shout but it was my anger. My anger with my alopecia. And that isn\u2019t pretty. It isn\u2019t pink, yellow or sparkly silver. It is black, bleak and ice cold. It is the inebriated, unwelcome, uncontrollable guest at a dinner party. It can suddenly rise dormant from the bottom of the ocean into a tidal wave without warning. But it can be fought. With forgiveness. With pity. With acceptance of a situation you can do absolutely nothing about as much as you want to with every single inch of your being.</p> <p>Tesco lady. I forgive you for staring at me. I hope you forgive me for shouting. But next time you see someone who looks a little bit out of the ordinary (which I know I do but I\u2019m trying so hard to rock the headscarf look every single day) maybe give this a go. Don\u2019t stare. And maybe have the thought that you have no clue what is going on in someone\u2019s life. As my mum taught me, it\u2019s rude to stare.</p> <p>And me? Well, I would do well to remember this Buddhist saying: \u201cHolding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else \u2013 you are the one who gets burned.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kirstie Smith</em></p>",

A man on a tractor in a nearby field answered Paul\u2019s inquiry by pulling a card out of his top pocket \u2013 he was the secretary of the Kildale cricket club.</p> <p>Thirty two years later, the Millfields families who made that first week-long tour playing village teams in and around the Eskdale valley near Whitby are still going there every July. That first tour was great for the cricketers, playing six games on the trot. But for the children, it was no exaggeration to say it was life changing. From the restrictions of their confined London lives, they couldn\u2019t believe they were allowed to run by themselves up the green lanes and to stay up impossibly late in pub gardens after post-match drinks and meals.</p> <p>They made friends among themselves \u2013 playing on the boundary, exploring each other\u2019s accommodation, the woods and moors, and, above all, the seaside at Whitby.</p> <p>The children looked forward to renewing their Yorkshire friendships each year and it was remarkable how they always immediately rekindled their once-a-year friendships.</p> <p>At the end of each tour, tears were shed and throughout each winter next year\u2019s \u201cYorkshire\u201d yearned for. Families grew, more children came along, some moved to other parts of the country but continued the yearly meet-up, some drifted away, and some families dissolved. Some of the original players have been given out by the great umpire in the sky.</p> <p>The tour helped to save and enhance a separated dad\u2019s relationship with his daughter, fighting through the family courts to establish the tour as a regular holiday. Her Yorkshire \u201cfamily\u201d became a regular part of her life.</p> <p>Now she goes with her partner and her own two small daughters, who, in their turn, are beginning to understand the excitement of playing with a gang of new friends, racing around in the freedom of the moors and dales, and a motley crew of friendly adults.</p> <p>Generations of cricketers have come and gone \u2013 the village hosts generously taking time off work to play, providing lavish Yorkshire teas and having a drink after the game.</p> <p>The key Millfields players now are the babies and toddlers who slept in tiny sleeping bags around the dining room floor at the last-night dinner on that first tour, and some who were not even born. This cricket tour has given a generation of young adults a network of friends and an extended family that now stretches across the country.</p> <p><em>Andrew Broadbent</em></p> <h2>Playlist: A biblical story \u2026 set along the Tyne</h2> <p><strong>You Belong to Me</strong></p> <p>\u201c<em>See the pyramids along the Nile / Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle /</em> <em>Just remember darling all the while / You belong to me\u201d</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/36544415\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/36544415\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Bob Dylan\u2019s You Belong to Me.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was years before I found out the name of this song. I first remember hearing it when I was about four. Dad picked me up from nursery and took me to the wholesalers in his butcher\u2019s van. It was winter, pouring with rain and pitch black. Dad sang all the way. He was singing as we crossed the bridge over the River Tyne into Newcastle.</p> <p>I felt so cosy, safe and loved there with him in the van as he sang.</p> <p>A few days later, at nursery, we heard the story of Moses and had to do a drawing of the story. I settled down to work. I drew the picture of Moses in a basket, hidden in the bullrushes by the Nile with \u2013 in the background \u2013 the iconic Tyne Bridge which, in my child\u2019s mind, were the pyramids along the Nile. My teacher asked about the picture and I explained that I had crossed the Nile with my dad in the van, a couple of days before.</p> <p>Dad also sang this song as we drove to my wedding and when he died I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head at his funeral: \u201c<em>Fly the ocean in a silver plane / See the jungle when it\u2019s wet with rain /Just remember till you\u2019re home again / Or until I come home to you / You belong to me.</em>\u201d</p> <p><em>Julie Leitheiser</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: Rhubarb Crunch pudding</h2> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><em>100g self-raising flour</em><br><em>150g porridge oats</em><br><em>200g brown sugar </em><br><em>125g butter or margarine </em><br><em>Ground cinnamon</em><br><em>500g stewed rhubarb that has been allowed to cool</em></p> <p>Butter a 24cm flan dish.

It is a great favourite with my family, especially in the summer when rhubarb is plentiful. The recipe dates back to my school days when I was 11 or 12 and is written in a small blue exercise book in large, neat joined-up writing.</p> <p>It was the mid 60s and I was a day girl at a convent school in Surrey. I had a two-hour journey from our dormitory town, involving a bus, a steam train and then a mile walk at the other end.</p> <p>My father grew prodigious amounts of rhubarb at the bottom of our garden. After he had cut the rhubarb with sharp ivory-handled knife, we would wear the giant leaves perched on our heads and parade round the garden.</p> <p>I can picture myself, too, in my brown school uniform, with pig tails and beret, carrying sticks of rhubarb to school wrapped in newspaper. Returning at the end of the day by train, I carefully balanced the pudding I had made in a bag on my knee. I remember having to quickly shield the open bag because when we went through a tunnel, the sulphurous steam came in through the permanently open windows. It was a great relief when I managed to get home with my cooking intact, ready to be enjoyed by my family for tea.</p> <p><em>Bridget Hall </em></p> <h2>We\u2019d love to hear your stories<br></h2> <p>We will pay \u00a325 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.

  "<p>When Vashti Seth first learned that her father had left her \u00a32,000 with instructions to \u201cdo something good with it\u201d, she was too lost in grief to give it much thought.</p> <p>Johnny Richards had been diagnosed with lung cancer just 11 weeks earlier \u2013 and initially given between a year and 18 months to live. He lived in New South Wales and Vashti was based in Bristol so she\u2019d left her job in film production, rented her house out and bought a one-way ticket to Australia to spend as much time with him as possible. \u201cI thought we\u2019d have at least a year together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had just five weeks until he died.\u201d</p> <p>Those weeks were spent at her father\u2019s home with his partner and her six siblings. \u201cThe main message he wanted to put across to us all was not living too much in the future and not in the past \u2013 you just have to enjoy what you\u2019ve got right now. When he died, I was devastated, overwhelmed. I\u2019d packed my entire life up and was in a state of limbo.\u201d</p> <p>The sum left to her in his will, with a note her father had written shortly after his diagnosis \u2013 only added to her confusion. \u201cDad had left my siblings personal gifts,\u201d says Vashti. \u201cOne got a ring that Dad always wore, another a little emerald Buddha. When I read Dad\u2019s message \u2013 to do \u2018something good\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, or what to do with it. I just put it to the back of my mind.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, her father planted a seed \u2013 and sent his daughter on a journey that started in India, led to Nepal and on to Africa. Vashti never returned to her former life or career \u2013 and instead invested the money to build the UK\u2019s first peer-to-peer crowdfunding charity. Eight years on, <a href=\"http://www.deki.org.uk/\" title=\"\">deki.org.uk</a> has lent over \u00a3800,000 to people in the developing world.</p> <p>Her father would have relished the adventure. Born into a working-class family, Johnny Richards was a free spirit, who managed to travel the world, have seven children with three partners \u2013 and remain extraordinarily close to all of them.</p> <p>Vashti\u2019s upbringing was far from conventional. She spent her early years in west Wales with her father, mother, older brother, Kite, and half-sister Britt. Before Vashti was born, her parents had gone to India to study Buddhism then returned to Wales and built a wooden hexagonal house in which to raise a family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"beeb6eda0f62f50e3d9a64e5fda6c285ab1825e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beeb6eda0f62f50e3d9a64e5fda6c285ab1825e4/45_276_980_1224/801.jpg\" alt=\"Vashti as a baby with her parents, Johnny and Xxxx, and her siblings.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vashti as a baby with her parents, Johnny and Xxxx, and her siblings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Vashti Seth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Vashti was four, her parents separated and her father went to Australia, taking Kite. He settled half way between Brisbane and Sydney. He built two more houses (both hexagonal), founded a music festival, had another child with his partner, Bryony, and became stepfather to two more. At the time of his diagnosis in 2006, aged 57, he was building a boat to sail around the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe were never like most families \u2013 or even like separated ones where you see your dad every other weekend and Wednesday nights,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a lot of flow between the UK and Australia. We\u2019d go back and forth. I went to school there for a bit too. There were lots of us, and lots of parents involved \u2013 but none were at war. The most important thing was for everyone to love each other. They were hippies, basically.</p> <p>\u201cDad was very charismatic, he had loads of energy. He played drums and was always in bands, going to gigs, then as I got older, he was very into sailing. He had a boat and twice I went sailing on six-week trips \u2013 we all loved to go sailing with him. He taught me how to navigate. We spent a lot of time doing amazing things \u2013 and we also talked about life and what a \u2018good life\u2019 is. Dad believed in living a full life, in following your passions and not being constricted by what society thinks you should do. We had so many conversations about the right way to be.\u201d</p> <p>Now Vashti wonders if her dad saw in her a kindred spirit. While her siblings had all settled close to him in Australia, she was always restless. Having left school at 16, she travelled across Europe, south-east Asia and Australia before working her way up in the film industry, producing commercials for clients such as Pepsi and Pizza Hut. \u201cMaybe Dad saw me as a bit of an adventurer, like he was,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knew I had a passion for travel \u2013 maybe he left me that money and that message because he thought I\u2019d take it on as a project.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Instead of making people dependent on aid, you give them a loan and set them up to stand on their own two feet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If so, he was right. After Johnny\u2019s funeral, Vashti decided to go first to an orphanage in northern India to meet Deki Dolkha, a Tibetan refugee her father had sponsored as a child. \u201cDad had visited Deki twice and there were always letters and pictures going around,\u201d says Vashti. \u201cWhen I got there, she was 16 and had basic literacy. There were loads of girls in the same situation \u2013 they couldn\u2019t stay where they were and they expected to be sent off around India to work as maids. My dad had sponsored her to give her a better life, but she still had no opportunities. We had an amazing week \u2013 I took her on fairground rides, to the chemist and bought her toiletries. I took the shoes off my feet and handed them to her \u2013 but when I got back to Bristol, I wanted to do something that would really make a difference. Sending money felt so disempowering.\u201d</p> <p>Vashti began to read about micro-finance \u2013 back then, a relatively new concept. \u201cI knew it was the right way of doing it. Instead of making people dependent on aid, you give them a loan and set them up to stand on their own two feet. Everything fell into place. This was what I had to do with my life. I was going to set a charity up and help people like Deki.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, the University of the West of England added an \u00a38,000 grant to her dad\u2019s \u00a32,000 starter fund. The scheme began in Nepal, with Vashti\u2019s mother as the chair and trustee \u2013 in fact, it was her idea to name it Deki. In 2009, the first loan was made \u2013 \u00a350 to enable a tailor to buy a new sewing machine. \u201cBy then, I\u2019d got together with my husband and had a baby under one arm and a laptop on the other, so it was a very slow start.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Deki is a thriving charity that invites individuals to browse the site and lend as little as \u00a310 to their chosen entrepreneur. There\u2019s a mother of five with \u00a380 left to raise to expand her food business in Ghana, a father of four in Uganda who needs \u00a3400 to buy 10 cows \u2026 and many more. The site is inspirational to navigate and, once you do, it\u2019s impossible not to be drawn in.</p> <p>Just back from a whistle-stop tour of Ghana, Vashti has seen the difference Deki has made to communities. \u201cSeeing the impact of those loans was so overwhelming, so emotional. I cried \u2013 and I thought about my dad a lot too. Maybe he saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see but he was the catalyst. All my siblings have made Deki loans \u2013 and my mum is no longer a trustee so she\u2019s one of our top lenders. All the family think it\u2019s a great thing to have done \u2013 and they know it\u2019s something Dad would have felt strongly about.</p> <p>\u201cDad was a Buddhist \u2013 very much into reincarnation \u2013 so I hope he comes back as a free spirit! Whatever and wherever that might be we all know he\u2019d be very proud.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.deki.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>deki.org.uk</em></a></p>",

  "<p>My husband and I and our 7 month-old baby arrived in California last week for an extended stay. We are sharing parental leave and it\u2019s his turn to take over. My work happens to bring me back to my home state, so we are making the most of it, starting with a little holiday in the Napa Valley wine region. Driving here from the coast north of San Francisco, I am struck by the dry, golden grass-covered rolling hills. Most of the area we drive through is agricultural. We go by grazing beef cattle and dairy cows and chicken caravans for facilitating free-ranging before we pass olive groves and finally vineyards. All along the way, the wide open roads are lined with wild fennel with feathery leaves and asterisk-like yellow flowers filling the air with their heady anise scent.</p> <p>Wild fennel is really a weed \u2013transferred easily on shoes and hooves \u2013 that has invaded this area of California the same way it has invaded the British isles. Wild fennel can be found in Britain along waterways and hedges, and now is the time it shines. I have long loved what its flavour does when paired with wine, so it is reassuring to see the two growing alongside each other here in Napa. The fig is having a moment now too, and roasted figs in red wine with fennel tastes as good as it looks. I choose ripe black figs with deep ruby and yellow-flecked centres, then drown them in a red wine that I like to drink, finishing them with a constellation of bright sunny fennel pollen.</p> <p>Fig ice-cream is another of my favourites. Using a generous amount of fruit gives it that gooey gelato texture and the popping of the seeds is really satisfying. These recipes work together, so that you can make the roasted figs one day and serve them on their own with creme fraiche, or let them cool down and puree them up to be made into a delicious ice-cream. My favourite is to make them twice and serve warm roasted figs over the frozen figgy ice-cream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ead64fdc465aab4989894edb461620821f620923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead64fdc465aab4989894edb461620821f620923/0_130_6750_4050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild fennel and red wine roasted figs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ripe black figs, drowned in red wine and finished with a constellation of fennel pollen.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wild fennel and red wine roasted figs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br>10 ripe black figs<br>100g raspberries<br>150g red wine<br>50g caster sugar<br>2 fronds wild or cultivated fennel leaves<br>Honey<br>2-4 wild fennel heads full of yellowpollen</p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Select a ceramic or other heavy roasting dish that will hold the figs snugly \u2013 about 20cm in diameter.</p> <p><strong>2 </strong>Trim the tough tip of the stem on each fig, but try to maintain the lovely fig shape. Slice the figs in half through the tail and stem, then put in your baking dish, cut-side facing up. Scatter with the raspberries and pour over the red wine. Sprinkle evenly with caster sugar and gently lay the fennel fronds over the top. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the figs have puffed up and the wine has reduced a little. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>While the figs are still warm, drizzle with honey and sprinkle over the pollen from the heads of fennel, by gently pulling the flowers.

  "<p>The government adviser who recommended re-starting offshore processing in Nauru and Manus Island has <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/09/03/VFST_Statement_Nauru_Manus_1_September_2016.pdf\">urged ministers to abandon the policy</a> and bring refugees to Australia before more kill themselves.</p> <p>Paris Aristotle, who has advised successive governments on refugee policy, said if refugees were left on the two islands it was \u201chighly likely that many more men and women will express their despair by attempting to harm and kill themselves\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>Aristotle, the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.foundationhouse.org.au/\">Victorian foundation for survivors of torture</a>, said: \u201cWe also hold grave concerns that children and young people in Nauru will respond in the same ways,\u201d adding that neither PNG nor Nauru could offer refugees a safe long-term future.</p> <p>\u201cImproving conditions and services in PNG and Nauru will not prevent this [continuation of self-harm].</p> <p>\u201cAn effective and sustainable response must involve the option of resettlement in countries including Australia which offer the opportunity for refugees to become integral members of society, to live in security and to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of their new homes.\u201d</p> <p>Aristotle, along with Michael L\u2019Estrange, Sir Angus Houston, sat on the 2012 <a href=\"http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/files/2015/03/expert_panel_on_asylum_seekers_full_report.pdf\">Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers</a>, that recommended to the Gillard Labor government, along with 21 other recommendations, the re-opening of offshore detention camps on Nauru and Manus as part of \u201ccomprehensive regional network\u201d.</p> <p>However, many of the report\u2019s other key recommendations designed to complement offshore processing have not been implemented \u2013 including those to lift Australia\u2019s humanitarian intake to 27,000 (currently 13,750), and to pursue stronger co-operative agreements with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p> <p>In his current statement, Aristotle argued that the old defence of offshore processing \u2013 that it served as a deterrent to irregular boat journeys to Australia and thereby saved lives at sea in Australian waters \u2013 was no longer valid.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia, Indonesia and other nations have increased their capacity to respond to irregular migration,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure this can be sustainable we must also build a regional system based on established human rights principles, which aims to ensure that asylum seekers are protected properly in countries of first asylum or transit, are processed fairly, and, for those found to be refugees, are afforded timely settlement outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>However, Aristotle said, before a long-term regional resettlement framework could be established, the current abuses needed to be addressed.</p> <p>\u201cThe immediate imperative is that Australia acts swiftly to change the present policy settings that are inflicting serious harm.\u201d</p> <p>Australia\u2019s offshore processing camps on PNG\u2019s Manus Island and Nauru have come under sustained pressure almost since they were re-opened in 2012 over systemic abuses, violence (including the murder by guards of one asylum seeker, Reza Barati), sexual assault of women and children, and catastrophic rates mental illness, self-harm and suicide attempts.</p> <p>In April, Iranian refugee Omid Masoumali publicly doused himself in petrol and set himself alight on Nauru in protest at conditions. After critical delays in care and in moving him to a hospital off the island, he died in Brisbane.</p> <p>The camps have been condemned as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/18/australias-indefinite-detention-of-refugees-illegal-un-rules\">illegal, arbitrary and indefinite detention</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/un-refugee-agency-condemns-australias-offshore-detention-regime\">numerous arms of the United Nations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/nov/10/un-countries-line-up-to-criticise-australias-human-rights-record\">dozens of other national governments</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/stories/new-report-experts-reveal-alarming-impact-detention-children\">Australian Human Rights Commission</a>.</p> <p>Pressure has been particularly acute since the publication by The Guardian last month of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">the Nauru Files</a> - more than 2000 leaked incident reports from that island that detailed systemic abuses, sexual violence against women and children, almost-daily reports of self-harm, and a culture of impunity for perpetrators of abuse.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of those forcibly sent to Nauru and Manus have been found to be refugees, that is, they have a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d, are legally owed protection, and cannot be returned to their homeland.</p> <p>Of the men on Manus who have had their asylum claims assessed, <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1516/Quick_Guides/Offshore\">98% have been found to be refugees</a>.

  "<p>As the Festival of Dangerous Ideas kicked off at the Sydney Opera House on Saturday morning, the mood in the Utzon Room was decidedly bleak. A two-hour forum asking \u2018<a href=\"http://fodi.sydneyoperahouse.com/home/guardian-workshop-can-we-solve-the-asylum-seeker-crisis/\">Can we solve the asylum seeker problem?</a>\u2019, held by Guardian Live and supported by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers to mark the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/14/dear-australia-guardian-video-series\">Dear Australia video series</a> on refugees, was just getting started, and MC David Marr opened with something of a dampener on the room\u2019s enthusiasm.<br></p> <p>Citing <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/too-soft-or-too-tough-on-asylum-seekers-8\">a recent Essential poll</a>, which found that 60% of Australians believed the government was either \u201ctoo soft\u201d or \u201ctaking the right approach\u201d on asylum seekers, Marr said that when it came to refugee policy, it was time to concede that traditional approaches to enact progressive social change might not be enough.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be a journalist if I didn\u2019t think that reporting the truth doesn\u2019t lead to change \u2013 maybe not right away, or quickly, but eventually. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here, and frankly, it shakes my faith in what I do,\u201d Marr said. \u201cIt used to be that when the boats went away our fears died, but that\u2019s not the case anymore. The nation\u2019s attitudes are set fast: stuck at cruel. The press and politics have failed to budge public opinion, and the courts have failed as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2016/jul/14/dear-australia-guardian-video-series\">Dear Australia: a Guardian video series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was to the good, then, that the forum\u2019s focus was on new ideas and approaches, rather than the same old story. Instead of reciting the well-known litany of human rights abuses that defines contemporary refugee policy, the panellists on offer were tasked with presenting potential solutions to this notoriously knotty corner of Australian politics.</p> <p>While the legal and intellectual pedigree on offer wasn\u2019t in dispute, the panellists struggled at times to cut to the core of the problem. Familiar and well thought-out ideas on how to better treat asylum seekers abounded, but very few addressed their common obstacle \u2013 most Australians don\u2019t want to treat asylum seekers better. </p> <p>Jane McAdam, the director of the Andrew &amp; Renata Kaldor centre for international refugee law at the University of New South Wales and a research associate at Oxford\u2019s refugees studies centre, outlined what a principled asylum policy could look like. But when Marr pressed her on what would happen to a political party that proposed such a system, McAdam acknowledged that \u201cit would never get off the ground\u201d in the current environment. </p> <p>The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, Daniel Webb, maintained that \u201cslowly but surely, public opinion is shifting\u201d, and proposed framing refugees more as a potential economic asset rather than a humanitarian responsibility, opening the door for private sponsors and a reallocation of the skilled migration quota to include refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-are-raw-evidence-of-torture-can-we-look-away\">The Nauru files are raw evidence of torture.

If you get out on the ground, you\u2019ll actually move opinion. But it takes going out and talking to people, and not in a nice, self-selecting audience like you, who all probably read the Guardian,\u201d Gilbert said.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the second half of the forum that things really began to bubble. In another departure from the usual refugee policy talkfest, the audience was invited to put the panel\u2019s ideas to the test in facilitated workgroups, come up with potential solutions of their own, and present the ideas they had come up with themselves to the larger assembly. </p> <p>It was in this environment that new ideas began to emerge. One group, tasked with breaking the feedback loop between political leadership and popular opinion, proposed sophisticated, large-scale marketing campaigns and the delightful prospect of a \u201cRefugee Wants a Wife\u201d reality TV show to change refugees\u2019 public image. Another, eschewing the media entirely, flagged more direct proposals such as pressuring politicians to visit offshore centres themselves and speak face-to-face with the people they\u2019re detaining, or using virtual reality to give regular people an idea of what life on Nauru and Manus is like. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/cruelty-to-asylum-seekers-dressed-up-as-compassion-is-the-scandal-that-bedevils-australia\">Cruelty to asylum seekers dressed up as compassion is the scandal that bedevils Australia | Antony Loewenstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Representatives of Maurice Blackburn floated soliciting corporate sponsors to take on refugee work placements to give refugees a chance to live and work in the community, and Australians the opportunity to meet them first-hand. A fourth group came up with rebranding Australia Day as \u201cOpen Door Day\u201d and normalising the practice of experiencing a suburb you don\u2019t normally frequent, as a way of easing people\u2019s insecurities around multiculturalism.</p> <p>But the most well-received idea came at the end, and addressed the concerns Marr raised at the opening: commissioning research to actually understand how to change people\u2019s minds on a political issue. There was a common acknowledgement that unless the refugee movement stopped talking to itself about itself and reached people outside its own bubble, its capacity to bring about lasting change was limited.</p> <p>That, perhaps, was the most valuable thing to come out of the forum. The act of inviting people to actively contribute to the movement, rather than sit back and support the cause on social media, did more to excite attendees than the prospect of sitting through another speech from a refugee expert. If experiments such as these get similar receptions, David Marr may have less to despair about than he supposes.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cIf one thing positive came out of this trip\u201d, Danish MP Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen said in the final hours of her visit to Australia to learn about the country\u2019s immigration detention system, \u201cit was that again the world can see that in a country where critical eyes and ears are not allowed, it\u2019s obvious that something is being hidden\u201d.</p> <p>The carefully worded missive was Schmidt-Nielsen\u2019s parting shot as she and five parliamentary colleagues from across Denmark\u2019s political spectrum ended <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/30/danish-delegation-visit-to-nauru-australian-detention-centre-refused-visas\">their fact-finding mission on Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime.</a></p> <p>It didn\u2019t quite end up where the six had hoped.

That is not correct. We do not hold them there.\u201d</p> <p>Denmark has developed a particular interest in Australia\u2019s policies for asylum seekers. The last election witnessed the rise to prominence of the Danish People\u2019s party, a hard-right group that is aggressively against immigration, particularly Muslims. The conservative government in Denmark doesn\u2019t have a working majority. They\u2019re heavily reliant on the DPP and several smaller parties to retain power. </p> <p>And the DPP\u2019s views on immigration have had them encouraging the government and the public to turn to a place infamous for its hardline policies: Australia.</p> <p>So in secret, and without the knowledge of the Danish public, the 29-member parliamentary committee that examines immigration in Denmark began to discreetly make inquiries about visiting Australia and Nauru to understand how the offshore detention system worked.</p> <p>This was almost a year ago. Things appeared to be going smoothly, and Australia was incredibly welcoming. It was an opportunity to show the world that its policies were working, and were gathering interest globally.</p> <p>The Nauruan government had given every indication it was finalised and prepared. They had provided a formal program of their tour. It listed meetings with the secretary for multicultural affairs, Barina Waqa, and the deputy secretary for refugee status determination, Shyla Vohra. A formal tour was planned for the Regional Processing Centre, and a bus was organised to take them from site to site.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">when the Guardian reported on the Nauru files</a>, which highlighted devastating trauma and abuse inflicted on children held in offshore detention in the largest cache of leaked documents released from inside its immigration regime, there was renewed attention to the criticism of Australia\u2019s detention system. It coincided with the secret trip finally being disclosed last week by the Danish radio station <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.radio24syv.dk/udvalgte-nyhedshistorier/danske-politikere-skal-besoege-udskaeldt-australsk-flygtningelejr/\">Radio24syv</a>. It generated a wave of controversy over the cost of the visit and the broader secrecy around it. Australians may be used to secrets, but the Danish are not. The trip would no longer be a discreet one.</p> <p>The increasing attention on Nauru and Australia, and some of the comments from Schmidt-Nielsen and Mark, appear to have signalled a turnaround from the Nauruan government. Why they would do so at such a late stage remains a mystery.</p> <p>\u201cIt was unacceptable and anti-democratic and I suppose everyone in the delegation was really surprised,\u201d Schmidt-Nielsen said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want us to go you would assume they would have denied access before we came all the way to Australia.\u201d<br></p> <p>Although it was frustrating for them, the trip was far from fruitless for at least some members. The delegation did have the opportunity to speak with a large number of high-profile Australian immigration officials. They also met the assistant minister for immigration, Alex Hawke, as well as organisations such as Save the Children and the Australian Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>It gave them the opportunity to try to understand more about the relationship between Australia and Nauru, and how the system worked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detention</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still completely unclear for me who has actually got the legal responsibility for what is going on in Nauru,\u201d Schmidt-Nielsen said. \u201cIs it Australia? Is it the government of Nauru? Is it a shared responsibility, and if so what does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>It also gave them the opportunity to ask some tougher questions of the Australian officials.</p> <p>\u201cI asked about the Nauru files, several times. Every time the answer was \u2018all of the cases are being looked into and this is just a symptom of us having a really good reporting system\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cI said \u2018do you know of any cases where assault and child abuse were actually being investigated, someone being prosecuted?\u2019 And I have been asking that for a lot of time, and nobody has answered. One time when I asked, they said \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. That was the closest I got to an answer.\u201d</p> <p>Their responses were of equal surprise to Mark.</p> <p>\u201cYou can sit at one meeting and they will talk all about how much they care about children,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you ask if they know if children have been raped or abused on Nauru, \u2018do you know if anything has happened to the people who did it?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd then the government in Australia just says \u2018oh we don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It is unclear how much the Danish government will take on what the delegation learnt and saw in Australia for its own policies. In any case, while the parliamentary delegation was in Australia the Danish government made a surprise announcement; it would entirely cut the 500-person quota it placed on refugees for 2017. None would be resettled in Denmark next year.</p> <p>In a very short trip, the parliamentary delegation did see a rare glimpse of Australia\u2019s detention system \u2013 although perhaps not the one they hoped for.</p> <p>\u201cFor me it is just one big show,\u201d Mark said. \u201cA symbol to the world that says \u2018don\u2019t come here\u2019.\u201d</p>"
