  "<p>\u2018Abstract expressionism,\u201d wrote poet and curator <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/07/fast-company\" title=\"\">Frank O\u2019Hara</a>, \u201cis the art of serious men.\u201d The bad boys of this great American art movement, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, shifted the centre of western art from Paris to the US in the 1940s and 1950s and, more precisely, to New York, where they were well known for drinking and brawling in the bohemian Cedar Tavern. <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/artist-krasner-lee.htm\" title=\"\">Lee Krasner</a>, the American abstract expressionist painter, and Jackson Pollock\u2019s wife, rarely joined them. \u201cI loathed the place,\u201d she said. \u201cThe women were treated like cattle.\u201d</p> <p>Abstract expressionism moved art away from the figurative and explored darker sides of our nature, irrationality and vulnerability. The art is tremendous and of its time \u2013 monumental, paint-spattered pieces, an expression of individual freedom, much of it brash and bold. Were these artists serious? Without question. Men? Most definitely: too much so, apparently.</p> <p>The first major survey of abstract expressionism since 1959, which has <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/abstract-expressionism\" title=\"\">just opened at the Royal Academy</a>, has been accused of displaying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/20/abstract-expressionism-review-royal-academy-pollock-rothko\" title=\"\">too much testosterone</a>. Commentary developed on social media from early visitors asking: \u201cWhere were the women?\u201d A prominent critic complained that there was \u201cnot enough work by the few female artists\u201d and took issue with the exclusion of Hedda Sterne, an artist who appeared in a well-known 1<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/14/hedda-sterne-obituary\" title=\"\">951 <em>Life</em> magazine photograph</a> of the movement\u2019s major figures.</p> <p>But what exactly were they expecting? The telling word from the critic is \u201cfew\u201d. There were not many women in the movement to be included in the first place: Hedda Sterne may have been in that photograph but she didn\u2019t share the rough posturing of the others and she painted in a variety of styles. Lee Krasner and <a href=\"http://joanmitchellfoundation.org/work/artwork/cat/paintings\" title=\"\">Joan Mitchell</a>, to name two women artists associated with the movement, <em>are</em> included in the show. But a significant a number of women painters are not on the walls because they never existed. They cannot be conjured out of thin air.</p> <p>In these hypersensitive times, this sort of response to an exhibition should not surprise anyone. However, the question \u201cBut where are the women?\u201d is one that won\u2019t always produce useful answers or reassessments. It is also one that fails to appreciate that, in the past decade and more, there has seen a forceful attempt at gender rebalancing in exhibitions and collections.</p> <p>At the forefront is the Tate. In the opening display at the new Switch House, half of the artists who are given solo displays are women, while, overall, 36% of the works on display are by female artists. There has been a healthy run of shows by female artists in the last couple of years, including those dedicated to <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/agnes-martin\" title=\"\">Agnes Martin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/yayoi-kusama\" title=\"\">Yayoi Kusama</a>. Tate Modern is run by a brilliant woman \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/22/frances-morris-takes-tate-modern-helm\" title=\"\">Frances Morris</a> \u2013 who was instrumental in the shaping of the collection and helped to secure the giant metal spider by Louise Bourgeois for its opening in 2000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is an insult to be included on the basis of having a uterus rather than merit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while some of this has brought fresh and exciting results, there are limitations to the attempts to shoehorn more women into the canon: not all of the art is strong enough. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/sonia-delaunay-tate-modern-london-review\" title=\"\">Sonia Delaunay exhibition</a> at Tate Modern last year was delightful and she has been somewhat overlooked; it was thus a break from the tried and tested. But her work didn\u2019t justify the scale of the show.</p> <p>No doubt there are plenty of below-par male artists who have received similar treatment, and received a temporary but unwarranted boost, but there is more to this feminist turn than a few extra hangs. There is a danger of art history being&#xa0;rewritten through the prism of gender rather than achievement and that is doing a disservice to art and our understanding of art history.</p> <p>Take Denver Art Museum\u2019s <a href=\"http://denverartmuseum.org/exhibitions/women-abstract-expressionism\" title=\"\">Women of Abstract Expressionism</a>, the first show to focus on the topic, which ran through the summer. Ambitious and revealing, it showed the work of 12 female painters with pieces such as Helen Frankenthaler\u2019s glorious green and peach coloured <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/helen-frankenthaler-jacobs-ladder-1957\" title=\"\"><em>Jacob\u2019s Ladder</em></a> from 1957. But look a little closer and you will see that the women included are not exactly abstract expressionist artists.</p> <p>Of course, a membership card was not required, but much of the work featured seemed only loosely aligned: Frankenthaler did her own thing and developed her own techniques. The exhibition is guilty, then, of expanding the idea of the school precisely, it seems, to include the women.</p> <p>While, no doubt, many involved in challenging the canon believe in the artists they champion, too often they talk about the sex of the artist, the problem of art history in ignoring them and, less often, the work. And what about the feminist cause? If anything, the rewriting of the artistic canon to include more women sets it back. It is an insult to be included on the basis of having a uterus rather than merit. Frankenthaler would have hated to be introduced as a \u201cwoman\u201d artist.</p> <p>Canons are flexible. They can and should be challenged and reshaped. But so often with feminist art history, what you see is a display of bad faith, a disregard for the achievement of great artists and a failure to understand why women often did not participate.</p> <p>The first time the question \u201cWhy have there been no great women artists?\u201d was thoroughly asked and answered was in 1973 and the <a href=\"http://deyoung.famsf.org/files/whynogreatwomenartists_4.pdf\" title=\"\">questioner was the academic Linda Nochlin</a>. \u201cThere are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt, Delacroix or C\u00e9zanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even, in very recent times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any more than there are black America.\u201d</p> <p>Nochlin argued that this was mostly due to the fact that in the past women were second-class citizens. They were prevented, sometimes actively, but also by expectations and circumstances, from making art.</p> <p>That\u2019s not an entirely satisfactory explanation; there have been some notable exclusions and convincing reassessments, such as with Georgia O\u2019Keeffe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/10/georgia-okeefe-review-tate-modern-retrospective\" title=\"\">on show at Tate Modern</a> until the end of October), whose work still commands less at auction than a comparative male artist. Then there\u2019s the brooding and brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/sep/25/female-artist-artemisia-gentileschi\" title=\"\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>, who has rightly been written back into art history.</p> <p>But Nochlin was broadly right: when women were treated as unequal and barred from many art practices, of course there were fewer women artists. The shortage of great women artists in our galleries or art history isn\u2019t a result of a conspiracy to write them out of history \u2013 they were not there in the first place.</p> <p><em>Tiffany Jenkins is the author of </em>Keeping Their Marbles: How the Treasures of the Past Ended Up in Museums</p>",
  "<p>British authorities have confiscated the passport of a prominent Syrian critic of Bashar al-Assad at the request of the government in Damascus, effectively preventing her from travelling and blocking her work as an activist.</p> <p>Zaina Erhaim, an award-winning journalist and campaigner based in Turkey, had her passport taken away by UK border officials when she landed at Heathrow airport. After more than an hour of questioning, they told her that the document had been reported stolen.</p> <p>The complaint came from the government she has been campaigning against for years. \u201cI expect to be harassed inside my country,\u2019 Erhaim told the<em> Observer. \u201c</em>I know that if I went home I would be killed, but now I find that Assad\u2019s arm can even reach to the UK. This is a dictator pursuing a journalist.\u201d</p> <p>A receipt that Erhaim was given for the passport states: \u201cDocument reported as stolen.\u201d Erhaim, who is travelling to the UK <a href=\"http://writeon.kew.org/events/women-on-the-frontline-presented-by-index-on-censorship\" title=\"\">for an event with the BBC\u2019s Kate Adie</a> at the Kew literary festival, said it contained her name, photograph and fingerprint. Erhaim had previously used the passport without problems to travel to the UK in April, when she collected the Index on Censorship\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/indexawards2016-zaina-erhaim-acceptance-speech/\" title=\"\">Freedom of Expression Journalism award </a>for her work. She had also travelled on it without any problems across Europe.</p> <p>The officials told her that they \u201cdid not get involved in politics\u201d and that this was \u201cour system, our rules\u201d. The passport would be returned to Damascus, they said. Erhaim also has an older Syrian passport that she can use to return to Turkey, because it is still valid. But because it has no pages left for visas or immigration stamps \u2013 the reason she got the new document \u2013 she will effectively be unable to leave Turkey again.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just the regime trying to handicap us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are collaborating with him. And they still wonder why Syrians are floating all over Europe seeking asylum.\u201d The decision is particularly painful because it was taken by a government that had given Erhaim a prestigious Chevening Award, which brings \u201cfuture leaders, influencers and decision-makers\u201d to study in the UK. \u201cWhat really, really hurts me is I am a Chevening scholar, you funded my master\u2019s degree and I work for a UK-based, UK-funded organisation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd despite that you take the regime\u2019s word against mine.\u201d</p> <p>The development came two days after foreign secretary Boris Johnson said a change of government was the key to peace in Syria, and blamed Assad\u2019s government for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians. \u201cThere can be no genuine ceasefire unless there is a genuine political agreement that we can have a transition away from the Assad government,\u201d Johnson told the UN security council. \u201cBecause it is the Assad government that is responsible. That regime is responsible for the vast majority of the 400,000 deaths.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said Britain had to comply with the request because passports are the legal property of the government that issues them. \u201cIf a passport is reported as lost or stolen by a foreign government we have no choice but to confiscate it,\u201d the spokesman said. He suggested that Erhaim seek consular assistance from the Syrian government, which has a well-documented history of imprisoning, torturing and killing opponents.</p> <p>This was condemned by Index on Censorship, which invited Erhaim to speak at the event. \u201cI am appalled and frankly ashamed at the treatment of Zaina Erhaim by the UK. This is a woman who has risked her life simply to do what every good journalist aspires to do \u2013 bring both sides of the story \u2013 in an area of conflict that is also her home,\u201d chief executive Jodie Ginsberg said. \u201cThe message the UK sends when it takes such action is that it is not on the side of those struggling to defend human dignity amid the inhumanity of war.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Alex Hacillo: I felt a twinge of sadness that there was no alternative<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a5374c264ffd8581f53917bd38519bf284ba563\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a5374c264ffd8581f53917bd38519bf284ba563/0_585_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Hacillo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I voted for Jeremy Corbyn, but with a potent sense of dread. The problems with Corbyn\u2019s leadership aren\u2019t the invention of a hostile media. In my younger, redder days, I believed that qualities of \u201ccompetence\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d were some sort of elitist ploy, words invented by Tories to discredit any leftwing political project. It isn\u2019t just Corbyn\u2019s gaffe-strewn tenure that convinced me otherwise, but the collapse of John McDonnell\u2019s economic advisory committee.</p> <p>And yet, for all this, the anti-Corbyn opposition, \u201cthe 172\u201d \u2013 Labour MPs who voted they had no confidence in the party leader \u2013 have no positive alternative, least of all Owen Smith, a man who spends lonely nights worrying that his choice of coffee mug isn\u2019t proletarian enough.</p> <p>Broad swaths of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) failed to realise that the attempt to unseat Corbyn in the wake of the EU referendum felt like a direct attack on the membership. No one could reasonably expect the bulk of party members to rally around a candidate standing because the electorate couldn\u2019t be trusted to vote properly the first time. It gave members the feeling that the contest was one between rank-and-file and party elites; or youthful optimism and jaded cynicism. This only solidified pro-Corbyn opinion among potential waverers.</p> <p>So if you can\u2019t remove Corbyn through official channels, the only option left is to persuade members with reasoned discussion, right? Wrong, apparently. A better strategy is to wage a low-intensity war against anyone of vaguely leftish sympathies within the party. Re-tweeted the Greens? The procedures committee will show you the door. This sort of antagonism is proven electoral poison.</p> <p>As someone long on the left of the party, I would have been amenable to an alternative candidate who engaged with me on an intellectual level. The problem with this isn\u2019t that it hurts my feelings \u2013 nothing compared with the abuse decent MPs have received at the hands of some on the left \u2013 but that it exposes the intellectual poverty on the right of the party. I voted for Corbyn the first time round because I feared that Labour, and social democracy, faced an existential threat.</p> <p>Pasok, PSOE, Labour in Scotland: traditional socialist parties in Europe, shorn of their traditional support bases seemed vulnerable to populists on left and right. No one on the right of the party has properly addressed this, instead offering a rehashed vision of \u201997 .</p> <p>I felt Labour needed a way of tapping into popular anti-elitism with a progressive, socially just programme, rather than one that made weak, mug-based overtures to controlling immigration. With no one on the Labour right or left offering a credible alternative to Corbyn, the only choice we have is to cooperate, to find grounds for compromise with the bulk of the PLP, and to work for a Labour victory in 2020. I can\u2019t help but feel a twinge of sadness that this, the greatest opportunity for real political change in my lifetime, is all being squandered.</p> <p><em>Alex Hacillo is 24, and joined the Labour party in Liverpool in 2010</em></p> <h2>Isabel Hardman: stop all the bickering and start the long walk to power<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_749_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents now have a long time to answer two big questions.

They have twice boasted they wereable to do this before the 2015 and 2016 contests \u2013 and twice miserably failed.</p> <p>The party is becoming less and less attractive a prospect for anyone with a decent perspective on life and interesting hobbies to give up their spare time and money to attend vitriolic branch meetings. Indeed, it\u2019s not just a question of finding new members, but trying to stem the exodus of existing ones.</p> <p>The second question concerns how to heal the divide between centrists and soft left. Moderates are offended by the way Owen Smith and his soft left comrades have explicitly blamed the Blairites for the turmoil in the party, suggesting that things were fine until they started whingeing. Both sides need to put aside their personal gripes with one another, otherwise the walk back from the wilderness will take even longer as everyone bickers about the directions.</p> <p><em>Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator</em></p> <h2>Kerry-Anne Mendoza: it\u2019s time to end a toxic coup and resume the party\u2019s core mission<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3bea8c3c78021bdcf074d31ab7cc4d00a58ba1c/0_1637_3181_1909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry-anne Mendoza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Labour is having a moment of reckoning.

Our future outside the EU, our role as a member of the international community, the future of science and technology, building a sustainable and robust economy, creating fulfilling careers, supporting and empowering those with illnesses and disabilities, making education the foundation block of our society, being a fit and healthy society.</p> <p>Those are the issues that the Labour party could and should be addressing. Instead the rightwing of the party and their friends in the commentariat are attempting to exert their will on the rest using any and all means. This must end. Now.</p> <p>The country is crying out for the kind of vision and values that set a road map to a better future. It\u2019s time for this anti-democratic and toxic coup to end, and for Labour to return to its core mission: to lead a country that works for the many, not for the few.</p> <p><em>Kerry-Anne Mendoza is editor of the Canary</em></p> <h2>Tom Holland: the hard left has given us an unelectable husk of a party<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deb3f8c442771c120030fc5b05cee24c899fa18f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb3f8c442771c120030fc5b05cee24c899fa18f/0_244_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Holland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Running into a pregnant <em>Glyptapanteles</em> wasp is rarely good news for a caterpillar. The wasp, after drilling an ovipositor into its hapless victim, will lay its eggs inside the caterpillar\u2019s body; the larvae, when they hatch, will then devour their host\u2019s bodily fluids. Taking great care not to damage its vital organs, they will also mind-control it, so that the caterpillar, even after the larvae have erupted through its exoskeleton, continues to defend them as they pupate. Eventually, the wasps hatch. The caterpillar, meanwhile, is left to die.</p> <p>Such is the fate that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s re-election as leader seems to portend for the Labour party. The hard left faction that has seized control of Britain\u2019s main progressive party has every prospect now of devouring it inside out. That this is bad news for anyone who wants to see a Labour government goes without saying.</p> <p>Among the numerous reasons why the incompetent, incurious and pharisaical Corbyn will never be prime minister, the most copper-bottomed is surely this: that British voters will never elect as their leader a sympathiser with the IRA. Corbyn himself can blame this on false consciousness all he likes. If he genuinely cared about securing a Labour victory at the next election, he would have stood down long ago.</p> <p>The reason that he has not, I can only assume, is because - like the zealot he is - he believes in a higher cause. Bad for Labour, and bad for those who would best be served by a Labour government, Corbyn\u2019s re-election is bad as well for the very fabric of our parliamentary democracy.</p> <p><em>Tom Holland is a journalist and author</em></p> <h2>Eliza Filby: centrists should help themselves by taking a long look in the mirror<br></h2> <p>The one standout moment in this tiresome leadership campaign was when Owen Smith asked Jeremy Corbyn to name how many seats Labour would need to win back in order to form a majority government. Corbyn got the answer wrong. It was perhaps symptomatic of the fact that Corbyn may offer a genuine alternative to Labour members sick of centrism but he does not currently offer a credible alternative to the electorate. The British state is about to undergo its biggest overhaul since 1945; this requires an opposition that does not simply oppose but effectively scrutinises.</p> <p>In order to do this, Labour needs unity, ideas, organisation and competence; all of which this leadership is completely lacking. Corbyn now has three options: purge the party of dissenters, push for unity between MPs and party members, or alternatively try to find agreement on key issues (at least on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy). The first option seems depressingly likely, the second depressingly unlikely, and the third the most sensible. A separate Labour party in Scotland also presents problems as well as opportunities.</p> <p>So, what now for Labour centrists? They may choose to sit and wait for Corbyn to fail. But by then it might be too late and a split inevitable. Collaboration with Corbynistas might be too hard to stomach and impossible to maintain. One thing that centrists could do is stop blaming Corbyn for everything and take a long look in the mirror. The foundations of leftwing centrism have completely crumbled and fresh thinking is required.</p> <p>What should be at the forefront of their minds for both MPs and members is the future of the Labour voter. Ukip will redouble its efforts in Labour heartlands and, with the possible resurgence of the Lib Dems and the strength of the SNP, Labour MPs of all shades might find there is no longer a loyal electorate on which they can draw.</p> <p><em>Eliza Filby is the author of God and Mrs Thatcher</em></p> <h2>Neil Kinnock: do not desert the only party that can deliver social justice<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d390c6acb01b1cdc81aa448626ca8d7d198861f/0_1694_3992_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Kinnock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Countless conversations in communities of all kinds in the past year tell me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/im-taking-my-vote-elsewhere-if-corbyn-wins\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> columnist Barbara Ellen last week </a>spoke for many who react to the current Labour leadership, and some of its followership, with an intention to leave the party and even stop voting Labour.</p> <p>I plead with them to do neither. I urge them to understand that the only people pleased \u2013 and strengthened \u2013 by their departure would be those who provoked them, in despair and anguish, to go. I ask them not to give the Labour party to such people but to stay in the party and to keep on voting Labour. Despite the political tunnel vision and self-indulgence of the current leadership, Labour is still, to borrow Ellen\u2019s words, the \u201cpolitical entity conceived to provide parliamentary representation (and therefore protection) for the most overlooked and vulnerable people in society\u201d; it still needs broad support to secure elected power at local and national levels; it is still the only \u201cpolitical force\u201d that can credibly offer the social justice essential for a productive and equitable country.</p> <p>In a previous existential crisis \u2013 in the 1930s \u2013 the Labour party declared that \u201cthe victory of ideals must be organised\u201d. It is an abiding, inescapable truth. Many democratic socialists would, like me, appeal to all to stay, to organise, and to uphold the reality that only a Labour party that again makes a wide electoral appeal can feasibly earn the parliamentary power to combat the huge injustices and inefficiencies of gross and growing inequality, underinvestment and underperformance.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t an easy course.

How is it possible to do any kind of leftwing politics in a globalised world where governments are up against supranational forces beyond their control? President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Syriza are very different kinds of leftists, but both are the latest to discover that when it comes to fair taxes, ending austerity or tackling inequality, idealism and public support aren\u2019t enough.</p> <p>When tax rises were on the table in France, the French rich rapidly became the Belgian rich (or in Gerard Depardieu\u2019s case, the Russian rich).

We\u2019ve been hearing about globalisation, digitalisation and automation for decades, but the left still hasn\u2019t found a politics to match its challenges.</p> <p>With the leadership election now over, Labour should set about finding one, because if it doesn\u2019t this time there may be no way back for the party if voters in this country decide it hasn\u2019t got any answers.</p> <p><em>Dreda Say Mitchell is an award-winning crime novelist</em></p> <h2>Sue and Jennie: we\u2019re feeling despondent \u2013 and politically homeless<br></h2> <p>Between us we have 100 years on the electoral register, voting Labour every time.

Unless we abandon our first-past-the-post system in favour of proportional representation we will continue, as at our last election, to vote in majority governments from only 34% of votes cast and the 7.3 million voters (25% of our electorate) who put their cross against a Ukip, Lib Dem or Green candidate will have no more to show for their vote than 10 MPs between them. hey might certainly be envious of the 1.5 million Scots who voted for SNP and got 54 MPs elected to parliament to represent them.</p> <p>If proportional representation does not speed to the top of the democracy agenda soon, then a large proportion of the population will continue to be disenfranchised, their votes will be seen to have unequal value and disengagement with politics will grow deeper.</p> <p>The sails of UK democracy are disappearing fast over the horizon and the Tories and Labour are happy to wave them on their way.<br><strong>Jasper Dorgan</strong><br>Edington, Wiltshire</p> <h2><strong>Our buzzards need protection</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>When I was a young boy \u2013 I am now 87 \u2013 it was a cause of great delight to travel from London to the west country and actually see a buzzard (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/17/buzzard-hunting-licences-threat-to-uk-pheasant-industry\" title=\"\">Buzzards back in hunters\u2019 crosshairs over threat to UK pheasant shoots</a>\u201d, News, last week). Even more exhilarating was a trip to mid-Wales where my brother and I saw red kites which had been so persecuted that only&#xa0;14 existed. These are native birds in our countryside, and it beggars belief that Natural England, the government agency tasked with protecting England\u2019s wildlife, should issue a license to a gamekeeper to shoot up to 10 buzzards. This will encourage farmers, who raise thousands of pheasants, to believe that they too can kill buzzards with impunity.</p> <p>In the autumn, when these foreign birds are released in order to be killed for fun, they stream into our garden and wood where for free they feast on insect life and any slow-worms, grass snakes or lizards that have not yet hibernated.

Collective association and action is as much as part of our democracy as elections and neither is perfect.</p> <p>Collective action may start from a specific concern but can lead into broader systemic issues of which the original concern may merely be a symptom. As a result, collective movements can be hijacked or perceived to be. I am sure there were the same arguments about the civil rights movement in the US in the 1960s as there are now about Black Lives Matter.

  "<p>The BBC\u2019s coverage of the EU referendum was highly regarded by the critics who matter most to us: the public. Our audience research shows that the BBC was the most trusted reporter of the referendum. In fact, our scores for trust rose as the campaign progressed. Complaints were low. And more than 90% of people in the UK<strong><em> </em></strong>came to the BBC during the campaign for the news. That said, there have been two strands of criticism of our coverage. On the one hand, some Leavers have said the BBC reported impartially and accurately through the course of the campaign, but, since the vote of 23&#xa0;June, we have returned to what they say are our true EU-luvvie colours and our reporting of the prospects for Brexit Britain has been gloomy or hysterical.</p> <p>On the other, some Remainers have complained that we have been too impartial \u2013 that our unthinking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/bbc-impartiality-skewers-evidence-based-facts\" title=\"\">insistence on balance</a> meant we treated Remain and Leave arguments with equivalence, giving the same treatment to respected experts as to know-nothings and lightweights. Worse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/29/tvs-failure-to-properly-scrutinise-boris-johnsons-eu-claims-a-criminal-act\" title=\"\">the criticism has gone</a>, we abandoned our duty to inform the public: the Leavers\u2019 exaggerations, distortions and downright lies, they say, were given the same airtime as the Remainers\u2019 evidence-based judgments. Impartial reporting, this argument goes, is contributing to the problem of post-truth politics.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss these critics as regular BBC bashers or sore losers. But the BBC has no business being complacent. It is worth making a few points that, I hope, show that we are alive to our critics.</p> <p>The Leavers\u2019 complaint will, in no small part, be answered by what happens next and how we report it. The fact is that, since the EU referendum, there has been a revaluation of sterling, the Bank of England cut interest rates because it says the outlook for economic growth has weakened markedly and the government\u2019s plans for Brexit are unclear. But consumer confidence has bounced back and manufacturing and services sectors have rebounded accordingly. In the months ahead, our job is to understand what Brexit actually means \u2013 without relish or alarm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Remainers who grieve at the result have blamed the BBC. But they know that the BBC did not choose to hold the referendum, frame the question, decide the timing of the vote, agree the reform package with Brussels or set the terms, tone and talking points of the campaign. Nor was the BBC responsible for the approach of the big political parties to the campaign. Labour chose to operate separately from Stronger In. Downing Street refused to send out Conservative cabinet ministers to rebut arguments made by prominent Tory Leavers live on air, because they insisted that \u201cblue on blue\u201d arguments would turn the national debate into a Westminster soap opera. Unsurprisingly, the BBC did not carry water for the government: our job is to challenge politicians, not to serve as a rebuttal unit or advocate the alternative argument.</p> <p>One other point: inasmuch as the EU referendum was about the economy, it was about forecasts more than facts. It was not a contest of hard truths but an argument over whose predictions of the future you preferred. The BBC was abundantly clear that the overwhelming weight of expert economic opinion advised people to vote Remain. But the BBC, at all times, should be open to those who may challenge a consensus \u2013 not all such opinions stand the test of time. (And, for the avoidance of doubt, that does not mean any crank heretic can come along and think they can take a pop at a point of historical, scientific or social fact.)</p> <p>The fundamental charge \u2013 that BBC reporting resulted in a false balance in which fanciful claims got the same billing as serious insights \u2013 is not true. We were keenly aware of this risk, precisely because the BBC had been so roundly criticised by the scientific community over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/02/mps-criticise-bbc-false-balance-climate-change-coverage\" title=\"\">climate change</a>.</p> <p>For the uninitiated: \u201cfalse balance\u201d means thinking wrongly that you have to give pro and anti equal airtime, regardless of the facts, editorial judgment and the expertise of the interviewee. The BBC\u2019s rules are clear. We have to deliver \u201cdue impartiality\u201d and \u201cbroad balance\u201d, terms designed to ensure that we are free to make judgments on the validity of stories, that we challenge facts and figures, that we acknowledge that different people speak with different levels of authority on a subject.</p> <p>The editorial guidelines that we spend a great deal of time thinking through make clear that balance is not measured with a stopwatch. So, if you go back, you will see that the squeakier claims made by politicians were challenged again and again by our presenters and correspondents. Go back and look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36380980\" title=\"\">Evan Davis take on Douglas Carswell</a> over the claim that voting Leave would bring \u00a3350m a week back into UK coffers; watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-on-question-times-eu-referendum-special-the-verdict\" title=\"\">David Dimbleby take on Michael Gove</a>\u2019s dismissal of the IFS; read what <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36073201\" title=\"\">Reality Check said about George Osborne\u2019s forecast</a> that voting Leave would cost each home \u00a34,300; watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaSQT7QnbWI\" title=\"\">Andrew Neil pick apart Nigel Farage\u2019s numbers</a> on immigration. Or Kamal Ahmed on the 6pm and 10pm bulletins saying: \u201cThe economic consensus is on one side of this debate.\u201d I could go on and on.</p> <p>The Remainers\u2019 criticism does not stand up. No one who watched the BBC during the campaign could have been left in any doubt that President Obama, the governor of the Bank of England, the IMF, OECD, IFS, CBI, prime minister, chancellor and, yes, both David Beckham and Jeremy Clarkson believed Britain should remain in the EU. People who voted out made up their own minds and did so knowing that all those people thought it was a bad idea. If some people who believe in the benefits of EU membership think they lost the referendum because their case was not sufficiently heard on the BBC, I can\u2019t help feeling they may be missing the point of the 52%. It is impossible to generalise on what 17.5&#xa0;million voters were saying, but it was a vote for a change.</p> <p>We plainly do not get everything right. We make mistakes and, I hope, move quickly to grip them. More than that, there is a real issue about how newsrooms can get beyond the noise to the news. This means thinking differently about reporting stories, the resources we put into data analysis, and the prominence we give to context. But no one wants paternalistic news. The BBC\u2019s job is not to preside over the democratic process \u2013 it is to report, to host the argument and to interrogate the participants. We aim to inform our audiences, not seek the approval of politicians or pundits. That is what we sought to do in this difficult and contentious contests. And it is what we continue to do.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThis is the story of this country\u2026 generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.\u201d The most powerful speech of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia earlier this summer was made not by the party\u2019s presidential nominee, nor the president, but by the first lady, Michelle Obama. <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/michelle-obama-speech-democratic-convention-dnc-2016-full-text-video/\">Her words</a> remind us of the extent to which the slave trade \u2013 and the terrible legacy it left the United States \u2013 is part of that country\u2019s national consciousness.</p> <p>Not so in Britain. Our political leaders hardly make reference to the dominant role this country played in the global slave trade. British slave traders generated immense spoils by transporting 5.5 million African slaves to its Caribbean colonies, forcing them to work in terrible conditions on plantations in Jamaica, Barbados and beyond. A new <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/\">database</a> launched last week by academics at UCL, cataloguing the details of 20,000 British slave owners, illustrates the extent to which the historic wealth of the slave trade extends its reach into modern Britain: in the Georgian architecture of cities such as London, Liverpool and Bristol; in businesses such as Greene King and the Royal and Sun Alliance; in the several recent or serving <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slave-owners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html\">MPs with slave owners in their family history</a>.</p> <p>The extraction of this wealth came at terrible cost. Slaves were shackled and transported in appalling conditions aboard disease-ridden ships. Those who survived the journey were often treated with unspeakable physical and emotional cruelty. Countless lives were lost: by the time of abolition, the African slave population in the Caribbean stood at a small fraction of the total number of slaves who had arrived over the years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain is portrayed as a benevolent benefactor rather than a country with a burden of debt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scars are still visible across Britain\u2019s former colonies. After abolition, former slaves were left in abject poverty, a legacy from which no country has recovered. In Jamaica, Britain\u2019s largest slave colony, 80% of its population lacked functional literacy at the time it was granted independence in 1962. In Britain, the wealth extracted from African slaves has continued to contribute to our society flourishing long after slavery was abolished.</p> <p>But unlike in the United States, the horrors of British slavery unfolded on plantations on distant shores and its legacies affect populations Britain has long washed its hands of. So our role in this dark period has been all to easy to obscure. Tony Blair was the first British prime minister to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/nov/26/race.immigrationpolicy\">address this grim period of Britain\u2019s past</a>, but only after decades of political leaders ignoring it altogether. When David Cameron visited Jamaica last year, he called for Jamaica to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/jamaica-should-move-on-from-painful-legacy-of-slavery-says-cameron\">\u201cmove on\u201d</a> from its past and spoke positively of Britain\u2019s role in abolition. He neither acknowledged Britain\u2019s role as a perpetrator, nor the fact that even the act of abolition was itself a terrible injustice. While British slave owners were paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/12/british-history-slavery-buried-scale-revealed\">huge amounts of compensation</a> by the government \u2013 between \u00a316bn and \u00a317bn in today\u2019s prices; 40% of government expenditure in 1834 \u2013 their slaves were forced to work for a further four years without pay in order to further compensate their owners.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s true role in the slave trade must feature more prominently in our collective history and our national consciousness: not so that our political leaders should constantly apologise for Britain\u2019s past wrongs, or that contemporary descendants of slave traders should bear an ongoing burden of shame, but so that we view Britain\u2019s role in the modern world in the context of our history.</p> <p>Our international responsibilities cannot be understood devoid of that context. They are derived not just from the deep injustice of the structural inequalities that divide global north from global south but from the fact that in the past Britain has helped create those very inequalities.</p> <p>Few would disagree with this principle in abstract. Yet it is rarely played out in concrete debates about international aid, migration and refugee policy. Too often, Britain is portrayed as a benevolent benefactor rather than a country with a burden of debt to some of the world\u2019s poorest nations. We cannot understand our role in the world using only a sanitised version of our history.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 1,000 unaccompanied minors will be left to fend for themselves when the so-called jungle camp for refugees in Calais is bulldozed next month. The French authorities have made no plans to rehouse the children, the <em>Observer</em> has learned, because it is hoping to force Britain to honour a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">promise to help child refugees</a>.</p> <p>The French interior ministry has informed charities and aid organisations that it intends to destroy the camp in less than four weeks. <br></p> <p>Almost 400 unaccompanied youngsters in the camp, some of whom have relatives in the UK, have already been identified as having a legal right to come to Britain.</p> <p>In May, David Cameron announced that Britain would accept as many as 3,000 unaccompanied minors.

Details emerged last week when refugee organisations were told that alternative accommodation elsewhere in France would be supplied for 9,000 adults and families. <br></p> <p>However, because of a supposed lack of emergency capacity for unaccompanied minors, at least 850 children will be made homeless. <br></p> <p>Josie Naughton of the charity <a href=\"http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/\">Help Refugees</a> said: \u201cWe are particularly concerned for the safety of the unaccompanied children and ask the authorities to ensure they are protected and accounted for.

The gulf in quality and competitiveness between the two leagues has widened in recent years and it would be a major surprise were Celtic to do what no English team has managed and put the brakes on Manchester City\u2019s impressive opening to the season.</p> <p>The temptation is strong to suggest that Brendan Rodgers\u2019s team might be in for another mauling on the scale of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/13/barcelona-celtic-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 7-0 welcome back to the Champions League</a> they were given in Barcelona a fortnight ago, though this time Celtic are at home and, while the process has clearly begun, Pep Guardiola has not quite turned City into a replica of his former charges just yet.</p> <p>City will probably not be looking for a statement victory in Scotland in any case. They will be perfectly happy with the points. They have to play Barcelona too and, as Guardiola sensibly pointed out after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/manchester-city-borussia-monchengladbach-champions-league-group-c-match-report\" title=\"\">opening Champions League victory over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach</a>, when you find yourself in the same group as such a strong team your first duty is to try to make sure you do not drop any points from the other matches.</p> <p>Celtic dropped their first points of the SPL campaign last week, when they could manage only a draw away to Inverness Caledonian Thistle. City were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/17/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">thumping Bournemouth the same weekend</a>, though in the preceding week they had accounted for Manchester United and M\u00f6nchengladbach. Guardiola\u2019s assertion that Eddie Howe\u2019s side was the best he had played all season was an early indication that not only is the rivalry with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho still current but that not all the wind-ups and oneupmanship will necessarily emanate from Old Trafford.</p> <p>Rodgers must have felt euphoric enough to say something similar after the long-anticipated resumption of Old Firm games ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/10/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">a resounding 5-1 Celtic victory</a>. Yet three days later that achievement was put into the most unflattering perspective by the cruel scoreline in Catalonia. \u201cWe were given some harsh lessons in the Nou Camp,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt was a humbling experience, though Barcelona are capable of doing that to better teams than us.\u201d</p> <p>The dropped points at Inverness were perhaps inevitable in the circumstances; it is never easy to put a hiding of that scale out of mind and concentrate on the next game. Celtic were not at their best in the league cup in midweek either, struggling at home against the part-timers of Alloa Athletic before two late goals set up a semi-final meeting with Rangers.</p> <p>Rodgers characteristically attempted to talk up the positives \u2013 \u201cWinning builds confidence, we can\u2019t always play perfect football but we can look for ways to improve\u201d \u2013 though there is more than a suggestion of ever decreasing circles about Scottish football at the moment.</p> <p>While having Celtic and Rangers back together is probably better than having them apart, the need for a competitive European dimension is obvious now that the English Football League has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/efl-rules-out-including-premier-league-b-teams-in-plans-for-new-league-structure\" title=\"\">crushed any Old Firm hopes of joining in the fun south of the border</a>. \u201cCeltic and Rangers hit by new English snub\u201a\u201d was the <em>Daily Record</em>\u2019s take on last week\u2019s news that the EFL will not be expanding to five divisions.</p> <p>So Europe it must be for the moment, even if Celtic appear much more suited to the Europa League than the full-on powerplay of the Champions League. While it might be considered unlucky to be drawn in a group containing a Guardiola side, to find yourself having to play two of them \u2013 with due respect to Luis Enrique \u2013 must be daunting indeed.</p> <p>Celtic\u2019s only hope when the draw was made was that the new City manager might take a little while to find his feet in England, or that his club\u2019s underwhelming track record in Europe might drag even Guardiola down. None of this has happened. There is a new manager struggling in Manchester, in the Premier League as well as in Europe, but his name is not Guardiola.</p> <p>City, for perhaps the first time since the enabling Abu Dhabi money was pumped in, look more than the sum of their parts (and what a sum that must be). In between reinvigorating Raheem Sterling, introducing Ilkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, scoring points off Mourinho and taking his team clear at the top of the league, Guardiola has even found time to slap down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/21/yaya-toure-agent-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-dimitri-seluk\" title=\"\">Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s troublesome agent</a>.</p> <p>It seems Guardiola can do no wrong at the moment. His players are rightly attracting superlatives, though if Celtic are looking for a glimmer of hope they might conclude that these are exactly the conditions for complacency to creep in. One feels it would have to be quite a lot of complacency for a team that shipped seven goals last time to manage a result against one that won 4-0 but Celtic must try to make the most of their home advantage.</p> <p>Perhaps anyone would struggle against Barcelona on a good day. We may have to wait until City\u2019s games against Guardiola\u2019s old club to give that 7-0 scoreline some context but in the meantime Celtic\u2019s motivation is clear. They need to prove there is still some fight in Scottish football.</p>",
  "<p>Perry, a five-year-old African grey parrot, is for sale on a well-known pet trade website for \u00a3750. She looks in good condition with her large black bill, red tail and white mask and her owner says she can whistle the tune of Flower of Scotland, does a passable imitation of R2D2 and is \u201cvery clever and funny\u201d.</p> <p>What Perry\u2019s Scottish owner does not tell prospective buyers is that the African grey is close to extinction in the wild largely because of the international pet trade.</p> <p>Although there have been restrictions on the export of these small and intelligent birds since 2009, dealers pay a pittance for tens of thousands of them to be trapped every year in the rainforests of west and central Africa and smuggled out.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to catch them, say researchers from <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Birdlife</a>, a global grouping of conservation groups. A team of hunters will use decoys or go to the birds\u2019 water and mineral licks in the forests where flocks gather. They then throw nets over them and take dozens at a time.</p> <p>Once caught they will be smuggled over borders, stuffed in tiny cages and flown illegally to Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and China, where they may fetch up to \u00a31,000 each. All this makes the African grey probably the most highly traded bird in the world, causing their numbers to plummet from Nigeria to Cameroon, and from Ivory Coast to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some conservationists estimate only 1% of their historical numbers remain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">In a world of 7 billion people how can we protect wildlife?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week moves are afoot that could give hope to the African grey\u2019s future. Nine African states, the European Union and others will ask world governments and EU at the triennial meeting of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/30/7-billion-people-how-protect-wildlife-endangered-species\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg</a> to give the highest international protection to the bird. But it is far from the only species whose future hangs in the balance and whose fate could be determined at this year\u2019s meeting. The Cites convention, signed by more than 180 countries and the EU, is the best hope the world has of stemming the growth in the \u00a3150bn a year wildlife trade and of reversing catastrophic animal and plant losses.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a surge in African elephant and rhino poaching, and continuing deforestation and habitat losses, governments will come under intense pressure in Johannesburg to increase protection for many hundreds of endangered species. Ministers will hear from scientists, technical experts and conservationists that the fate of wildlife is at a crossroads, with populations crashing and a slow-motion extinction taking place.</p> <p>The precipitous decline of the African grey echoes what is happening to hundreds of other plant and animal species, including the African elephant, the tiger, rosewood trees, pagolins, banggai cardinal fish and many others, say conservationists.</p> <p>Last month the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) revised its animal danger lists. Sixty-eight species are said to have become extinct in the wild; 5,107 are critically endangered; 7,600 are endangered; and 16,000 are \u201cvulnerable\u201d or \u201cthreatened\u201d.</p> <p>Within a human generation, the meeting will hear, species such as the African elephant, tiger, gorilla and lion could be on the verge of extinction in the wild as a result of illegal hunting, habitat loss and the pet trade. The trade in illegal ivory has more than doubled since 2007.</p> <p>\u201cAfrica\u2019s overall elephant population has seen the worst declines in 25 years, mainly due to poaching over the past 10 years,\u201d the IUCN\u2019s director-general, Inger Andersen, will say. \u201cTheir plight is truly alarming. Poaching has been the main driver of the decline, while habitat loss poses an increasingly serious, long-term threat to the species.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a340216eb91cf6969244f9a68e2a34dc3e806d35/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old African elephant bull with a broken tusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The trade in ivory has attracted the opposition of Prince William, who has has lobbied President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to take action against it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beverly Joubert/Getty Images/National Geographic Creative</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cites protects about 5,000 animal and 30,000 plant species, and ministers will be asked to change the protection status of more than 500. Some, like the lion, African elephant and pangolin, are high profile, but many reptiles, coral and fish, such as the banggai cardinal fish, are barely known.</p> <p>Nearly all the 62 proposals put forward by governments will be to increase protection. But a few species, like the panda and peregrine falcon, are no longer considered to be in danger and could have their protection reduced.</p> <p>Many countries will be admonished for allowing the illegal trade in animal parts and plant species to flourish. Laos has pledged to phase out its controversial tiger farms, which supply neighbouring China with bones and other parts for traditional medicine. But international animal trade inspectors will report in Johannesburg that rhinoceros horn, elephant ivory and many other wildlife specimens are being regularly smuggled through the country both to China and other south-east Asian countries. \u201cLaos is being targeted by organised crime groups as a transit point,\u201d says wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. \u201cNo arrests or prosecutions related to illegal trade in rhino horn, elephant ivory and other wildlife specimens have occurred in the country since 2012. Significant loopholes still exist in national legislation.\u201d</p> <p>South Africa, the host country, is certain to be embarrassed, having lost nearly 6,000 rhinos to poachers since 2007, including more than 700 this year. Vietnam will be told to crack down on its rampant illegal rhino horn trade or face sanctions, and China will be identified as the world\u2019s primary destination for precious woods.</p> <p>\u201cVietnam\u2019s poor law enforcement record speaks for itself; ending the illegal rhino horn trade and helping to save Africa\u2019s rhinos is clearly not a priority for the government,\u201d said Ginette Hemley, WWF\u2019s head of delegation to Cites.</p> <p>\u201cWith around three rhinos being poached each day, there is no time to lose. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/total-ban-ivory-disastrous-elephants-legalise-it\">Cites must take a tough line with Vietnam</a>: swiftly implement critical measures to tackle the illegal rhino horn trade or be banned from legally trading many wildlife products,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157d44996af7a501655df82788b840e241018696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157d44996af7a501655df82788b840e241018696/0_262_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The future of the rhino is also hanging in the balance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The future of the rhino is also hanging in the balance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Minihane/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chinese consumption will be blamed for the plight of the tiger but also for the loss of west African forests. Soaring demand for expensive classical furniture made of rosewood is driving deforestation. \u201cMost Chinese imports of rosewood have come from south-east Asia, but in recent years traders are turning to west Africa to help satisfy booming consumer demand. From 2010 to 2014, China\u2019s rosewood imports from Africa jumped 700% and in the first half of 2016 alone nearly $216m worth of west African rosewood was imported into China,\u201d international forest group Forest Trends will report.</p> <p>But whereas pressure for increased wildlife protection has, in the past, come from scientists and campaigners, the drive for better protection now comes from celebrities, business groups, royalty and governments with agendas of their own.</p> <p>Prince William has made wildlife a personal cause and, working with elephant conservation group Tusk, has lobbied President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to take action to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/21/uk-to-crack-down-on-illegal-ivory-sales\">trade in ivory</a>.

It is some of the world\u2019s poorest peoples who will suffer when their natural resources are stripped from them illegally and brutally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last week Joanna Lumley weighed in to voice dismay at a proposal at Cites to allow the trade of horns from rhinos that have died from natural causes, or recovered poached horns. \u201cThis iconic species should not be reduced to a commodity that can be plundered for human indulgence,\u201d said the actress.</p> <p>Since the last meeting, in 2013, governments, too, have found a new reason to crack down on wildlife crime. According to the London international affairs thinktank Chatham House, wildlife crime can lead to international terrorism, and the destabilisation of vulnerable democracies. The Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabaab is said to generate its funding from illegal ivory sales.</p> <p>But everyone knows that the international trade restrictions which Cites can impose on countries are limited and nowhere near enough to stop the \u00a3150bn a year trade. The measures, say conservationists, are complicated, difficult to enforce, do not take the place of national laws, and are implemented in different ways by different countries.</p> <p>Moreover, court fines are nowhere near enough to deter poaching or smuggling. The street value of ivory is now more than \u00a31,500 a kilogram in Beijing, and rhino horn can sell for \u00a350,000 per kilo \u2013 far more than the price of gold or platinum \u2013 on the Chinese black market. Meanwhile rosewood can sell for many thousands of pounds a cubic metre.</p> <p>The UN environment programme says that 88 countries must strengthen their laws if they are to implement Cites decisions and combat illegal trade in wildlife. Many, including Bolivia, Guinea-Bissau, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritania and Mozambique must to do it urgently, says the UN body.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d02113ff6efed34e38c520472cfd6c6d72f000/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists demonstrate against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild, Fauna and Flora (Cites) in Johannesburg on September 24, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animal welfare groups say that Cites pays no attention to the treatment of animals. \u201cEvery year it rubberstamps the trade in thousands of live animals from Africa, but corruption and a complete disregard for the wellbeing of these animals means that most will suffer mistreatment, and many will experience unimaginable cruelty during their capture and transport,\u201d said David Barritt, Network for Animals\u2019 chief campaigner.</p> <p>\u201cInternational trade bans are critical to saving wildlife, but without rigorous efforts to prevent poaching and trafficking they are never enough on their own. Organised criminal networks will continue to target threatened species, as we have seen with rhinos, elephants and tigers,\u201d said the WWF.</p> <p>The Johannesburg meeting will be the largest ever, with more at stake than ever before, said John Scanlon, Cites secretary-general. \u201cCites is critical to fight the illegal trade in wildlife. Thousands of species are internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, housing, healthcare, eco-tourism, cosmetics or fashion.\u201d</p> <p>If countries agree to protect the grey parrot, either by consensus or by a two-thirds majority, an outright ban will be placed within 90 days on its international trade. It would also mean that all owners in Britain and elsewhere will have to register their birds.</p> <p>The exotic pet trade, which has powerful political support in many tropical countries, will lobby, but with backing for a total trade ban also likely from Washington and Brussels the parrot is almost certain to join 1,000 other species, such as tigers, rhinos and gorillas, on what is known as Cites Appendix I, the list of most endangered species. If it stays on Appendix II, which includes sharks, polar bears and lions, some limited trade will continue to be allowed.</p> <p>\u201cCites has remarkable power. It is a pragmatic and honest convention. Discussions can be robust and intense. If there is no consensus on a request, it goes to a vote. The stage is set for a remarkable two weeks,\u201d said Scanlon.</p> <p>But whether Cites really saves the African grey parrott, the pagolin and the rosewood tree from vanishing is far from certain.</p> <h2>African lions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7905e67647cd16fc62324a2eb816784628b9cb4/0_0_5899_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lioness and adolescents lying down in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Numbers of lions in west Africa have declined by about 60% in the last 20 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anup Shah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many west African countries are seeking a total ban on the commercial trading of lions.

Countries that promote trophy hunting will object to an upgrading of lions\u2019 protection. The probably outcome is that western and central African lions will be placed on Cites\u2019 Appendix I, while other populations remain on Appendix II.</p> <h2>Sharks and rays</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95c8fb5efa4a42534ec0d457c17b7c6148246586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95c8fb5efa4a42534ec0d457c17b7c6148246586/832_623_4381_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mobula rays gathering for migration around the Yucatan Peninsula, Contoy Island, Quintana Roo, Mexico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nine species of Mobula ray could be put on Cites\u2019 Appendix II for the first time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa, whose waters are home to a quarter of the world\u2019s 400-odd shark species, has proposed with other countries that protection of many more species of shark be strengthened. The silky shark, three species of thresher shark and nine species of mobula ray could all be put on Appendix II for the first time because all are said to have seen declines of more than 70%.</p> <h2>African elephants</h2> <p>Countries will consider several proposals to clamp down on the ivory trade, destroy stockpiles, close legal domestic ivory markets, restrict live animal exports and create a mechanism for a future ivory trade. Currently, all African elephants are included in Appendix I, except for those in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, which are in Appendix II. One contentious proposal from Namibia and Zimbabwe seeks to move the populations of all four countries to the most stringent Appendix I level. Along with South Africa, they also propose to adopt a mechanism to permit commercial exports of ivory from lesser protected Appendix II range states. Conservation groups were encouraged this month when the IUCN World Conservation Congress voted by a 90% majority to pass a resolution urging countries to close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw or worked elephant ivory. Last week Britain pledged to ban all domestic trade in ivory that could not be at least 70 years old.</p> <h2>White rhino</h2> <p>Swaziland has submitted a highly controversial last-minute proposal to be allowed to sell its stockpile of around 330kg of valuable southern white rhino horn and some 20kg annually from animals that died naturally. The proceeds from a one-off sale to traditional Chinese medicine hospitals would, it says, raise nearly $10m which, placed in an investment fund, could earn enough to pay for conservation and cover the $2m annual costs of running the country\u2019s three national parks. It argues that the 39-year-old worldwide ban on the sale of horn has clearly not worked, with more than 1,200 rhino killed a year in Africa, and that there is little likelihood of demand in China reducing. Far better, it says, to strictly control poaching and to trade judiciously with selected partners. The proposal has dismayed conservationists, who say that the animals are critically endangered and that any legal trade would provide cover for poaching and undermine existing international and domestic bans.</p> <h2>Pangolin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1e1f45a937c57f1c4986753920c7164b6b7fad/0_0_3771_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pangolin searching for ants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The critically endangerd pangolin is poached for meat and its scales and skin, which have become luxury fashion materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These burrowing, armour-shelled anteaters with sticky tongues are critically endangered and ranked as the world\u2019s most hunted mammals, with possibly a million illegally poached in the past 10 years for their meat, plus their scales and skins, which have become luxury fashion materials.

  "<p>When underdogs become overdogs, everything changes. They are the masters now, however much they try to pretend otherwise. Their power to change and ruin lives demands relentless and unforgiving scrutiny.</p> <p>The hangover from the long age of globalisation has hidden the existence of a new elite, let alone the need to hold it to account. The neoliberal order began from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, perhaps earlier with the elections of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in 1979/1980.

Its death was disguised because no new system stepped forward to replace it.</p> <p>Now its successor is shambling into view, like a figure from a bad dream you hoped you had forgotten. It is nationalism. The often demagogic and always deceitful nationalism you saw in the Brexit campaign and see now in the actions and policies of Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Vladimir Putin. Even the Syriza movement, held up by many as a respectable alternative to the old status quo, was powered as much by a <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/jim-armitage-now-greece-pays-the-price-for-its-anti-german-rhetoric-a2488661.html\" title=\"\">grotesque but authentically nationalist Germanophobia</a> as a socialist programme.</p> <p>Demagogic nationalism has to be fought. Not only because the promises it makes to its gullible supporters are plainly false, but for a reason many are still struggling to comprehend.

I agree one must accept that the collapse of European social democracy was caused in part by the failure of narrow, middle-class liberals to understand their fellow citizens. Technocrats thought the fact there was no evidence worth mentioning that immigrants steal jobs or depress wages meant opposition to immigration could be dismissed as irrational prejudice. They did not grasp that most of us, maybe all of us at some point in our lives, value the familiar and the local. New cultures that native Europeans did not understand, and new people whose mannerisms and expressions they could not read, unnerved them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the authoritarianism, which has turned left-liberalism into a movement for sneaks and prudes, was always going to play into the hands of the right. Free citizens have stopped listening to those who respond to the challenge of argument by <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prosecuting-paul-gascoigne-racist-comment-8900383\" title=\"\">screaming for the police to arrest the politically incorrect</a> or for universities to ban speakers who depart from leftish orthodoxy.</p> <p>There are good reasons for liberal guilt. There is much to be guilty about, after all. But guilt about \u201cliberal\u201d elitism make no sense. We do not have a liberal elite now. We have a bragging, nationalist and proudly ignorant elite. The \u201chard Brexit\u201d they are driving us towards will hurt the very workers who voted Leave. With Labour in the hands of the far left, it has, shamefully, fallen to the lone voice of George Osborne to warn that the nationalist elite <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37452356\" title=\"\">is about to threaten the jobs and living standards</a> of the very \u201chard-working\u201d people who so naively believed its promises.</p> <p>What applies at home applies abroad. The collapse of communism left America as the world\u2019s sole superpower. Even if its foreign policy was consistently benign, resentment of its dominance would have been inevitable. As it was, American power was far from being consistently benign and in the decades since 1989 anyone who questioned it was treated with the indulgence we always grant to Davids who take on a Goliath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/why-would-eu-appease-deluded-brexiters\">Why would the EU appease the deluded Brexiters? | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But see where American power stands today. Russia, Assad, Iran and Hezbollah break the Syrian ceasefire. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/un-aid-convoy-attack-syria-us-russia\" title=\"\">bomb aid convoys</a> and turn Aleppo into a 21th-century Dresden. Barack Obama and John Kerry do not look like imperious masters of a unipolar world now. They look like what they are: impotent and humiliated has-beens. Russia can do what it wishes in the Middle East. However loudly America complains it has no option but to tag along. For years, some of us have been writing against the immorality of politicians and intellectuals who excused Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Islamo-fascism, Saddam Hussein, the Iranian theocracy and the Russian kleptocracy. You get a measure of how deep the rot has spread when you notice that Trump, and the leaders of Ukip and the Front National are Putin admirers. You realise the scale of the corruption on the left when you find the leader of the British Labour party has worked as a <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/james-bloodworth-left-wing-case-against-comrade-jeremy-corbyn-1513969\" title=\"\">paid propagandist for Iranian state television</a>, defended Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Hamas and Hezbollah \u2013 and, not to be left out, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2015/10/i-wanted-believe-jeremy-corbyn-i-cant-believe-seumas-milne\" title=\"\">Putin too</a>. The moral disgust at their collaborations should never fade. But in our new age, moral arguments have a practical urgency. The destruction of Syria is pushing refugees into Europe, whose presence fuels support for the far-right parties Putin sponsors.</p> <p>Denunciations of American power, like denunciations of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and \u201cliberal elite\u201d, are worse than simplistic now. Like the twitching of a corpse, they are exhausted responses from a world that has gone. They still have propaganda value, no doubt about it. But in the world as it is rather than was, it is Brexiters who are pushing with a doctrinaire determination to leave Britain poorer and meaner than they found it; the extreme left and right that support the regimes that threaten us; and Russian rather than American imperialism that is throwing Europe into chaos.</p> <p>Liberal technocrats who \u201ctreat ordinary people as fools\u201d neither receive nor deserve a hearing. But show \u201cordinary people\u201d that their supposed champions have taken them for fools and you have a chance of breaking through. Then, maybe, they will listen.</p>",

  "<h2>For Donald Trump</h2> <p><strong>How can you be trusted with the nuclear codes?</strong></p> <p>A symbolic question, but one that goes to the heart of concerns about Trump\u2019s suitability for the job of commander-in-chief. He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-habitual-liar-presidential-debate\">Clinton: \u2018habitual liar\u2019 Trump must be curbed in presidential debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?</strong></p> <p>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?</strong></p> <p>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?</strong></p> <p>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?</strong></p> <p>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own. What proof does Trump have that climate change is a \u201choax\u201d?</p> <h2><strong>Trump is doing well if\u2026</strong></h2> <p>\u2026 he can convince viewers at home that he is not crazy. This low bar for success is a big cause for concern among Democrats. Trump has come a long way despite erratic and unpleasant behaviour on a unprecedented scale in modern politics. If he can walk offstage with people thinking he is not quite as erratic or rude as they thought, then it could make all the difference.</p> <h2><strong>For Hillary Clinton:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a52d62bdd27a7e6e46e8fa1a9a083ffa6181afc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52d62bdd27a7e6e46e8fa1a9a083ffa6181afc0/0_54_5041_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton speaks in Philadelphia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton speaks in Philadelphia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What single policy should your campaign be known for?</strong></p> <p>Harder than it sounds, or should be, this question gets at a weakness which many critics feels lies at the heart of the campaign. Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?</strong></p> <p>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/presidential-debate-preparation-trump-clinton\">Clinton and Trump's first presidential debate: will practice make perfect?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?</strong></p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?</strong></p> <p>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <h2>Clinton is doing well if\u2026</h2> <p>\u2026 Americans finish the debate with a clearer sense of what she stands for. Increasingly, the campaign has become defined by what it stands against \u2013 principally Donald Trump. While this is highly effective at motivating Democrats, it remains to be seen if this is enough to win over independent voters. Clinton needs to show them, not tell them, that she is on their side.</p>",

  "<p>Jeremy Corbyn was always going to win the Labour leadership. We live in an age of confident political predictions that are repeatedly proven to be unwise, but this was an outcome that was never in serious doubt. </p> <p>Yet it is difficult to think of a greater defiance of political odds in modern times. The nearest competitor? Corbyn\u2019s last election win. </p> <p>In the last year, Corbyn\u2019s leadership has been battered by the most relentless and extreme media campaign against a mainstream politician in modern British history. Labour MPs attempted to turf him out of his office in a botched coup at a time of national crisis, and 172 members of the parliamentary Labour party voted no-confidence in his leadership. </p> <p>A leadership team that had no expectation of winning last year has made repeated and undeniable mistakes in communication and strategy. Yet not only has Labour grown into perhaps Europe\u2019s biggest political party, but Corbyn has been granted an electoral mandate even greater than his overwhelming victory a year ago. Last year he won 59.5% of the vote. This time he won almost 62% among an even larger selectorate.</p> <p>After his victory last year, Corbyn\u2019s acceptance speech was criticised for having little to say about reaching out to the country as a whole. Not this time. He was passionate in his calls for unity: \u201cWe\u2019re part of the same Labour family,\u201d as he put it. No retribution, no bitterness. He made it clear that Labour was in it to win, would take it to the Tories and focus on developing a compelling alternative. He looked like a leader. Corbyn Mark II must carry on as he started.<br></p> <p>When Corbyn won last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-victory-easy-bit-grassroots\">I wrote</a> that his victory was the easy bit. That is as much of an understatement this time round as it was then. The Labour movement now brims with anger, mutual distrust and looming internecine warfare. The most hardened anti-Corbyn and pro-Corbyn factions are united by one belief: that they are in a war not of attrition but of annihilation, and that if they do not prevail they will be destroyed. </p> <p>The anger goes much further than the most passionate fringes. A large chunk of the Labour membership believe that MPs and the party hierarchy have declared war on them, have contempt for their democratic decisions and want them driven out forever. Many MPs fear they have been swamped by people who lack loyalty to the party and who are intolerant of dissent. If this fury is unchecked, then Labour will implode as a political force.<br></p> <p>Hope for the future lies with critical friends of the Labour leadership. They will be attacked by all sides. The uncompromising anti-Corbyn wing will see them as naive accomplices of electoral oblivion. The most ardent leadership loyalists will see them as naive capitulators to saboteurs who will never accept a left-led Labour party. In such a polarised atmosphere, nuance is regarded as flip-flopping, fence-sitting, standing in the middle of the road and being hit by traffic in both directions, to paraphrase Nye Bevan. But whatever derision they face, critical friends are pivotal to both the survival and success of the left in general, and Labour in particular.<br></p> <p>Critical friends will expect the parliamentary Labour party to accept and respect the second overwhelming democratic mandate granted by a mass membership in the space of a year. No undermining, no sabotage. That doesn\u2019t mean shutting up about disagreements and lying to their own consciences, but it is possible to express dissent in a way that doesn\u2019t inflict serious political damage. MPs should accept more democratic involvement by a mass membership they should see as an opportunity, not a threat. They should acknowledge that investment not cuts, tax justice, public ownership and a foreign policy that prioritises peace are now cornerstones of Labour party policy. If Labour is heading for calamitous defeat, then Corbyn\u2019s opponents need the leadership to own what happens. If they plot against the leadership, they risk being blamed.<br></p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s most ideological opponents should also take time to reflect on their own failures. Lacking a coherent and inspiring vision, they left a vacuum and are furious it was filled. When New Labour triumphed in 1997, social democrats were on the march across western Europe. Today, the German social democrats \u2013 whose leader promotes Blair-type third way politics \u2013 hover between 18% and 22% in the opinion polls. Spain\u2019s social democrats have a telegenic leader, but haemorrhage support to the radical left. If Labour\u2019s right had an obvious route map to power, they would not been in such a parlous state.</p> <p>Critical friends must put demands and pressure on the Labour leadership too. Given both their renewed mandate and the fury of much of the grassroots at the summer\u2019s events, it would be easy not to reach out. The appetite among many Labour members for mandatory reselection is real but must be resisted. It would simply destabilise the party. Corbyn and John McDonnell are passionately emphasising unity. That\u2019s exactly the tack to take. If the most militant anti-Corbynistas publicly attempt to undermine the leadership, ensure they always look like the unreasonable ones. With the leadership battle over, intra-party disputes need to be relegated to the burning priority of winning over the electorate. </p> <p>Issues that unite the party should be emphasised. See how Corbyn put Theresa May on the back foot over secondary moderns. Mistakes made last year were understandable, given the lack of preparation for a leadership victory that seemed unlikely. Those excuses are now gone. The leadership need to set out a clear, coherent vision that reaches beyond their passionate supporters. What exactly is Corbyn\u2019s project? What sort of country does Labour aspire to build, and how? How can he unite a country divided by the EU referendum? These questions need clear answers.</p> <p>The media strategy has often been lacking. That means prioritising the broadcast media, which is, after all, where most people get their news about politics. Older people are increasingly turning away from Labour. Winning them back is an existential challenge. Self-employed people will soon eclipse public sector workers in number. They need answers. The traditional Labour coalition is divided over both immigration and the EU. Those divisions need resolution. Labour\u2019s mass membership has so much potential, but there needs to be a strategy to mobilise them to go into communities and reach the unconvinced.</p> <p>Given the barrage of attacks the leadership has faced, the most passionate Corbyn supporters are infuriated by any criticism. But blind, uncritical cheerleading will undermine it. Critical friends are critical not because they want the left to fail. They are desperate for it to succeed. Ignoring challenges and problems, and pretending when things go wrong that it is always the media and the parliamentary party to blame, will lead to terrible defeat. Critical friends should cheer on the leadership when it gets it right, challenge attacks when they are unreasonable or worse, and criticise when the leadership gets it wrong. There is nothing more disloyal to the left than not saying uncomfortable things that have to be confronted if it is going to succeed. </p> <p>The 313,209 people who voted for Jeremy Corbyn are ecstatic at his victory.

  "<p>As many as 9,000 people could be moved from the Calais refugee camp to reception centres across France in the coming weeks, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said.</p> <p>On a visit to one of France\u2019s 164 such centres in the town of Tours on Saturday, the president reiterated his pledge to shut down the Calais camp, where thousands of people are sleeping rough in the hope of moving on to Britain. He said conditions there were not acceptable, especially for people fleeing war. </p> <p>The reception centres would hold 40 to 50 people each for up to four months while their cases were examined, Hollande said.

  "<p>Earlier this week British activist and researcher Andy Hall was found guilty of criminal defamation and computer crimes in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/british-activist-found-guilty-thailand-report-alleging-labour-abuses\" draggable=\"true\">shock ruling by a Bangkok criminal court</a> in Thailand. He was given a three-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and fined 150,000 baht (\u00a33,330).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The charges related to the publication of a report based on the worker interviews that he carried out in 2012 for Finnwatch, the Finnish civil society organisation of which I am the director. Migrant workers interviewed by Andy alleged that rights violations were occurring during the production of the pineapple juice products made by Natural Fruits that have been sold in Finland and other European countries. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes solutions, Thailand's export industries are at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Natural Fruit denies the allegations in the report. But rather than fully engaging with us as we prepared it, they instead sued Andy for his research. He was personally accused of defaming Natural Fruit, distributing Finnwatch report\u2019s findings on the internet and creating serious business impacts and loss of face for the company. <br></p> <p>During the long court hearings over this summer, Finland\u2019s largest retailer, S Group, who had stopped purchasing from Natural Fruit, testified that their decision had not been because of the Finnwatch report, but because Natural Fruit refused internationally recognised social responsibility audits. Thai companies testified that Andy\u2019s research was beneficial to improving labour practices. I testified that Finnwatch was responsible for both writing the report and publishing it \u2013 not Andy Hall. Still, in a surprise to the whole world, Andy was found guilty, even seemingly for events that didn\u2019t appear on the charge sheet he was indicted for. </p> <p>The court verdict is a clear sign that Thailand wants to stop Andy\u2019s work and his criticism of conditions in the country\u2019s labour-intensive export industries, which contribute so much to the Thai GDP. Andy is everything that a good human rights activist is: loud, persistent and undoubtedly annoying to those who end up on the wrong side of his criticism. He has lived in Thailand for more than 10 years and knows the domestic media, key civil society and business actors well. He is just as comfortable at the grassroots level, listening to migrant workers talk about their real-life challenges, as he is working within international forums, and on high-level diplomatic and media terrains. He is just as convincing in Thai as he is in English.</p> <p>The exposure of human rights violations, human trafficking and forced labour has cast a shadow over Thailand\u2019s reputation over the last decade. Diminishing trust has led to business enterprises changing their attitudes towards the country, which has become subject to increased scrutiny. Independent auditing of Thai factories has become more frequent. Some companies have stopped purchasing from the country altogether.</p> <p>But boycotts do not help to solve the problems and Thailand is too big an exporter for most businesses to replace in the short term. Thai and international companies have therefore turned to civil society for assistance \u2013 and one of those people they have asked for assistance is Andy Hall. He has been instrumental in building a dialogue between European companies and Thailand\u2019s labour intensive export industries. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/15/activists-terrorists-foreign-puppets-mohammad-halabi\">Human rights activists are being portrayed as terrorists and foreign puppets  | Danny Sriskandarajah</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maina Kiai, a UN special rapporteur, <a href=\"https://www.boell.de/en/2016/09/13/interview-maina-kiai-our-ideas-keep-living\">has warned</a> about closing space for people to engage with governments. He says that civil society can play a role like unlocking the lid on a pressure cooker, just as the heat is increasing and the cooker is about to explode. Andy has been keeping an eye on Thailand\u2019s own pressure cooker, voicing the concerns of millions of migrant workers, who are invaluable to the Thai economy but remain unorganised and without their own voice. Without people like Andy, who exposes challenges and proposes workable solutions, Thailand\u2019s export industries are at risk and that ambition to reach consumer markets in Europe is unlikely to be achieved.</p> <p>Several organisations in Europe have publicly stated their support for Andy. The UK\u2019s Ethical Trading Initiative expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d over the guilty verdict. The Foreign Trade Association, which represents 1,500 European companies, said it considered his guilty verdict \u201ca sad setback for human rights\u201d. That business enterprises take a stand in support of a human rights defender is unprecedented.</p> <p>When I spoke with Andy, he was adamant that we should not think that this case was just about him. Many migrant workers with whom he works closely with have been devastated by the verdict. If this can happen to Andy, who has a British passport and the support of the world behind him, what chance do they have to stand up for their rights, they ask?</p> <p>Thailand should wake up and realise before it\u2019s too late that the justice system and medieval laws that can be abused to stifle freedom of expression are about to lose the keys to the solution.</p> <p><em>Sonja Vartiala is executive director of Finnwatch </em><br></p>",

I probably played a couple of dozen games for them before we moved to Brockley, and sadly that was the beginning and the end of my football career. I was about eight.</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked out for them ever since. My dad was an Arsenal fan and would try very hard to cajole us all to go to the old Highbury with him. But my best friend, Barry Delaney, was a Liverpool fan and wouldn\u2019t allow me to support any other team. I\u2019ve always been a Liverpool fan, but it can be difficult to get to a game if you\u2019re not a season ticket holder; so about 10 years ago I started to go to the odd Dulwich match. You could always get a seat, because there would be only about 150 fans there.</p> <p>There are a lot of people here who want to develop the club as representative of the community, the whole community. We have a stand in aid of <a href=\"http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/\">Black History month</a> and we want to kick homophobia firmly out of football. As a non-league club with those values and virtues, we aim to set an example to the country as a whole. When people come to Dulwich, they see a lot of banners, campaigns and collections. Our eventual plan is for a fan-owned club, and the <a href=\"http://dhst.org.uk/\">Dulwich Hamlet Supporters\u2019 Trust</a> is a vehicle for that. I\u2019ve been elected to the trust\u2019s board and my job is to expand the community aspect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can go into the club bar after a game, have a pint of a local brew, and invariably the players will be next to you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People look at me and think, \u201cWhy\u2019s this guy supporting a seventh-tier club when he could be a Man U fan or something like that?\u201d For me, a local football club that\u2019s thriving and sustainable is quite amazing. When you go to a Premier League game, you don\u2019t really talk to the away fans. In non-league, you might be going to a stadium with only 100 people there, so you talk to the locals. You can go into the club bar after a game, have a pint of a local brew, and invariably the players will be next to you, perhaps also partaking in the local brew. If you\u2019re fond of a player in non-league, they really do have time for you. You can discuss the game with them \u2013 and even give them pointers as to where they\u2019re going wrong.</p> <p>I do have my favourite corner at the ground and I can\u2019t bring myself to move from it for superstitious reasons \u2013 even at half-time. There\u2019s a guy who has stood near me for seven or eight years. He has his coffee; I have my beer. I don\u2019t know his name; he doesn\u2019t know mine. But we chat about the game and have a great time. As long as I\u2019m around good people and I\u2019ve got my local pint, there aren\u2019t many other places on the planet I\u2019d rather be.</p> <h2><strong>Brenda Smith, 66, </strong><a href=\"http://www.somersetrebels.co/\"><strong>Somerset Rebels</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29ec95a9f6ae1c135d7731f8dea08d8ef0fabbc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ec95a9f6ae1c135d7731f8dea08d8ef0fabbc0/36_235_3804_4755/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Smith\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Both my mum and dad were keen on speedway motorcyle racing, so I was taken to watch <a href=\"http://bristolbulldogs.weebly.com/\">Bristol Bulldogs</a> at a very young age.

I even remember the turnstile we always went in: C16, right next to the pit wall that we\u2019d lean over. In those days, the riders wore throwaway goggles. I\u2019ve got a collection of them, discarded by my favourite riders.

She wanted to go to Manchester to see her favourite team, <a href=\"http://www.bellevueaces.co/\">Belle Vue Aces</a>. It became an annual pilgrimage every August. My dad got only two weeks\u2019 holiday a year, and our idea of a great family holiday was to travel to various speedway tracks: Monday night was Wimbledon, Tuesday night Southampton, Wednesday night New Cross, Thursday night Oxford, Friday night back to Bristol and Saturday night Swindon. There wasn\u2019t speedway on a Sunday in those days, so we\u2019d rest and then we\u2019d be off to Exeter and Poole and elsewhere the following week.</p> <p>Twelve years ago, I made a pilgrimage to the <a href=\"http://www.goteborg.com/en/ullevi/\">Ullevi Stadium in Gothenberg</a>. Going there had been an ambition of mine since I was a teenager, because my favourite rider growing up was the five-time world champion <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ove_Fundin\">Ove Fundin</a>, who was Swedish. When I got into the stadium for the practice session, I was quite overcome. I had goosebumps. And last year I travelled all the way to Australia to watch four separate speedway meetings.</p> <p>It\u2019s such an exciting sport. The Oak Tree Arena, where the Rebels race, is acclaimed by the riders as one of the best tracks in the country. The racing\u2019s really close. It\u2019s not always the first out of the gate who wins. Don\u2019t forget, there are no brakes on these bikes \u2013 it\u2019s all about throttle control and the way they drift their bikes, the way they line up their wheels. To see our riders either do a cut-back up the inside or blast round the outside is just mind-blowing. When you get home, you can\u2019t go to bed \u2013 you\u2019re too hyped up by what you\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>I crave that speedway smell. It\u2019s addictive.

Growing up, I wanted to be a cheerleader. There\u2019s a photo of me at a really young age with pom-poms, so I always knew.

I\u2019m 6ft 2in \u2013 a giant next to the girls. I look like Bigfoot. But the way the squad includes me in all the routines shows that you can be different and still have style and presence. It also shows you can pursue anything you have a passion for, regardless of social norms and stereotypes.</p> <h2><strong>Lynda Bacon, 51, Ilkeston FC</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f24d0d24e26c2b185c38ee1f974c67c5dd9caba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f24d0d24e26c2b185c38ee1f974c67c5dd9caba/31_562_3782_4727/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lynda Bacon\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My first match was in August 2011.

So when they were reformed as <a href=\"http://www.ilkestonfc.co.uk/\">Ilkeston FC</a>, a lot of people like me and my husband thought we should go and support them.</p> <p>I was astounded by the turnout. At that first game, there must have been more than a thousand people. Ilkeston Town\u2019s average crowd was about four or five hundred. I didn\u2019t buy a season ticket that first year, because I thought that when it got cold, my husband could go on his own. I don\u2019t know what happened, but within three months I was on the supporters\u2019 group committee, and a couple of months later I was organising the travel to away games.

At a match at Skelmersdale, we had three birthdays on the coach. One of the lads was turning 16, one was 50 and one was 80. It cost me a fortune in bunting and badges.

Our greatest rivals are Castleford, and their ground is barely two miles away.</p> <p>The population of Featherstone is about 10,000, so the relationship between the town and the club is utterly different from that in a big city. Many people think the only thing that can bring them glory is supporting a well-financed soccer team, but they\u2019re missing out. When I retired, I potentially had a lot of time on my hands. I\u2019ve never been the sort of person who can sit and do nothing. I used to write for the match-day programme quite a lot, and to my surprise the board asked me to edit the programme.

The conclusion, roughly, was \u201cProbably not, but you never know\u201d, which is all one can ever say safely. The only problem was the word \u201cbubble\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/south-sea-bubble\">The South Sea Bubble</a>, the all-time benchmark for market irrationality, lasted one year \u2013 1720 \u2013 when shares in the South Sea Company rose tenfold and then collapsed. The London property market has been rising, with brief interruptions, since the end of the second world war, when top-end houses cost around \u00a35,000.</p> <p>In the past 20 years, an era of low general inflation, the <a href=\"http://www.halifax.co.uk/house-price-index\">Halifax house price index</a> shows that values in London have multiplied by almost six. <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/previousReleases\">The Office for National Statistics figures</a>, which started later but dig deeper, suggest that in some of the richest areas of inner London, the 20-year increase is tenfold. Over 70 years, that \u00a35,000 house might have gone up to \u00a35m or \u00a310m \u2013 one or two thousand-fold. This long ago ceased to be a bubble. A hot-air balloon? A barrage balloon? The metaphor doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>It has become an entirely different phenomenon: a ceaselessly rising tide, occasionally drawing back after one wave breaks, but only to regather force for the next, even stronger, surge. This tide has not lifted all boats, but it has lifted a great many: metropolitan middle-class members of the baby-boom generation in particular, but others too. (Some have of course been drowned, but there you go.)</p> <p>It has sent ripples across the country, and down the class hierarchy. The Thatcherite council house sell-off created many more winners, particularly in London, and a new cockney diaspora cashed up and moved out, creating space \u2013 albeit nowhere near enough \u2013 for vast numbers of new Londoners: the hopeful young pouring in from across the UK and the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492451d5985406a8f08489de1052f0fe90e5694a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492451d5985406a8f08489de1052f0fe90e5694a/0_166_7184_4312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A basement conversion underway in Holland Park, west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A basement conversion underway in Holland Park, west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The outlines of this phenomenon have become so familiar that only rarely does anyone stand back and consider quite how astonishing it all is, and the extent to which the consequences have permeated every aspect of British life.</p> <p>Three years ago, the London-based American journalist Michael Goldfarb did stand back, for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/londons-great-exodus.html?_r=0\">an op-ed column</a> in the New York Times, which went viral, pointing out something that had not then been widely understood: how the most expensive London homes had ceased to be places to live and had become a store of global money. \u201cAlmost nothing has changed,\u201d says Goldfarb now, \u201cexcept that all the stresses in the system have got deeper. It will take an epochal catastrophe \u2013 like the great depression followed by a war \u2013 to allow ordinary people to get into the housing market. But no one will say this. It will be a London without Londoners.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing that has changed is that people will now rent rather than buy. But has there been anything done to protect tenants? Nothing. None of that conversation is being had, and it\u2019s shocking.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/19/city-resist-gentrification-displacement\">What is your city doing to resist gentrification?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, the Halifax house price index, which began 33 years ago, shows just how much deeper those stresses have become. From a base of 100 in 1983, the UK-wide index passed the 700 mark earlier this year. The separate Greater London index was still below 200 in 1996, towards the end of the negative-equity crisis, and under 700 in early 2013, but reached 1,128 in the second quarter this year. The average property sold in London fetched \u00a340,000 in 1983; the figure is now \u00a3449,000. (The next set of figures may show a slight post-Brexit dip, but only a slight one.)</p> <p>The structural facts have not changed. Supply and demand for homes in London are out of kilter because Britain is so over-centralised, and the road to success in almost every field of endeavour leads through the capital; because the UK is run by people who have made massive tax-free gains from the boom and have a mindset that the merest blip is a catastrophe; and because successive governments have had no coherent policy on anything relevant \u2013 certainly not on housing, regional policy or immigration.</p> <p>There are also strange sub-phenomena now taking place, designed to keep the mad times rolling. Parents are sinking their profits back into the market to help their children into the game. Well-off baby-boomer provincials are downsizing and moving to London to be near their children. Old houses that were subdivided into flats decades ago are now being undivided again, further reducing the stock of homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"389286d529ecd16ce7460c51737785b67aa3035d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/389286d529ecd16ce7460c51737785b67aa3035d/0_0_6654_4490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign announcing the opening of a new branch of Foxtons estate agents on Rye Lane in Peckham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign announcing the opening of a new branch of Foxtons estate agents on Rye Lane in Peckham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At street level, it is possible to see other subtle developments taking place \u2013 none of them intended, some of them astonishing. Each district, each sub-district, or even each street, has its own nuances and variations. It cannot just be said that the top 1% are gaining at the expense of the 99%, which was never the whole truth. Now the 1% are themselves finding themselves overmatched by the 0.1% or the 0.01% or the 0.001%.</p> <p>Take Chelsea, an area that has been in fashion, with artistic tendencies, since at least Victorian times. In this portion of London, the wealth has now entirely submerged the raffishness and even the trendiness. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any Sloane Rangers anywhere near Sloane Square,\u201d reflected Michael Stephen, the former MP who is now chairman of the <a href=\"http://chelseasociety.org.uk/\">Chelsea Society</a>\u2019s planning committee. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to live there.\u201d</p> <p>Fewer and fewer people are doing anything as quaint as actually living in Chelsea. The signs are obvious from the streets: constant darkness at dusk and closed blinds at noon are the outward indicators of an empty flat, ownership likely foreign and opaque. And there is anecdotal evidence that this is starting to make local businesses unviable.</p> <p>Close to Chelsea Green is <a href=\"http://www.savethesuttonestate.co.uk\">the Sutton Estate</a>, a not unhandsome collection of 15 Edwardian red-brick blocks \u2013 originally 500 flats in all \u2013 now in urgent need of an upgrade. Affinity, the housing association that owns the estate, plans to knock down all but two of the blocks and rebuild: the result will be 316 flats at \u201csocial\u201d rent (much cheaper than the misleadingly titled \u201caffordable\u201d rent), to be funded by building 106 for private sale.</p> <p>The Chelsea Society has been closely involved, and is sympathetic to Affinity\u2019s problems. \u201cThey can choose to spend their money anywhere in the country. And they can build four social housing units somewhere else for the price of one in Chelsea,\u201d says Stephen. Nonetheless, the quantity of social housing in central London will decrease even if the quality improves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88592232cdeabda17e07ed54508f0711a3c297a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88592232cdeabda17e07ed54508f0711a3c297a/0_0_7039_4793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cobbler Matthew Childs, who works in Chelsea, but lives in Surrey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think there are any kids here now\u2019 \u2026 Cobbler Matthew Childs, who works in Chelsea, but lives in Surrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Round the corner is the Chelsea Green Shoe Repairs, run by Matthew Childs, a bubbly bloke who still serves the kind of Chelsea resident who buys shoes classy enough to be worth repairing.

The next phase is on its way. Whitfield took me into a narrow alley leading to the huge Bussey Building, a former sporting goods factory. When dereliction came, the shell became a hangout for prostitutes and drug addicts, then home to a dozen or more African churches. Now it is an informal <a href=\"http://www.clfartcafe.org/\">arts centre</a>, with a <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/film/rooftop-film-club-peckham-rye\">rooftop cinema</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/25/restaurant-review-franks-cafe-campari-bar\">bar</a>, 60-odd studios for the kind of artists who would once have gravitated to Chelsea or Holland Park, and loads of \u201cprofessional co-working spaces\u201d where wannabe creatives and techies can ply their trade sociably.</p> <p>\u201cIt all seems wonderful,\u201d I remark to a manager, who is disinclined to give his name, but happy to extol the glittering future that awaits Peckham. \u201cBut if Peckham comes up as you say, this won\u2019t be an arts centre for long. It\u2019ll be worth too much for housing, won\u2019t it?\u201d He raises his eyebrows a little and smiles an enigmatic smile. But less cryptic answers are available. Not far away, a sign announces the impending arrival of the famously aggressive chain of estate agents, Foxtons.</p>",
  "<p>The rising sun glints off a silver and jade ring on a rangy hand.

Otherwise, it could not keep up with demand. Fresh milk is not an easy product to handle in the heat, and collecting it from an area of 32km is a tricky business. Hardly any of the families are accessible by road so the motorbike-trailer is the only way to get to them.

But despite the international interest, Bathily says that his focus will remain on helping herders. He has already started buying wholesale feed to sell to herders at affordable prices. This has stopped the need for the herders to migrate 400-600km every year to find grazing for their cows during the dry season.</p> <p>Despite the stellar growth, this year is the first in which Bathily expects to balance the books, partly because the tax situation makes it very difficult to sell at competitive prices. The tax on imported milk powder is 7%, while all the taxes associated with collecting local milk add up to 30%. </p> <p>Still, what he calls \u201cthe crazy milk of the desert\u201d will stay at the heart of his business.

  "<p>Six months ago, Ibrahim Farouk, a 21-year-old university student who drove a minibus for extra money, started his day doing a routine job shuttling four neighbourhood men he vaguely knew around Cairo.</p> <p>His passengers that day \u2013 three members of a single family and a close friend of theirs \u2013 were known to be petty criminals and had a history of run-ins with the authorities. Two had served time in jail for stealing a wallet in 2001 and one had been a drug addict. The men\u2019s relatives say they were heading to a decorating job in the suburb of Tagammu al-Khamis, but the group never made it to their destination.</p> <p>They were killed in a hail of police gunfire. Within hours of their death, Egyptian authorities accused them of being part of a gang of thieves that targeted foreigners, and an alleged house raid linked them to a heinous act<strong>: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/egyptian-police-investigated-giulio-regeni-days-before-his\">the torture and murder of an Italian researcher named Giulio Regeni</a>. The battered and disfigured body of the 28-year-old Cambridge PhD student, who was pursuing sensitive research in Egypt, had been found in a roadside ditch between Cairo and Alexandria seven weeks earlier.</p> <p>Pro-government media quickly published graphic pictures of the blood-spattered bodies of the five dead Egyptians \u2013 Tarek Saad Abdel Fattah, 52; his son Saad Tarek Saad, 26; his son-in-law Salah Ali Sayed, 40; Mostafa Bakr, 60; and Farouk. Egypt\u2019s interior ministry said the men died in a shootout with police, even though the pictures showed no guns inside or around the minibus and witnesses described the men as trying to flee when the police opened fire. The bullets so disfigured Farouk\u2019s face that his fiancee initially said he was unidentifiable.<br></p> <p>Soon after that, the ministry said that Regeni\u2019s belongings \u2013 including his passport and a wallet \u2013 had been found in the home of one of the accused, who in death was unable to defend himself.<br></p> <p>In Egypt, officials may have had reason to hope that the identification of Regeni\u2019s alleged killers would put the case to rest. Experts and Italian officials had suspected from the outset that elements of the Egyptian state had carried out the murder, despite the government\u2019s staunch denials. The murder led to a major diplomatic incident between the two countries. </p> <p>In Rome the story that the men in the minibus had killed Regeni immediately smacked of a cover-up, according to a senior Italian official, and was quickly disregarded. Now, following months of acrimony between Egyptian and Italian officials over the still unsolved murder, the shooting has become a mere footnote in the tragedy.</p> <p>Egyptian officials have admitted that the group were unlikely to have had any involvement in Regeni\u2019s killing. Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, said earlier this month that while the case was still under investigation, the link between the five men and Regeni\u2019s death was weak.<br></p> <p>After initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/italy-recalls-ambassador-egypt-talks-death-student-giulio-regeni\">recalling its ambassador to Egypt at the height of diplomatic tensions</a>, Italy has since announced a replacement, though in a sign of the still-frosty relationship he has not yet been sent to Cairo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e111040b98b36e60c412c6e0a33d6905583b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e111040b98b36e60c412c6e0a33d6905583b47/0_39_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Giulio Regeni\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giulio Regeni was a PhD student at Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raffaele Marchetti, a professor of international relations at Luiss University in Rome who has followed the case, said Italy had witnessed a slight improvement in Egyptian officials\u2019 cooperation in the ongoing investigation into Regeni\u2019s murder, and that there was an expectation that Egypt could still arrest an official, possibly a low level officer, which would acknowledge some state culpability.</p> <p>\u201cThis has not been formalised, of course, but if you add all the pieces that have been coming up in recent weeks, they point to the idea that, yes, there is the beginning of a recognition of an institutional responsibility,\u201d Marchetti said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the families of the five men are united by a sad fact. They do not have the money or the connections to seek justice in Egypt. Four relatives of the victims have also been detained without any assurances that they will be released. </p> <p>It is a bitter new reality for the family, compared with the their last gathering, on 2 March, when they met to celebrate the birthday of Tarek\u2019s wife, Mabrouka. Video footage of the party shows the family singing and clapping. Salah pulls faces when the camera is pointed at him, the candles on the birthday cake illuminating their smiles. His young brother-in-law Sameh, the person who would later identify Salah\u2019s body, stands in a corner sulkily. Less than two weeks later, three of them would be lying in Cairo\u2019s Zeinhom morgue. Two others would end up behind bars. </p> <p>Salah and Tarek had become close friends, working together for more than 15 years painting houses or renting and selling cars.

She said that the accusation that the group was a criminal gang hailed back to an incident in 2001, when Salah and Tarek were stopped at a police checkpoint after finding a wallet belonging to someone from the interior ministry, and subsequently imprisoned for two and three years respectively. </p> <p>\u201cEven Regeni\u2019s mother says the five who were killed were not the ones who committed this crime,\u201d said Um Yasser, the former wife of Mostafa Bakr, another victim. \u201cSo why did the police officers not even leave one of them alive to ask him this question?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/why-was-he-killed-brutal-death-of-italian-student-in-egypt-confounds-experts\">Why was he killed?

Like Saad and Salah, he had had his brushes with the law. He spent 12 years of his marriage in prison on a drug conviction. </p> <p>It was his son, who declined to give his name for fear of his safety, who would later identify Bakr\u2019s body, before taking a silver and turquoise ring from his father\u2019s dead hand in the morgue. He recalled with his eyes closed and a shudder how his father\u2019s right arm was broken from a bullet above the right elbow. Two more bullets shattered the front of his skull close to the hairline.. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>His family say his wrists were red as though he had been handcuffed. Sameh, who also viewed the bodies, said that Salah had been shot multiple times across the body and in the right ankle and that Saad\u2019s face showed signs of grazing and scars, as though he had been dragged along the floor.</p> <p>The police arrived at Bakr\u2019s family home by 10am on the day of the shooting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b395fa54414c17628221af1275c57cdc032393/495_114_3005_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paola Regeni, mother of Giulio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paola Regeni, mother of Giulio, during a press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Casilli/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The house of Tarek\u2019s wife Mabrouka was also raided the same day, leading Egyptian police to declare that they had found Regeni\u2019s possessions and documents inside before arresting Mabrouka along with Tarek\u2019s sister, who is also called Rasha. The pair have been held since March, accused of handling stolen goods.</p> <p>The family said that many of the belongings reported to be Regeni\u2019s in photos taken by police following the raid were actually theirs. A wallet emblazoned with the word \u201clove\u201d belongs to Mabrouka, the watch belongs to Sameh, one wallet was Salah\u2019s and the telephone, headphones and brown aviator sunglasses were all Saad\u2019s, they said.</p> <p>It is not clear \u2013 especially since Egyptian officials now say the five were likely unconnected to Regeni\u2019s death \u2013 how the Italian researcher\u2019s passport, bank card and ID documents arrived at Tarek\u2019s sisters\u2019 apartment. There were no withdrawals from Regeni\u2019s bank account and Italian officials said his mobile phone has never been found. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they dragged us into this situation,\u201d said Sameh. </p> <p>Saeed Youssef, a defence lawyer who represents Mabrouka, Tarek\u2019s sister and two other family members still held in pre-trial detention, described the latest statement by Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor as an insult.</p> <p>Farouk, the minibus driver, had been with his fiancee, Aya Khalid, for eight years and was engaged for almost two. After his kiosk burned down last year, Khalid\u2019s father had given him the microbus to allow him to make a living driving people around. Khalid insists Farouk and the other four men knew each other from the neighbourhood, but that was the extent of their relationship. His bride-to-be had not picked out a wedding dress when he was killed, She had wanted to save the detail for last so that Farouk could choose it with her.</p> <p>Farouk\u2019s family describe his body as missing the left side of his face, and say that his legs showed signs of bruising and a severe beating. \u201cHe never hid anything from me,\u201d said his fiancee. \u201cI know for sure he never worked with these people, whether they are convicted or not. That was the first time.\u201d</p> <p>She said she hoped to bring charges against the police officer in charge of the case, but to do so would be to stand against a mass of state machinery. The officer in question is known locally by a nickname that translates as \u201cthe one who cracks the whip\u201d. </p>",
  "<p>The first thing that struck me when it arrived was the smell of polish, lingering long after my dad had stopped \u201cnourishing the wood\u201d or my mum had finished with the Pledge. I was overwhelmed by its size, too. My 18-year-old son couldn\u2019t get his knees into the well and I couldn\u2019t get my laptop on the desktop with any wrist room. Dad\u2019s desk had always seemed so imposing in the bay window of his study, keeping him company while he marked into the night (he was a teacher), wrote his endless sermons (he was a preacher after he retired), or read.</p> <p>It is funny how memory works \u2013 maybe the polish was my olfactory memory kicking in \u2013 and how lost and diminished this once enormous piece of furniture looked now in my study, miles away from its home.</p> <p>My father\u2019s desk wasn\u2019t originally meant for me, or for computers and home hubs. He bought it way back when there was an auction house round the corner from the flat where we grew up in Merseyside where my parents loved to go each Saturday morning for a mooch and to marvel at what people paid for junk. This, he felt, was designed for him. He saw through a dusty old top-scratched Edwardian twin pedestal dressing table, loving the mahogany plinths and frame and walnut-fronted, graduated drawers with their handmade dovetail joints. He made his bid and brought it home, removing the mirror and fitting a new red leather writing top. I saw him, shirt sleeves rolled up, polishing the wood and individual drop brass handles and marvelling at its splendour.&#xa0;</p> <p>From that day it became his intensely private space, where he stored personal things and where he found most peace. He\u2019d never have used the word meditation, but this was his moment in the day and would, he said, shape what came after it.</p> <p>My children and I decided to share the drawers between us but they were still full of Dad\u2019s stuff. He died a few years before Mum and she had \u2013 I realise now \u2013 never cleared it out. When she died this was the one thing bequeathed specifically to me. Probably because I am a writer, perhaps it\u2019s a last nag from heaven knows where to slow down and find peace in my working day.&#xa0;</p> <p>The top drawers were Dad\u2019s stationery store and now a homage to pre-computing days with hole punchers and reinforcement rings, metal-ended treasury tags and an embossed cast-iron address stamp that headed hundreds of handwritten letters in its day. There were ink pens and blotting paper, too, and a small magnifying glass had given way to a bigger one, complete with light, a reminder of that slow loss of sight that was to signal my father\u2019s demise. A cigarette lighter in its own, well-worn leather pouch, was hidden in the corner from when my father used to smoke, a habit he picked up when he started work at 14 and gave up when my elder brother was born in 1960 \u2013 apart, that is, from precious but occasional gifts of cigars.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2eab0713125a75d89522727f6060c68eb9106fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eab0713125a75d89522727f6060c68eb9106fc5/464_665_5237_3142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny and her father, Cyril Filder, in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenny and her father, Cyril Filder, in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We found a King Edwards\u2019 box, heavy with the scent of this rationed luxury, in the drawer below. It was filled with mementoes \u2013 the stuff of the life he\u2019d had before I came along and never asked enough about. A card commemorating the 1934 opening of the first Mersey tunnel (which he\u2019d walked through aged six with his parents), a fading photo of a sister he lost as a child, and photos of him, alone, in his boy scout uniform and on the beach at Llandudno.</p> <p>An old leather autograph book opened with a message from his parents, and had been filled with names of pals I vaguely remembered from his stories about school in Liverpool and war-time evacuation to north Wales. There was a certificate from the War Office marking my grandfather\u2019s bravery in the first world war and underneath Dad\u2019s own national service card and some leave papers, a pack of cards and a tiny black and white picture of him and his best friend in Berlin, both in uniform bearing Brylcreemed hair and swaggery smiles.</p> <p>In the drawer below that, newspapers, Liverpool Echos mostly. I sat and scanned, searching for a clue to their safe keeping. One marked the 1971 opening of the second Mersey tunnel (Dad walked us through it), another \u2013 August 1959 \u2013 contained my parents\u2019 engagement announcement, the day that Dad always described as the happiest of his life.</p> <p>I found his wallet, instantly familiar. The brown, shiny, scratched leather that throughout my childhood would slide out of his breast pocket when it was time to pay for cinema tickets or ice-creams, train rides or funfairs. It had been replaced by my mother when it started to fall apart at the seams. The wallet had been stuffed with mementoes, like a catalogue of memories designed to bring some order to our grief, a reminder that my father\u2019s life was bigger and better than the last difficult years. Postcards from places he\u2019d visited with Mum, foreign stamps he\u2019d probably meant to file in his collection, out-of-date passports stamped with the places he loved to travel to, the first letter I wrote from university when letters were the easiest way to stay in touch, pictures of us as babies, on our first day of school, of holidays, weddings and christenings. And there were lots of photos of Mum, including one of her standing shyly on a promenade where they\u2019d met.&#xa0;</p> <p>In another drawer, my children found chocolate, white and cracked with age, which made them laugh because Dad always had chocolate hidden away for them. It also made me pause because it came in a tin bearing a yellow taxi cab and the words \u201ca souvenir from The Big Apple\u201d. We\u2019d brought it when the two of us flew to New York to catch something spectacular before he lost his sight completely. It was such a happy memory for him, but the taxi reminded me of how needlessly mad I\u2019d got that he insisted on befriending every taxi driver, the fare gauge still ticking as he engaged in long conversations (the hallmark of Scousers), learning more about them than the sights we\u2019d come to see.&#xa0;</p> <p>I was ready to stop, but my 14-year-old daughter was&#xa0;unpacking tons of scribbled papers \u2013 endless pictures of felt-tipped flowers and dogs and families \u2013 all her gifts to Grandad as she\u2019d sat on his knee at this desk to draw. My son had discovered something else, way back in the bottom drawers. Dad\u2019s diaries, and stacks of them. These leather-bound Letts volumes were an annual gift to my father from one of us. This was where he filed his resolutions and ambitions and recorded events. I didn\u2019t feel I should look at his diaries, even now, but my son had searched out his birth date and found it, and every birthday, and every subsequent babysitting booking or visit to our home since, recorded in Dad\u2019s neat inked pen, each accompanied by a penned emoticon smiley face, standing out at odds with the formality of the other entries. Letting down his guard for a moment, my 18-year-old greeted them like a last reassuring hug from his grandfather and sat among the piles trying to count the countless days they\u2019d spent together each year.</p> <p>And then we put everything back.</p>",
  "<h2>Keith Richards\u2019 Lost Weekend </h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC4<br></strong>Keith Richards appears indestructible. But this time last year we thought that about Lemmy, Prince and Bowie. BBC4 has wisely determined that we must enjoy the venerable guitar-slinger while we can, and has handed him control of the channel for three days. As well as a fascinating interview with Julien Temple, look out for a curated selection of the culture that has informed this remarkable rock\u2019n\u2019roll outlaw. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Labour Leadership Result </h2> <p><strong>11am, BBC2<br></strong>Victoria Derbyshire presents live coverage from the Labour Party conference in Liverpool as the result of its leadership contest is finally announced. The outcome has been a near-certainty for months, the process farcically protracted. But can a party whose PLP and membership/leadership have been at loggerheads find a way of working together, or will this week see the airing of further mutual recriminations leading to an eventual split? <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>The X Factor </h2> <p><strong>8pm, ITV<br></strong>Control your excitement X Factor fans, for tonight sees the first Six Chair Challenge. This weekend, the acts must sing in front of a real live audience before the judges decide who goes through to the next stage. Expect a tense moment or two as Mrs Osbourne, Louis and the gang make their minds up about who takes those hallowed seats. It\u2019s worth watching for the chance of some panto-style controversy from the panel, all highly experienced in the ways of the Factor. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Walking Through Time </h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4<br></strong>Around 1.2bn years ago, a vast meteorite hit Scotland. But where exactly did it land? You\u2019d think this would be obvious but, as paleontologist Dr Tori Herridge explains, time and shifting tectonic plates can cover up a lot of evidence. This deep-time variation on the Walking Through History format works a treat, both because it has a fascinating scientific detective story to tell and because Herridge is adept at bringing such tales to life. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4<br></strong>New series of the word-wrangling panel show, with guests including David Walliams (AKA all the Carry On films stuffed into one suit) and Jonathan Ross (who brings along some cat nappies as a mascot). Isy Suttie is in Dictionary Corner alongside Susie Dent, Jon Richardson has brought a Ouija board to assist him (\u201cat various points I may go into a trance-like state\u201d), and there are two faintly rude-sounding anagrams for you to untangle. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Alcatraz: Search For The Truth </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Blaze<br></strong>Blaze is US network A+E\u2019s first free UK channel (think a more outdoorsy Dave), and this is among its first docs. The Anglin brothers were sent to \u201cthe rock\u201d for robbing a bank with a toy gun in 1960, escaping with another prisoner, Frank Morris, in 1962. They were thought to have died in the attempt. Now their nephews present evidence that suggests they survived, and may still be alive. Despite its reality TV feel, this is an absorbing tale. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>The Gardens of Pompeii </h2> <p><strong>8pm, Sky Arts<br></strong>Since its burial by Mount Vesuvius in 79AD, Pompeii has existed in collective memory as the definition of desolation. This film reminds us, however, that Pompeii was not merely a living city, but one especially famous for its glorious flora; Pliny the Younger recorded 41 varieties of pears alone. In fact, the gardens were part of the reason for the city\u2019s pre-volcano status as a preferred playground for ancient Rome\u2019s hedonistic aristocrats. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f627608eddd5c7e9d745f63b00f4371cfbbc3d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f627608eddd5c7e9d745f63b00f4371cfbbc3d80/0_0_2919_1752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I Walked with a Zombie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A creepy, shadowy twilight chiller \u2026 I Walked with a Zombie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Monsters<br>(Gareth Edwards, 2010, 11.25pm, Film4</strong><br>A sci-fi romance about a space capsule that has crashed in Mexico, spawning enormous alien beasts.

  "<p>I have been making a lot of fruit pies recently. I\u2019m on a trip back to the US, and reacquainting myself with my American roots \u2013 I can\u2019t seem to stop myself from cooking in bulk, and inviting lots of people over to share what I\u2019ve made. One bake that accommodates this is a slab pie. Baked in a sheet pan, the filling isn\u2019t as thick as a typical fruit pie, so it\u2019s perfect for pastry lovers. The rectangular shape means even portions for all, it\u2019s free of embellishment, and it\u2019s homely and welcoming, as a good pie should be.</p> <p>And it is finally grape season. I look forward to it all year. It presents the perfect excuse to make a grape pie. There is no denying that making one requires patience. You will probably make this just once a year, as the season is relatively short and the effort is considerable \u2013 but it really is a special pie, and well worth the time. </p> <p>Seek out the best grape varieties for this: in markets, delis or even online. Normal table grapes are not the same. American <a href=\"http://www.concordgrape.org/bodyhistory.html\">concord</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_(grape)\">isabella (fragola)</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_labrusca\">grapes</a> have captured my culinary imagination for decades. The flavour is so striking, it\u2019s borderline artificial \u2013 a taste like the juice and bubble gum of childhood. Muscat grapes are another favourite of mine \u2013 the magically perfumed pale purple or soft celadon green grapes used in muscat wine making. Both of these are wonderful eating grapes, but are not as popular \u2013 I assume because of their bitter and astringent seeds. But why forego flavour because of a few annoying seeds?</p> <p>You can make grape icings for cakes and cupcakes, which provides a beautiful, rich, purple buttercream colour that\u2019s totally natural. Another way to make the most of this glorious fruit is to make a jelly. Not the pudding kind, but the kind you spread on white sandwich bread with peanut butter, like a jam. You could also serve the jelly alongside a cheddar toastie for dipping. Salty-sweet perfection.</p> <h2><strong>Grape slab pie</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 12</strong><br>560g plain flour, sifted <br>2 tsp fine sea salt <br>340g unsalted butter, cold<br>8 tbsp iced water<br>4 tbsp milk or cream, for brushing<br>4 tbsp caster sugar, for sprinkling</p> <p><strong>For the filling</strong><br>1.25kg ripe muscat or fragolina/isabella (fragola) grapes (weight before removing stems)<br>1 vanilla bean, scraped<br>Zest of a lemon<br>2 tbsp lemon juice<br>150g light brown sugar<br>50g caster sugar<br>5 tbsp cornflour<br>\u00bd tsp fine sea salt <br>A pinch of grated nutmeg<br>2 apples</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a19fa25dfa4b4b9cd2da468649c3aca021dc430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a19fa25dfa4b4b9cd2da468649c3aca021dc430/0_0_3000_4200/714.jpg\" alt=\"grape slab pie\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seek out the best grape varieties for this: in markets, delis or even online.

Add half the butter. Combine well using a cutting motion. Add the second half of the butter and rub in until your mix forms roughly pea-sized pieces.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Sprinkle over the iced water (holding back the ice) and toss it through the mix as you go. The dough should start to become raggedy and eventually, when all the water is added, it will come together into a ball. Divide the ball in half, wrapping each piece in clingfilm. Flatten them into squares and rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours \u2013 any longer than this, put it in the freezer.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> To make the filling, stem the grapes, then separate the skins from the pulp by pinching each grape to squeeze out the pulp. Set aside the skins. Heat the pulp along with the scraped vanilla bean and seeds, plus the lemon zest, in a heavy saucepan until it is soft and beginning to separate from the grape seeds (about 10 minutes). Pour the pulp through a mesh sieve placed over a bowl. Press through with a plastic pastry scraper or the back of a wooden spoon until all the pulp is in the bowl. Discard the grape seeds. Rinse and dry out the vanilla bean for another purpose. Add the lemon juice to the pulp.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> In another large bowl, whisk together the sugars, cornflour, salt and nutmeg. Slowly whisk the strained grape mixture into the sugar mixture and add the grape skins back in. Peel, core and chop the apples and add to the grape mixture.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Preheat the oven to 210C/410F/gas mark 6\u00bd.

Press the pastry down into the prepared sheet, then chill in the fridge while you roll out the other piece. The second pastry sheet (which will form the top of the pie) can be rolled out to 23 x 33cm. Remove the chilled pastry and carefully fill it with the grape mixture. It can come right up to about 2mm shy of the top of the tin but don\u2019t let it overflow. Roll the top layer of pastry over the pie. Brush the pastry with milk. Fold or roll over the excess pastry and pinch to seal. Use a knife to pierce the top of the pie a few times. Put in your freezer or fridge for 20 minutes.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Brush the edge of the pie with the milk or cream and sprinkle with caster sugar. Line the bottom of your oven with foil to catch the drips, and bake for about 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for another 35-45 minutes or until golden and the bubbles of filling coming through are thick.

Tie the cloth up and leave overnight to drain all of the juice.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> In a clean pot, combine the juice, jam sugar and the lemon juice. Warm over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Turn the heat up to high and boil for 15 minutes.
