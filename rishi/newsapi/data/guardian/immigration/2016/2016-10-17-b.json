Daesh [another name for Islamic State] are mostly moving around on motorbike and have small and heavy guns.

He is a Shia who has survived the past two years under Islamic State (Isis) control by passing himself off as Sunni. </p> <p>He said he thought the airstrikes were mostly precisely targeted on Isis but added: \u201cDaesh are moving into civilian houses and mixing with the population. For example Daesh has placed a large depot of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] in a house next to my cousin\u2019s house. I begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me as the house could be targeted by coalition. He refused and said: \u2018Whatever destiny brings.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople have had enough in Mosul, the majority want Daesh to go as soon as possible and would like to see the Iraqi army and peshmerga enter the city,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen too many beheadings, people being drowned in cages, thrown from top of buildings ... I myself saw a man thrown off a building near the governor\u2019s office around three months ago. I couldn\u2019t sleep for a week afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>US aircraft have begun dropping 7m leaflets over the city, urging civilians to stay in their homes and giving advice on how to protect themselves from flying glass and comfort their children when the bombs drop. It advised residents not to attempt to flee.

It is also helping set up camps to help people displaced by the fighting. Hadidi\u2019s greatest fear was that Shia militias might carry out sectarian reprisals on the local people after the city is liberated from Isis. </p> <p> Hadidi added that the council adopted a decision, which it passed to the Iraqi government, to oppose the participation of Shia militias in the mission to retake Mosul. \u201cWe do not want to go back to the time of sectarian war and killing civilians.

They could not flee because they could not afford the cost of traveling to Turkey. Besides it is very risky. If Isis militants get hold of anyone fleeing, they will execute him immediately. I paid more than $2,000 (\u00a31640) to flee with the help of a smuggler who took us to Syria and then to Turkey,\u201d Firas said.</p> <p>\u201cI will get back to Mosul as soon as it is liberated. Only God knows how long the battle will last because Isis won\u2019t give up easily. They have been reinforcing their forces to be ready for the attack.

I would say the airstrikes are very precise but around 10% of casualties, in my estimate, are civilians. </p> <p>Daesh are moving into civilian houses and mixing with the population. For example Daesh has placed a large depot of IEDs in a house next to my cousin\u2019s. I begged him to leave his house and bring his family to stay with me, as the house could be targeted by coalition. He refused and said [he accepts] whatever destiny brings. </p> <p>People have had enough in Mosul. The majority want Daesh to go as soon as possible and would like to see the Iraqi army and peshmerga to enter the city. </p> <p>We have seen too many beheadings, people being drowned in cafes, thrown from buildings, etc. People have even offered to sacrifice animals if they see Daesh [go[ and get rid of them. I myself saw a man thrown off a building near the governor\u2019s office around three months ago. I could not sleep for a week afterwards. </p> <p>It\u2019s difficult for civilians to leave the city because a ditch has been dug around many neighborhoods, especially east of the city.

Their presence indicates that US troops, while not formally in a combat role, are on the frontlines and willing to use substantial airpower on Iraq\u2019s second city.</p> <p>The US command\u2019s acknowledgment of their presence is a departure from previous battles in two years\u2019 worth of war against Isis. Members of Congress have criticised the Pentagon for relaying airstrike spotting through coordination cells far from the fight, including in an operations centre in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Erbil.</p> <p>Having US troops spotting airstrikes is both the latest departure from Barack Obama\u2019s pledge against having \u201cboots on the ground\u201d and an effort at ensuring greater specificity and lethality against Isis targets in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\" data-alt=\"mosul\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-zip/giv-1406yxT7GAC08tV7/\">mosul</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cJTACs are the difference between precision bombing and area bombing,\u201d said Christopher Harmer, a former US Navy pilot who said their presence indicated the US is willing to \u201cincur casualties\u201d in Mosul.</p> <p>\u201cWith JTACs, you can select individual targets in real time and accurately strike them. Without JTACs, you can only bomb a general area and hope for success.\u201d</p> <p>The UK and France are also believed to have their own special forces involved in retaking Mosul.

France has sent approximately 150 troops to operate four 155mm Caeser howitzers as part of its Task Force Wagram. The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, carrying 24 Rafale combat planes, is also in the eastern Mediterranean to support the war.</p> <p>As the long-anticipated battle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">began on Monday</a>, US warplanes launched substantial bombing runs on positions around Mosul.

It could add fuel to the sectarian fires raging in the region and so we have urged the Iraqi government not to use the Shia militias. That is the greatest danger that we see. We actually told them to disband them, and yet they have not. They are being managed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. They are brutal.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that although there had been reassurances from the Iraqi government about the deployment of Shia militias, he was not sure the Iraqi government was fully in control. He said the Iranians played a role, the Revolutionary Guards played a role, and sometimes the militias acted independently of the government. He said he supported the attack on Mosul, adding: \u201cWe support any objective which is to destroy al-Qaida absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>But he did not propose the Saudis should play a role in the reconstruction of Mosul if it is liberated. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the Iraqis have the second largest oil reserves in the world.</p> <p>There are a number of tribes that extend from Saudi Arabia into Iraq so a lot of Iraqis have kinsmen in Saudi Arabia so our history is intertwined, and so is our future, but we have to get off this sectarian track.</p> <p>The Iraqis need to find a way to have a more incredible government \u2013 they found a way in 2014 when they removed Maliki.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jubier said that if the Daesh were forced out of Mosul, they were likely to go on to Syria, adding its president, Bashar al-Assad, would allow them to grow.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T14:06:00.063Z\">at 3.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804d1ece4b08feb7300a46e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mona-mahmood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:30:57.489Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague, <strong>Mona Mahmood,</strong> has conducted a second interview with Iraqis affected by the battle for Mosul.

It has been a real hardship since I left Mosul seven months ago and fled to Turkey with my family. I stayed in Turkey for 15 days and then returned to Sulaimaniya as I could not cope with expensive life in Turkey. It was so hard to stay in Telafer after Isis militants took over of Mosul. I\u2019m a government employee and did not get a salary for more than a year and a half \u2013 how can I feed my five kids? </p> <p>If I had stayed in Mosul my family would have died, there was no work, no freedom, no life. The strict rules of Isis were a nightmare that I challenge any human being to be able to accept them. </p> <p>I still have three brothers in Mosul with their families, they said that the battle is still at the suburbs of Mosul. They could not flee because they could not afford the cost of traveling to Turkey. Besides it is very risky, if Isis militants get hold of any one fleeing, they will execute him immediately. I paid more than $2,000 to flee with the help of a smuggler who took us to Syria and then to Turkey.</p> <p>When Isis first came, they said they came just to change the situation for the interest of Mosul civilians who suffered a great deal of injustice from the Iraqi army. Something that made all the people happy to have them and look at them as saviours from the devil, but it turned that was not right and they began to impose their hardline Islamic doctrine on people. They made our life a complete hell.</p> <p>When I had to flee I could not take anything with me and thought it was better to let my neighbour stay in my house. At least he would guard it and Isis would not confiscate it. I will get back to Mosul as soon as it is liberated. Only God knows how long the battle will last because Isis won\u2019t give up easily. They have been reinforcing their forces to be ready for the attack. They will not hand over Mosul easily, which is one of their main fortresses in Iraq.</p> <p>I will get back to my home, even if Shia militia take the city as they did in other Sunni-liberated areas in Iraq. I do not care any more, I prefer to die in my home and not to be a refugee. I will never repeat this mistake again. </p> <p>I live with my sister in Sulaimaniyia now and we are really struggling to provide the daily basics for the kids.

In total, up to 1 million people could flee their homes in search of safety during the military operation, with an estimated 700,000 requiring shelter, food, water and other vital aid.</p> <p>With emergency camps not ready for the large numbers likely to flee, the IRC anticipates that many people will find their way to abandoned buildings, schools and mosques in the towns and villages around Mosul. The IRC\u2019s mobile response teams are ready to reach 60,000 of the most vulnerable, whether they flee to the north, east or south of the city. The IRC teams will provide $420 in cash to 5,000 families (30,000 people) so they can buy food, pay rent and buy clothes, blankets and cooking utensils. Another 30,000 will be given essential items, provided with legal support or identified as needing specialist care. With more funding the IRC could increase the reach of its response to 90,000 people.</p> <p>After escaping the city, men and boys over the age of 14 will be security screened. This may take several days and it will be critical conditions are suitable, and people are provided with food, water, medical care and adequate communication on the process.

We deal with displaced families and Mosul infrastructure. We support the army with potential residential sites in Mosul that should not be targeted to avoid killing innocent people. I\u2019m a university professor, I teach chemistry at the College of Agriculture and Forestry in Mosul.</p> <p>I left Mosul the day Isis took over the city. I have not seen my relatives who are still inside Mosul for two years. I just talked to the head of a tribe in Mosul, he lives at the western bank of the the city. They are so glad for the beginning of the battle for Mosul liberation. The battle started yesterday at 2am Iraq time.</p> <p>People are desperately observing the marching of the Iraqi forces to Mosul. The mobile network is too weak and people are so scared to talk. The head of the tribe told me that all the city now is in a state of alert and he claimed that some of the Isis families are fleeing the city. Some of the roads are blocked by concrete walls, caravans and damaged cars to stop the progress of the city.</p> <p>It is too early to talk about the liberation of Mosul city, all the battles now and bombardment is against the deterrence wall set up by Isis at the suburbs of the city like al-Hamdaniya district, al-Hamam, Britla, al-Guwair and Ba\u2019ashiqa.</p> <p>The battle now is at the surrounding areas of Mosul, it might take a few weeks to get to the city centre. We have set up camps for the people who would flee the city, however, up till now, we did not receive any. None of the people are fleeing outside Mosul but they are moving from the west bank to east bank which is relatively safer. None of the tribal militia formed by the tribes of Mosul is taking part in the battle so far. There is a tribal militia at the southern part of Mosul, they are holding the ground. Their job is to keep the security inside the city after the battles.</p> <p>There are six axes for the battle of Mosul liberation \u2013 two axes are from the south-eastern part of Mosul, al-Khaziq and Ba\u2019ashiqa, where the battles are going on now. Other axes are still quiet, like the northern one in Aski Mosul, Zumar, Mosul Dam and Telkief. We think at night the army would march to these three axes. I have not seen any of the Shia militia here, they might take part in the Telafer liberation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T13:11:37.900Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804b4b5e4b04312166ed6e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T11:25:45.005Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, says Turkey is determined to be part of the operation to recapture Mosul, and possible talks on the city\u2019s future.</p> <p>Associated Press reports that Erdo\u011fan has reiterated Turkey\u2019s concerns that the operation could lead to sectarian clashes.

She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the campaign to retake Mosul is a success, it would not only be a massive military defeat for IS but more importantly it would be massive blow to its ideological stance. Mosul symbolises the heart of the caliphate for the group and removing this would mark the beginning of the end for a group who is already struggling for survival. The group is no longer the powerhouse that it once appeared and is in fact struggling not only to gain support but to keep the support in place that it currently has. </p> <p>The international community needs to be extremely careful in how it approaches this campaign, keeping in mind that this is not just a fight for territory, but also a fight for the hearts and minds of those who are the most fragile \u2013 the citizens of Iraq. In order for this to be a success there cannot be a repeat of the debacle that followed the 2003 invasion where the US-led coalition were essentially understaffed and unplanned for the scope of instability that would emerge across Iraq. For IS this would almost certainly be the hardest blow and would make it almost impossible for them to continue their propaganda campaign built around their creation of the caliphate. </p> <p>If Mosul were to be retaken by the allied coalition, a desperate IS may increase its levels of suicide attacks and other such methods to try to show its strength, but in reality the group is already weakened and has made little real ground in the last year. If anything they have been pushed back to levels not seen since its rapid emergence in 2014. It may be the beginning of the end for IS as we know them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T12:02:35.659Z\">at 1.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804a89ee4b047a4eaafd58c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T10:41:00.751Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Smoke is rising over Mosul from the artillery and mortar fire and airstrikes from the US-led coalition backing Iraqi and irregular forces\u2019 assault.

One refugee who recently fled Mosul, Abu Ammar, 47, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/mosul-civilians-brace-assault-iraq-retake-isis-stronghold\">told the Guardian</a> that he and his family spent six hours walking through the night, through fields they feared were peppered with mines, to escape. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My kids hadn\u2019t left the house for weeks, because they were afraid of the US airstrikes, they were bombing residential areas, close to our home. The noise is horrible, windows get broken, the whole house shakes, and people get hysterical.</p> <p>I only went out if I needed to do some shopping, and tried my best to avoid Isis militants. Mostly we borrowed wheat from a neighbour, because we couldn\u2019t afford to buy it. I\u2019m a government employee and haven\u2019t been paid for two years. The only places that are open in Mosul are petrol stations, and shops with goods from Syria.</p> <p>I was trying to find a way out for months, a job somewhere to feed the kids, but I was scared to take the route to Erbil because it is planted with mines. I finally agreed to leave with four other families one night, but at the last minute the others dropped out.</p> <p>They said they had been tipped off that Isis had set up many checkpoints along the way and might capture us. I insisted on going anyway. We walked through the night for more than six hours, with my kids frightened and begging to go back.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amina Najib, 45, speaking from Mosul city centre, told the Guardian that she and her family had decided the risk of trying to escape was too great. They have stockpiled a few essentials in a room in their house to use as a shelter. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People here have nothing to talk about except the horrific war that will be launched against the city soon. But in the end we reckoned it was better to stay home than risk getting caught by Isis trying to flee. My son has already had 20 lashes just for using a mobile in the street.</p> <p>I prepared a room in the house as a shelter with just some wheat to make bread and a few kilos of rice.</p> <p>Most locals don\u2019t have any cash because the government stopped paying its employees two years ago, and all our savings are wiped out. Pensioners are the lucky ones, they still get their pension via credit card, so our money comes from my cousin who is a retired teacher.</p> <p>People are worried about what comes after liberation. It is true we want to get rid of Isis but can you trust who will take power after?</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/mosul-civilians-brace-assault-iraq-retake-isis-stronghold\">Mosul civilians brace for assault as Iraq forces bid to retake Isis stronghold</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580477d9e4b01ffb8ffcc73e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T07:12:42.994Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A senior U.N. official says he\u2019s \u201cextremely concerned\u201d for the safety of civilians in Mosul, who may be trapped between the lines or held as human shields as the attack begins on the city.</p> <p>Stephen O\u2019Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-stephen-0\">a statement</a> last night: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Families are at extreme risk of being caught in cross-fire or targeted by snipers. Tens of thousands of Iraqi girls, boys, women and men may be under siege or held as human shields. Thousands may be forcibly expelled or trapped between the fighting lines.

It found continued membership of the two groupings would allow the UK to have free trade with countries that buy 90% of its exports.<br></p> <p>She said the onus was on Brexit supporters to prove the economic benefits of withdrawal. \u201cThe government should bring before parliament serious cost-benefit analysis of the potential impact of leaving both the single market and the customs union. And whether their benefits can really be replicated outside. This must be done before article 50 negotiations start.\u201d</p> <p>In a sign of continued tension between leave and remain campaigners, the international development secretary, Priti Patel, said that those trying to force a debate and vote on article 50 were trying to \u201csubvert the economic will of the British public\u201d. </p> <p>Other Brexit supporters, including David Davis and Liam Fox, have hinted at the idea of Britain accepting much looser economic ties with the EU in order to deliver a hard Brexit.</p> <p>However, the issue of membership of the customs union is also still being considered, the Guardian understands, with a paper on its pros and cons presented at a meeting of May\u2019s Brexit cabinet committee last week. <br></p> <p>On migration, Rudd\u2019s suggestion of a visa-entry scheme for skilled workers is not the only option being considered. Under Rudd\u2019s plans, which aim to significantly cut net migration, EU workers would need to have a skilled job before being allowed into Britain. <br></p> <p>Although Brexit supporters were reported to have been angered by Hammond\u2019s cautious approach at the meeting, with some accusing him of \u201carguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything\u201d, his approach was accepted with ministers leaving all options open.</p> <p>The Brexit committee includes Hammond, Clark and Green, as well as May, Rudd and the Tory chair \u2013 who backed remain \u2013 Patrick McLoughlin.

But Straight Outta Compton didn\u2019t show how Michel\u2019le\u2019s radio-friendly ballads and uptempo dance tracks helped pave the way for Ruthless\u2019 mainstream credibility. It also failed to portray NWA producer Dr Dre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/19/straight-outta-compton-ignores-dr-dre-abuse-of-women-say-two-former-victims\">repeated violence against women</a> \u2013 violence that Michel\u2019le, Dre\u2019s former long-term girlfriend and mother of his son Marcel, alleges as well. </p> <p>Surviving Compton seeks to set the record straight. Though the production values don\u2019t rival those of last year\u2019s hit (the producers were unable to secure access to NWA\u2019s music, for example), it fills in large gaps in the story. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/nwa-straight-outta-compton-mainstream\">How NWA came straight outta Compton and went mainstream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prior to its release, Dr Dre\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/09/dr-dre-tv-movie-lawsuit-girlfriend-abuse/\">threatened legal action</a> against the film-makers if the movie contained scenes of him assaulting her, which he denies. But Surviving Compton nonetheless contains numerous chilling sequences of Dre beating her, and even one where he shoots at her. He\u2019s otherwise portrayed as a cheating, boozing manipulator who neglects her once he becomes famous. Michel\u2019le\u2019s next love interest \u2013 Suge Knight, by now Dre\u2019s arch rival \u2013 doesn\u2019t come off much better. </p> <p>The question many viewers will have after their viewing: is the film accurate? </p> <p>I would say, for the most part, yes. I extensively interviewed Michel\u2019le and other survivors of Dre\u2019s alleged abuse for my new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Original-Gangstas-Untold-Eazy-E-Shakur/dp/0316383899\">Original Gangstas: the Untold Story of Dr Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur, and the Birth of West Coast Rap</a>, and investigated their claims. The film largely echoes Michel\u2019le\u2019s accounts to me, though she never went to police with her allegations \u2013 unlike other women including television host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/25/women-assualted-by-dr-dre-respond-apology-straight-outta-compton\">Dee Barnes</a> and Lisa Johnson, the mother of three of Dre\u2019s children who alleged he beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. (Dre pled no contest to beating Barnes, and received probation, while Johnson was granted a restraining order against him. A Ruthless rapper named <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/music/tairrie-b-hip-hops-original-bad-bitch-is-back-5874080\">Tairrie B also maintains that Dre beat her</a>.) </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT16uxOEudU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iT16uxOEudU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>To be sure, Surviving Compton glosses over many details. It depicts the squeaky-voiced South Central native Michel\u2019le being plucked from obscurity from a job folding clothes at the mall to sing with Dr Dre\u2019s first group, but neglects a funny detail I uncovered \u2013 that her initial stage name was Baby, and she walked around with a pacifier around her neck. Other details \u2013 that NWA were marijuana fans, or that Suge Knight intimidated Tupac Shakur and bossed him around \u2013 are entirely false. </p> <p>But the soul of the story rings true. Michel\u2019le\u2019s character, as a young girl, is taught by the women in her life that men beating women is normal, and should be tolerated. She endures Dre and Suge\u2019s abuse for the promise of money, fame and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 love. Despite her early success she never reaches her singing potential, partly because she\u2019s stuck raising Dre\u2019s child in his absence. Suge promises her a fresh start, both personally and professionally, and they too have a child together, but eventually his violent tendencies sabotage everything. The performances of Rhyon Nicole Brown (as Michel\u2019le) and R Marcos Taylor (reprising his Straight Outta Compton role as Suge Knight) are particularly strong. A surprisingly sincere Jamie Kennedy, meanwhile, plays <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/benwesthoff/2016/09/07/jerry-heller-nwa/#74b3053129f6\">recently deceased</a> NWA manager Jerry Heller, who somehow comes off better than anyone else. </p> <p>Mirroring the arc of films like the Tina Turner biopic<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-16/entertainment/ca-35747_1_tina-turner/3\"> What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It? </a>the story ends with Michel\u2019le\u2019s affirmation of self, and before the final credits we receive great news: she\u2019s recording a new album and touring again. While it\u2019s likely that Surviving Compton won\u2019t endure like Straight Outta Compton, owing to its smaller budget and platform, if there were any justice in the world the two films\u2019 DVDs would be sold as a bundle. After all, the story of NWA is simply incomplete without the story of Michel\u2019le. </p>",
  "<p>Three men accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/bomb-plot-somali-immigrant-kansas-militia-charged\">plotting a \u201cbloodbath\u201d</a> of Somali immigrants in a small Kansas town in order to provoke a religious war appeared in court on Monday and were ordered to remain in custody. </p> <p>Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright are suspected of planning a domestic terrorist attack to destroy an apartment complex that is home to about 120 Somali people in Garden City.</p> <p>The men were charged last week with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and face up to life in prison if convicted. </p> <p>Since February, the FBI has conducted an investigation into a small anti-government, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim militia group in south-west Kansas called the Crusaders, according to the criminal complaint.</p> <p>The trio met on 14 August and decided they would blow up the complex with four explosive-laden vehicles \u2013 one on each corner \u2013 because a large Somali community lives there and uses one of the apartments as a mosque, the complaint alleged.</p> <p>Garden City, 210 miles west of Wichita, has a diverse population of about 27,000 people, many working at a meatpacking plant. It has previously been cited as a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/11/249981976/a-midwestern-meatpacking-town-welcomes-immigrants\">successful example</a> of the rapid assimilation of a multicultural population into a rural area.</p> <p>\u201cThis presented an escalated level of planned violence that we [in Kansas] have not experienced before,\u201d said Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman of the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said the thwarted attack \u201cconfirms what we\u2019re hearing from law enforcement authorities all along, that the biggest threat to safety and security in the US is not from Muslim terrorists or anything like that, it\u2019s mostly from homegrown militia-type terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>After the August meeting, authorities said, the group began to formulate more detailed plans about how to source materials and carry out the attack while evading detection. The carnage would take place at prayer time for maximum loss of life.</p> <p>All the accused are in their late 40s. One of the plotters, Allen, works at a mobile home business owned by Wright, authorities said. The complaint says the suspects and their communications were monitored and recorded by an informant. It contains numerous disturbing details about their alleged fantasies and schemes. Stein described Somali people as \u201ccockroaches\u201d who needed to be eliminated, court documents say. </p> <p>Allen is said to have suggested making signs that say \u201cI support illegal immigration, I go against the constitution on a daily basis\u201d, and then \u201cfor every one of them [Somalis] that we blow the top of their head off we just put that around their neck\u201d.</p> <p>On other occasions, Stein is said to have suggested carrying out an attack against Muslim refugees in Garden City in retaliation for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\">Orlando nightclub mass shooting</a> and to have floated the ideas of blowing up apartments using rocket-propelled grenades, kicking in doors of homes where Somali people lived and shooting them one by one, firing at them with a bow and arrow dipped in pig\u2019s blood, and burning down churches that have helped refugees. </p> <p>\u201cThe only fucking way this country\u2019s ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath,\u201d Stein allegedly said. </p> <p>At another time, he reportedly said: \u201cThe only good Muslim is a dead Muslim\u201d and \u201cIf you\u2019re a Muslim I\u2019m going to enjoy shooting you in the head \u2026 When we go on operations there\u2019s no leaving anyone behind, even if it\u2019s a one-year-old. I\u2019m serious. I guarantee if I go on a mission those little fuckers are going bye-bye.\u201d</p> <p>During a meeting in July, the complaint said, the men discussed a wide range of targets they believed were Muslims or sympathetic to Muslims, and Wright \u201cpulled up Google Maps on the computer at his business and began dropping pins on the map at these various locations using the label \u2018cockroaches\u2019 \u2026 The group brainstormed various methods of attack, including murder, kidnapping, rape, and arson.\u201d</p> <p>Allen was arrested in the Kansas city of Liberal on 11 October after his girlfriend contacted local police to say he had physically attacked her during an argument. Police said they found a large amount of ammunition in his car and close to 1,000kg (2,200lbs) worth of ammunition at his home. Later that day, the woman told the FBI that within the past two weeks she had watched Allen make what appeared to be homemade explosives.</p> <p>On 12 October, with Allen\u2019s arrest putting the plot under pressure, Stein allegedly met with someone he believed could supply guns and bomb components and tried out two automatic rifles in a rural location near Garden City. But the supplier was an undercover FBI employee and the weapons came from an FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.</p> <p>Detention hearings for Stein and Wright were set for Friday and for Allen next Monday. Their attorneys declined to comment after the hearing.</p>",
  "<p>Fourteen children and adolescents arrived in south London today from the camp in Calais which is to be demolished, possibly as soon as next week. As a fraction of the eligible children in the \u201cJungle\u201d camp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">it is negligible</a>. There may be as many as a thousand children there who deserve to come to Britain and who are legally entitled to do so. As a fraction of the 88,000 child refugees adrift in Europe, 14 is infinitesimal. Yet by the standards of the British government, these 14 children represent a heroic humanitarian effort. There may ultimately be as many as 300 admitted, a&#xa0;figure that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, described as \u201ca good result\u201d.</p> <p>It is a \u201cgood result\u201d only from a perspective of remarkable smugness or meanness. The smugness would marvel at the fact that we have taken any refugees in at all when we have so successfully defied our moral and indeed legal obligations for so long. The meanness is both stingy and frightened. Britain is the sixth biggest economy in the world \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 and it is absurd to suggest that we could not absorb more than 300 children. Even David Cameron promised last autumn that we could welcome as many as 20,000 over five years from Syria. And Syria is only one of the ravaged countries from which children now try to escape, carrying with them little but the hopes and prayers of the families they leave behind.</p> <p>Obviously, Britain cannot on its own solve the global refugee crisis. Nor has the government been stingy in supporting refugees who are prepared to stay away from here and languish in third countries. But this does not excuse the tactics of delay and obfuscation that have characterised the reactions of both the French and British governments right up until the moment when the destruction of the Calais refugee camp is imminent. This imposing record of resolute inaction suggests that the authorities on both sides of the channel really just want the refugees to disappear, and don\u2019t care too much about how this happens, so long as it is not embarrassing.</p> <p>It is our duty, then, to shame these two governments, and to hold up the threatened humanity of these refugees.</p> <p>Successive governments have been afraid of Ukip, and of the tabloid press, to the degree that they have attempted to define suffering out of existence through bureaucratic procedures. Months can be spent in registration and pointless inquiries. It is all deliberately and literally dehumanising. Against this, the direct actions&#xa0;of thousands of ordinary citizens (and some celebrities) express unmediated&#xa0;solidarity.</p> <p>Much of the reaction has been driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/faith-leaders-refugee-traffickers\" title=\"\">churches and Christian organisations</a>, who deserve credit for it. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, while he has expressed sympathy for the anxiety that some people feel about immigration, has also housed a refugee family in the grounds of his own palace. One of the most effective encouragements to the government came&#xa0;from Citizens UK, a collection of largely&#xa0;faith-based community groups, which managed to sue the government. About&#xa0;12,000 evangelical Christian families have offered to foster refugee children.</p> <p>All of the children so far rescued have come in under the provisions of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:180:0031:0059:EN:PDF\" title=\"\">Dublin III</a> agreement, which represents the absolute bare minimum that any government can do to recognise the humanity and human rights of refugees: children who have close family in this country may enter to be looked after by their relatives. But the plight of the orphans, the children who have no family at all, must surely be worse. They are or ought to be covered by the Dubs amendment, sponsored by a survivor of the Kindertransport. The&#xa0;next step must be to pressure the government to live up to its obligations under Dubs as well as Dublin. That might rescue as many as 3,000 children: a few grains of sand from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/17/world-will-not-face-up-to-refugee-crisis-un-obama\" title=\"\">a desert of despair</a>, but then, as the Jewish saying has it, to rescue one life is to rescue a whole world.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday morning, the bookies assume, there will be a new Conservative MP for Witney, the constituency suddenly vacated by David Cameron when he resigned last month. While few doubt that the Tory candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/22/robert-courts-chosen-tory-candidate-david-cameron-constituency\" title=\"\">Robert Courts</a>, will win, it is likely he will have no more than 40% of the vote, where his predecessor won 60%.</p> <p>Courts faces a strong Liberal Democrat challenge and an equally strong Labour one. These two candidates will split the not-Conservative vote and allow Courts to become another name in the long succession of Tory MPs for west Oxfordshire. His victory will be taken as an endorsement of Theresa May\u2019s divisive and sometimes dangerous rhetoric about Brexit. Those who oppose both the style and substance of what she says will be weakened. This is not an attempt to rerun the referendum or overturn the popular will, it is about making sure that leaving Europe inflicts as little collateral damage as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/bernie-sanders-endorses-his-brother-larry-in-race-to-replace-david-cameron\">Bernie Sanders endorses his brother in race to replace David Cameron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now just imagine what a message could have been sent if Labour and the Lib Dems \u2013 and perhaps the Greens too \u2013 had run a single candidate to campaign just on a pro-single market, pro-migrant, pro-refugee ticket. These are issues that many voters in Witney, a constituency that voted to remain in the EU by 54% to 46%, care about deeply. These are people who trek into Oxford to join <a href=\"https://en-gb.fievent.com/e/let-the-children-in-refugees-welcome/4534089\" title=\"\">Refugees Welcome</a> marches like the one last week, and who support the local council\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.westoxon.gov.uk/residents/communities/help-for-refugees/\" title=\"\">Asylum Welcome</a> work.</p> <p>But instead, even though the two main challengers are actually working together on the council to set up a community transport company to replace newly axed bus services, for the past three weeks they have been fighting each other over the sterile territory of who\u2019s to blame for the cuts. What an indictment this byelection will be of British politics\u2019 destructive preference for the narcissism of small differences.</p> <p>Over the next two years, Britain will be remade by a government with a working majority of 12. This new country that is being born will be out of Europe, its territorial integrity under threat from nationalism and its outlook narrow and sometimes xenophobic. It is a place where millions of people will find themselves ill at ease. Proof of identity will become part of everyday life, not just an inconvenience for under-25s at a party. And the first serious opportunity to challenge its direction is taken as the opportunity to debate local buses.</p> <p>It is typical of the reductionist style of politics that has undermined the capacity of Westminster to represent the whole country. It may be why people who ran street stalls during the referendum campaign report that time after time they found bewilderment about what was at stake. This is the lesson: if you treat voters as if they are nothing but a compound of self-interested behaviours, then that\u2019s what you get.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3c238261e79ba3a31bdbeff3a0abaf0391c07a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3c238261e79ba3a31bdbeff3a0abaf0391c07a/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David and Samantha Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron with his wife, Samantha, just before he resigned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EU referendum should have left voters in no doubt about the power of their vote. Byelections, held at critical moments such as this one, can do something more subtle but just as powerful. Cameron is far too tactical a politician not to have been aware of the hold that a few thousand voters can exert over a government, not least one embarking on the fraught and uncertain route to Brexit. A campaign that challenged May\u2019s determination to remake Britain by executive fiat, and demanded instead that parliament be allowed its central role in shaping the country\u2019s future could have helped to influence wider public opinion and the political context.</p> <p>In the 1930s, perhaps the last period when the national mood was so uncertain, byelections became a way of demonstrating opposition to government policy. Depression, economic collapse and the rise of fascism had split the Labour party, destroyed the Liberals and left the country in the control of a single party.</p> <p>In 1933, after the Fulham East byelection was won by John Wilmot, a pacifist Labour candidate, Stanley Baldwin was persuaded not to campaign for rearmament. Five years later, after the \u201cpeace in our time\u201d Munich agreement in 1938, a series of byelections \u2013 most famously in Oxford and Bridgwater \u2013 became in effect plebiscites on Neville Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement.</p> <p>The main opposition parties were as reluctant to stand a single candidate then as now. A Labour MP who came to support the anti-appeasement candidate in Bridgwater <a href=\"http://vernonbartlett.co.uk/which-side-are-you-on/the-result/\" title=\"\">summed up the attitude</a>: \u201cI have not departed one iota from my Labour principles. When the campaign is over I shall go back again to the party to which I belong. Until then I feel there is much work to be done in making a protest against this government.\u201d Victory for the Liberal Vernon Bartlett did not change government policy. But it did challenge the orthodoxy.</p> <p>West Oxfordshire has already had one moment in history: in 1990, at the height of the political row over the poll tax, 18 Conservative councillors in Witney <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11951319.England_apos_s_poll_tax_rebels_view_future_with_resignation/\" title=\"\">resigned</a> in protest at a tax that fell hardest on the least able to pay. Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told Margaret Thatcher it was serious. Their action didn\u2019t quite defeat the policy, but it was a revolt that significantly loosened Thatcher\u2019s grip on power.</p> <p>This week there will be no unambivalent message for May, no irrefutable clarion call to end the anti-migrant rhetoric and work for as soft a Brexit as possible. Witney 2016 could have been another byelection that changed Britain. Instead it will be business as usual.</p>",

We are concerned that buses may at some point arrive for the children, and the pushy ones will get on while the most vulnerable ones will still be hiding in their shelters and tents \u2013 either because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or will be too scared to get on a bus.\u201d</p> <p>The French interior minister has warned of a damaging blame game between his country and the UK over the Calais refugee crisis, with accusations of selfishness and inhumanity preventing action being taken to support vulnerable individuals.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/uk-moral-duty-calais-unaccompanied-children-asylum\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Bernard Cazeneuve said there had been a litany of misunderstandings between the two countries but added that there was now an urgent need for a common outlook to tackle a situation \u201ceveryone agrees is a disaster\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cFrom the point of view of some in France, the Calais migrants\u2019 misery is entirely down to the selfishness of the British government,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>The politician said there was a perception that the UK was using a bilateral agreement with France in an \u201cunscrupulous way, as a means of refusing to take in refugees fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, including unaccompanied children with family connections in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Cazeneuve argued that neither country was the first entry point for migrants, but said that both could not abdicate their responsibilities in the long run.<br></p> <p>Under EU laws, a child seeking asylum who has a parent or a sibling in another European country can be fast-tracked to join them in that country.

  "<p> Imagine a story with so much inherent drama it sounds far-fetched even for a Hollywood thriller. Our heroes dig tunnels from freedom into enemy territory to help loved ones and others escape. They are bankrolled in part by a savvy media executive looking for a network exclusive. Meanwhile, the White House seeks to shut it all down in the interest of politics \u2013 and avoiding nuclear war.</p> <p> It sounds over the top but it\u2019s all true and detailed in Greg Mitchell\u2019s new book, <a href=\"http://gregmitchellauthor.com/books/the-tunnels-tr/the-tunnels-hc\">The Tunnels: Escapes Under the Berlin Wall and the Historic Films the JFK White House Tried to Kill</a><em>. </em>Utilizing a mix of interviews and archival records Mitchell tells a kaleidoscopic cold war story from 1962, recreating a world seemingly on the edge of a third world war. </p> <p> The action revolves around the brave and indefatigable young Germans of West Berlin who take up shovels against repression; yet even as they aid the escape of those trapped in East Berlin, they are undermined by a Stasi informer in their midst. Mitchell also recounts the efforts of CBS and NBC reporters and executives to gain an upper hand in their own competition by racing to secure the rights to film a tunnel escape for the education \u2013 or perhaps entertainment \u2013 of the American audience back home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cecbe98152fd8ae8e110dd7059fc50ea39509a1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cecbe98152fd8ae8e110dd7059fc50ea39509a1c/0_0_2046_3000/682.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Kennedy inspect the Berlin Wall at Bernauer Street in 1962.\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Kennedy inspect the Berlin Wall at Bernauer Street in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reichert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>President John F Kennedy\u2019s administration, meanwhile, aims to control the media\u2019s message, perhaps out of general distrust of the press, perhaps out of political concerns, including the all-too-real notion that the Soviet Union could interpret American involvement as a step toward war. </p> <p> All of this plays out against an increasingly fraught backdrop as East German guards shoot fellow citizens in cold blood as they try to escape, West German officials break the law to help escapees and the Soviets begin maneuvers for what will become the Cuban missile crisis. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s not a very nice solution,\u201d Kennedy said of the Berlin Wall as it went up, \u201cbut a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.\u201d </p> <p> Mitchell, 68, has written numerous books about the intersection of American politics and media and about nuclear war. The former editor both of <a href=\"http://cironline.org/partners/nuclear-times\">Nuclear Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/\">Editor &amp; Publisher</a> magazines, he stumbled on to the idea for The Tunnels<em> </em>when his daughter and her husband moved to Berlin. He went to visit them at their new home which turned out to be about a mile from <a href=\"http://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/\">Bernauer Strasse</a>, the former East Berlin street that turned out to be the focal point of much of the book\u2019s action. </p> <p> \u201cI knew about the Berlin Wall, of course,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cI grew up with Berlin being in the news all the time and I had the childhood trauma of fallout shelters, air raid drills and duck and cover. My favorite movie was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/11/us-military-propaganda-film\">Dr Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a>.\u201d</p> <p> But what he knew about the wall was fairly general and it all felt like part of a distant past until that visit. \u201cGoing to the memorial site and reading the stories about the escapes was overwhelming,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing the \u2018death strip\u2019 made it all very vivid.\u201d </p> <p> Mitchell started digging in to the escape stories and was particularly drawn to the notion that those living in freedom, including many who had escaped East Berlin, were willing to tunnel directly into danger to help others. \u201cThat story was incredible enough with plenty of suspense,\u201d he says, though he felt like it was a \u201cforeign story\u201d Americans would not be interested in \u2013 indeed, while the sagas have been recounted in German language books, they have never been told in full detail here. But then he uncovered the story of the television documentaries and the White House\u2019s efforts to suppress them and realized \u201cthis was also an American story\u201d.</p> <p> Hollywood recognized its potential before the book industry did. His proposal sold its movie rights, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paulgreengrass\">Paul Greengrass</a> attached as director, even before he had found a publisher. \u201cThat was a little odd and embarrassing for a moment,\u201d Mitchell says. </p> <p> Mitchell says he was fortunate that his son-in-law is half-German because he provided vital help in translating Stasi archives \u2013 many never seen in public before \u2013 and interpreting during interviews. \u201cI had a list of 20 people and hoped to get six, not knowing who would be alive or well enough or willing to talk,\u201d Mitchell says. Instead, he found 16, including the major West Berlin diggers. </p> <p> In writing, Mitchell strove to be even-handed. \u201cI hate to announce a stand,\u201d he says. On the issue of Kennedy\u2019s decision to allow the wall to be built and his efforts to shape the media\u2019s coverage of the escape attempts, he knows some of the president\u2019s methods seemed wrong then and would be taboo today but believes that the genuine threat of nuclear war changed the equation. </p> <p>\u201cHalf the readers will say I\u2019m too hard on him and he had to worry about the end of the world while the other half will say he was too cautious and should have done more to support the people trying to escape,\u201d Mitchell says, adding that there will be also conflicting views on the networks dishing out money to the tunnelers in exchange for filming rights. </p> <p> While the events are a half-century old, they resonate today in a world trying to figure out how to handle escaped refugees, walls real (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/10/william-sutcliffe-west-bank-wall\">imposed on the West Bank by Israel</a>) and proposed (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d</a>), and deepening tensions between the US and Russia which are exacerbated by media leaks. \u201cIt all makes me feel like I\u2019m back in 1962,\u201d Mitchell says. </p>",

He was the rare detainee who presented himself to local authorities for questioning after 9/11. That fateful decision saw him transferred to US custody, first in Afghanistan, and then at Guant\u00e1namo. At the facility, his 2002 treatment was among the most abusive that has come to light. </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo interrogators and detention personnel told Slahi that they had visions of Slahi dead. Unless Slahi cooperated with interrogators, they threatened to bring his mother to Guant\u00e1namo, which the detainee understood as a rape threat. They contorted his body into painful positions, deprived him of sleep and bombarded him with noise, and beat him after stuffing ice into his clothing during a harrowing night-time boat trip through the bay. The US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, personally approved Slahi\u2019s interrogation regimen, which was overseen by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/18/american-police-brutality-chicago-guantanamo\">Chicago police detective</a>. </p> <p>Slahi wrote in his memoir that the torture made him willing to say whatever his tormentors desired, regardless of its truth. \u201cAs long as you are willing to buy, I am selling,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>Afterwards, Slahi became a docile detainee, even striking up friendships with his guards. He wrote that he hoped to maintain those friendships in the event of his freedom. For much of the past decade, he had lived in a bungalow setting at Guant\u00e1namo, where he was permitted television and even gardening privileges. </p> <p>Over the years, Slahi sharpened his English by handwriting an account of his experiences at Guant\u00e1namo, which his attorneys helped him publish \u2013 and declassify, as the US military considers even detainees\u2019 personal memories to be classified information.

Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said i<strong><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm\">n a speech in New York</a></strong> there were three reasons to be concerned about low rates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, and most worrying, is the possibility that low long-term interest rates are a signal that the economy\u2019s long-run growth prospects are dim...A second concern is that low interest rates make the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks that can put it in a recession...And the third concern is that low interest rates may also threaten financial stability as some investors reach for yield and compressed net interest margins make it harder for some financial institutions to build up capital buffers...</p> <p>Those are three powerful reasons to prefer interest rates that are higher than current rates. But, of course, Fed interest rates are kept very low at the moment because of the need to maintain aggregate demand at levels that will support the attainment of our dual policy goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, defined as the rate of inflation in the price level of personal consumption expenditures.. being at our target level of 2 percent.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said there were a variety of factors holding down interest rates - including slow economic growth, low investment, a slowdown in the global economy - and they may continue to go so for some time.</p> <p>But he added economic policy could help offset these factors, and boost the economy\u2019s growth potential:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies would be, some combination of more encouragement for private investment, improved public infrastructure, better education, and more effective regulation is likely to promote faster growth of productivity and living standards--and also to reduce the probability that the economy and, particularly, the central bank will in the future have to contend with the effective lower bound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T17:09:00.287Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5804f9b8e4b0cd26ff71e06f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T16:21:50.588Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek protestors as inspectors arrive</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Greece thousands of leftwing protestors are demonstrating outside the Athens parliament as pressure mounts on the government to revoke unpopular reforms demanded by the country\u201ds creditors.

The last time authorities recorded a similar rate was in 1982.</p> <p>No country in the world has had as prolonged a period of sub-1.5 fertility rates as Germany \u2013 a trend that dates back to 1975 in the former west of the country. In the old east, birthrates dropped off a cliff after reunification in the 1990s, leading to Germany being nicknamed \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-land-without-children-why-won-t-germans-have-more-babies-a-779741.html\">the land without children</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Recent statistical findings show women in the country are having more children than those in Mediterranean countries such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=demo_frate&amp;lang=en\">Greece, Italy or Spain</a>.</p> <p>The rate still falls short of the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. According to projections published last April, Germany\u2019s population is expected to decline by about 10 million people by 2060, meaning the country would be home to between 68 and 73 million inhabitants, compared with its current 81 million.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/jan/06/refugee-influx-helps-halt-decline-in-germanys-population\">Immigration was a key factor</a> in Germany\u2019s reversal of the declining rates of the 1990s. Among women with German citizenship, birthrates rose from 1.42 to just 1.43 in the years 2014 to 2015. For women with non-German citizenship based in Germany, however, rates in the same period rose from 1.86 to 1.95.</p> <p>But migration alone does not explain the current trend. Saxony, for example, has been the German state with the highest birthrate in the country since 2007, when the east of the country overtook the west in terms of children per woman, even though Saxony has one of the lowest rates of foreign-born inhabitants in the country. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster\">Europe needs many more babies to avert a population disaster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Berlin, where almost every third inhabitant has a multicultural background, the birthrate has flatlined over the past two years.</p> <p>According to Martin Bujard of the Federal Institute for Population Research, the most important driver in the recent trend reversal has been a series of childcare reforms. \u201cWhen it comes to childcare for the under-threes, eastern Germany always had a lot more to offer,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cTripling the number of childcare places over the last 15 years has played a central role in allowing women to combine work and family, especially in the former west. It has guaranteed that fertility rates would have started to rise even if you factor out migration.\u201d</p> <p>Germany\u2019s birthrate is significant because it is seen as an important factor in the rationale behind key policy decisions in Europe\u2019s biggest economy in recent years. The irresponsibility of burdening shrinking future generations with debt is a frequently cited argument by German advocates of fiscal discipline, while concerns about demographic decline have changed the political discourse around immigration.</p> <p>\u201cGermany is in a better position than it was in the noughties, but only marginally so,\u201d said the economist Olga P\u00f6tsch of the Federal Statistical Office. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t going to magic away the baby boomers any time soon.\u201d </p> <p>In order to compensate for <a href=\"https://www.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/#!y=2016&amp;v=2\">low birthrates in the late 90s and early noughties</a>, P\u00f6tsch argued, Germany would require a birthrate of about 2.5 to 3 in order to avert future demographic imbalances.</p>",

They come from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Kuwait\u2019s stateless Bidoon community.</p> <p>Lord Williams was speaking in Croydon, south London, where the children\u2019s resettlement was scheduled to be processed by the Home Office. The department later confirmed that the young people, aged 14-17, were transferred on Monday morning. They will be assessed and screened and may be cared for in specialist accommodation before being reunited with their relatives.</p> <p>Outside the Home Office processing centre in Croydon there were chaotic scenes as excited relatives were refused entry and told they could not see the new arrivals until Tuesday at the earliest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a1a692f0e3e03b0f8cead906a4c93829ed1e6fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a1a692f0e3e03b0f8cead906a4c93829ed1e6fc/0_34_5287_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Ghazi, (front right) greets his nephew Haris (centre) who arrived from in the UK today after leaving the Calais Jungle Camp, in Croydon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jan Ghazi, (front right) greets his nephew Haris (centre) who arrived from in the UK today after leaving the Calais Jungle Camp, in Croydon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afghan chef Jan Ghazi, 39, had not seen his 16-year-old nephew, Haris, for seven years.

I am shocked. I do not know why we cannot see him,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A lawyer for the charity Citizens UK Safe Passage explained to him that it was legal due diligence designed to safeguard the children and ensure no bogus claims were being made for their future care.</p> <p>Minutes later Ghazi ran to a minibus at the back of the imposing building waiting to take the children to overnight accommodation where they would get their first night\u2019s sleep in a proper bed in many weeks or months.</p> <p>\u201cI saw him in the window and I shouted to him: \u2018Come here I have come to take you home,\u2019\u201d said Ghazi.

It\u2019s a despicable way to build up hopes, withhold and keep changing information and confuse everybody.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that buses may at some point arrive for the children, and the pushy ones will get on while the most vulnerable ones will still be hiding in their shelters and tents \u2013 either because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or will be too scared to get on a bus.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, indicated that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/15/syrian-refugee-children-britain-france-calais-jungle\">UK would accept unaccompanied children with or without relatives in the UK</a>.</p> <p>After a two-hour meeting last Monday with her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, she said the official effort would prioritise safeguarding children under 12. But Williams said no process had yet been put in place to accept those children without relatives in the UK.</p> <p>He said there was \u201ca moral imperative\u201d for the UK to accept those that did not have relatives already settled in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve omitted to think what\u2019s in their best interests and to consider whether we take more children,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Under EU laws, a child seeking asylum who has a parent or a sibling in another European country can be fast-tracked to join them in that country. </p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/05/disgrace-to-europe-former-child-refugee-lord-dubs-calais-camp\">Alf Dubs forced the government to agree to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees</a> who have no relatives in the UK.</p> <p>Lord Dubs called for a \u201cshared enterprise\u201d between government and charitable organisations working to secure a future home for the children, many of whom have fled wars.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the actor Juliet Stevenson, who is supporting Citizens UK\u2019s Safe Passage programme, said of Monday\u2019s arrivals: \u201cToday is a proud moment for Britain. We did the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe arrival of hundreds of vulnerable children from Calais to the UK in the coming days is in no small part due to the tireless campaigning of community leaders, the hard work of Citizens UK\u2019s lawyers, and the Safe Passage team in Calais who have been working to safeguard children for over a year.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe can confirm a group of children who left the Calais camp this morning have arrived in the UK. This is the start of the process to transfer as many eligible children as possible before the start of the clearance, as the home secretary set out in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThese vulnerable children, aged between 14 and 17, were transferred to the UK under the care of Home Office staff, with the support of volunteers from specialist NGOs and charities. They will join their families in the UK as quickly as possible over the coming days.\u201d</p>",

But when Rudd gave evidence to the committee in September, she just said that Goddard stood down because she was lonely. In the Commons <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said this meant Rudd was open to \u201caccusations of misleading the committee\u201d. But Rudd said that Goddard strongly denied the allegations and that it would have been wrong for Rudd to have raised them with MPs. She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was asked [at the select committee] why Dame Lowell had gone. Dame Lowell had not spoken to me about her reasons, so I relied on the letter she had sent to the committee. In her letter she said she was lonely and felt that she could not deliver and that was why she stepped down. Dame Lowell has strongly refuted the allegations about her, and the only way we could understand properly why she resigned would be to hear from Dame Lowell herself. To echo any further allegations that are now likely to be the subject of legal dispute would have been entirely inappropriate. </p> </blockquote> <p>In response the Labour MP<strong> Lisa Nandy,</strong> who tabled the urgent question that led to Rudd addressing MPs, said Rudd\u2019s explanation was unsatisfactory. Nandy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This inquiry was established to shine a spotlight on institutions characterized by a culture of secrecy, denial and cover-up in which child abusers were able to operate in plain sight without challenge or consequence. It is a tragedy that the inquiry itself has become dogged by complaints about the very problems it was designed to expose and that for survivors of abuse will be far too familiar. If it is to proceed with confidence the home secretary and the prime minister need to answer the very many questions over this inquiry starting with the truth surrounding the departure of Dame Lowell Goddard.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/rowan-williams-stop-foot-dragging-over-calais-child-refugees\">Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has warned that the safety of up to 400 unaccompanied children stranded in the Calais refugee camp is being put at risk by the government\u2019s \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d.</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A Conservative councillor has been suspended by his local party after starting a petition to make opposing Brexit into an act of treason. </strong>As the Press Association reports, Guildford councillor Christian Holliday\u2019s petition for a change in the law to make supporting UK membership of the European Union a crime attracted more than 1,250 signatures within four days of being launched on the parliamentary website. </li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804ef14e4b0cd26ff71e03e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:49:56.221Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jay announces new approach to child abuse inquiry to make it manageable</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is more from<strong> Professor Alexis Jay</strong>\u2019s BBC interview about her review of how the child abuse inquiry operates. She has also put <a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/news/statement-chair\">a summary statement on the inquiry\u2019s website,</a> and<a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/key-documents/826/view/FINALChairStatement17Oct.pdf\"> a full statement here (pdf).</a></p> <p>Although she said she would not be reducing the scope of the inquiry, she has unveiled a new strategy designed to make it manageable. She said she hoped the inquiry would complete a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of its work by the end of 2020.</p> <p>The inquiry has been running 13 investigative strands, looking at child abuse within various institutions. In future it is going to focus more on four thematic strands. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Cultural - examining attitudes, behaviours and values within institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Structural - looking at the legislative, governance and organisational frameworks within and between institutions. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Financial - considering the financial, funding and resource arrangements for institutions and services. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Professional and political - focusing on leadership, professional and practice issues for those working or volunteering in relevant institutions. </li> </ul> <p>Jay said a traditional public inquiry approach to the allegations would fail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the concerns that our terms of reference cannot be delivered are founded on an assumption that we must seek to replicate a traditional public inquiry in respect of each of the thousands of institutions that fall within our remit. We will do so for some, but we would never finish if we did it for all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jay ordered a review of how the inquiry operates when she took over as chair in August. She said today her review was not yet complete, and that it would be finished by the end of November.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today is about outlining the strategy I intend to pursue to make the inquiry manageable and deliverable in a specified timescale. If we were to pursue the traditional public hearing model that people associate with inquiries of this kind to the thousands and thousands of institutions in England and Wales, we would fail, so there\u2019s no possibility that we can do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the four themes were \u201cabsolutely central to looking at institutions and their failings in the past, if any exist\u201d and that the inquiry would be holding public hearings related to the four themes. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For example, we might ask certain council leaders or police and crime commissioners to account publicly for what they\u2019ve done in relation to the subject of child sexual abuse within their areas of responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if her announcement was reducing the scope and scale of the inquiry, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s certainly not reducing the terms of reference in the inquiry. We have no intention to propose that any aspect of the terms of reference is dropped. But we do intend to use different models and ways of working to deliver the terms of reference. In that respect we consider that we can complete a significant amount of the inquiry\u2019s work by the end of 2020.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said no decisions have been made about the 13 investigations. Asked if some of them could be cut, she said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It really is impossible for me to say just now because it is quite a complex matter and we need to take the views of core participants and other relevant parties into account.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff666de51f68321cb486492f5c40b2a6786ce4b/0_79_2889_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Alexis Jay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Alexis Jay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Higgens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804ee0de4b0cd26ff71e038\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:29:23.773Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Professor Alexis Jay</strong>, the new chair of the child abuse inquiry, has told the BBC that she will not seek \u201cany reduction or restriction\u201d in its scope,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37680906\"> the BBC reports.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5804eb73e4b005f21833a555\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-17T15:23:51.220Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 says it was not involved in decision to shut down Russia Today's UK bank accounts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two subjects dominated at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing.

Oakden said the party did not want to rush the contest.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are going to be taking our time. We are going to be doing it in a very calm and collected fashion to make sure that we get the right results. There is no need to rush. There isn\u2019t any need to panic ourselves into getting a new leader into place quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>This meant the new leader might not be chosen until after Christmas, he said. The actual timetable is due to be settled later today.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said Ukip\u2019s internal investigation into the fight that led to Steven Woolfe MEP, the leadership favourite, being hospitalised in Luxembourg would conclude before nominations closed.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said it was up to Woolfe to decide if he was well enough to stand.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That\u2019s for Steven to say. We are all delighted that Steven is recovering, although, obviously, he is still feeling somewhat under the weather after what appears to have been a very serious medical incident. So, only he can say whether he is in full fitness and ready to fight a leadership campaign.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Oakden said there was nothing to stop Suzanne Evans, the former Ukip deputy chair, standing in the election</strong>.

He is arguing like an accountant seeing the risk of everything rather than the opportunity.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning <strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the health secretary, was on the Today programme talking about maternity care and he got the chance. His response was ingenious (and not entirely wrong.) Cabinet ministers should be having vigorous arguments, he said. When it was put to him that this infighting was \u201cnot ideal\u201d, Hunt replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the contrary. If we weren\u2019t having lively debates in cabinet, you would be saying \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to cabinet government, why aren\u2019t you going through incredibly thoroughly all the different arguments to make sure we end up with the right decision?\u201d </p> <p>The British people changed the history of our country on the 23 June. The cabinet is absolutely united that we must respect that decision.</p> <p>But we need to then go through, very thoroughly and carefully, all the different options because we\u2019ve got to have a new immigration policy, a new trade policy, a new economic policy ....</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt also rejected the suggestion that Hammond was trying to undermine Brexit. When this was put to him, he replied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time in the history of government where you read reports in the newspapers that may not actually reflect what\u2019s happened. All I would say is that you would expect lively debates to be happening in government because we are going to get the right solution in terms of securing our borders, but also the right solution economically. </p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt is right to say ministers should be arguing through the policy options behind closed doors. That happens all the time in government. But what is significant about this row is that it has spilt out onto the front pages of the newspapers. When ministers start briefing against each other to the media, it becomes harder for them to act collectively when they do reach an agreed position.</p> <p>I will be covering more developments on this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/maternity-wards-in-england-to-be-rated-by-safety-record\">Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, gives a speech setting out plans to make maternity units safer.</a></p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>The court hearing about whether the government is entitled to invoke article 50 starting the EU withdrawal process without a vote in parliament resumes.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, gives a speech on the impact of Brexit on the food and drink industry.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>4.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate in Westminster Hall on Brexit.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Ukip\u2019s national executive committee meets to discuss the timetable for its leadership election.</p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond\">Philip Hammond</a>, has angered more pro-Brexit cabinet colleagues with his concerns over plans to swiftly restrict immigration from the EU, warning this could harm the economy, according to reports.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blog, and our roundup<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/19/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/oct/10/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">of your comments and photos</a> from last week.</p> <p>Naturally, given the recent Nobel Prize announcement, there has been a lot of discussion about Bob Dylan. Most people on TLS seemed happy about the award. The general feeling was put very well by <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252\">conedison</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Put simply, Dylan made everybody try harder and do better. Bob Dylan took the cute, empty face of pop music and forced meaning down its throat... Dylan has always mattered to me in a very fundamental way. I value what he has created. He\u2019s a truly great songwriter - not a poet mind you - a songwriter and there are very few in his league - Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon - on occasion Randy Newman and Neil Young. For the modern songwriter, that\u2019s about it. But it\u2019s been enough to keep my musical body and soul together and most importantly, without Bob Dylan there wouldn\u2019t be any of them.</p> <p>As for the Nobel Prize, Dylan\u2019s winning it doesn\u2019t make me value him any more or any less. Prizes sure as hell do not make the man - one way or the other.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s also hard to argue with this, from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2438014\">nilpferd</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From what I know of Dylan the literary respect is well deserved. </p> <p>I think it is fair to say that he, more than anyone, created a unique language out of the sixties which will reverberate throughout many coming generations. He was able to distill rebellion, social and political upheaval, and the experimentation and fragmentation of \u201cthe self\u201d, into timeless prose.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1566437\">NatashaFatale </a>made it personal and vivid:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In \u201865 I went off to a small town to go, as we would say, \u201cto college.\u201d Every day for the first couple of weeks I walked around for a couple of hours a day and invariably passed the pool hall. Every single time I passed, Like a Rolling Stone was blaring out the always open door, and whole the congregation of layabouts stood at attention with their cues at port arms. It was a holy experience for them and it became one for me too. I don\u2019t especially like that song anymore, but I do respect it mightily.</p> </blockquote> <p>NatashaFatale also asked an intriguing question: \u201cSince this week we\u2019re speaking of him as a literary figure: was he the final chapter in the history of the Beats?\u201d</p> <p>On the subject of great songwriters <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13726489\">pearcesleftfoot</a> has been reading Born To Run by Bruce Springsteen:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m a huge fan and have read pretty much all the biographies from down the years so it was good to finally hear from the man himself.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t expecting anything particularly ground-breaking which it wasn\u2019t but it was an enjoyable, if somewhat superficial at times, telling of the life of someone I greatly admire.</p> <p>The parts I enjoyed most were when he spoke of his relationship with his dad. Fans of Springsteen will be aware of this particular trope and I doubt I\u2019d have been the only reader thinking \u2018that sounds like my life!\u2019 Thankfully for him it turned out OK in the end, as it did for me through a mixture of \u00a340 per hour counselling sessions and a huge dose of growing up and realising that my dad\u2019s a good, in fact the best, bloke who is flawed but tried his best.</p> </blockquote> <p>Talking of difficult fathers, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2467606\">Ieuan</a> has been reading Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s A Perfect Spy, which features one of the trickiest:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A re-read actually, but it\u2019s been years and years since I read it first and I\u2019d forgotten just what a damn fine novelist Le Carr\u00e9 is.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s also very interesting to read after his autobiography as now it\u2019s even more clear how much he was drawing from his own childhood/family experiences.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As the account of a man\u2019s slow psychological disintegration it is amazing (with shades of the Philby affair in the surrounding atmosphere) and, IMHO, makes a nonsense of those who say that there is a difference between \u2018genre\u2019 and literary fiction.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Further from home, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2763288\">drinkspernod</a> is keen to explore Mexico:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>What books about Mexico can you recommend? They have to be exciting enough to read. Fiction that teaches you something (or racy pop science, let\u2019s not lie, I need it to be catchy). I started \u201cThe Savage Detectives\u201d but I gave up/stalled on the section with the young poet boy and have by now forgotten who the characters are. DH Lawrence\u2019s \u201cMornings in Mexico \u201c is just about bearable with a thick \u201chistory and bigotry\u201d mental filter but he\u2019s so pompous! and he\u2019s doing that unbearable thing where he keeps repeating the same phrase over and over! I\u2019m 2/3 of the way through and it\u2019s a pretty thin book, the prospects of finishing are not good. </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully, Malcolm Lowry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano\">Under The Volcano </a>was recommended right away. Other fine tips include The Hummingbird\u2019s Daughter by Luis Alberto Urrea and Robin Bayley\u2019s The Mango Orchard. There\u2019s also the mighty Bolano\u2019s 2066...<br></p> <p>Elsewhere, this sounds fascinating from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2246303\">D1100766</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just started Shirley Jackson\u2019s Let Me Tell You, a collection of short stories, essays, lectures and articles including her thoughts on, among other things, clowns (!), Samuel Richardson and the art of the telling detail in a story, what she calls the \u2018garlic in fiction\u2019. </p> </blockquote> <p>And finally, a big claim from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I suspect Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory is that rare bird, a perfect novel. A seamless combination of plot, character, theme and style. This tale of a whisky priest in fear for his life pursued by a relentless lieutenant across an unnamed Mexican state is undoubtedly one of the best novels of the 20C.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like one we should look at on the Reading Group soon.

  "<p>\u201cPlayers end up fearing they\u2019ll never win away again,\u201d Jorge Sampaoli said and you could see why. Sevilla hadn\u2019t won on the road since 2015 \u2013 you know, back when there was hope. Worse, they hadn\u2019t won away for a year and four months: 511 days had passed since a 3-2 victory at M\u00e1laga on the final weekend of 2014-15. An entire season had been and gone but they hadn\u2019t been and won. They\u2019d defeated lesser clubs Logron\u00e9s and Mirand\u00e9s in the Cup and Athletic in Europe, true, but travelling just wasn\u2019t their thing. Not here and not there: 21 league games, three trips abroad in the Champions League, three more in the Europa League, and no victories. </p> <p>They had been from Manchester to M\u00f6nchengladbach and Molde; more to the point they\u2019d gone to M\u00e1laga, Las Palmas and Valencia, both sides of the city; to Eibar twice and Villarreal twice; to San Sebasti\u00e1n, A Coru\u00f1a, and across to the other side of Seville; to Madrid, north and south, Vigo, and Vallecas; Getafe and Gij\u00f3n, Bilbao twice and Barcelona, but it was no good. So they tried going somewhere they\u2019d never been before: New Mexico, USA. That, at least, was what president Jos\u00e9 Castro said \u2013 Albuquerque, Butarque, same difference \u2013 prompting CD Legan\u00e9s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDLeganes/status/786581407715827712\">to advertise Saturday\u2019s match</a> with the stars and stripes and a foam finger declaring, in English: \u201ccome on cucumbers!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/16/valencia-hand-cesare-prandelli-winning-la-liga-start-at-sporting-gijon\">Valencia hand Cesare Prandelli winning La Liga start at Sporting Gijon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Legan\u00e9s promised a show better than the Super Bowl and Butarque \u2013 B-U-T-A-R-Q-U-E, as the poster put it \u2013 was full for the fourth time in four games. Down in the corner, a thousand fans had come from Seville and they were enjoying it for once, singing the Marseillaise in the afternoon sunshine. It was a bit after 2.15pm and apart from Sergio Escudero \u2013 poleaxed on the pitch, his long run ending in a meeting with Martin Mantovani a split-second after he released the key pass \u2013 the visiting players were celebrating. Franco \u2018The Mute\u2019 V\u00e1zquez had nodded in the opener after 25 minutes and now Samir Nasri made it 2-0, with half an hour left. On to their anthem Sevilla\u2019s supporters went. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I came here to see you today,\u201d it runs.</p> <p>To see them win, at last. Sevilla would have been home and dry if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they weren\u2019t home at all. And then it happened. All that time and in two minutes it was gone: first David Timor then Alex Szymanowski scored: 67\u2019, 69\u2019, 2-0, 2-2. Butarque went bananas, Sevilla supporters silent. Up in the directors\u2019 box, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/sevilla-monchi-liverpool-europa-league-final\">Monchi</a> lit up a cigarette and puffed away nervously. The fear was natural, no wonder they felt it: two-up at a ground that hadn\u2019t seen its team win a first division game in its entire history and they <em>still</em> couldn\u2019t do it. They were <em>never</em> going to win away.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an inherited condition and an uncomfortable one,\u201d Sampaoli said afterwards, making Sevilla\u2019s run sound like a nasty dose of piles. \u201cPlayers always end up fearing that they\u2019ll never win away again, but instead of going under, they rebelled and looked for the goal.\u201d With five minutes left, they found it. The former Getafe striker Pablo Sarabia came in from the right and made up his mind. \u201cI knew I had to try it,\u201d he said. It was on his wrong foot but it was the right decision, a gorgeous shot curling into the far corner. On the touchline, Sampaoli went wild, or perhaps just <em>is</em> wild. \u201cHyperactive,\u201d he calls himself. And at the final whistle, he clenched his fists, pumped big, tattooed biceps and ran off down the tunnel. Sevilla had only gone and bloody done it.</p> <p>With some justification, Sampaoli had tried to shift the focus from the whole run to the more recent one: after all, just three of the 21 had been since he took over, and they had only lost one of those \u2013 away at Athletic \u2013 while drawing at Eibar and Villarreal. It hadn\u2019t been that bad \u2013 and even last season with that dreadful run they\u2019d managed to finish seventh and win the Europa League \u2013 but it had hung there. \u201cWe pulled a thorn from our side,\u201d said V\u00e1zquez. \u201cThis was very important; there had been some anxiety,\u201d Sarabia admitted. \u201cNow we can forget it, treat it as just an anecdote.\u201d As for Escudero, he insisted: \u201cWhat really matters is being up there.\u201d</p> <p>Sevilla are up there, alright. The monkey off their back, things look rather different now: seven games into the season they are unbeaten. Five wins and a draw in the league, a draw in Turin and a win over Lyon in Europe. When they left Legan\u00e9s, heading for Atocha station and the fast train home, they were top of the table. It didn\u2019t last \u2013 Atl\u00e9tico put seven past Granada and Madrid put six past Betis \u2013 but they do still sit third, just one point behind the top two, a point ahead of Barcelona. Eight games into a season, they have only been better off twice \u2013 in 2006 and 2014. No manager has ever had a better start than Sampaoli.</p> <p>But if Escudero says that\u2019s what really matters, his manager doesn\u2019t entirely agree and he is not alone. If it was not as bad as it seems, it might not be as good either. In the iron walkway that leads out of Butarque, Sarabia was talking to his mum, a member of staff piled up the pizzas on the Sevilla bus, and the Mute gave an interview. A few metres away, a Sevilla director was puffing out his cheeks. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d people said. \u201cYeah, but,\u201d he replied. In the press room, Sampaoli replied in much the same way. The manager, who insists that he would rather his team defended an idea than defended a result, was refusing to slip into hypocrisy, even if it is something a little more comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cThey overcame us at times,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThey were better.\u201d</p> <p>Even when they led 2-0, Sevilla had not convinced: Legan\u00e9s had seemed more likely to score when Sevilla made it 1-0, and more likely to equalise when they made it two. By the end, they\u2019d taken 19 shots to Sevilla\u2019s five, but lost 3-2. \u201cSevilla chose a bad day to stop smoking,\u201d wrote Juan Jim\u00e9nez in AS. \u201cThey played like always and won like never,\u201d ran one headline in the local paper Estadio Deportivo. For some, the problem is that they do not play much at all, and nor is it just this weekend. The start to the season has not been the most difficult and tougher tests await: the next two teams to come to the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n are Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona. Sevilla\u2019s season started with that incredible 6-4 win over Espanyol, but they were beaten 3-1 in Bilbao and their other victories were 2-1 wins against Alav\u00e9s and Las Palmas \u2013 both secured with last-minute equalisers.</p> <p>\u201cLuck? You have to look for your luck,\u201d Vicente Iborra insisted. And he is right; there\u2019s something not quite right about Sevilla yet but there\u2019s something about them. A huge amount of talent, for a start. And an intent. They have been fortunate but there are some glimpses of what they are trying to do and what they\u2019re about: only Barcelona have had more of the ball, against Alav\u00e9s they won it with two lovely backheels, and while it is true that Las Palmas dominated the first half against them, cutting Sevilla to bits, but while the equaliser came late (89\u2019) and the winner later (94\u2019), they did not come in isolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72f443777ec9a3c4ac4b5fcbd120ea8c2a11ecee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72f443777ec9a3c4ac4b5fcbd120ea8c2a11ecee/0_0_3191_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sevilla\u2019s players celebrate the opening goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevilla\u2019s players celebrate the opening goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mariscal/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things are not quite happening as Sampaoli wanted so far, which is natural enough. It is, after all, only eight weeks into the season and he rightly describes it as a \u201cprocess\u201d. \u201cTo repeat the philosophy is to consolidate it,\u201d he says, but that is not so easy. There are eleven new players in the squad (five of them Argentinians) and surprisingly little has been seen of Correa or Ganso, the latter a player whose touch and subtlety Sampaoli embraces, while Mat\u00edas Kranevitter has played a little under half the minutes. On Saturday, Iborra, a central midfielder who has spent time at centre-forward, played at centre-back. The ball is not coming out as they would like. They don\u2019t yet have an obvious candidate as the central midfielder who leads them in controlling the game; there\u2019s no \u00c9ver Banega or Ivan Rakitic.</p> <p>Or perhaps they do. Because there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/31/wilfried-bony-signs-stoke-manchester-city-loan\">Nasri, chosen ahead of Jack Wilshere</a> and nurtured by his manager and assistant coach Juanma Lillo. At Legan\u00e9s, he was at turns Sevilla\u2019s deepest player and their most advanced, on the right, the left and the middle, taking responsibility for getting them going, and not for the first time. \u201cThe team breathes when he has the ball,\u201d Sampaoli said. \u201cHe has so much quality that he is able to relieve us when we\u2019re being pressured by our opponent.\u201d Sampaoli called it a \u201cprocess\u201d, one that takes time, but there\u2019s only one way to buy time \u2013 by winning. On Saturday, at last, Sevilla did. Just when they thought they might never do so again.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Gooool! Gol, gol, gol, gol, gol, gol, gol. And so on ,and on and on. Not one of the current top six scoffed fewer than three goals this weekend: Atl\u00e9tico 7, Real Madrid 6, Sevilla 3, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/barcelona-deportivo-la-coruna-la-liga-match-report\">Barcelona 4</a>, Villarreal 5, Athletic 3.</p> <p> \u2022 A pity, then, that Las Palmas had to go and ruin it all with a 0-0 draw against Espanyol. Not that it was <em>their</em> fault, really. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores seems to have decided that goalless is the way to go.</p> <p>\u2022 It was a weekend of belting good goals too, but the best turned out to be pretty much the least relevant: Isaac Cuenca <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aqwCLFjnCE\">released his inner Matt le Tissier</a> to give Granada the lead at the Calder\u00f3n but by the end of the night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/atletico-madrid-granada-la-liga-match-report\">Yannick Carrasco was standing there</a> under the stand beaming, with the match ball in his hands signed by all his team-mates. \u201cWe told him to shoot more,\u201d Simeone said, helpfully. A little further along, a member of the Granada coaching staff was shrugging: \u201cWhen they get the steamroller out, there\u2019s not a lot you can do.\u201d They could have done a little more than they did \u2013 which, after a semi-decent first half, was not very much at all \u2013 but he had a point. Atl\u00e9tico are not just the best team defensively in La Liga \u2013 although they\u2019re that too, having let in just three goals \u2013 they are the best team, full stop.</p> <p>\u2022 Maybe sacking your manager isn\u2019t a problem after all; maybe the problem is waiting until the season actually starts to do it. Celta scored four against Barcelona last time round; this weekend, they conceded five against Villarreal \u2013 the team that got rid of their manager, Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, before the campaign had even begun. Villarreal are unbeaten in their eight games, level with Barcelona and just two points off the top. They were superb too, Roberto Soriano scoring twice to start it all off \u2013 including a neat curled lob. Afterwards, the coaches couldn\u2019t agree, just not the way round that managers normally don\u2019t agree: \u201cThey played well [at times]; we were tremendously effective,\u201d Fran Escrib\u00e1 said; \u201cthey could have scored more past us; they controlled the game,\u201d Toto Berizzo said.</p> <p> \u2022 \u201cThat was bordering on the ridiculous,\u201d Gus Poyet said. Bordering on? Fans chanted for him to go as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/15/real-betis-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">Betis were taken apart</a> by a very impressive Real Madrid side who also scored pretty much the perfect counter-attack from just about the worst corner imaginable. Oh, and for whom Isco starred, scoring twice. \u201cI\u2019m in intensive care, but I\u2019m not dead yet,\u201d Poyet insisted.</p> <p> \u2022 The Basque derby ended with Gero Rulli\u2019s last ditch chance, three yards out, being pulled back for offside. That\u2019s Rulli, the Real Sociedad goalkeeper. It was that kind of game. He had saved his team over and over but couldn\u2019t save them in the end, the match finishing 3-2. Zurutuza gave la Real the lead; Iker Muniain curled in a beauty, Aritz Aduriz beautifully clipped Athletic into the lead, and then Inaki Williams made it 3-1. He\u2019s Spain\u2019s fastest player, you know. Although a gorgeous goal from I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez \u2013 like a perfect cross-and-header routine but with everyone kind of facing the wrong way, turned side on instead \u2013 gave la Real a chance, Athletic held on for their first derby win in four-and-a-half years.</p> <p> \u2022 Next weekend: Valencia-Barcelona, Sevilla-Atl\u00e9tico, Madrid-Athletic and the Galician derby. Woof.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Las Palmas 0-0 Espanyol, Legan\u00e9s 2\u20133 Sevilla, Barcelona 4\u20130 Deportivo, Atl\u00e9tico 7\u20130 Granada, Betis 1-6 Madrid, Alav\u00e9s 1\u20131 M\u00e1laga, Athletic 3\u20132 Real Sociedad, Villarreal 5\u20130 Celta. <strong>Monday night:</strong> Eibar 2-3 Osasuna.<br></p>",
  "<p>Mayer Hersh, who has died aged 90, became in the last 30 years of his life one of the foremost UK-based witnesses to the Holocaust. That he had lived to tell his story at all was little short of miraculous. Hersh, whose family name was originally Herszkowicz, was a Polish Jew, born in the town of Sieradz, near \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, in central Poland. His father, Isaac, who was a tailor, mother, Riwka (nee Szczukowska), and four of his siblings were murdered in the Holocaust, as were his entire extended family in Poland, numbering close to a hundred. Only Mayer and his elder brother, Jakob, survived, taken from Sieradz in 1940 to be slave labourers.</p> <p>The brothers were separated and Mayer, who was 13 at the outbreak of the second world war, was taken from camp to camp. In May 1943 he found himself in Auschwitz. A few months later, he met Jakob in the camp and advised him to ask for a transfer to the coalmines in Silesia \u2013 advice that probably saved Jakob\u2019s life, since, though the job was desperately hard, it took him out of the camp.</p> <p>Mayer did not leave Auschwitz until November 1944, when he was taken to Stutthof, near the Baltic Sea, then to Stuttgart, and then to a camp called Gotha, where he worked in an underground bunker loading ammunition on to trucks. The day before the allies arrived, the workers began a forced march to Buchenwald, the last part of it through the mountains. \u201cAnyone who stopped got a single bullet through the head,\u201d said Hersh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t waste a bullet. For the first time, I had lost all hope. I was in total despair, but the man next to me, a complete stranger, said: \u2018You can\u2019t give up now, the war is virtually finished.\u2019 That made me carry on.\u201d</p> <p>After liberation, Hersh came to Britain with a Jewish refugee group and lived initially in the Lake District, where 300 young survivors of the camps were taken to recuperate. \u201cFor the first time in five years we were treated with dignity and respect,\u201d he said, \u201cand this by local people who didn\u2019t really know who we were.\u201d</p> <p>Jakob, meanwhile, went initially to the US and then settled in Israel. The brothers remained close, and Mayer was a frequent visitor to Israel until Jakob\u2019s death in 2003.</p> <p>Mayer had grown up in a Yiddish-speaking household, and also spoke Polish and German, but now had to learn English. A gifted linguist, he picked it up quickly, settled in Manchester, home to a large Jewish community, trained as a tailor and built a successful bespoke business.</p> <p>He had a shop in central Manchester, was active on behalf of Jewish causes \u2013 looking after survivors and collecting money for the new state of Israel \u2013 and in 1965 married Judith Cooklin, whom he had met at a Jewish social club in the city. Like almost all Holocaust survivors, in the 1950s and 60s he said little publicly of his experiences in the war. A combination of survivor guilt and the fact that the community in which he now lived had itself been traumatised by the war and wanted to resume normal life meant that much was left unsaid. But from the 70s on, and especially once he had retired, Hersh became an increasingly significant voice in Holocaust education.</p> <p>He toured schools \u2013 sometimes up to three a week \u2013 giving talks on his experiences, and his friend David Arnold, who helped plan the visits, says he may have addressed 100,000 schoolchildren. Many corresponded with him after his visits, and some became lifelong friends.</p> <p>As a survivor of nine camps, Hersh was much in demand to verify archival material, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOqLG9pPoM8\">recorded his testimony</a> many times, most notably in 1997 for the <a href=\"https://sfi.usc.edu/\">University of Southern California Shoah Foundation</a>, established by the film director Steven Spielberg in 1994. In 2003 Hersh cooperated with the author Colin Rushton on a book called Beyond the Gates of Hell. Arnold is also preparing a book, based on conversations with Hersh, called Of Hell and Humanity.</p> <p>Hersh\u2019s educational work was recognised with his appointment as MBE in 2013, but an award that meant even more to him had come the previous year \u2013 an honorary doctorate of education from Edge Hill University. He had had a close relationship with Edge Hill, based in Ormskirk, Lancashire, over many years, giving advice to trainee teachers on how to discuss the Holocaust with young people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/13/secondworldwar.poland7\">Mayer Hersh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bearing witness \u2013 not with anger but with compassion \u2013 had become his vocation. \u201cIn spite of what he had been through,\u201d said Rabbi Jonathan Guttentag at Hersh\u2019s funeral, \u201che was not bitter or negative \u2013 he was positive and faith-filled; he was wise, he was inspirational \u2026 By constantly being prepared to tell the story of his experiences, he was upholding the memory and the dignity of his family, his friends, his community and his people.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/13/secondworldwar.poland7\">I met Hersh in 2005 for an article</a> to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. \u201cIn 1944,\u201d he told me, \u201cI was daydreaming \u2013 when I had a chance to daydream \u2013 that maybe I\u2019ll get through and survive, knowing by that time that not many people would.

  "<p>If anyone expected 24 June to mark the end of a bitter and acrimonious battle over Britain\u2019s place in Europe, they could not have been more wrong. </p> <p>The battle over Brexit is going strong and with recent briefings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/17/philip-hammonds-brexit-worries-point-to-cabinet-tensions\">some from cabinet members themselves</a> \u2013 a somewhat poisonous atmosphere has emerged in parliament.</p> <p>Much of the focus is on last week\u2019s cabinet committee meeting about leaving the EU, when Theresa May and her chosen ministers (a balance of leave and remain supporters) discussed three papers on what happens next.</p> <p>The liveliest issue was unquestionably how far the prime minister would use the \u201cmandate\u201d of the Brexit vote to control Britain\u2019s borders, with Amber Rudd laying out the idea of a visa-entry scheme for highly skilled migrants as part of a free movement report.</p> <p>Pitched against the home secretary was the chancellor, Philip Hammond, whose decision to urge caution landed him on the sharp end of criticism from some Brexiters who say he is trying to stall the process. </p> <p>Had this script been written months ago, we would not have been able to predict the individuals taking on the key roles. </p> <p>The idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-boris-johnson-v-nicola-sturgeon-in-itv-debate-live\">tub-thumping, pro-remain Rudd</a>, whose strength of enthusiasm for staying in the EU made her a Tory rarity during the referendum campaign, would be spearheading the fight for immigration controls would have been bemusing.</p> <p>Equally unlikely would have been the sight of Hammond \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/15/philip-hammond-eurosceptic-foreign-secretary\">considered a staunch Eurosceptic</a> by his own party just two years ago \u2013 banging the drum for a soft Brexit in which economic considerations trump a free-movement clampdown.</p> <p>Brexiters think the chancellor went soft during his time in the pro-European Foreign Office, with leave campaigners dubbing him \u201cEuroPhil\u201d during the referendum.</p> <p>But according to civil servants involved in the process, the arguments are more defined by the departments that the individuals are defending rather than their personal views. </p> <p>To put it crudely, Hammond, as chancellor, will be judged on Britain\u2019s economic performance, while Rudd will have her feet held to the fire over migration numbers. And the battle is raging because so much is still up for grabs.</p> <p>People have been quick to label as a hard Brexit move May\u2019s promise that the UK will have immigration controls and not be under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.<br></p> <p>But the truth is that, beyond the fact of an EU exit, things are not black and white, but a mass of grey in which economic and free-movement factors could alter dramatically ahead of and during negotiations.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Rudd\u2019s work permit idea is not the only option on the table regarding migration controls. Other ideas being mooted in Europe by experts such as the Tory MEP Vicky Ford, who heads an influential Brussels committee on the single market, include an upper break on numbers, or a registration system for EU nationals. </p> <p>Ford believes the EU 27 would still be open to close economic ties under such a system, and suggests that Britain could also consider checking migrants\u2019 criminal records before they arrive without ruffling too many feathers. </p> <p>The Guardian has also been told that the issue of whether Britain should remain a member of the customs union \u2013 inside which EU countries negotiate trade deals collectively and set uniform external tariffs \u2013 is still up in the air. </p> <p>Although Liam Fox has suggested the UK will have to leave the customs union (perhaps to ensure his job as trade secretary remains viable), ministers did discuss a paper on the pros and cons of the issue last week, with some warning that the administrative costs of leaving could be huge. </p> <p>Even David Davis\u2019s new adviser, Raoul Ruparel, who believes an EU exit will mean leaving the free trade bloc, has admitted it could inflict a permanent cost of \u00a325bn on the UK\u2019s GDP. </p> <p>The arguments are dripping out of departments and into the media. </p> <p>Some senior figures have suggested Davis needs to choose his words more carefully, and be acutely aware of the impact that every twist and turn has on the financial markets. Others have said Hammond is guilty of talking down the economy. </p> <p>Friends of the chancellor have hit back, however, suggesting it is in his DNA to proceed with caution. After all, what\u2019s wrong with the chancellor acting like an accountant?</p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Brexit debate, one thing is clear: May\u2019s promise of \u201cno running commentary\u201d will be impossible to fulfil.</p>",

  "<p>It is hard to know who to trust when you\u2019re a refugee, explains 25-year old Mohamad Albwab from Syria. People smugglers lie. The armies close the borders. The conduct of the police varies from country to country. Aid organisations are overwhelmed. Rumour is rife and reliable information is hard to find. </p> <p>In the face of such uncertainty, many refugees look to their smartphones to find out what\u2019s happening. But finding information they can trust is hard. <br><br>Albwab was studying electrical engineering at university when war broke out. He has been in Stockholm for six months now, reunited with his brother after travelling through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Germany. He has found navigating life as a refugee incredibly difficult. <br></p> <p>\u201cI needed to know what the registration procedure was in the camps we moved through, what documents I needed to support my asylum application, which agencies can provide food, healthcare and places to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of information but nothing is trustworthy and no-one knows the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The refugee crisis has found a number of champions in the technology sector. <a href=\"http://refugeeaidapp.com/\">RefAid</a> for example, allows aid organisations to post resources by location and category, such as food, shelter, medical care or water, allowing refugees to search what\u2019s nearby, and fieldworkers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/18/rumours-and-lies-the-refugee-crisis-is-an-information-crisis\">Mediterranean Rumour Tracker</a> visit camps in Greece to collect and dispel, via its website and Facebook pages, common rumours. </p> <p>But one new approach is to automate information via a chatbot, making it easier, in theory, to scale and distribute to new regions or groups, and to create a link between refugees, governments and charities. </p> <p>   Created by three Danish Master\u2019s students, Ciar\u00e1n Duffy, Caroline Arvidsson and K\u00e5re Solv\u00e5g, <a href=\"http://www.refugeetext.org/\">Refugee Text</a> enables refugees to access information via a chatbot, via either text messaging or Facebook\u2019s messenger service.

The main way of reaching them is via community centres, but these require a lot of human resources and overheads. Refugee Text is one useful way, he says, to reach refugees with new information about the centres, which have services including legal advice, counselling and emergency cash.

  "<p>In any other election year, a massive battle involving US force to seize a city of hundreds of thousands from the Islamic State might affect how voters choose their next president. But 2016, defense analysts and political advisers observing the mid-October campaign for Mosul point out, is no normal election year.<br></p> <p>Two years after senior US officers described the fight for Mosul as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/12/politics/isis-baghdad-martin-dempsey/\">decisive</a>\u201d \u2013 something experts have become wary of predicting in Iraq \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/17/us-lloyd-austin-iraq-emphasis-airstrikes-isis-syria-kobani\">frequently delayed </a>battle for Iraq\u2019s second city is under way. Should Iraqi ground forces and US warplanes prove successful, Isis will lose its final stronghold in the country.</p> <p>The fight is expected to be the toughest in Iraq since Isis conquered the city in June 2014. Isis is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/14/last-battle-against-isis-in-iraq-forces-mass-for-mosul-assault\">6,000 fighters</a> prepared for close urban combat. The US military\u2019s spokesman for the war called Mosul \u201cby far the largest challenge the [Iraqis] have undertaken to date\u201d, far outstripping the battles to retake Ramadi and Fallujah in 2015 and 2016. Already civilians are fleeing the northern Iraqi city, and the United Nations is bracing for <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/battle-mosul-aid-agencies-warn-humanitarian-disaster-241710471\">as many as 1 million refugees</a>.</p> <p>The American public is expected to pay minimal attention.</p> <p>\u201cCompared to domestic issues, the electorate doesn\u2019t really care very much about this and probably is not following what\u2019s going on in Mosul in particular,\u201d said Steven Simon, who was mideast director for Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council from 2011 to 2012.</p> <p>The election calendar has been a factor in previous wars, even previous wars in Iraq. Only after George W Bush secured reelection in 2004 did the second battle of Fallujah unfold. But this time, according to a former Iraq adviser to both George W Bush and Obama, the differences between the second and third US wars in Iraq overwhelm their similarities, as do their electoral implications.</p> <p>While the US is providing a significant advisory presence for the Iraqi military, as well as a special-operations presence in the shadows, its primary combat contribution is aerial. With Iraqi forces on the ground doing the bleeding and dying, the American public does not consider the Iraq issue urgent, despite anxieties about the group known as Isis, Isil or Daesh featuring significantly in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not a divisive issue. There\u2019s not a huge lobby in the US for not having the Iraqis fight Isil in Iraq,\u201d said Doug Ollivant, a former NSC staffer and army veteran of the second Iraq war, who discloses that he has business interests in southern Iraq.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the two candidates would tell you they probably approach the battle of Mosul differently, I don\u2019t think anyone takes this seriously. There are not going to be, at least, many publicly acknowledged Americans directly involved, so it\u2019s difficult for me to see this taking a turn that has a significant impact on the presidential election.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Trump were arguing to do nothing, then a protracted campaign would help him.

They are concerned that not enough is being done to improve security even now. <br></p> <p>Bunch, who was working as a private contractor for aid agency Management Systems International, says the US embassy failed to keep aid workers informed. \u201cThe problem is that the UN mandate is completely under resourced for what it is being asked to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been nice if they had rescued us \u2013 but we didn\u2019t really expect it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were systemic failures and also incredible naivety.

  "<p>I will always remember the mood at the oversubscribed first meeting of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/the3million\" title=\"\">the 3 Million forum</a> in early July in Bristol. The anxiety in the room was palpable. People who had lived in the UK for anything between a couple of years and 60 or more were suddenly finding themselves in a bubble of suspended time, with huge question marks about their future, their lives and their families. Something had to happen; apathy was not an option.</p> <p>The official message since July has been that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d, a message relayed on the gov.uk pages relating to the application for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-uk-residence-card/permanent-residence-card\" title=\"\">permanent residence card</a>. The reality on the ground is that, effectively, everything has changed for us. People calling the Home Office have been told to apply for the card ever since the announcement of the referendum in February, as proof of their entitlement to stay. This is also the advice proffered by many immigration lawyers and EU law experts. The process is worse than your worst bureaucratic nightmare, and worse still if your life is complex and you require the services of an immigration lawyer to help you through the application, something that the majority of potential applicants cannot afford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/eu-citizens-brexit-foreigners-hate-crime-britain-tolerance\">We need a country that works for everyone \u2013 EU citizens included | Jakub Krupa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We started the 3 Million forum with the aim of preserving the rights of EU nationals living in the UK. \u201cRights\u201d is a funny concept.

The fact is, what is at stake behind these \u201crights\u201d is people\u2019s lives.

  "<p>After months of planning, a long-awaited ground assault on the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, the last urban stronghold of Islamic State in the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/iraqi-forces-begin-assault-on-isis-stronghold-mosul\">has begun</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Why is Mosul significant to Islamic State?</strong></h2> <p>The city is Iraq\u2019s second biggest and was overrun by Isis in mid-2014. Since then, the terror group\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d has shredded state authority in the region\u2019s heartland, led to a mass exodus of people, attempted a genocide of minorities and created grave doubts over the future of Iraq.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/oct/17/mosul-battle-iraq-isis-islamic-state-peshmerga-latest\">Battle for Mosul: Isis stronghold under attack from Iraqi and Kurdish forces \u2013 latest news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The formation of a caliphate across the borders of already existing countries is essential to Isis ideology, and the terror group is the first in modern history to control its own state in such a way. Without a caliphate, Isis would find it significantly harder to call on recruits to join in its war against the rest of the world.</p> <p>But the jihadis have had a string of territorial defeats this year in both Iraq and Syria \u2013 only on Sunday they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/turkish-opposition-fighters-syria-dabiq-islamic-state\">lost the town of Dabiq to Syrian rebel fighters</a> backed by Turkey. The loss of Mosul would be one of its greatest, because the city was acquired after beating the US-backed Iraqi army. It was from Mosul\u2019s Great Mosque that Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare public speech in 2014 in which he declared himself the new global caliph and called on followers to \u201cdo jihad in the cause of God, incite the believers, and be patient in the face of this hardship\u201d.</p> <p>Losing Mosul would also make it easier for Isis\u2019s opponents to recapture the group\u2019s Syrian capital of Raqqa, because major supply routes from Iraq would be cut.</p> <p>For these reasons, the assault is expected to be a protracted and difficult one, with Isis thought to have between 5,000 and 8,000 fighters ready to defend Mosul. These fighters are hidden among a dwindling civilian population of approximately 600,000, most of whom are expected to flee as the battle intensifies.</p> <p>Isis have had months to prepare and will seek to use hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, snipers, bombs, berms and trenches to slow down the Iraqi forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\" data-alt=\"Mosul map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/10/mosul-irbil-zip/giv-1406dZmG6zVDudi1/\">Mosul map</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Who is involved in the attack?</strong></h2> <p>The offensive is a joint operation by more than 30,000 troops from the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga and a Shia paramilitary force. Also on the ground are US, British and French special forces, which have been advising the peshmerga and will play a prominent role in calling in airstrikes against Isis targets inside the city.</p> <p>The US has recently deployed an additional 600 troops to aid in the retaking of Mosul, bringing the total number of US military personnel in Iraq to more than 5,200, according to the Pentagon. The US said on Sunday night it was proud to stand with its allies in the offensive, and in a statement, the defence secretary, Ash Carter, called it \u201ca decisive moment in the campaign to deliver Isil [Isis] a lasting defeat\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe United States and the rest of the international coalition stand ready to support Iraqi security forces, peshmerga fighters and the people of Iraq in the difficult fight ahead.

Isis is also believed to have placed thousands of improvised explosives in villages on the road to Mosul, which are likely to make the going slow.<br></p> <p>Isis has also used mustard gas against Kurdish forces \u2013 up to 19 times in the past two years. The militants thought responsible for the group\u2019s chemical weapons programme are believed to have all been captured, or killed, but a risk remains of further attacks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/iraqi-army-and-kurdish-peshmerga-attack-isis-stronghold-of-mosul-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/57qhb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2814410\"            data-video-name=\"Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga attack Isis stronghold of Mosul \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5804aa68e4b01ffb8ffcc839\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/17/161017Mosul_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/17/161017Mosul.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/17/161017Mosul_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/oct/17/iraqi-army-and-kurdish-peshmerga-attack-isis-stronghold-of-mosul-video\">Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga attack Isis stronghold of Mosul</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>What does the offensive mean for the people of Mosul? </strong></h2> <p>Militants have banned civilians from leaving Mosul, and have set up checkpoints on roads out and blown up the homes of those who do flee as punishment and to deter others. But while leaving can mean trekking through minefields, and the risk of discovery and punishment by Isis, those who stay know they face airstrikes, street battles, a potential siege by the Iraqi security forces (ISF) and the grim possibility of being used as human shields by Isis.</p> <p>Isis has used civilians for protection in other cities it lost control of in recent months, and militants have already moved into residential areas to try to blunt the impact of US airstrikes now landing near ordinary homes. Those stuck in Mosul are digging makeshift bomb shelters, stockpiling food, and, as the battle draws closer, mostly staying at home to avoid bombs or provoking militants. </p> <p>The United Nations and aid organisations warned that a huge number of civilians were in immediate danger as the operation got under way. \u201cI am extremely concerned for the safety of up to 1.5 million people,\u201d the UN deputy secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, Stephen O\u2019Brien, said. \u201cDepending on the intensity and scope of the fighting, as many as 1 million people may be forced to flee their homes in a worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/victory-isis-iraq-offensive-mosul\">Victory over Isis will not solve Iraq\u2019s problems | Ranj Alaaldin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Save the Children have said the lives of more than half a million children \u201cnow hang in the balance\u201d. The Norwegian Refugee Council said safe exits from Mosul must be provided or civilians would be faced with the \u201cbleakest of choices: stay behind and risk their lives under attack, or risk their lives trying to flee\u201d.<br></p> <p>One of the pressing questions is how to cater for what will potentially be the largest single exodus of people at any point since mid-2014. The new wave of displace people is likely to be far more difficult to manage than the war itself, and authorities and aid agencies were desperately trying to finalise plans before the attack. </p> <h2><strong>Why have sectarian concerns featured in the buildup to the fight?</strong></h2> <p>Sectarian tensions remained high in the region throughout the post-Saddam years, and peaked before Isis swept into Mosul in 2014. As the terror group arrived, Iraqi forces who were mostly Shia and had alienated the local population, quickly surrendered the city. Restoring trust with Baghdad and re-establishing basic governance therefore loom as the biggest challenge of the post-Isis period.<br></p> <p>Iraq\u2019s central government remains weak and has little influence in Sunni areas of the country. The US, which maintained a presence in Mosul until 2010, no longer has an occupying presence in Iraq. Barack Obama has made clear that the 6,000 troops his administration has redeployed are there only to fight Isis and not to provide military muscle in support of a diplomatic push to hold the country together.</p> <p>As for the offensive, Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga forces which have played vital roles in the war against Isis are not slated to enter the largely Sunni Mosul. The Iraqi military, which is largely made up of Shia soldiers and officers, will take the lead in the battle. </p> <p>Iraq\u2019s counter-terrorism forces, which performed well in the four-week battle to retake Falluja in June, are expected to lead the fight. Peshmerga units are planning to take up blocking positions to the north and east, where they will also receive and screen fleeing civilians. The popular mobilisation units, known in Iraq as Hashd al-Sha\u2019bi, have been confined to a blocking role to the west of Mosul.</p> <p>An Iraqi intelligence official said: \u201cThere is an agreement about the structure, and the order in which [forces] come in. This is the last battle in Iraq and everyone wants to be included. It was a wise move to let the Shia militia be involved but in designated areas, and under control. I don\u2019t think after two years fighting Isis you can keep out the Shia in the last battle of Iraq.<br></p> <p> \u201cIf we cannot reassure Sunnis they will fight to the death. There are small elements trying to assassinate [Isis], and trying to make them feel uncomfortable, but it largely depends on the tribes. We are trying to tell the Sunnis inside this is coming, and people reaching out to them and saying they have a second chance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hadley, you\u2019ve written on Brexit elsewhere in the paper, but not in your style column. Why is that?</strong></p> <p><em>Robert, by email</em></p> <p>You\u2019re right, Robert! I have stayed away from Brexit in this column because that would mean looking at what it means for the fashion industry, and the answer to that is, well, no one knows. Confusion over Brexit, how strange \u2013 don\u2019t see that in any other industry, do you?</p> <p>On the one hand, thanks to the plummeting pound (boo!) luxury goods are now cheaper for tourists (er, yay?). So, for example, a Louis Vuitton Speedy bag is currently <a href=\"http://hypebeast.com/2016/10/cheap-luxury-products-london-brexit\">about $200 cheaper in the UK</a> for US visitors \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t exactly count this as sticking it to the elites, as the leave campaign repeatedly claimed voting its way would achieve. But, someone at the back bellows, this will help the British industry as a whole. A surge of tourism! Bringing in money! To the economy! Yay!</p> <p>All right, little Mikey Gove, try to calm yourself. Maybe go and have an ice cream out the back, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/brexit-to-blame-uks-biggest-retailer-is-running-out-of-ben-jerrys.html\">but not Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s because we can\u2019t afford that at the moment</a>. So some tourists might spend more at Harrods, but let\u2019s look at what this means on a more granular level, as proper columnists would put it. Yes, British exports will be cheaper, but only if they don\u2019t rely on imported goods and manufacturing. And, as much as it might pain certain members of the Tory party to hear this, pretty much every British fashion brand relies on those two things. This isn\u2019t because British fashion labels are trying to chisel their own nation\u2019s economy with cheap Chinese knockoffs and eastern European workers, but rather because it is simply not possible for most fashion labels to be entirely manufactured in this country, relying instead on European factories and skilled labour. So the net result of Brexit on all this is that British brands will become much more expensive for British customers, as companies find their costs going up and their workforce depleting. Um, yay sovereignty?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/15/brexit-britain-where-not-wanted\">When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they don\u2019t mean me. Or do they?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also, let\u2019s look at British fashion as a whole. Now, what this country\u2019s fashion industry has always lacked in terms in of infrastructure, slickness and big-brand money, it has made up for in creativity. At least, that\u2019s what those who work in it love to tell themselves. OK, we don\u2019t have Dior or Calvin Klein, but look! We have the best fashion schools in the world, where the best students from around the world come to study. And look! We also produce some of the most acclaimed designers who then work at the biggest labels around Europe, such as Phoebe Philo (Chlo\u00e9, C\u00e9line), Stella McCartney (Chlo\u00e9), Alexander McQueen (Givenchy), John Galliano (Givenchy, Dior, Maison Margiela), etc, etc. Yay, Britain! But how, exactly, will this continue to work if it\u2019s harder for foreign students to come here and European companies have to sort out complex visas when they hire British workers? Oh stop worrying, says the leave camp, relying, perhaps, on British fashion\u2019s much-vaunted creativity to get around these little problems.</p> <p>Finally, I\u2019d say the ultimate problem is bigger and more amorphous than visas. So much in fashion is about image and association: buy a New York label and you\u2019re buying into the fantasy of Manhattan dynamism and power lunches; an Italian label suggests <em>dolce vita</em> glamour; French labels promise chic. British labels, more than any other country\u2019s, play on such national stereotypes: ideas of heritage (the tweed, the crown), punkish rebellion and, most of all, a kind of gonzo creativity in which Britain has always taken pride. But what image, Britain, do we have now, in our post-Brexit era on the global stage? I\u2019d wager it has a lot less to do with enviable sovereignty and more about a silly little country that cut off its nose to spite everyone\u2019s face. Is that the sort of look people want to buy into?</p> <p>Look, as even Boris Johnson would almost certainly admit if you caught him in a rare moment of honesty, Brexit has far bigger problems facing it than how it will affect the fashion industry. But all of these issues underline the central question of Brexit, which is: what kind of country do we want to live in? Because, at the risk of tipping into pomposity, fashion encapsulates fantasy and aspirational self-image. So when a country\u2019s fashion industry looks like it will struggle to achieve this, on both a practical and mental level, it\u2019s perhaps time to take a good long look in the mirror again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35d7098abcd9aab1d7fff9ebda937cd2e09233be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35d7098abcd9aab1d7fff9ebda937cd2e09233be/224_80_4359_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right look?

Tickets to the show at the Richard Rodgers theater, which seats only 1,319, are notoriously difficult to snag and more than worth their weight in gold. So there\u2019s a ready-made audience for the PBS documentary Hamilton\u2019s America, which screens on 21 October under the aegis of Great Performances: everyone wants to be in the room where it happens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/sep/25/lin-manuel-miranda-broadway-smash-hamilton-hip-hop-musical-school-of-eminem\">Lin-Manuel Miranda on his Broadway smash Hamilton: 'the world freaked out'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But this is a desire that the documentary only intermittently satisfies. Handsome, admiring and assured, it sets out to describe both the story of Hamilton the musical and the story of Hamilton himself, an intertwining both gratifying and frustrating. </p> <p>The documentary\u2019s producers, RadicalMedia, had a hunch that Hamilton would be a success and began filming Miranda in 2014, months before rehearsals began. Miranda, ponytail in various stages of growth, is an enthusiastic and unpretentious host. Sometimes he speaks directly to an unseen interlocutor; at other times he asks the questions, interviewing those who have inspired him, from Stephen Sondheim to Nas, from his father to Barack Obama. (Miranda\u2019s father\u2019s description of his immigrant experience is poignant and pointed.) </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KsTjxKi5JE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KsTjxKi5JE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The best sequences juxtapose Miranda and the show\u2019s stars with historic settings \u2013 the women of the cast visiting the home of an aunt of the Schuyler sisters, one of whom Hamilton married; Leslie Odom Jr and Miranda strolling along Maiden Lane in New York and executing an impromptu shoulder shuffle; one beautiful scene of Miranda writing in Aaron Burr\u2019s bedroom, mouthing words with his eyes closed, headphones clapped to his ears. Also featured are a few choice bits of backstage banter and freestyling, which mostly serve to whet the appetite for more. Unfortunately, there\u2019s almost no rehearsal footage or any sense of how the show was built from the script up. The filmed excerpts are beautifully shot, though tantalizingly brief. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/01/lin-manuel-miranda-ancestry-hamilton-mexico-texas\">Lin-Manuel Miranda's ancestry is as multifaceted as Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to the history of Hamilton himself, the approach is dutiful, with predictable archival images and talking heads. Some of these heads are more incisive than others. Ron Chernow, on whose book Hamilton based the musical, is of course a welcome presence, as is the historian Joanne Freeman and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who offers a nuanced critique of Hamilton\u2019s elitism. But the likes of Jimmy Fallon and George W Bush don\u2019t offer much illumination, though Bush\u2019s analysis of Hamilton is interestingly self-serving: \u201cThat\u2019s the way history works. Sometimes it takes a while for people to give you credit.\u201d</p> <p>Is any of this more rewarding than a filmed version of the show in the style of NT Live would be? Not really. Michelle Obama\u2019s hyperbolic encomium, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/15/hamilton-at-the-white-house-obamas-art-theater\">Hamilton is</a> \u201cthe best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life\u201d, is fun to hear. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to listen in on the art itself or at least tell the story of its creation more specifically? The producers of this engaged and often astute film have in no way thrown away their shot, but they might have taken more particular aim.</p>",
  "<p>One of the things the Dallas Cowboys have always loved about Tony Romo is his football mind. Three years ago he played a significant role in developing the team\u2019s offense, doing far more than most quarterbacks by sitting in most of the coaches\u2019 offensive installation meetings during that offseason. Few quarterbacks have the patience or the understanding to attend those endless meetings and help design the offense. In the Cowboys offices he is seen as a football genius \u2013 even if this brilliance doesn\u2019t always appear in the waning moments of the most important games.</p> <p>But now that the broken bone in Romo\u2019s back has recovered and Jerry Jones has said Romo will have his starting job back when healthy, the Cowboys should consider leaving Romo on the sideline where he can serve as an extra coach for Dak Prescott. For no matter how wonderful Romo is at breaking down tape and drawing plays on a whiteboard, Dallas should not pull Prescott. Their future quarterback should probably remain their current quarterback.</p> <p>What hasn\u2019t he done? Thrown into one of the most-scrutinized roles in sports \u2013 quarterback of the Cowboys \u2013 with little time to prepare, the rookie Prescott has been outstanding. He has led Dallas to a 5-1 record no one expected them to have when Romo went down late in the preseason. He has thrown seven touchdowns for just one interception, and his passer rating <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/dakprescott/2555260/profile\">has been over 100 for five straight weeks</a>. Rookies don\u2019t do this often. They really don\u2019t do it when they have been dumped into the starting line-up days before the season\u2019s start.</p> <p>After the Cowboys <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2016101610/2016/REG6/cowboys@packers/watch#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000722327&amp;tab=recap\">beat Green Bay 30-16 on Sunday</a> even Jones wasn\u2019t ready to hand the job back to Romo, avoiding questions on who will be starting at quarterback following the team\u2019s bye next week. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I think we do is wait until the next card is played,\u201d Jones said. A few moments later he was even less specific: \u201cI\u2019d hate to end up with two winning quarterbacks and a tough decision as to who is going to win the game,\u201d he said and then winked.</p> <p>His Cowboys are in first place in the NFC East and look like Super Bowl contenders, a fact that startled even Jones as he stood in the locker room beneath Lambeau Field early Sunday evening. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that we are playing as well as we\u2019ve played,\u201d he said. How can anyone change this by inserting Romo into the success that has come behind Prescott? \u201cThese are not hard times,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>And yet they are. One wrong move can destroy everything, especially with Dallas\u2019s rival, Washington, just a game behind at 4-2. Right now the Cowboys are playing with confidence, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">outscoring opponents by 52 points</a>, the fourth-best rate in the league. But their wins behind Prescott are more team victories than individual monuments. The Cowboys have been conservative with him, putting him in situations where he can be confident. So far that has worked, but there will come a time when it doesn\u2019t, when teams will make moving the ball difficult and when he will have passes intercepted. Dallas can return to Romo then. For now, they should ride the one who has gotten them to a place they never imagined they\u2019d be. Why ruin a winning formula? Surely even Jerry Jones knows that.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>He\u2019s as knowledgable about that as he is about foreign policy</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman was cornered by <a href=\"http://geekwire.com/\">geekwire.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2016/seahawks-star-richard-sherman-donald-trump-microsoft-surface-power-grit-favorite-apps/\">after an event in Seattle on Friday</a> and was asked what he made of Donald Trump\u2019s comments about the NFL\u2019s concussion laws being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/10/13/trump-just-criticized-the-nfls-softer-rules-intended-to-help-protect-players-from-traumatic-brain-injury/\">\u201csoft.\u201d</a> Sherman was obviously not impressed by Trump\u2019s thoughts.

When Richard confronted Sherman about the score, seemingly implying the miscommunication that allowed the touchdown was Sherman\u2019s fault, the cornerback exploded, throwing his helmet to the turf and screaming at Richard. When team-mates tried to intervene he shouted at them too.</p> <p>Apparently the whole exercise worked. Despite allowing Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan to throw for 335 yards and three touchdowns, the Seahawks came back from a 24-17 fourth quarter deficit to win 26-24, <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nfl/2016/10/16/falcons-seahawks-pass-interference-julio-jones-richard-sherman\">albeit after a controversial call at the end of the game</a>.

Yes, John Elway. Hall of Fame John Elway. Manning, who came into Sunday\u2019s 27-23 victory over Baltimore with just five touchdowns this season, is some way behind No6, Fran Tarkington, who has 342. Not surprisingly, Eli\u2019s big brother Peyton is No1 with 539 touchdowns. But who would have imagined that Eli \u2013 a player with clear flaws \u2013 would pass Peyton\u2019s last boss <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/elimanning/2505996/careerstats\">in just his 13<sup>th</sup> season?</a></p> <h2><strong>Fantasy player of the week</strong></h2> <p>Imagine the poor fool in your fantasy league who was forced to start Rams quarterback Case Keenum on Sunday. You probably chuckled at their fate, rolling your eyes at the ridiculousness of dumping a quarterback who put up a passer rating of 67.7 in Los Angeles\u2019s loss to Buffalo last week. So imagine your fantasy rival\u2019s surprise when Keenum rocketed passes all over Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, completing 27-of-32 throws for 321 yards in a 31-28 loss to the Lions. Especially nice were those three touchdowns against one interception for a rating of 126.7.

This exceeds even the trite \u201cSuper Bowl hangover\u201d tag often thrown out to describe a team that struggles after they play for the title. Carolina\u2019s 1-5 start can\u2019t be dismissed with a simple shrug of the shoulders and wave of the hand. Letting cornerback Josh Norman go might have been a mistake in retrospect, but even Norman wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep New Orleans from putting up 523 yards in their 41-38 win on Sunday. Cam Newton has been beaten up this year, with at least one concussion and yet he still threw for 322 yards and two touchdowns while running for another. Mostly, it seems Carolina lack cohesion. Now they have tumbled to last place in the NFC South, tied with Chicago and San Francisco for the worst record in the conference.</p> <p>- Tom Brady played his first home game in Foxboro this year and immediately restored order for the Patriots by throwing Rob Gronkowski his first touchdown pass of the year in New England\u2019s 35-17 victory over Cincinnati. Brady had two other touchdown passes and threw for 376 yards. Cincinnati, preseason favorites to win the AFC North, fell to 2-4.</p> <p>- Marcus Mariota is showing signs of growth as an NFL quarterback. Sunday, he threw for 284 yards and three touchdowns in Tennessee\u2019s 28-26 home victory over Cleveland. This pushed the Titans to a respectable 3-3. The Browns, however, tumbled to an awful 0-6. Still, the news was not all bad for Cleveland. Rookie quarterback Cody Kessler had his best game so far in the NFL completing 26-of-41 passes for 336 yards and two touchdowns.</p> <p>- Hapless Jacksonville held on to beat hapless Chicago 17-16 in perhaps the day\u2019s worst game. Blake Bortles hit Arrelious Benn on a 51-yard touchdown pass late in the game to give the Jags their second victory of the year, negating the 302 yard passing day of 1-5 Bears\u2019 fill-in quarterback Brian Hoyer.</p>",

  "<p>Northern Ireland should push the EU to grant it special associate or even membership status to avoid the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of Brexit for Irish people, Martin McGuinness has said.</p> <p>The deputy first minister and Sinn F\u00e9in leader told the Guardian that leaders in Belfast and Dublin needed to work together to make the case for special rules to apply to Northern Ireland. The province voted 56:44 in favour of staying in the EU in June\u2019s referendum, but will be forced to pull out when Britain does.</p> <p>\u201cAs things sit at the moment we are going to suffer big time,\u201d McGuinness said. \u201cTheresa May says \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019, but so far as we are concerned Brexit means disaster for the people of Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was encouraged that the Democratic Unionists, with whom his party shares power in Belfast, also agreed that Ireland needed to be treated as a special case by Brussels because of the importance of the potential problems \u2013 borders, trade, peace and security \u2013 presented by Brexit.</p> <p>And he added that many unionists were as unhappy as republicans at the outcome of the referendum and the risk posed by the restoration of immigration and customs borders, as well as loss of easy access to EU markets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The big challenge is whether the government in the north and south can come to a common position</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a large amount of discontent, including within the unionist community, about how this Tory-led Westminster administration is being so cavalier in disregarding the impact of what they are planning,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McGuinness warned that unionists could turn against Westminster in the way that Scots have done in recent years because of the feeling that London doesn\u2019t care about them. \u201cI think there are a lot of people here beginning to feel the same, and depending on how this negotiation goes that trend will accelerate over the next couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be an island of Ireland solution that we can live with, and it is critical that we have an Irish government fighting our corner, so the big challenge in the next few weeks is whether the government in the north and the south can come to a common position.

It would be a devastating blow.\u201d Moreover, some 37% of Northern Ireland\u2019s exports, worth \u00a33.6bn, go to Ireland.</p> <p> Britain has said its one stated red line in the talks with the EU will be to prevent the formation of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and to ensure the maintenance of a common travel area. But it has not set out how this is achievable, and McGuinness is sceptical.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhenever the government promise there will be no return to the borders of the past, they don\u2019t make it clear there will be no borders.

The fatal decision to hold the referendum was made without any consideration whatsoever on its impact in the island of Ireland.\u201d</p>",

As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since <strong>Bill Shorten</strong> last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer <strong>Kimberley Kitching</strong>, to replace the departing <strong>Stephen Conroy</strong>.<br></p> <p>Let\u2019s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, <strong>Kim Carr</strong>, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call that a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus.</p> <p>It appears to have done exactly that. <strong>Gavin Marshall</strong> (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named <strong>Andrew Giles</strong> and <strong>Catherine King</strong>, the shadow health minister. </p> <p>Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he\u2019s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal.</p> <p>The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight\u2019s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate.<br></p> <p>We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared.<strong> Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers).</strong><br></p> <p>That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy\u2019s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn\u2019t. <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> once talked about exciting times.

  "<p>If Donald Trump should win the presidency it would represent a threat to press freedom, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2016/10/cpj-chairman-says-trump-is-threat-to-press-freedom.php\">says the Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ).</p> <p>The US-based press freedom watchdog has taken what it calls \u201can unprecedented step\u201d by issuing a statement by the chair of its board, Sandra Mims Rowe, in which she accuses Trump of consistently betraying first amendment values.</p> <p>Earlier this month, said the statement, CPJ\u2019s board of directors passed a resolution declaring Trump to be a \u201cthreat to the rights of journalists and to CPJ\u2019s ability to advocate for press freedom around the world\u201d. It continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the beginning of his candidacy, Trump has insulted and vilified the press and has made his opposition to the media a centrepiece of his campaign. Trump has routinely labelled the press as \u2018dishonest\u2019 and \u2018scum\u2019 and singled out individual news organisations and journalists.</p> </blockquote> <p>It recalled that Trump, the Republican candidate, \u201cmocked a disabled New York Times journalist and called an ABC News reporter a \u2018sleaze\u2019 in a press conference\u201d. </p> <p>It also stated that Trump had refused to condemn attacks on journalists by his supporters while his campaign team had \u201csystematically denied press credentials to outlets that have covered him critically\u201d.</p> <p>Rowe\u2019s statement mentioned the rally in Texas in February, in which Trump pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">\u201copen up our libel laws so when [newspapers] write purposely negative stories</a>\u2026 we can sue them and make lots of money\u201d.</p> <p>In September, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/777280259875975169\">Trump tweeted</a>: \u201cMy lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching\u201d.</p> <p>The CPJ statement said: \u201cWhile some have suggested that these statements are rhetorical, we take Trump at his word. His intent and his disregard for the constitutional free press principle are clear\u201d.</p> <p>It believed a Trump presidency would have a negative effect on press freedom outside the United States, arguing that any failure by the US to uphold its own standards <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2016/05/why-trumps-insults-of-journalists-must-be-taken-se.php\">would embolden despotic leaders</a> to restrict the media in their own countries. The statement concluded: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Through his words and actions, Trump has consistently demonstrated a contempt for the role of the press beyond offering publicity to him and advancing his interests... </p> <p>This is not about picking sides in an election. This is recognising that a Trump presidency represents a threat to press freedom unknown in modern history.</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement was issued before Trump implied that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/trump-groping-accusations-new-york-times-rally\">the New York Times was part of a Mexican conspiracy to undermine him.</a></p> <p>This was the \u201clogic\u201d of his claim: \u201cThe largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim [who]... comes from Mexico. He\u2019s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiative.\u201d </p> <p>So, in Trump\u2019s view, NY Times reporters are \u201cnot journalists, they\u2019re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton\u201d.</p> <p>Trump returned to that theme on Sunday<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787699930718695425\"> in a tweet</a> saying: \u201cThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary...\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/donald-trump-rigged-election-poll-giuliani-gingrich-pence\">supported by Newt Gingrich</a>, a former Republican House of Representatives speaker. During a Fox News interview he said: \u201cFourteen million people picked Donald Trump.

  "<p>Drive south along Croatia\u2019s Adriatic freeways and you will stumble on the kind of border headache that Ireland might face when Britain leaves the EU.<br></p> <p>An hour-long tailback at the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina makes motorists fume. A desultory passport check and everyone is on their way again \u2013 but not for long. Ten miles further south there\u2019s another border, this time crossing from Bosnia back into Croatia.</p> <p>When Croatia joined the EU in 2013, these became hard borders again overnight. If Britain opts for a \u201c\u2018hard Brexit\u201d, ending freedom of movement with the EU and requiring new trade arrangements, the same issues could rear up along the 310-mile (500km) frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p> <p>Officials on both sides seem determined that no hard border will re-emerge. Many feel that passport checks in particular would be unnecessary, however urgently the British feel they need to \u201ctake back control\u201d of their borders. </p> <p>But questions remain: how will customs enforce differences in tariffs without searching lorries on the scores of roads that run between north and south? If the border is not policed, how will EU nationals who migrate to the Irish Republic be prevented from moving to the north, and then to Great Britain? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:06:26.html\" data-alt=\"Croatia map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:06:26.html\">Croatia map</a> </figure>  <p>Like the Irish divide, the 850-mile demarcation line in the Balkans cuts across cultural, family, and business ties, with bilateral trade worth \u00a31.1bn (\u20ac1.3bn).</p> <p>When Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013, the bloc\u2019s external frontier was redrawn along the country\u2019s borders with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. The border with Bosnia and Herzegovina has proved particularly troublesome. Both were once republics of Yugoslavia, and 15% of Bosnian citizens are ethnic Croats, most of whom have Croatian EU passports. </p> <p>In some cases, the results are surreal: houses and farms that are part in the EU and part not, and farmers who need to show ID to get to and from their own fields.</p> <p>Ivan Glavota runs a winery with a 100-year-old wine cellar in Imotski, a picturesque small town on the Croatian side that is perched on cliffs above a striking azure lake. He has 1,000 vines on the Bosnian side of the border. In addition to the occasional bureaucratic hassle of crossing to his own land, he is not able to obtain EU or Croatian funding for the grapes harvested across the border, though the wine is made in Croatia.</p> <p>\u201cThis creates a problem for numerous small agriculture producers in the area,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The border has become synonymous with such frustrations. Even though most Bosnian goods enjoy free-trade status within the EU, Bosnian agricultural goods can only be exported to Croatia through two customs posts on their long frontier, pushing up costs. Tariff-free trade privileges were suspended temporarily earlier this year during a bureaucratic wrangle.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to sometimes forget that Croatia is now part of a different system, that things are not like they used to be,\u201d says Amer Kapetanovic, assistant minister for bilateral affairs and economic diplomacy at the Bosnian foreign ministry. \u201cAll these bureaucratic nuances suddenly became very important and this is the moment of realisation that Croatia is in the EU and we are not, despite the fact that we used to live together in one state, we speak the same language, listen to the same music, have the same jokes, have family either side of the border.\u201d</p> <p>Kapetanovic warns his counterparts to avoid a clean break when it comes to Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wise if during the negotiations on article 50 both the UK and Ireland strongly opt for continuing with an open border policy,\u201d he says. \u201cAs neither are part of Schengen [passport-free travel zone], I think it would be the wisest approach. Otherwise some of our examples affecting our daily life with our EU neighbour Croatia might appear in your situation as well, and I\u2019m sure your people would not like it.\u201d</p> <p>Croatian former interior minister Ranko Ostojic, who was in office when Croatia joined the EU, points out that citizens living within 30km of the border are eligible for special passes. But he acknowledges that there are long queues at the border as all other non-EU citizens (including most Bosnians) are subject to \u201cfull passport control\u201d at the border, and require biometric passports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"652e32e5f41df51fe1282b851ff9d465fc5242dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/652e32e5f41df51fe1282b851ff9d465fc5242dd/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trucks queue on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trucks queue on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Croatia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zoltan Balogh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Nordic model</h2> <p>About 2,000 miles to the north, another EU border provides further insights into what happens when two close trading partners have a hard tariff border. </p> <p>In the Swedish town of Charlottenberg, sweet shops are thriving because of the different prices of sugar in Sweden and Norway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-30T15:49:54.html\" data-alt=\"Sweden map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2016-09-30T15:49:54.html\">Sweden map</a> </figure>  <p>Every weekend, Norwegians come to fill their boots \u2013 literally \u2013 from an assortment of 4,000 varieties of cheap candy in stores such as <a href=\"http://www.gottebiten.se/\">Gottebiten</a>, which is almost the size of a football field.</p> <p>Enormous Swedish shopping centres within driving distance of Oslo also cater to Norwegian demand for low-tax tobacco and alcohol. </p> <p>The creation of the Nordic Council after the second world war saw passport-free travel and a common labour market implemented across the Nordic countries. Sweden\u2019s accession to the EU in 1995 did not change the arrangement, and indeed Norway\u2019s membership of the European Economic Area makes issues such as freedom of movement moot.</p> <p>The two countries that once split apart have grown closer together, despite one being inside the EU and the other outside. So could Norway and Sweden hold any lessons for the future of Britain and Ireland?<br></p> <p>\u201cPassport-free movement while Norway is not an EU member is quite unique,\u201d says Peter Dafteryd, a councillor for the ruling centre-right group on the town council of Str\u00f6mstad, another community near the border with Norway. \u201cThe problem in Ireland is that that kind of arrangement has not been prepared. It will be a struggle for both sides, I think.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/atlas/programmes/2014-2020/europe/2014tc16rfcb016\">EU\u2019s Interreg programme</a> spends as much as \u20ac20m a year on strengthening economic cooperation across the border. \u201cThe EU wants to have good relations with its neighbours,\u201d says Michael von Essen, a project officer for Interreg on the Swedish side.</p> <p>Some Norwegian companies like to establish themselves inside the EU, so they open small offices in places such as Str\u00f6mstad, just 80 miles from Oslo, according to Dafterydl.</p> <p>\u201cThat way they have a daughter company in the EU, with quite different taxes and regulations. It\u2019s a way of getting into the EU without being a member,\u201d Dafteryd says. Norwegians bring more than 8bn krona (\u00a3715m) into the Str\u00f6mstad area every year, paying the salaries of some 2,000 Swedes, he adds.</p> <h2>Germany-Switzerland</h2> <p>Another model for the future of the British-Irish border may be glimpsed where Germany meets Switzerland.<br></p> <p> Officially, there have been no land border controls between the two countries since 12 December 2008, and journeys by air have been denoted \u201cinland flights\u201d since 29 March 2009 \u2013 which means people only need to show their ID card to board a flight from Berlin to Zurich, and can walk from Basel to Weil am Rhein without any documents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:11:12.html\" data-alt=\"Switzerland map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/oct/2016-10-03T15:11:12.html\">Switzerland map</a> </figure>  <p> Apart from the odd cow fence, there are no fortifications along the 362-km border. About 54,000 people who live in Germany commute daily to Switzerland.</p> <p> But since Switzerland is not part of the EU\u2019s customs union, both countries carry out some checks at the crossings. For example, even though Switzerland is part of Schengen, Germans on holiday to the Swiss Alps are not allowed to take more than two bottles of wine or 500g of beef. Likewise, if expensive skiing equipment is purchased in Verbier, it must be declared to German customs when crossing back into the EU.</p> <p>The line between controlling traffic of people and goods is hard to draw. Swiss customs officials are also required to carry out ID checks for security issues, and not just at fixed border points but also via mobile units that operate along the border. Customs officials say they can carry out spot checks without creating tailbacks at border points.</p> <p>In September 2010 Bavarian police gained the first lead that eventually resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/german-and-swiss-art-galleries-display-cornelius-gurlitt-nazi-art\">discovery of the Munich art hoard</a> after customs officers discovered \u20ac9,000 in cash on collector Cornelius Gurlitt during a spot check on a Zurich-Munich train. The legal limit is \u20ac10,000.</p> <p>Since the start of 2015, even couriers who travel two miles to deliver pizzas from an Italian restaurant in Weil am Rhein to Basel have to declare their stone-oven-baked wares with Swiss customs. It\u2019s easy to see why: a pizza margherita, which sells for about \u20ac4.90 on the German side of the border, costs \u20ac13 in Basel. </p> <p>It is no coincidence the term \u201cshopping tourist\u201d was voted the Swiss word of the year in 2015. People in German border cities such as Konstanz complain about Swiss visitors gridlocking their medieval city.</p> <p>Shopping tourists are already emerging in northern Ireland, as the slump in sterling makes goods in Britain that much cheaper. <br></p> <p>But there have been no reports of gridlock in Belfast as yet.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p> </p>",

At the beginning of the year, when they begin to grasp how difficult the referendum is going to be, Cameron lamely jokes: \u201cRemind me whose idea this was?\u201d When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>&#xa0;declares for Out, Cameron greets this&#xa0;act of personal and political&#xa0;betrayal by shrugging: \u201cThat\u2019s&#xa0;him off&#xa0;the Christmas card list.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oliver does not report this with intended malice. He is never less than adoring about the man he refers to as \u201cDC\u201d. He wants us to admire his boss and share his pride to \u201chave worked for a man who had always been able to take anything in his stride\u201d. But in this reader \u2013 and, I suspect, many others \u2013 it simply provoked fury that Cameron greeted each disaster with a flip remark. It had me wondering whether he found it so easy to sound untroubled by the unplanned consequences of his reckless actions because he was never really all that bothered about anything much.</p> <p>\u201cThe inside story\u201d of the most seismic campaign in Britain\u2019s postwar history ought to make for a highly compelling read. Yet this book weirdly&#xa0;contrives to drain it of drama. This is partly because Oliver, being a spin doctor, is obsessed with things that only really interest spin doctors. &#xa0;He details his spats with various journalists, which will probably gratify their egos, but is of little interest to anyone else. Someone seems to have told him that this sort of book needs \u201ccolour\u201d. The author interprets this as an instruction never to leave the reader uninformed about what he ate. Sometimes this is as exciting as a Pret sandwich. To help us understand how gruelling life is at the coalface of the campaign grid, he gives us a stream of bulletins about his health. \u201cMonday begins with a throbbing head, toothache and low-level sore throat.\u201d \u201cI go to bed with a low-level headache.\u201d \u201cI feel knackered.\u201d \u201cI am so exhausted now that I don\u2019t even feel tired.\u201d \u201cI feel physically sick.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m dehydrated.\u201d \u201cThe campaign is making me ill \u2013 my chest is wheezy and I have the early symptoms of an ulcer.\u201d For God\u2019s sake, man, see a doctor. There is a lot of regurgitation of \u201clines to take\u201d that he drafted for this or that media squall. There are long and unrevelatory accounts of what one staffer you\u2019ve never heard of said to another staffer you\u2019ve never heard of. Funnily enough, it is usually Oliver who comes over as the shrewdest person in the room. When the other side makes a mistake: \u201cI am on it in a flash.\u201d When he suggests a course of action: \u201cI can see DC nodding along with this.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He finds out what it was like to be Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg and hasn\u2019t a clue what to do about it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Michael Gove is the vain, scheming and treacherous villain of the campaign, but then I think we have all gathered by now that it wouldn\u2019t be sensible to trust him with a pencil. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> swithers all over the place before coming out for the Outers, but then we knew that too from his description of himself as \u201cveering around like a shopping trolley\u201d. We learn surprisingly little about Cameron\u2019s true feelings towards&#xa0;the friends turned enemies who eviscerated him. His emotions about Gove and Johnson must surely be more vivid than the tepid observations reported here. So it is with some relief when we occasionally bump into a personality who springs off the page. One is our old friend Peter Mandelson. He steals every scene in which he appears, including the occasion when he chides Oliver for drinking too much coffee on the grounds that it will be bad for his skin. How very Mandelson. The book would have been enlivened by more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/ruth-davidson-never-been-caught-out-tells-you-something-interview-leader-scottish-conservatives\" title=\"\">Ruth Davidson</a>, the leader of the Tories in Scotland. She is briefed that, for one of the TV debates, she may be teamed up with Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle. Davidson responds: \u201cAngela and I are very similar. Are you sure you want two shovel-faced lesbians?\u201d</p> <p>The author never tires of telling us that his team is \u201camazing\u201d, which leaves him with the problem of explaining why he was at the heart of the campaign that lost. For much of the book, it is the fault of everyone except him and the boss. The EU ought to have given more in the negotiation. Tories are untrustworthy. Labour is useless. The other side has more money. The other side constantly lies. The other side\u2019s deceits aren\u2019t being properly challenged by the BBC. The Out newspapers are a nightmare, \u201cbecoming more and more personal, more and more destructive\u201d. Here, he alights on one of the reasons they lost. At election after election, including the most recent one, the Tories could rely on the rightwing press to assassinate the characters of opponents and megaphone Conservative messages. Cameron had clearly not thought enough about having that firepower turned against him. He finds out what it was like to be Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg and hasn\u2019t a clue what to do about it.</p> <p>It is only towards the conclusion that the author brings himself to reflect&#xa0;on&#xa0;the mistakes made by his side and the book is worth reading for that. The In campaign staked everything on the belief that \u201cthe economy would&#xa0;trump immigration\u201d. He realises now that many Britons didn\u2019t think they had much to lose from Brexit and \u201cwe didn\u2019t do enough to understand them\u201d.</p> <p>What he can\u2019t bring himself to admit is that Cameron, the insouciant gambler, was a fool to make the referendum promise when he wasn\u2019t certain that he could get a deal from the EU that he could sell to the voters nor sure that he could bind in the support of key colleagues. He miscalculated again by calling the vote even when it was obvious he had secured neither. Even if we accept the contention that a referendum was \u201cinevitable\u201d at some point, it was Cameron\u2019s choice to hold it at a time when the chances of winning were most dicey. Oliver laments that \u201cwe struggled to communicate a complex truth in the face of simple lies\u201d. They sure did, not&#xa0;least because his boss gave himself&#xa0;just a few weeks to build a case&#xa0;for EU membership after decades in which he and other Tories had trashed it.</p> <p>When Cameron leaves No 10 for the last time, his faithful retainer says to himself: \u201cI hope history will be kind to you.\u201d It won\u2019t.</p> <p><em>Unleashing Demons is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/unleashing-demons.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316.40</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Construction of the polar research ship Sir David Attenborough, which will explore the deepest waters of the Antarctic, is due to start on Monday with the laying of the vessel\u2019s keel in Merseyside.</p> <p>A competition to name the ship caused controversy earlier this year when voters overwhelmingly backed Boaty McBoatface, only for officials to override the outcome of the poll.</p> <p>Boaty McBoatface received 124,109 votes, four times more than second-placed Poppy-Mai, the name of a 16-month-old girl with incurable cancer.<br></p> <p>But the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) announced that the ship\u2019s name would honour the British broadcaster and naturalist in his 90th birthday year, christening it RRS (royal research ship) Sir David Attenborough.</p> <p>Boaty McBoatface will be used instead as the name of a high-tech sub on board the \u00a3200m RRS Sir David Attenborough, the world\u2019s most advanced seaborne laboratory.

Despite this Sikkema said his wife did not seem overly concerned. </p> <p>\u201cI felt she really thought it was just going to be going to the station for a few more questions and she\u2019d be released probably before I got up in the morning,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cShe insisted that I stay at home. I said, \u2018Should I contact your father? Should I contact a lawyer?\u2019 She was like, \u2018No, no, no, that\u2019s not needed. Don\u2019t worry about that.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen I talked to the police and I said, \u2018Pardon me, how do I get hold of you? Can I get a name card or something? \u2026 Or know where you are taking her?\u2019 They were like, \u2018No, if we need to talk to you we will call you. Don\u2019t call us.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadly, jokingly, at the time, I said, \u2018What if you are gone for a week?\u2019 And everyone present just sort of laughed, including my wife. It seems not as funny now as it was when I said it.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cIt was just going to be a little thing. But obviously it is not now.\u201d</p> <p>Sikkema said he had been alarmed to discover through an intermediary with knowledge of the police investigation that his wife might have confessed to escorting Crown customers in China to the company\u2019s casinos in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the easiest confession in the world to debunk. Because she has never been to Australia, She doesn\u2019t have an Australian visa and her passport can prove that,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe fact that they are saying they have a confession from her with her saying that worries me a lot \u2026 I don\u2019t know what they are doing that made her confess that \u2013 an obvious, blatant lie.\u201d </p> <p>Sikkema said he had not been allowed to speak to or visit his wife who is being held at Shanghai\u2019s Number Two Detention Centre. <br></p> <p>But he had written her a letter that he hoped would delivered by a lawyer on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d the letter says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s working to get you out.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Christy Yao </em></p>"
