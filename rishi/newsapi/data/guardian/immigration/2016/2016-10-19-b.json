When asked: \u2018What do you think is the biggest threat to job security in Australia?\u2019 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/progressives-can-attract-hanson-supporters-but-not-by-insulting-them\">an Essential poll last month</a>, 18% of those surveyed said it was the impact of technological change, while 31% said there was more to fear from free-trade deals that allow foreign workers into the labour market.</p> <p>Combined, it means almost half<em> </em>of Australians fear technology or foreigners are a threat to their jobs. This leads to some fundamental questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/fourth-industrial-revolution\">the impact the fourth industrial revolution</a> is going to have on migration and refugees. If jobs now routinely done by migrants (such as cleaning, fast food and other low-skilled, low-paid work) are increasingly automated, does it mean countries take fewer migrants? Does it mean they will only want well-educated migrants?<em> </em>And does this have implications for how refugees are valued by the wider community?<em> </em></p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, says refugees have often filled jobs in rural areas. \u201cMost particularly during the mining boom, young Australian men would much rather go to the mines where they could earn $100,000 a year plus, than go out and work in the agricultural field. So for instance, in meat processing, chicken processing and a lot of the heavy agricultural work in isolated locations, they were desperate for workers,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Curr says Hazaras, who mainly come from central Afghanistan and have a background in agriculture, regularly filled regional jobs, often in very isolated locations, after coming out of immigration detention in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/14/why-teaching-graduates-to-be-flexible-is-more-important-than-worrying-about-jobs-that-dont-yet-exist\">Why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that don't yet exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But those isolated locations have just become a little less isolated.

Not all of this can be controlled by government. If people want to migrate, they figure out ways to migrate. They\u2019ll work through the channels that exist, and if they can\u2019t then they\u2019ll work through illegal channels to migrate.\u201d</p> <p>Jiyoung Song, director of migration and border policy at the Lowy Institute, says economic migrants normally fill gaps in the labour market, rather than replace people. \u201cThere will still be the need of skilled migrants who will work across different national boundaries. The future of work is already having an impact on our lives.\u201d She says advances in technology means national borders are increasingly no barrier to jobs \u2013 for instance, there is no reason a computer coder in India can\u2019t do work for companies in Australia, the US or anywhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/26/with-robots-is-a-life-without-work-one-wed-want-to-live\">With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While well-educated migrants are very much in global demand, people with fewer skills will still also be needed, Song says. \u201cThose with the wanted knowledge and skill sets are likely to have greater mobility than those without. However, countries need both skilled and low-skilled migrants to fill the jobs the locals can\u2019t do or don\u2019t want to do, in other words, either the most cutting-edge jobs or the most unwanted jobs in domestic markets.\u201d</p> <p>She says advances in technology are unlikely to affect how refugees are valued. \u201cRefugees are accepted for humanitarian grounds, not economic demand ... However, in recent years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/18/refugee-crisis-rests-on-obama-summit-un-talks-fail\">and at the UN summit [in September]</a>, legal and complementary pathways were suggested as alternative ways to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that governments are considering the option to offer various other ways to settle temporarily and permanently for refugees and asylum seekers who have skills they want. This is a progressive solution not many governments are buying into at the moment, but it is the only viable way to solve the current refugee crisis,\u201d said Song.</p> <p>Matching refugees\u2019 skills to jobs in their new country benefits both the individual and the host nation.

He soon found that tech companies in the city were so desperate for developers they didn\u2019t care whether employees could speak German. It was their knowledge of ones and zeroes that mattered most.</p> <p>Such innovation is happening locally too, with the Red Cross partnering with tech communities in Sydney and Melbourne for <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.au/red-cross-partners-with-tech-community-for-refugee-hackathon.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cTechfugees hackathons\u201d</a> to find new ways that can help refugee families settle into Australian life. <a href=\"https://techfugees.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Techfugees</a> looks to address some of the issues faced by refugees and asylum seekers by connecting developers, designers, entrepreneurs and startups with non-profit and community organisations.</p> <p>Vicki Mau, manager of migration support programs at Red Cross, says the ideas that have come out of Techfugees, such as an app to help connect migrants with interpreters and another to help link individuals to friends, mentors, services and employment, have been very innovative. \u201cThese are great for Red Cross and invaluable for participants, such as refugees and asylum seekers looking for work and mentors,\u201d she said.</p>",

Some of them made up to $15,000 per year from their handiwork. One of them used the money to take her husband on two cruises per year. Started with the help of some grants, including $10,000 from the Uniting Church, that business foundered for a number of reasons, including the fact that the bag-making was too labour intensive for realistic pricing (at $80 each).</p> <p>It was also before the rise of the online craft marketplace Etsy or Facebook, which would have made selling the bags much easier than having to attract people to a very basic website.</p> <p>\u201cI was pretty cynical and pretty burnt-out for a while from it all,\u201d Jockel says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are making it work better now but it has become more of a trendy thing and you have things like the <a href=\"https://thankyou.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thank You group</a> [aid through sales of consumer goods] and <a href=\"https://au.whogivesacrap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who Gives a Crap</a> [fundraising through toilet paper sales] and all of these other great companies that are really clever and are doing really well.\u201d</p> <p>Even though Biddy Bags closed, it was a launchpad for Jockel to become a social media entrepreneur: cofounding a social media agency, Good Funny Smart.</p> <p>Motherhood, however, puts her at a disadvantage when it comes to taking up opportunities. She now has three children, aged eight, six and two. \u201cI can\u2019t just show up for things,\u201d she says. A video shoot in Sydney means she has to have a whole chain of people and arrangements in place to be able to fly down for the day. </p> <p>Jockel, 33, says she still considers herself a social entrepreneur through her Facebook and blog project <a href=\"http://schoolmum.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Mum</a> (340,000 followers), which provides information and advice. </p> <p>\u201cSchool Mum is a for-profit business but 80% of what we do is unpaid and is part of giveback \u2013 but in a different way.\u201d</p> <p> School Mums has raised more than $10,000 for a health clinic in Cambodia and crowd-funded $45,000 for two families in need.</p>",

In a fortnight, they will go to Germany for tonight\u2019s reverse fixture almost certainly needing a win to nab third place and a Europa League spot. It\u2019s a tough ask \u2013 with Hazard, Raffael and Christensen all likely to be fit again \u2013 especially with Barcelona at home, and Manchester City away to come. </p> <p>Well done to Gladbach. Elvedi looks a real prospect at centre back, just 20 years of age, and the captain Stindl looked a standout player, not just because of his goal. They got their tactics spot on, dominating Celtic in the first half with possession and pressing them into mistakes in the second. The players link arms and face the 3,000 travelling fans, each of them bouncing in celebration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08f3cfe9b59e1ba78c69da48d567b0d7ea18473b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f3cfe9b59e1ba78c69da48d567b0d7ea18473b/0_0_2455_1722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendon Rodgers looks dejected after the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendon Rodgers looks dejected after the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kolo Tour\u00e9:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In that kind of competition, you can\u2019t afford to make those kind of mistakes.

  "<p>The Home Office is understood to be about to urgently speed up its operation to rescue unaccompanied migrant children stranded in Calais, with more than 100 expected to be bussed to Britain in the next four days.</p> <p>With bulldozers expected to arrive on the French site on Monday, the Home Office has come under fire from charities for not moving faster \u2013 while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/rightwing-tabloids-pour-scorn-appearance-child-refugees\">Sun and the Daily Mail made controversial claims</a> that not all of those who are arriving are children. </p> <p>A Home Office minister, Baroness Williams, confirmed that there were an estimated \u201c1,300 children in the camp\u201d and said that 39 of the several hundred estimated to be eligible to come to the UK had been brought into the country this week in the only government update on numbers accepted so far.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate Williams insisted no date had been given by the French authorities for the destruction of the site even though the Foreign Office had an issued an advisory notice to travellers in Calais that they could expect congestion in coming days because of the French demolition. </p> <p>Williams told the House of Lords that 14 children arrived on Monday, 13 on Tuesday and 12 on Wednesday. She said those with approval under the so-called Dublin regulations will be given sanctuary first; these allow migrants under 18 to be reunited with relatives already in another country. </p> <p>\u201cWe will transfer as many as children who qualify under the Dublin regulation before the start of the clearance,\u201d said Williams, adding that about one third of the children qualified to come to the UK. </p> <p>However, one peer, Lord Roberts, said at the present rate of intervention there would be more than 1,000 children marooned when the demolition started. <br></p> <p>He said: \u201cI am sure we all welcome the 14 who were received here two or three days ago. At the moment in Calais there are 1,020, 14 have come here, that leaves 1,006 to accommodate. With the coming winter we can\u2019t surely leave any children open to exploitation, hunger and homelessness when we have the opportunity to fulfil their need.\u201d </p> <p>The claimed change in pace comes at the end of a day of tabloid pressure on the government after the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, among other newspapers, questioned the ages of the 13 children who arrived on Tuesday. The Sun reported on Wednesday morning that the children looked \u201csuspiciously like adults\u201d while several papers said one of the males who got off the bus in Croydon looked as old as 39 or 40, although this suspicion could not be backed up.<br></p> <p>The Home Office said it works closely with the French authorities that do the initial screening to ensure those who are given sanctuary qualify for it. One source with knowledge of the situation said photographs were misleading and they have \u201cnever doubted\u201d any of the migrants\u2019 ages.</p> <p>\u201cAll individuals are referred to the UK authorities by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> Terre d\u2019Asile [charity] and are then interviewed by French and UK officials. Where credible and clear documentary evidence of age is not available, criteria including physical appearance and demeanour are used as part of the interview process to assess age.\u201d</p> <p>Home Office officials say that once refugee children have arrived in Britain they are fingerprinted as part of further identity checks. There is also the option of requesting a further local authority age assessment, which must be case law-compliant and approved by two social workers.</p> <p>A Conservative backbench MP, David Davies, had called for migrants to be subject to dental checks to determine their ages and argued that Britain\u2019s hospitality was being misused. However, the Home Office immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/home-office-rules-out-unethical-dental-checks-for-calais-refugees\">ruled out their use</a>, criticising the technique as \u201cinaccurate, inappropriate and unethical\u201d.</p> <p>The Doctors without Borders charity which has volunteers in Calais branded the the suggestion as despicable and called for the Tory party chairman to consider discipline against Davies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/gary-lineker-hits-back-at-online-abuse-over-hideously-racist-coverage-refugees\">Gary Lineker hits back at online abuse over criticism of Calais refugee coverage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vanessa Cowan, the British Red Cross\u2019s refugee family reunion operations manager, said it was a shame that the comments had been made because the children have been \u201crecognised as having the right to be brought here\u201d. </p> <p>She added: \u201cThese children have gone through a process and they\u2019ve applied as children and the evidence they have provided has been accepted by the Home Office that they are children and they qualify, and as such they have a legal right to be here and there\u2019s nothing else to say about this.\u201d </p> <p>She said the children could go missing if they were not transferred before the camp\u2019s demolition. \u201cThey could disappear and be put in a very vulnerable situation trying to survive outside the community. Anything can happen when you try to survive in an unfriendly environment.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners including Citizens UK, which said it has reunited 60 children from Calais with relatives in Britain since March, claim to have identified hundreds of children in the camp who have a right to come to the UK but are unhappy about the pace of action. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/19/calais-camp-charity-threatens-uk-with-legal-action-over-vulnerable-children\">It is threatening legal action</a> on behalf of 30 children and has criticised the Home Office for being slow and inefficient in its interventions.</p> <p></p> <p>Among those waiting to be reunited with their relatives on Wednesday were 13-year-old Shamsher Sherin, whose story led singer Lily Allen to break down and cry last week on a televised visit to the site. Allen tweeted: \u201cSo happy to see that Sham Sher made it to the UK safely and won\u2019t be risking his life jumping on to moving vehicles.\u201d</p> <p>Another was a 17-year-old who had escaped war-torn Syria.

  "<p>Philip Hammond has sought to allay fears that the economy will be sacrificed in Brexit negotiations, with support for foreign high-skilled workers, the expectation of a favourable deal for the City and a staunch defence of the Bank of England\u2019s independence.</p> <p>The chancellor, burnishing his credentials as an opponent of a hard Brexit, was hopeful a deal was possible that allowed all European nationals to remain in the UK and for UK nationals to remain in the EU.</p> <p>He maintained the government must heed the call from voters to tighten border controls following the vote to quit the EU but restrictions would need to be relaxed to support jobs and growth.</p> <p>\u201cAs we approach the challenge of getting net migration figures down to the tens of thousands it is, in my view, essential that we look at how we do this in a way that protects our economy and protects the vital interests of our economy,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee. </p> <p>Hammond is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/theresa-may-given-stark-warning-about-leaving-customs-union\">understood to be battling inside cabinet</a> for a more emollient negotiating position with Brussels ahead of Theresa May invoking article 50 by March, which begins the two-year process of leaving the EU.</p> <p>Some ministers are known to favour pulling out of all EU agreements and exporting to the trading bloc under standard international rules. This stance, and a speech by the prime minister at the Conservative party conference that appeared to put migration controls before the safety of the economy, have sent the pound plunging almost 18%.</p> <p>May also appeared to question the Bank of England\u2019s low interest policy and its independence from the Treasury, which was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/18/william-hague-attacks-bank-of-england-over-ultra-low-interest-rates\">supported later by the former foreign secretary William Hague</a>, further undermining confidence in the City.</p> <p>Asked by MPs on the Treasury select committee about reports that the cabinet is split, Hammond appeared to take a swipe at his Tory rivals. \u201cThose that are undermining the effort are those that are seeking to close down that negotiating space, seeking to arrive at hard decisions that we don\u2019t need to make at this stage,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping as many options open as possible is the key to the strongest possible negotiating hand.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said negotiations were necessary to win the best deal for each industry. And he said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that London will remain a global financial services centre following Brexit, supported by an immigration system that acknowledges the need for employers to recruit highly skilled workers.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f51a7e44b6a1a44c91d7f0d57ee362de414dff9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51a7e44b6a1a44c91d7f0d57ee362de414dff9a/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May\u2019s apparent commitment to a hard Brexit has spooked many in the City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI cannot conceive of any circumstance in which we would be using those controls to prevent banks, companies moving highly qualified, highly skilled people between different parts of their businesses. That is essential for the smooth operation of our economy.\u201d </p> <p>Hammond was confident that perceptions on the continent of winning business from the City should it lose access to EU markets were likely to \u201cmelt away\u201d as people realised that lost jobs and activities were more likely to go to the US or the far east, or disappear altogether.</p> <p>London is Europe\u2019s financial services centre as well as the UK\u2019s, said the chancellor, adding: \u201cAnything which broke up this deep and broad pool of capital and expertise in London would be hugely detrimental to the real economy across the EU as well as the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts welcomed Hammond\u2019s softer tone. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: \u201cIt gives the markets a glimmer of hope that the UK may not target a hard Brexit.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about May\u2019s comments and the government\u2019s approach to monetary policy, Hammond said nothing had changed: \u201cMonetary policy is independently determined. That will continue to be the case.\u201d </p> <p>Earlier, the chancellor was forced to defend his refusal to publish analysis being drawn up by the Treasury of the pros and cons of various potential Brexit deals. </p> <p>Labour MP Rachel Reeves was backed by committee chair, Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, as she said: \u201cWe can have a public debate but it will be without the facts available to us. </p> <p>\u201cThat will be a very poor debate and I think that is a disappointing decision by the government. Taxpayers pay for the Treasury to do that work, chancellor, and I think the public and parliamentarians deserve to see that work.\u201d </p> <p>But Hammond insisted: \u201cIt would not be sensible \u2013 however irritating I understand that is going to be to some people \u2013 to go into the negotiation with all of our potential negotiating positions, all of the building blocks of a negotiating position spelled out in public with the costs and benefits and consequences displayed for our interlocutors on the other side of the table. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cI can promise you the European Union will not be arriving at the negotiations with all the downsides as well as upsides of different negotiating positions set out for us to see.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cWe cannot have a public debate about what our negotiating position is going to be. If we were to do that, we would have no negotiating position.\u201d</p>",

The Mail used the top half of its front page to promote another double page spread inside on the \u201cchild refugees\u201d debate.</p> <p>The front page of the Sun plastered the picture of one particular refugee to illustrate a call by a backbench Tory MP, David Davies, for dental x-rays to be used to check ages, under a banner headline \u201cTell us the tooth: migrant children look 40\u201d. The tabloid\u2019s top team, including editor Tony Gallagher, are understood to have used an app that used facial recognition technology to guess the ages of the refugees \u2013 and then to raise questions about them. </p> <p>Such coverage prompted an interview with a backbench Tory MP, David Davies, on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, which fed into an online row about how a few pictures were being used to criticise a programme to admit just 100 refugees with relatives in the UK before the Calais camp\u2019s closure.</p> <p>Nobody is expecting the refugees who arrived this week to have to go through dental tests to prove they should remain in the UK, not even Sun executives. So why has the issue become such a live one?</p> <p> \u201cThis completely undermines the case to take them in,\u201d said one tabloid executive, pointing out that none of the unidentified but quite possibly traumatised refugees had written to complain about the coverage to date. Besides, editors had looked at the pictures expecting to see young children and girls, and were taken aback by the young men in hoodies.</p> <p>All this ignored the fact that photographers cannot take pictures of minors without the consent of a guardian. Indeed by Wednesday, when pictures of far younger-looking children were made available by agency photographers, tabloid editors cited press regulation for making their use too difficult. \u201cWe would probably have to pixellate them,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Sun executives in particular, claiming to be cockahoop at having \u201cled the way\u201d on the story, seized on the pictures on Monday as proving the fears they had had all along about the resettlement scheme for unaccompanied children in Calais. \u201cWith those crows feet at 17, he\u2019s obviously been using the wrong moisturiser!\u201d hooted one.</p> <p>However, the story, which was on the print front page two days in a row, was far lower down in the Sun\u2019s online edition.

WikiLeaks has released successive dumps of damaging material over recent months from inside the Democratic party and the Clinton campaign, which the US government has blamed on Russian state hacking.</p> <p>\u201cThe government of Ecuador respects the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cIt does not interfere in external electoral processes, nor does it favour any particular candidate.\u201d</p> <p>The statement, in which Ecuador stressed that it \u201cdoes not yield to pressure from other states\u201d, followed claims by WikiLeaks that John Kerry, the US secretary of state, had requested a private meeting with Ecuador last month \u2013 during a visit to Colombia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/colombia-farc-peace-deal-resounds-homeland-uribe\">show support for a peace deal with leftwing rebels</a> \u2013 specifically to ask the country to block Assange. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b75164caacf5671d307186dc6fc4321764457f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b75164caacf5671d307186dc6fc4321764457f02/0_0_2670_3987/670.jpg\" alt=\"Pamela Anderson visited Julian Assange in the embassy on Saturday.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pamela Anderson visited Julian Assange in the embassy on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben A.

His deputy, Mark Toner, added later that Kerry had not even met with the Ecuador delegation during the talks. \u201cThere just was no meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t discuss any of this stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The confirmation that Ecuador had shut down the internet at least put to rest <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/17/conspiracy-theorists-pamela-anderson-poisoned-julian-assange-with-a-vegan-sandwich.html\">one bizarre rumour</a>, which surfaced after the Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson visited Assange in the embassy on Saturday, telling reporters she had brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret a Manger. </p> <p>Three WikiLeaks tweets after her visit, labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584\">pre-commitments</a>\u201d and containing strings of code, led to a brief, feverish conspiracy theory that Assange could be dead \u2013 with some even pointing to the sandwich as a possible culprit \u2013 before the site explained its connection had been \u201cintentionally severed by a state party\u201d.</p> <p>Neither WikiLeaks nor Ecuador\u2019s foreign ministry responded to requests for comment on Wednesday, and it is unclear whether Assange will have been able to restore his internet access independently. The journalist John Pilger, a close ally and frequent visitor of Assange in the embassy, told the Guardian that Assange \u201cwill have a contingency\u201d, and stressed that WikiLeaks was bigger than its founder. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the restrictions will stop the leaks or deter WikiLeaks and Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cThe significance of the action by Ecuador, which is clearly under pressure, is to show how frightened the US establishment is of further revelations reaching the public about its preferred presidential candidate.\u201d</p> <p>WikiLeaks said it had \u201cactivated the appropriate contingency plans\u201d, and has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks\">continued to tweet links</a> to its stream of damaging email leaks, most recently from the personal email account of the chairman of Clinton\u2019s election campaign, John Podesta. They included transcripts from speeches made to Goldman Sachs bankers in which she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/16/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-wall-street-goldman-sachs-speeches\">avoided any direct criticism of Wall Street</a>, raising questions of an overly cosy relationship with the banking establishment. </p> <p>But for a man who cannot move beyond a handful of rooms in what is, in essence, a modest apartment, even the temporary loss of his connection with the outside world will be a significant blow and troubling development. Ecuador\u2019s move to silence him points starkly to frustrations at some of Assange\u2019s activities while on diplomatic premises.</p> <p>Periodic rumours have emerged of strains between Assange and his Ecuadorean hosts in the more than four years he has lived in the embassy. Confidential embassy documents <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/mr-white-and-mr-blue?utm_term=.drzw9qy5p#.co8Y50zd2\">leaked to Buzzfeed News</a> last year revealed Assange had a late-night scuffle with a security guard in the embassy who said he had found the Australian tampering with security equipment in its secure room (Assange said the guard had accosted him).<br></p> <p>The documents also showed that embassy staff painstakingly monitor Assange\u2019s movements \u2013 referring to him as \u201cMr Guest\u201d \u2013 and contained references both to the stressful situation in which he lives and his \u201cevident anger\u201d and \u201cfeelings of superiority\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/wiileaks-from-liberal-beacon-to-a-prop-for-trump-what-has-happened\">From liberal beacon to a prop for Trump: what has happened to WikiLeaks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about occasional strains to the relationship, Pilger said: \u201cWhen I met Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister and other officials not long ago, they spoke highly of Assange and Ecuador\u2019s commitment to protect him. I have always regarded this small country\u2019s decision to give him asylum and refuge as a rare example of principle and courage.\u201d</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, US election or not, Assange is unlikely to be going anywhere. Sweden is still seeking to extradite him over a rape allegation that he denies, and he says that he could face onward extradition to the US, where WikiLeaks is being investigated over the Cablegate releases in 2010. </p> <p>\u201cEcuador granted political asylum to Julian Assange in 2012 based on his legitimate fears of political persecution,\u201d the country\u2019s statement said, adding that it \u201creaffirms the asylum granted to [him] and reiterates its intention to safeguard his life and physical integrity until he reaches a safe place\u201d.</p>",

The first, which is constantly mentioned, is that the income of many international companies is denominated in dollars \u2013 the dollar rises against the pound, so these companies are shielded from the falling pound. But the London market quotes company value in sterling, therefore their true value has declined.</p> <p>The FTSE 250, which comprises more UK-centric companies, has meanwhile contracted by more than 13%. The total value of companies on the UK stock market has thus significantly fallen.</p> <p>Third factor, interest rates being at rock bottom, investors\u2019 money goes into the stock market (while also transferring from FTSE 250 companies), pushing up company values and the FTSE 100 index. This is purely inflationary, and when interest rates go up this will evaporate.

The traditional view is that, all other things being equal, while the fall will lead to more expensive imports, it will also result in cheaper exports, providing a stimulus for export-led growth. But all other things are not equal. If, as seems inevitable, hard Brexit immigration controls push us out of the single market, tariff and other restrictions will offset some or all gains from supposedly cheaper exports. He doesn\u2019t mention this, possibly because he\u2019s keen to find ways of justifying the fact that he backed the Brexit horse.

The British Dental Association, aghast, did just that, saying the tests he would like were \u201can inaccurate method for assessing age\u201d.</p> <p>But efficacy is not the issue here. Are we a nation that would stoop to treating the vulnerable human beings we would purport to help as livestock, to be collated, corralled and verified by their individual body parts? Are we willing to put those we should be rescuing from peril at further risk with a procedure that would produce no guaranteed benefit? \u201cIt is inappropriate and unethical to take radiographs of people when there is no health benefit for them,\u201d warns the dental association.

Our preoccupation with migrant children reflects the fact that as children they will encounter the least public resistance. That is inevitable. In its way, it is laudable. We saw pictures of thousands of migrants arriving after a perilous, sometimes murderous, journey on the Mediterranean coast. But it was photographs of three-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\" title=\"\">Alan Kurdi</a>, drowned on a Turkish beach, that pricked the public conscience.</p> <p>However, let\u2019s not confuse what we are doing with what we should be doing. A charitable scheme to help isolated children \u2013 hopefully very young, with features, teeth and teddy bears to prove it \u2013 is one thing. A proper effort to fulfil our responsibilities as Europeans, whether or not we are members of the EU, is another.</p> <p>The migrants conveyed from Calais may be young enough to dispel doubts. It may be, as some suggest, that they are youths whose experiences have aged them. But as we examine them for signs of maturity or worldliness, don\u2019t lose sight of why the issue of age verification has become so important.

And if we look at the history of the EU, how many times have people said there is no way through this problem or that problem? And yet the EU has been able to find a way through it.

The economics says it\u2019s in all our interests to seek an agreement to continue to trade freely with each other. We have a strong hand because we import more than we export.

Most experts think the opposite, says Gardiner. In a statement he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Legal advice from the European Commission and confirmed by the House of Commons library suggests that the UK would have to renegotiate all those trade agreements concluded whilst we were members of the EU.</p> <p>If Dr. Fox has the private assurances he has claimed from non-EU trade partners, then these need to be made public and confirmed because the UK must increase its trade to these countries by 37% over the next 15 years just to stand still.</p> <p>A \u201ccross your fingers\u201d approach to what would constitute a 4.5% drop in GDP is simply not good enough.</p> <p>Today\u2019s reports again highlight just how dangerous this split in the government is. Policy decisions cannot be based upon private \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreements\u201d made off the record by foreign politicians who may or may not still be in office when we need to call them in. </p> <p>People need to know their jobs are being protected and businesses need clarity about the basis of future trade.

There are two reasons why this figure does not, in our view, accurately reflect the impact of the Spending Review on health expenditure. The first is that the \u00a310 billion figure is expressed in 2020\u201321 prices, rather than the current (2015\u201316, the time of the Spending Review) prices which would normally be expected to have been used in the calculation of such figures. At 2015\u201316 prices, NHS England\u2019s budget will rise by \u00a39.5 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The second reason is that the \u00a310 billion figure refers to the additional sum allocated to NHS England, not to total health spending. Part of the increase in funding to NHS England is being funded by reductions in areas of health spending which fall outside NHS England\u2019s budget, such as the public health grant to local authorities, and education and training funded through Health Education England. Those reductions amount to \u00a33.5 billion in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. The overall impact is that total health spending\u2014the Department of Health\u2019s budget\u2014will increase in real terms, at 2015\u201316 prices, by \u00a36 billion between 2014\u201315 and 2020\u201321. If the spending review period is considered\u20142015\u201316 to 2020\u201321\u2014that increase is \u00a34.5 billion. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580766b5e4b005f21833b054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:31:39.431Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following her question at PMQs (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/19/pmqs-may-corbyn-hammond-angela-eagle-was-subect-to-homophobic-abuse-after-challenging-corbyn-labour-inquiry-finds-politics-live?page=with:block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b#block-58075ec6e4b005f21833b01b\">1pm)</a> the Labour MP <strong>Lisa Nandy</strong> is now saying Theresa May must come clean about when she knew about the concerns about Dame Lowell Goddard\u2019s leadership of the child sexual abuse inquiry.

Corbyn started with two focused and very reasonable questions on mental health. It was noticeable how May seemed much more comfortable when she could talk about the police (her old portfolio) and the issue of mental health patients being held in cells, although Corbyn\u2019s \u2018this is still not good enough\u2019 argument was effective. When he turned to the NHS, he just kept highlighting the funding crisis. He was not proposing anything specific, and he effectively ruled out any A&amp;E closures (which is not a position many NHS managers would support), allowing May to outflank him by stressing the Tories\u2019 commitment to localism. But Corbyn was able to shoot down this point quite well with a jibe about the NHS Act, which may be four years old but at least is more relevant than something Andy Burnham said before the 2010 general election (increased spending being \u201cirresponsible\u201d), which was one of the lines May relied on.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:25:57.470Z\">at 1.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5807556be4b055209adaf19d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:18:41.567Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says they all want local government and the NHS to work together better. But council funding has been cut. There is bed blocking, because no care is available. The problem is caused by a funding crisis. The government had disguised the extent of the crisis through temporary bailouts. That is a good thing. But why are they in crisis in the first place. Next month sustainability plans will be published. Many are worried because of the threats to A&amp;E departments. Will there be no closures?</p> <p>May says the government will spend \u00a3500bn over the course of this parliament on the NHS. But there is a difference. She says she thinks decisions should be taken locally. The Labour party favours a top-down approach.</p> <p>Corbyn says top-down is what we got from the last government. It cost \u00a33bn. She says the government promised parity of esteem, but has just delivered parity of failure instead. Another winter crisis is looming. The Society of Acute Medicines has it right when it says the NHS is on its knees.</p> <p>May says more patients are being treated, and there are more doctors and nurses. A former health secretary said spending more on the NHS would be irrreponsible. Ed Miliband wanted to weaponise the NHS. Labour say at every election that the Tories will cut spending on the NHS. But the Tories spend more. There is only one party that has cut spending on the NHS, the Labour party in Wales. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58075490e4b0cd26ff71eaa7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:13:45.024Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says no one with a mental health condition should be taken to a police cell. He commends those police commissioners who have stopped this. But NHS trusts are in a crisis. NHS providers says it is the worst crisis in NHS history. In 2010 the NHS was in surplus. What has happened?</p> <p>May says the government asked the NHS to come up with a five-year plan. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, asked for \u00a38bn. The government promised him \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Corbyn says the NHS has gone into the worse crisis in its history. And yesterday Simon Stevens told the select committee he did not think the NHS was getting the money it needed. Will May address the reckless and counterproductive adult social care cuts.</p> <p>May says Stevens said last autumn the case for the NHS had been heard and supported. She says extra money has gone into the better care fund. But it is important that the health service and local authorities work together to provide social care. She wants to see more of that. Labour would not put the money in, she says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58075395e4b005f21833afd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T11:09:59.913Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> also starts by remembering the Aberfan tragedy.

And she thought the Huw Edwards\u2019 documentary was poignant. It showed what happens when those in power do not take responsibility.</p> <p>On mental health, she says the government is investing more. And the number of children\u2019s beds is being increased. </p> <p>Corbyn quotes a letter from Colin. A family member of Colin\u2019s has a chronic mental health condition. He says too often it is left to the police. The Devon and Cornwall chief constable is threatening court action because he is being left having to deal with mental health issues.</p> <p>May praises those in the Commons who have spoken about their own mental health problems.

Interesting of course, in the light of prime minister Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the effects of monetary policy in her Tory party conference speech. Here\u2019s the blurb from the Bank:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the past decade or so, a number of central banks have purchased assets financed by the creation of central bank reserves as a tool for loosening monetary policy \u2013 a policy often known as \u2018quantitative easing\u2019 or \u2018QE\u2019.</p> <p>The first half of the paper reviews the international evidence on the impact on financial markets and economic activity of this policy. It finds that these central bank balance sheet expansions had a discernible and significant impact on financial markets and the economy.</p> <p>The second half of the paper provides new empirical analysis on the macroeconomic impact of central bank balance sheet expansions, across time and countries.</p> <p>It finds three key results. First, it is only when central bank balance sheet expansions are used as a monetary policy tool that they have a significant macro-economic impact. Second, there is evidence for the US that the effectiveness of QE may vary over time, depending on the state of the economy and liquidity of the financial system. And third, QE can have strong spill-over effects cross-border, acting mainly via financial channels. For example, the impact of US QE on UK economic activity may be as large as the impact on US economic activity. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full report can be found here\u201d</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/workingpapers/2016/swp624.aspx\">Staff working paper 624: QE: the story so far</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:39:55.879Z\">at 4.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58078da2e4b0cd26ff71ec3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T15:15:00.643Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The rise in the oil price - to its highest since July 2015 - is giving a lift to the FTSE 100 as trading heads towards the close.

Fears that earnings forecasts were too high have been shown, thus far, to be unproven, with the result that equities have been able to rally once again. This afternoon\u2019s sharp drawdown in crude inventories will be welcomed by oil bulls, with a reduction of 5.2 million barrels confounding market expectations of a second consecutive weekly rise.

The markets seem comfortable, rather than ecstatic, about his comments including confirmation that the Bank of England will remain independent, and that no conclusion has yet been reached on the exact Brexit deal that will be sought by the UK government. He admitted that there are different opinions in the cabinet over how to approach Brexit, however Hammond and May are reportedly close, so his view could suggest that May\u2019s own view is less severe than she put across at her Party conference.</p> <p>Although the pound has fallen back from its intra-daily highs versus the dollar at 1.2332, Hammond\u2019s comments seem to support the pound/dollar around the 1.23 level. We believe that, on balance, his comments that nothing is set in stone regarding Brexit, is more market-friendly than the \u201chard\u201d Brexit rhetoric that has come from Number 10 in recent weeks.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efd30c7ed0ebcbfd8f7b3ca45d22b57edee5e309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd30c7ed0ebcbfd8f7b3ca45d22b57edee5e309/4_1_647_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond at the Treasury Committee\" width=\"500\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond at the Treasury Committee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliament TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Although Hammond is not giving anything away at this stage of his testimony, it gives the markets a glimmer of hope that the UK may not target a \u201chard\u201d brexit. His opening comments did mention that the current government will bring down net migration to the UK, however, he hasn\u2019t linked this to throwing out access to the EU single market or customs union. This is significant, as it is a softer approach from what the market had perceived from PM Theresa May\u2019s comments at the Tory Party conference at the start of this month.<br></p> <p>Hammond said the government will not pursue the policies outlined by former Chancellor George Osborne in April, which included a further cut to corporation tax, however this was to be expected. Regarding the economic impact from Brexit, the Chancellor said that he would examine the fiscal and economic impact of all Brexit options. From a \u201cRemainer\u2019s\u201d perspective, this seems like a more sensible approach to leaving the European Union, compared to some of the extreme approaches that appeared to disregard the economic impact in favour of reducing immigration.</p> <p>Although Hammond is giving nothing away, his comments may sooth some economic concerns regarding the Brexit process. Overall, his comments so far seem to be supportive of the current recovery in the pound and FTSE 100. But whether or not these gains can be sustained, could depend on this evening\u2019s final US Presidential debate. A win for Clinton could sew up the race for her, which could be a short-term positive for the buck, but may limit further sterling gains.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58077889e4b055209adaf280\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:49:28.197Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens mixed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Away from the UK, and US stock markets have struggled for direction in early trading, ahead of the final presidential debate later.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 24 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 opened a couple of points higher.

  "<p>My father, Felix Franks, who has died aged 90, changed the way scientists understood water and introduced new ways of freeze-drying vaccines and of administering insulin.</p> <p>He was born Felix Frankfurther, in Berlin. His father, Paul, was a fine musician but obliged to run the family textile business. His mother, Henriette, died in 1931 and his father later married Nina Lachman, also a keen musician.</p> <p>As the storm clouds of nazism gathered, the young Felix became aware of things changing. His teacher appeared in uniform and ordered the children to give the Heil Hitler salute. After Kristallnacht, Felix and his two sisters, Beate and Eva, were dispatched on a Kindertransport, reaching Southampton in April 1939. Through a remarkable combination of circumstances his parents also reached Britain two days before the second world war broke out. The family lodged together in boarding houses around Hampstead, north London.</p> <p>In 1943, Felix signed up for the army, changing his surname to Franks. He fought in the D-day landings and witnessed the liberation of Belsen. In 1945, waiting to be demobbed, Felix saw a note in the barracks seeking fluent German speakers for \u201cinteresting duties\u201d. He was taken back to the UK, trained in espionage and spent two years working undercover in the Soviet zone of Germany.</p> <p>In 1948 Felix became naturalised and went to study physical chemistry at London University on an ex-serviceman\u2019s grant. In 1950 he married a fellow refugee, Hedy Werner.</p> <p>Upon graduation he worked both in industry and as a lecturer, gaining his PhD at Birkbeck University. His earliest substantive post was at Bradford University, followed by later academic roles in Nottingham and Cambridge. This was interspersed with work for Unilever and a Nasa fellowship in the US at Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>His early research career focused on the physical properties of water; he built up as complete a picture as possible of the properties of the water molecule. His magnum opus was a seven-volume work on the physical chemistry of aqueous solutions \u2013 giving him the nickname \u201cWater Franks\u201d in the scientific community. This is how many came to know him, through the numerous publications he edited, bringing together as much knowledge as possible. He also wrote a book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/books/ice-nine-russian-style.html\" title=\"\">Polywater</a> (1981),about the alleged Soviet discovery of a different form of water with a higher boiling point that had become the focus of cold war tension, but was exposed as a hoax.</p> <p>In later years he became an entrepreneur, developing preservation technologies. His first applied cloud physics to store solutions, unfrozen and uncontaminated, down to -30\u00b0C. His second was developing new freeze-drying techniques for the vaccines, pharmaceuticals and biotech industries. He set up a business in Cambridge with contracts from major pharmaceutical companies. Together with a US biotech company Felix also worked on developing stable insulin that could be inhaled, promising an end to daily injections.</p> <p>He retired in 2000 and moved to be closer to his family in London. Felix was an accomplished pianist and cellist who played in chamber music and orchestral ensembles into his late 80s. He loved to organise outings and reunions, frequently taking the entire family on summer holidays to the South Tyrol, where he had spent happy times as a child.</p> <p>He is survived by Hedy, his daughters, Carolyn and me, and five grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>I was in the Calais refugee camp filming a couple of weeks ago. It is a horrible place to be. Aside from the general conditions, with the demolition looming, there is a sense of desperation hanging over the place. A protest held at the entrance to the camp by some of the refugees was brutally dispersed by police using teargas and rubber bullets.</p> <p>However, there was some sense of hope for one set of people living there \u2013 the unaccompanied children.</p> <p>I spent a lot of time at one or two of the youth clubs there, meeting young people and hearing about their daily lives, their back stories, and their hopes for reaching the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/home-office-rules-out-unethical-dental-checks-for-calais-refugees\">Home Office rules out 'unethical' dental checks for Calais refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Riswan was a shy, softly-spoken teenager from Afghanistan. He told me he was 15, which seemed about right. I met him in a quiet corner of Jungle Books, a makeshift youth centre built and run by volunteers. He gradually told me his story. He said his father was killed by the Taliban, and shortly after that his mother died from a heart attack. He says it was the grief. With no one left in Afghanistan, he and his 14-year-old brother left and spent a troubled year in Pakistan.</p> <p>He has an uncle in Birmingham, who told them to come and he would look after them. Riswan told me that all he wanted was to be able to go to school, study and have a normal life. With that, he left to find his brother. He was worried about him, living in conditions like this, and being responsible for him had led Riswan to grow up fast \u2013 these were his words.</p> <p>I wanted to hear more about Riswan but the next day I went back, nobody knew who he was, and he didn\u2019t come back. The Calais camp is like that. More young refugees arrive all the time, while others disappear. What support there is for them is a fairly chaotic network of volunteer-run services and shacks. The legal centre is a small portable hut with a couple of French volunteers taking notes. The hugely dedicated volunteers who run the youth clubs are constantly worrying, or on the phone trying to track one or other of the young people who have gone missing.</p> <p>The next I saw of Riswan was in a set of photos splashed in a tabloid newspaper, under angry headlines questioning the young people\u2019s age. When I met him, like most of the young people there, he didn\u2019t want to be filmed or photographed. Yet here he was being used to whip up outrage that these young people were being allowed into Britain.</p> <p>It is very difficult to judge a troubled adolescent\u2019s age, but Riswan came across as sincere, young and fragile. He told me his age and story before he knew anything about the legal moves to bring unaccompanied minors to Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/child-refugees-date-stamped-medical-age\">Children     don't come date-stamped \u2013 and that includes refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I sat around in another hut late at night with a group of boys. One of them was practising on a battered old guitar. Another boy said he was 14 and seemed incredibly cheerful, but then his mood began fluctuating wildly. It was clear that what he needed was a child psychologist, not trial by press. Yet one of the boys partially visible in the tabloid\u2019s pictures looks like him.</p> <p>And another boy, Hassan, spoke in my video, with his face hidden and name changed. He had been living in the camp for six months. His older brother lives in Britain, and he did his paperwork to come to the UK legally under the Dublin regulations three months ago. Like many, during this interminable wait he was trying to get through by jumping on the lorries on the motorway. Tragically, his cousin who was in Calais with him died a few weeks earlier, hit by a lorry. \u201cNow I don\u2019t go,\u201d he told me, his voice breaking. Instead he is waiting to be transferred to the UK <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/refugee-children-britain-calais-resettlement-uk\">under the Home Office initiative</a>.</p> <p>While some of the press here are now hunting for pictures of the oldest-looking refugee they can find to try to discredit the whole process, we mustn\u2019t lose sight of some important facts: there are lots of young people at the camp, many have family in the UK, and almost all of the ones I spoke to seemed vulnerable and in need of care. I hope Hassan, Riswan and others succeed in getting that care and are finally made to feel welcome here.</p> <p>\u2022Names have been changed.</p>",

Almost half a million people with diabetes in the UK are in regular contact with the DVLA drivers\u2019 medical group. Its poor communication, lack of consistency and absence of clarity can cost people with diabetes their livelihood.\u201d </p> <p>Nick Lyes, the RAC\u2019s public affairs spokesman, said the DVLA had to balance the interests of people\u2019s freedom to drive with that of road safety: \u201cUse of a vehicle is essential for many people to go about their day-to-day lives and for their professional careers, so any work the DVLA can do to reduce unnecessary delays is welcome. </p> <p>\u201cOver the last year, it is encouraging that the DVLA has recognised this, and has taken appropriate steps. The average processing time has been reduced from 53 to 38 working days, but we\u2019d still like to see this brought down further. There is a balancing act to be had \u2013 it is vitally important that those who need their vehicles and are safe to use them can do so in the quickest time possible, but there is also a duty on authorities to keep our roads and drivers as safe as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The president of the AA, Edmund King, said: \u201cIt is essential that those that are fit to drive are able to do so and equally that those that aren\u2019t fit to drive should not be allowed to put their own lives and the lives of others at risk.\u201d<br></p> <p>The DVLA\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Morley, said: \u201cWe are sorry for the way we handled the customers\u2019 cases highlighted in the report.

All member countries including those who refused to acknowledge LGBTQ communities, have signed an agenda which says: \u201cWe share a vision of cities for all \u2026 without discrimination of any kind \u2026 We further commit to promote culture and respect for diversity, and equality as key elements in the humanisation of our cities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real call for inclusion without LGBTQ rights,\u201d says Javier Jileta, director of Scientika, a Mexico City-based organisation focused on policy design for governments, who is keen to stand up for gay rights at the conference. \u201cThe LGBTQ community is constantly marginalised and Habitat III is no exception. When our rights are not being taken into account this shows how much of the agenda is conservative.\u201d</p> <p>Castro, <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD\">HUD</a> secretary since 2014, has long been an advocate for LGBTQ rights. He continues the work of former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan, who in 2012 promulgated the Equal Access rule that has sought to ensure LGBTQ individuals would not face discrimination in public housing and Section 8 housing. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are still denied housing because of their sexual orientation to this day in the US and elsewhere,\u201d Castro explains at Habitat III in a rare room of quiet away from the crowds. \u201cLGBTQ individuals are often at the greatest risk of homelessness.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-40-percent-of-homeless-youth-are-lgbt-family-rejection-is-leading-cause-a2aaa72c414a#.noezlt1yf\">research showed</a> that 40% of homeless youth in the US were LGBTQ (even though LGBTQ youth only made up 7% of the population) mostly as a result of being evicted from family homes or escaping abuse.

LGBT people can\u2019t have children in Ecuador. We struggle to secure housing because we can\u2019t get married.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cA few days ago I got asked why the LGBT community wants to be included in the New Urban Agenda,\u201d Manzano reflects with a dry laugh. \u201cThe thing you need to remember is: we are normal too.\u201d</p> <p>There are alliances of cities which are working hard towards inclusion. The international <a href=\"https://www.movisie.com/news/international-cities-form-rainbow-cities-network\">Rainbow Cities</a> network shares and promotes LGBTQ policies in cities around the world, believing that municipal and regional authorities have an important and specific task in combatting discrimination.</p> <p>One city trying to join the Rainbow network is S\u00e3o Paulo. Felipe de Paula, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s secretary for human rights and citizenship, agrees the LGBTQ agenda is missing at Habitat III. \u201cLGBTQ rights are part of the human rights agenda,\u201d he says. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Paulo, which has a Right to the City Coordination embedded in local government, has publicly funded centres of LGBTQ citizenship across the city that offer legal, health, social and psychological support. There is also a specific city policy for transgender citizens, working to achieve better inclusivity in education and employment. De Paula insists this is the first policy of this kind in Latin America. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/18/world-quito-ecuador-future-cities-local-voices-habitat-3\">The world is in Quito to discuss cities \u2013 but are local voices heard at Habitat III?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe right to the city for us means a city for everyone, including LGBTQ,\u201d he says. \u201cS\u00e3o Paulo is a city for people and for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/blog/human-rights-campaign-releases-5th-annual-municipal-equality-index\">released its 2016 Municipal Equality Index</a>, scoring American cities on how inclusive their policies and practices are for LGBTQ people, and explained that the report shows that cities across the nation \u201care not waiting for their states to extend vital protections to the LGBTQ community, nor are they intimidated by some state elected officials threatening to deny cities the ability to extend fully-inclusive protections to their residents and workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCities are actually able to get stuff done,\u201d lead author Kate Oakley <a href=\"http://time.com/4531933/cities-most-lgbt-friendly-policies/\">told Time magazine</a>, \u201crather than getting bogged down in partisanship.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the pressure for better LGBTQ inclusion in cities is not just coming from activist groups, but from the government level too.

  "<p>I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life. Many Americans would not see this as a problem \u2013 Americans who think of Canada as \u2018America\u2019s hat\u2019. But when I found myself in a bar with hundreds of Canadian strangers on my first night at university in Montreal (a city where I could legally go to a bar at 18), I realized that this had been a tremendous oversight. </p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister of Canada?\u201d someone asked me, when I confessed my American-ness. I had no idea, and it hit me like a hockey puck smashed into an unguarded net: my ignorance of Canada was an awful oversight. For my whole life all of these Canadians had been living in Canada, not wanting to be American, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/81468/why-do-canadians-drink-milk-bags\">drinking milk from bags.</a> </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why I was particularly moved by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/world/americas/sympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F18%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fsympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">the sympathetic message sent south this week</a> by some lovely northern neighbors: <em>America</em>, they say, <em>you guys are already great</em>. Designed by a Toronto-based creative agency, the video and accompanying social media campaign aims to help Canadians to \u201cmake a positive contribution to an election season that has been downright depressing\u201d.</p> <p>Like an ignored younger sibling reaching out to give a gentle squeeze of the hand to a pompous, bullying older one in a time of sudden vulnerability, it\u2019s a most Canadian acknowledgment of our current predicament. Polite. Sensitive. Cheerful. Gently overlooking the fact that Canada rarely crosses the mind of many Americans unless they\u2019re looking for a way to easily emigrate if national leadership is passed into the hands of a despotic, racist egomaniac by a bonkers electorate.</p> <p>Americans often speak as if \u201cmoving to Canada\u201d to escape the worst of the United States is a decision that can be made casually. We discuss the idea as though we believe that Canada is but a giant, pleasant, snowy backyard that we can wander into when we feel like it. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2016/may/12/donald-trump-president-move-to-canada\">That\u2019s far from the case</a>, and not just because you do have to complete a rigorous visa application process. As I learned that night so many years ago, many Canadians do live up to their national stereotypes of being <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/canada-fears-photo-of-prime-minister-with-pandas-could-worsen-american-refugee-crisis\">friendly cuddlers of panda bears</a>, and people who will apologize with genuine feeling if you step on their foot. But despite 75% of Canadians living 100 miles (or fewer) from our northern border, they\u2019re proud of their distinctly non-American national identity and don\u2019t regard us with particular envy \u2013 ever, not only when we\u2019re in dire circumstances.</p> <p>Is there a note of smugness to the #tellamericaitsgreat campaign? Perhaps just a touch. But I learned from my years in Canada not to hold a grudge. After all, that country, too, is far from perfect \u2013 from Vancouver to St John\u2019s, there\u2019s plenty of tussling between right and left over the same issues that cripple our government, from crime to climate change to healthcare. </p> <p>But the debate is undergirded by a level of stability most Americans can only dream about. There\u2019s a public healthcare system in place. There\u2019s a federal government <a href=\"http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E18C8F2D-1\">commitment</a> to work on climate change. And <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/1354803/fact-checking-michael-moore-does-canada-have-more-guns-per-capita-than-the-us/\">contrary to rumor</a>, Canada has far fewer guns per capita than the US, and far fewer gun-related deaths (one study found that \u2018<a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/\">you\u2019re more likely to be shot to death in the US than to die in a car accident in Canada</a>\u2019). In 2009, the inauguration of President Obama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/feb/17/barack-obama-canada\">made some people speculate</a> that Canadians would no longer be able to look down on their southern neighbors the way they once did. </p> <p>They shouldn\u2019t have worried.

All proceeds from the event go to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jrsusa.org/campaigns_focus?TN=PROMO-20130815114542\">Jesuit Refugee Service\u2019s Global Educational Initiative</a>.</p> <p>Lampedusa, an Italian island in the Mediterranean sea, has been a prime entry point for refugees in Europe since 2000. It has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/22/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-migrants-africa\">a place of considerable peril</a>. Last year, nearly 1,600 migrants died en route there from Libya. </p> <p>While issues so dire gave the show its urgency, the mood of the night often stressed joy through cooperation. The setup helped. Rather than honoring a strict hierarchy of stars, the main artists remained onstage throughout the night, sitting in a semicircle on chairs, taking turns performing songs round-robin style. Along with the stately names at the top of the bill, the show included equal contributions from the gifted young duo <a href=\"http://themilkcartonkids.com/\">the Milk Carton Kids</a>, a cameo for the musical comedy of Will and Grace actress <a href=\"http://www.meganmullally.net/\">Megan Mullally</a>, as well as a special appearance at the end by the grande dame of politicized song, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/31/joan-baez-singer-activist-peacenik-lover-legend-royal-festival-hall\">Joan Baez</a>.</p> <p>Toward the start and finish of the two-and-a-half hour event, songs of displacement, alienation and wandering peppered the set. Miller emphatically delivered Shelter Me, whose narrator draws on faith to guide him to safety. The Milk Carton Kids offered Hope of a Lifetime, whose lyrics chart an equally treacherous journey. Earle contributed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvaEJzoaYZk\">Copperhead Road</a>, featuring characters who try to get by on the underground economy. </p> <p>Deep into the night, the theme grew more pointed. Earle sang City of Immigrants, while the Kids rendered The City of Our Lady, whose chorus declares: \u201cEverywhere we go / We\u2019re the child of where we came.\u201d Baez delivered Woody Guthrie\u2019s classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrRak5-tCr8\">Deportee</a>, about the consequences of objectifying refugees. </p> <p>In the central part of the show, the subject turned to thwarted love. Harris offered Making Believe, a song she first recorded 40 years ago, whose narrator can only imagine romance. Plant went back farther to cover a sad ballad sung by Elvis Presley called Done. Here, as well as in his renditions of Little Maggie and Nothing, the Led Zeppelin yowler drew on his quietest voice, finding in its high, open tones nearly as much power as his classic shouts. In a snarky aside about his old band, Plant said he would not be performing \u201cHobbit songs\u201d. </p> <p>Throughout the night, Harris lent harmonies to other singers on the most tender points of their songs, Miller injected energy through his electric solos, while Kenneth Pattengale of the Milk Carton Kids ran rings around the tunes with his speedy and dexterous acoustic solos. </p> <p>The Kids brought to the night youth, humor and the dynamism of a duo in ideal sync. Their tandem vocals inescapably recall the most delicate interplay of Simon and Garfunkel, while their banter has the dry wit of the <a href=\"http://www.smothersbrothers.com/\">Smothers Brothers</a>. Their songs added prettiness to proceedings which more often emphasized the flinty and raw. Nearly the entire set list drew from America\u2019s greatest musical resources: blues, folk and country music. The result carried a potent subtext: it presented an empathic and inclusive view of America, in contrast to the fearful and exclusive one exploited by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Baez referred to the show as a \u201cpocket of sanity\u201d in the current world.

  "<p>Until recently I would never have considered myself a patriot. Though I do feel an attachment to the comfy familiarity of the country I\u2019ve lived in my whole life, I\u2019ve never really been the Union Jack bunting and jubilee tea party type.

Talk of \u201cBritish values\u201d also makes me somewhat twitchy, because I\u2019m aware that defining positive characteristics as uniquely British traits often means labelling people considered \u201cunBritish\u201d as inferior.</p> <p>I also think we made the wrong decision when we voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">leave the EU</a>. According to rhetoric that has become worryingly normalised in recent months, this alone makes me a \u201ctreacherous snake\u201d and enemy of the nation \u2013 48% of voters have found themselves cast as an insufficiently patriotic fifth column. Any talk of the benefits of EU membership, or the economic risks of leaving, sees them dismissed as \u201cremoaners\u201d who must be \u201csilenced\u201d for the greater good. Presumably, my hazy republicanism and aversion to claims of British exceptionalism are just further evidence that I\u2019m the enemy within.</p> <p>However, the more frenzied these accusations have become, the more I\u2019ve realised that I do actually love my country.

This was going to be the beginning of change. This was the corner we had turned onto a brighter street. This was the first of many moves to a more just and equal nation. </p> <p>And in many ways it was. These past eight years have seen marriage equality, expanded healthcare, a renewed economy, federal divestment from for-profit prisons, the Fair Sentencing Act reducing the disparity between crack and cocaine sentencing, the end of the war in Iraq, the appointment of the first Hispanic supreme court justice and <a href=\"http://pleasecutthecrap.com/obama-accomplishments/\">so much more</a>.</p> <p>But we\u2019ve also seen that equality isn\u2019t free.

  "<p>When Theresa May was home secretary she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">boasted proudly</a> about creating a hostile environment for migrants. As some of the unaccompanied children who have been living in the Calais refugee camp arrive in the UK this week that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3850840/Third-batch-child-migrants-begin-journey-Calais-Jungle-UK-Home-Office-admit-two-thirds-past-children-lied-age-officials.html\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a> has been very much in evidence. Most notably, there have been claims that some of these children are \u201cfaking it\u201d. It\u2019s been strongly suggested that they are really adults posing as children to sneakily take advantage of the UK\u2019s gullibility, kindness and generosity towards outsiders, and should have to undergo dental checks to determine their age. The hostility has also spread to those who dare support these children publicly. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37633342/lily-allens-been-trolled-after-visiting-a-migrant-camp-in-calais\" title=\"\">Lily Allen was heavily trolled</a> when she visited the Calais camp to show her support for those living there in appalling conditions. And now <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gary-lineker-faces-torrent-abuse-9073112\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker has been deluged with abuse on Twitter</a> for expressing similar support for the children arriving from Calais this week.</p> <p>The Home Office is not known for being a soft touch when it comes to asylum seekers and it has stated clearly that any child brought to the UK must have provided clear and credible documentary evidence proving their claimed age.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that those who criticise the youngsters who have arrived so far this week \u2013 poring over their facial features for evidence of deceit regarding their age \u2013 have omitted to mention the scores of children who have been wrongly detained in adult immigration removal centres over the years.</p> <p>For children who have witnessed and sometimes experienced atrocities in their home countries and who leave family behind to embark on hazardous journeys to safety, being locked up with adults in conditions equivalent to a category B prison when they reach the UK really is the last straw. The experience compounds their trauma.</p> <p>The Refugee Council works closely with unaccompanied child asylum seekers and closely monitors these unlawful detentions. <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/5945/Not_a_minor_offence_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Their records show</a> that from the start of October 2014 to the end of December 2015 they received 37 referrals of age-disputed young people who were being treated as adults and detained on the basis of the Home Office policy that their physical appearance and demeanour strongly suggested they were significantly over 18. Of these 37 referrals, the Refugee Council supported 25 of the young people. Of these 25 young people, 13 have been assessed and accepted as a child by a local authority. Seven have been released into the care of the local authority pending assessment, but absconded. Two were assessed to be adult. One was removed from the country before action was concluded. Two are being looked after as children pending the outcome of court proceedings.</p> <p>From the start of January to the end of March this year, the Refugee Council received seven referrals of age disputed young people in detention, and supported six of them. Five of these have already been accepted as children and are in the care of the local authority, while one young person is in the care of the local authority pending the outcome of further assessment.</p> <p>They received 11 such referrals between April and July this year, and of the 10 they supported, two have already been accepted as children, seven are in the care of the local authority being treated as a child pending assessment, and one is still in detention but is due to be released imminently.</p> <p>In 2012 it was reported that the Home Office had to pay out \u00a32m in the case of 40 child asylum seekers who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/council-asylum-seeker-children-classed-adults\" title=\"\">wrongly detained as adults</a> - <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/17/home-office-payout-child-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">compensation of more than \u00a31m</a>, plus \u00a31m costs. Girls and boys \u2013 including 25 who were aged 14 to 16 \u2013 from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Eritrea, Uganda, Somalia and China, were involved in the case.</p> <p>The youngest was a 14-year-old girl from Sri Lanka. Some were survivors of torture in their home countries and some of the girls were survivors of rape and other forms of sexual violence.</p> <p>Among the 40 were some who had already been assessed by social services and declared to be children. They showed officials letters from social services stating that they were looked-after children, but the Home Office still detained them.</p> <p>As a result of this case, government officials accepted that the policy was unlawful and changed it. But the new Refugee Council data shows this abuse is continuing.</p> <p>The current climate of profound hostility towards children who have suffered unspeakable things and committed no crimes is alarming. Let\u2019s hope the Home Office does not respond to this populist backlash against these children by unlawfully locking up more of them.</p> <p>\u2022 To discuss the issues raised by this piece please use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/share-your-views-on-the-governments-response-to-calais-child-refugees\" title=\"\">this form</a></p>",

And also, I just couldn't keep up three jobs.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5807708de4b005f21833b092\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T13:10:11.741Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15414031\">SkeletalDude</a> says:</p> <p><em>Some of George Duke\u2019s 1970s output puts me in mind of you.

I have some rhythms on my computers, that are actually called &quot;trance&quot;, they go from 1-30 or 40. They're grooves that come on the synth. If I could somehow use them, I would.

I would say that I always prided myself on playing whatever was right for the song. And as the songs got a little simpler, I think therefore so did my drumming. When you're young you want to show people what you can do, no matter what the cost. Whereas when you're older, and you realise that maybe a drum machine is better than you playing, then use the drum machine. As a composer I approached the drums differently than a non-composing drummer. I embraced drum machines. Drummers get bored. You tell them to play something simple, and it gets more complicated as they do it. If they're not a composer, if they don't have any kind of investment in the music, they'll just add a bit there and another bit there, and you think no! Don't do that. So you end up using a drum machine. There's no drummer I know that would play the first four or five minutes of In The Air Tonight without putting something in. It's a hypnotic thing a drum machine can create, an atmosphere; then you paint extra colours with live drums.</p> <p>Why did I like simpler songs? Just times change. This is one of the repeated things I hear: even though people will read different kinds of books, they don't read Lord of the Rings when they're 30 even though they did at 15. People don't wear the same kind of clothes. And yet we're supposed to play the same kind of music as we did in the 70s. It's not changing for commercial success, it's changing because that's the way we are as people.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58076bdbe4b0cd26ff71eb4b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:50:54.447Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">American Psycho</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12383943\"><br>Jackman87</a> asks:</p> <p><em>How did you feel about your music being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmTyizVfCng&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpmTyizVfCng&amp;has_verified=1\">referenced heavily in American Psycho</a>?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/oct/17/phil-collins-webchat-not-dead-yet-the-singles#comment-85770468\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16846292\" title=\"View Ph1lCollins\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16846292\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Ph1lCollins\"> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16846292\" title=\"View Ph1lCollins\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Ph1lCollins</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/85770468\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">19 October 2016 1:47pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Flattered!

I don't think him being a psychopath and liking my music is linked - my music was just omnipresent in that era.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:52:02.271Z\">at 1.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58076b7ee4b055209adaf235\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-19T12:49:11.281Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16684562\">Christopher Green</a> asks:</p> <p><em>Are you aware of the various Phil Collins tattoos people have had done?

The UK received a total of 3,695 applications from Eritreans in 2015, approximately one-third of which (1,319) were granted.</p> <p>In the judgment this month, the upper tribunal (immigration and asylum) issued a new country guidance case on Eritrea, which determined that Eritreans of or approaching the draft age of 18, who had evaded national service, deserted, or were likely to be suspected of doing so, faced a \u201creal risk of persecution or serious harm\u201d if sent back. The tribunal rejected the argument, set out in existing Home Office guidance, that Eritreans could return safely by signing a letter of apology and paying a \u201cdiaspora tax\u201d.</p> <p>The country guidance ruling, where the tribunal lays down the approach other judges should take, was welcomed by MPs, human rights groups and immigration lawyers.</p> <p>Stuart McDonald, a member of the home affairs select committee, said he hoped it would force the government to correct its guidance on Eritrean asylum seekers. The delay in doing so was \u201cinexcusable\u201d, he said.</p> <p>McDonald, the Scottish National party\u2019s spokesman on asylum and immigration, said: \u201cThe determination is a welcome one. It\u2019s just very frustrating that it has taken this to force the Home Office to get its house in order.\u201d</p> <p>The Refugee Council\u2019s policy manager, Judith Dennis, said: \u201cThis ruling has confirmed that the government\u2019s treatment of Eritreans who\u2019ve sought refuge here is both dangerous and unjustifiable. It\u2019s vital that the Home Office now focuses on protecting Eritreans who\u2019ve fled here in fear of their lives rather than putting them at further risk.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Yeo, a barrister at Garden Court chambers who specialises in immigration, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a massively wasteful and rather political decision by the Home Office. It is not only wasteful of Home Office funds but tribunal funds and legal aid funds as well as really stressful for applicants.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth Chyrum, director of Human Rights Concern Eritrea, said: \u201cIn short, the tribunal decided that it could not rely on Home Office policy \u2026 and that other evidence, including that provided by the UN commission of inquiry, provided a much more accurate assessment of political conditions in Eritrea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/hundreds-of-eritrea-asylum-applications-still-incorrectly-refused\">Hundreds of Eritreans' asylum applications still 'incorrectly refused'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The upper tribunal case was brought on behalf of three Eritreans and centred around a heavily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/10/britain-refusing-asylum-eritreans-discredited-report\">criticised report by the Danish Immigration Service</a>, which was used to determine asylum applications in Denmark. The Home Office updated its country guidance for Eritrea in March 2015, based on the Danish report, advising that Eritreans are no longer at risk of persecution if they return home after leaving the country without official permission. The guidance is used by UK immigration officials to determine the legitimacy of asylum applications.</p> <p>In its ruling, the tribunal appeared to suggest that not only would a letter of apology not establish a safe return, but that it could expose individuals to potential danger. Such a letter amounted to \u201ca confession of guilt by the person who signs it\u201d, stated the ruling, exposing returnees to what the regime might deem \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d.</p> <p>The tribunal said: \u201cWe do not accept that the evidence goes anywhere close to establishing the payment of tax and the signing of the letter would enable draft evaders and deserters to reconcile with the Eritrean authorities.\u201d</p> <p>The case, brought by three Eritrean asylum seekers, centred on the Danish fact-finding mission on which the report was based, which has been criticised as misleading and inaccurate by the <a href=\"http://www.ft.dk/samling/20141/almdel/uui/bilag/41/1435206.pdf\">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/17/denmark-eritrea-immigration-report-deeply-flawed\">Human Rights Watch</a> and others.</p> <p>The ruling accepted that criticisms of the mission were \u201cwell made\u201d.</p> <p>Tasaddat Hussain, of Broadway House chambers, part of a legal team that represented two of the Eritreans in the case, said: \u201cIt appears that the outcome of the case is in line with what international opinion says: that nothing has changed in Eritrea.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ruling, which was seen by the Guardian, as well as those asked to comment on it, has now been removed from the upper tribunal\u2019s website without explanation.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have noted the court\u2019s ruling and will be updating the country guidance accordingly.<br></p> <p>\u201cAll country information and guidance is based on a careful and objective assessment of available evidence from a range of sources including media outlets, local, national and international organisations, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Home Office removed country guidance on Eritrea from its website. </p>",
  "<p> The use of dental x-rays to determine the age of child refugees has been repeatedly proposed by ministers and then dropped over the past 15 years.</p> <p>Practical as well as ethical considerations show that the idea cannot work; children are not \u201cdate stamped\u201d.</p> <p>Refugees are treated differently if they are under 18, so there has always been a premium on trying to establish beyond doubt the precise age of an asylum seeker; and yet it has proved a \u201cquasi-science\u201d in the same league as measuring skulls to determine ethnicity .</p> <p>Medical opinion is strong on the issue.

When people are much older, say 30 or 40, it can be a lot more accurate. But if you think of puberty and what different rates children develop at, you can see how wrong these tests can be.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most authoritative intervention to halt the use of such checks came in 2008, when Sir Liam Donaldson, then chief medical officer, endorsed medical and dental opposition to the use of dental x-rays to establish the age of asylum seekers. He said it was unethical to subject young people to radiation when no medical benefit was involved.</p> <p>Four years later,his successor, Dame Sally Davies, forced the UK Border Agency to suspend a renewed attempt to use dental x-rays when it became clear that they had not sought ethical permission for the programme.</p> <p>In 2001, the age determination tests were so rudimentary that all that some asylum seekers were asked to do was wave their hands at the Home Office caseworkers sitting behind a glass screen.

Ethnic and cultural information may also be important.

I\u2019m just baffled by it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have yet to face a moderator question on climate change during two debates in which time was found to grill Clinton repeatedly over her use of emails and to ask Trump about a series of late-night tweets he sent about a former Miss Universe\u2019s sex tape. Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, was reportedly set to ask a climate question but ran out of time. </p> \n<p>Wednesday\u2019s final debate is set to retread the same ground, with the debate referee, Chris Wallace of Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=71&amp;cntnt01origid=93&amp;cntnt01detailtemplate=newspage&amp;cntnt01returnid=80\">planning to prod</a> the candidates on immigration, the economy and \u201cfitness to be president\u201d.</p> \n<p>Wallace has also decided to ask about \u201cforeign hot spots\u201d, but it appears unlikely that it will segue into talking about the diabolical heat suffered in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/kuwait-swelters-record-breaking-54c-heatwave-weather-7152911.html\">Kuwait</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/india-records-its-hottest-day-ever-as-temperature-hits-51c-thats-1238f\">India</a> this year. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a sort of collective cowardice,\u201d said Emanuel of the omission.

The Paris climate accord has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/07/paris-agreement-climate-change-carbon-emissions\">ratified by countries</a> around the world while the Obama administration has attempted to implement its Clean Power Plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/clean-power-plan-court-obama-climate-change\">in the teeth of fierce opposition from 27 states</a>. Alaska <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/24/iditarod-climate-change-sled-dogs-winter-alaska\">barely had a winter</a> this year while some American communities are already having to relocate due to rising seas.</p> \n<p>Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them personally, <a href=\"http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-spiral-silence-america/\">according to the Yale Program on Climate Communication</a>, although few people talk about the issue with family or friends. </p> \n<p>Americans are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but there\u2019s a clear political divide about how to approach climate change. <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/10/clinton-trump-supporters-worlds-apart-on-views-of-climate-change-and-its-scientists/\">Polling by the Pew Research Center</a> shows half of Clinton\u2019s supporters care about climate change a great deal, compared with 15% of Trump supporters. </p> \n<p>This division is most starkly demonstrated by the candidates themselves. Clinton has talked about installing half a billion solar panels, halting oil drilling in the Arctic and, in sobering evidence of this election\u2019s debasement, proudly told the Democratic national convention: \u201cI believe in science.\u201d </p> \n<p>While some liberal Democrats are suspicious of Clinton\u2019s climate credentials \u2013 fears were exacerbated by recent leaked emails <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-wikileaks-update-leaked-emails-show-hillary-told-climate-change-activists-get-2432359\">that show</a> she said those who wanted to shut down fossil fuels should \u201cget a life\u201d \u2013 the former secretary of state\u2019s plan cannot be compared meaningfully with Trump\u2019s.</p> \n<p>The Republican nominee has called climate change a Chinese hoax and \u201cbullshit\u201d. He has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, revive the coal industry while also expanding oil and gas drilling. He has darkly hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency and resurrecting the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. </p> \n<p>\u201cI wish there was a proper battle of ideas that we could judge accordingly,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Green groups have supported Clinton almost as a default position because she\u2019s the only major party candidate who accepts climate science. </p> \n<p>While Clinton and Trump differ on issues such as police shootings, immigration and the economy, both candidates at least accept that these things actually exist. It\u2019s tricky to have a debate on a topic that a participant doesn\u2019t think is real. </p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s denial is shared by many members of Congress, who have been lavished with $29.6m in contributions from fossil fuel companies in the 2016 election cycle, according to figures <a href=\"http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/\">compiled by ClimateTruth.org Action</a>. </p> \n<p>Regardless, here are three germane, and pressing, climate change questions that Wallace could ask: <br></p> \n<p><strong>An overwhelming majority of climate scientists say that climate change is real, caused by humans and a growing threat to our way of life.

  "<p>The rights of Irish citizens to emigrate to Britain will need to be enshrined in law if their assumed \u201cspecial status\u201d is to continue, according to legal experts.<br></p> <p>The Irish have more rights than other EU citizens in Britain because of the historical ties between the two countries, such as the right to vote and the right to stand for public office, including Westminster.</p> <p>It has been widely assumed that this comes from the special historical links between the two countries and specifically the 1949 Ireland Act, which officially ended the country\u2019s status as a British dominion.</p> <p>But Bernard Ryan, professor of migration law at Leicester University, said this was a vague statement and if it were challenged might not have much legal value. \u201cThere is some sort of political consensus and the Ireland Act has some sort of legal aspiration, but I would not say it in itself protects the rights of the Irish,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The act was designed to treat the Irish the same as Commonwealth citizens, who in 1949 had the right to emigrate to Britain. </p> <p>Irish and Commonwealth citizens were both subsequently subjected to immigration controls. In the case of Irish citizens, the controls never amounted to anything in practice as they were cancelled out by an exemption that came into force on the same day as the <a href=\"http://legislation.data.gov.uk/uksi/1972/1610/made/data.htm?wrap=true\">the immigration (control of entry through Republic of Ireland) order 1972</a>.</p> <p>This exemption, under common travel area legislation, means that to this day there is no legal requirement to show a passport when crossing the British/Irish borders, although there are rights to deport undesirables.</p> <p>Ryan is one of the few lawyers examining the unique position of Irish citizens in detail. He has been cited in a post-Brexit House of Commons briefing paper on the \u201cspecial status of Irish nationals in UK law\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe minimum needed would be some sort of political statement on immigration and future rights of Irish citizens. But I feel in reality something has to be written into immigration legislation going forward.\u201d</p> <p>The right to vote is probably the least contentious issue as it is provided for in the Representation of the People\u2019s Act 1983 and was reciprocated by Ireland in 1984.<br></p> <p>The chances of EU citizens settled in Britain retaining all their rights to live, work and retire in the UK after Brexit have been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/zero-chance-eu-citizens-keep-same-rights-post-brexit-expert\"> rated at zero by legal experts</a>.<br></p> <p>A leading barrister who specialises in international public law told a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a> panel in September that it was inconceivable that the laws would survive entirely intact.<br></p> <p>Prof Alan Vaughan Lowe QC said this was the price millions of people \u2013 including 1.3 million Britons abroad and 3 million non-Britons living in the UK \u2013 were likely to pay for Brexit.</p> <p>Such was the uncertainty surrounding negotiations and the demands of other EU states, he said, that the British government might have to consider compensation for British citizens abroad if some rights, such as access to Spanish or French healthcare, were lost.<br></p> <p>But Lowe told the Lords\u2019 justice subcommittee that what worried him most was the lack of knowledge about the issue at government level. \u201cThere is very little evidence of people knowing what they are trying to do,\u201d he said.<br></p>",
  "<p>Scientists are investigating the mysterious deaths of at least 10,000 endangered frogs, in a river which leads into South America\u2019s most famous lake on Peru\u2019s border with Bolivia.<br></p> <p>The dead Titicaca water frogs were found along a 50km (30 mile) stretch of the Coata river, a tributary which flows into the 8,372 sq km Lake Titicaca, <a href=\"http://www.serfor.gob.pe/noticias/negocios-sostenibles/serfor-evalua-muerte-de-mas-de-10-mil-ranas-en-rio-coata-en-puno\">according to Peru\u2019s wildlife and forestry service Serfor</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Researchers are trying to find out what killed the amphibians in such numbers. The Titicaca water frog (<em>Telmatobius culeus</em>) is <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/57334/0\">listed as critically endangered</a> by the IUCN red list on threatened species, and is endemic to the lake.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest aquatic frog, weighing up to two pounds, has large folds of skin, which give it a wrinkly appearance \u2013 it is jokingly referred to as the Titicaca scrotum frog. The skin increases its surface area so the amphibian can absorb more oxygen. </p> <p>Roberto Elias, Peru programme manager for US-based Denver Zoo, who has been studying the frog since 2010, said only toxins could have caused such \u201chigh mortality so quickly\u201d. </p> <p>Previous studies had shown high levels of heavy metals in the lake caused by mining tailings from both formal operations and illegal gold mining in surrounding rivers, he said. They include lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, iron and zinc.</p> <p>\u201cVillagers had been cleaning garbage from the river which may have disturbed the sediments,\u201d Elias added, although he stressed post-mortem studies on the frogs had not yet been completed.</p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/12/urban-population-boom-lake-titicaca\">pollution factors are raw sewage</a> due to a lack of sewage treatment plants and pesticides from agriculture surrounding the world\u2019s highest navigable lake, he said.</p> <p>Local anti-pollution campaigner Maruja Inquilla Sucasaca, took 100 dead frogs to the main square in the regional capital Puno, to draw the situation to the attention of the authorities.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took the pollution problem seriously until I showed them the dead frogs,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cLake Titicaca used to be a paradise, now we can\u2019t use the water and our livestock die if they drink it,\u201d said Inquilla, who is vice president of the local committee against the contamination of the Coata river. </p> <p>\u201cUntreated sewage is being pumped into the lake from the big towns and the authorities don\u2019t care,\u201d she said crying with frustration.</p> <p>Last October Inquilla accused the mayor of the Coata district of delaying a plant to treat the river water contaminated by sewage emitted by the region\u2019s most populous city, Juliaca. </p> <p>Pollution is not the only threat to the endangered frog. They are also hunted and eaten in regional dishes or transported to Lima and other cities as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/wildlife-butchers-of-belen-peru-town-that-serves-up-rare-species-for-a-few-dollars\">Peru\u2019s illicit wildlife trade</a> because they are believed to have aphrodisiac properties.</p> <p>The IUCN red list says the frog has declined in numbers by more than 80% over the last three generations, due to over-exploitation, habitat degradation and invasive species. </p> <p>Trout, which is not native to the lake, have been introduced and eat the frog\u2019s eggs and tadpoles, says Elias.</p> <p>\u201cThe threat is much higher and the examples of the species we find are much smaller. If this trend continues they could disappear,\u201d he added. </p>",
  "<p>A border is a question. In fact, a border poses a whole series of implied questions; such as \u201ccan you cross me?\u201d, \u201cwill you cross me?\u201d, \u201cwhat am I doing here in the first place?\u201d and maybe most importantly: \u201cWill <em>you</em> be someone else on the other side?\u201d<br></p> <p>Writers relish questions. They\u2019re what propel narratives, for one thing, but more importantly, I believe good books are themselves sprawling, messy questions, tens of thousands of words long.<br></p> <p>And borders are especially intriguing to writers, I think, because they are the physical representation of liminality \u2013 the threshold between different (literal and metaphorical) states. Since so much writing is about change, it\u2019s endlessly fascinating to look at the indefinable moment when one thing becomes another.

Urban growth rates in recent years have been particularly pronounced in lower and middle-income countries. Africa depicts this global migration trend in high relief. Nairobi is a prime example, with its population pushing upward and its boundaries pushing outward.</p> <p>At the time of the last official government census in 2009, the population of Kenya numbered more than 38 million people, with 3.5 million housed in Nairobi \u2013 more than double the 1986 population. The images above, acquired in 1986 and 2016, show the expansion of Kenya\u2019s capital in the past three decades.</p> <p>While such migration often mirrors economic advancement, it also presents socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Rapid urban growth strains existing infrastructure. Conservationists also note that it discourages the preservation of natural habitat in favor of building more developments. In Nairobi, urbanisation has caused the city to encroach on former green spaces such as the nearby national parks and forests.</p> <p>Population density in Nairobi varies greatly, peaking in the city\u2019s slums, which house roughly 2.5 million people in about 200 settlements. Roughly 60% of Nairobi\u2019s population occupies just 6% of the land. The city\u2019s largest slum, Kibera (the light-coloured patch north of Nairobi national park) is made up of small, tightly packed structures.</p> <p>Although both of the images above were taken at a similar time of the year, the more recent one depicts greener vegetation, the result of a rainy El Ni\u00f1o cycle.</p>",

  "<p>A Conservative MP and sections of the British media have been accused of vilifying refugees by calling for dental tests to verify the ages of child migrants.</p> <p>Images of some of those brought to the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/refugee-children-britain-calais-resettlement-uk\">under a scheme to resettle unaccompanied children</a> from the Calais refugee camp suggest they are over 18. The Sun claimed one of them was \u201c35 if he\u2019s a day\u201d and that it was a \u201cfiasco\u201d for the British authorities to take their ages on trust.</p> <p>David Davies, the chairman of the Commons Welsh affairs select committee, said dental checks or hand x-rays to check bone density should be used to check ages and stop Britain\u2019s hospitality being abused. </p> <p>But such reaction has prompted widespread outrage. The broadcaster and former footballer Gary Lineker tweeted that the reception by some had been \u201chideously racist and utterly heartless\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/788407048031600640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The treatment by some towards these young refugees is hideously racist and utterly heartless.

She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the first refugees to arrive under the scheme had been \u201cvilified in the papers and their age has come into question to make a story\u201d.</p> <p>Davies responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to vilify anyone, and I would like to see genuine children being brought in, but I think we have got a right to raise this question. If we don\u2019t raise this question we allow ourselves to be carried along on a tide of emotion, Lily Allen-style with tears in our eyes. What we are going to end up doing is very quickly exhausting the well of hospitality that exists in Britain. </p> <p>\u201cPeople in Britain want to help children but we don\u2019t want to be take for a free ride either, by people who seem to have got to the front of the queue even though they clearly look in some cases a lot older than 18.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe should use age checks, dental checks, because we do need to make sure the public have confidence in the system.\u201d </p> <p>The BDA pointed out that dental checks were unreliable for assessing age. A spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s not only an inaccurate method for assessing age, but it is both inappropriate and unethical to take radiographs of people when there is no health benefit for them.</p> <p>\u201cX-rays taken for a clinically justified reason must not be used for another purpose without the patient\u2019s informed consent, without coercion and in full knowledge of how the radiograph will be used and by whom.\u201d </p> <p>Davies suggested other tests including a hand x-ray to test bone density. He added: \u201cWe need to be quite hard-nosed here. People are desperate, they will say what they need to say to get in.\u201d</p> <p>Allen said medical tests would be \u201cvery intrusive and could be retraumatising\u201d. She added: \u201cIf there are issues about the age of the people who have come in in this first cohort, then that can be looked at. But the key issue is, how do we bring the hundreds of children who are in the camp who have a right to be here under various conventions and obligations and how do we ensure that there is now a process to get all of those brought in to the UK. We need to ensure that children can come through quickly and have their rights met.\u201d</p> <p>Ukip\u2019s spokesman, Patrick O\u2019Flynn, called for Lineker to be sacked from Match of the Day for expressing political views on the issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oflynnmep/status/788445853010788352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If Mr Lineker wants to be Lib-Left political voice then fair enough, but get him off MOTD please.Time to pass baton to Jermaine Jenas anyway</p>&mdash; Patrick O&#39;Flynn (@oflynnmep) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oflynnmep/status/788445853010788352\">October 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Later he tweeted that images of some of those helped under the scheme showed young men. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/oflynnmep/status/788647363711737856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PC Left may not like it, but no getting away from fact that photos of &quot;child&quot; migrants from Calais appear to show young men.

  "<p>Like many young players across the country, Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez\u2019s dream is to make it as a professional soccer player. \u201cEventually, I see myself playing in Europe,\u201d says the 15-year-old Mexican American from De Pere, Wisconsin, a suburb of Green Bay. \u201cBut I want to start in Mexico, just like Osvaldo.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez is talking about his older brother, a member of Chiapas FC in Liga MX, who moved to Mexico from De Pere after showcasing his talents last year at a tryout event hosted by Alianza de Futbol Hispano, an organization which focuses on the development of Hispanic amateur soccer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/indi-cowie-freestyle-football\">The wonderful football freestyling world of Indi Cowie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNever give up: there will be many people who will tell you they\u2019re crazy, but you must ignore them,\u201d said the 19-year-old Osvaldo, <a href=\"http://www.alianzadefutbol.com/nota.php?id=647&amp;lang=en\">shortly after getting picked up</a> by Chiapas. \u201cYou can achieve your goals, with hard work, discipline and the support of your family. All you need is an opportunity, like I had with Alianza.\u201d</p> <p>Officially founded in 2004, Alianza de Futbol has become the biggest amateur program for Hispanics in the US, and offers what are probably the largest scouting events in the nation. Alianza organizes sponsored tournaments, tryouts and clinics for thousands of young Hispanic soccer players across 12 different cities. In addition, players who wish to follow a collegiate career have a chance to receive academic and financial aid thanks to the non-profit group Alianza U, whose aim is to mentor and guide those who aspire to play soccer in college. Other events include Alianza Femenil, for female players, and the Coca Cola Cup \u2013 a national tournament for girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 teams under the age of 15.</p> <p>Inspired by his brother\u2019s journey, Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez decided to attend one of Alianza\u2019s events this year, hoping to get noticed. He and his family traveled all the way from Wisconsin to Florida, with the hope the hard work would pay off. Rodolfo did so well he was selected to take part in Sue\u00f1o Alianza, a national showcase taking place this week in Miami. This year, more than 9,500 athletes registered to take part, and 54 of the best were chosen to attend the organization\u2019s biggest event, where 30 scouts and coaches from MLS, Liga MX, USL, national youth teams and US colleges get a chance to analyze potential talent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very thankful to his organization,\u201d said Ramirez. \u201cThey have done so much for me, my brother and really, my whole family.

Players come from all over the globe to join in \u2013 and they don\u2019t need to speak or come from a Spanish-speaking family.</p> <p>One thing that makes this the tournament unique is that, by contrast with the well-respected Sue\u00f1o MLS, where only two winners (outfield player and goalkeeper) receive an invitation to join an MLS academy team, Alianza\u2019s tournaments have no limit or exclusivity on who gets chosen. Since its inception, more than 500 players have been invited to try out for a club or an academy, and 50 have signed a professional contract including Mexican Under-20 star Edwin Lara and Dennis Flores, who plays for Le\u00f3n in Liga MX and has represented the United States Under-23 team.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1EU5cTicRI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A1EU5cTicRI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rodolfo Ram\u00edrez and his family are a glowing example of a community who benefit from an organization that not only pays attention to young Latino soccer players who simply can\u2019t afford academy fees, but make them their absolute priority. \u201cPaying for soccer was just never going to happen with us,\u201d says Ramirez. \u201cThe fact that that Alianza is free make it so great.\u201d</p> <p>But money is not the only reason why these players and their families choose these events. Perhaps the biggest factor is Alianza\u2019s active presence in the Hispanic community.</p> <p>These programs go to where these kids are, promoting heavily on social media and forming alliances with networks such as Telemundo to really pay attention to the people they are trying to reach. Their local managers and staff who work in the 12 cities are all Hispanic and are members of the community so they already understand the type of player who is trying out on any given day. This, in essence, is very much a grassroots project with a national outreach whose main goal is to give an opportunity to kids who are mostly ignored by bigger soccer institutions in America. </p>",

But the free-traders peddle their own untruths. They have insisted that black is white, even as the voters beg to differ. In their seminar rooms, their TV studios and their Geneva offices, they have perpetrated the ideological sleight of hand that equates internationalism with free trade, and globalisation with untrammelled corporate power. The result has been misery for workers from Bolton to Baltimore to Bangladesh. But it has also left the six-figure technocrats who supervise our economic system pushing a zombie idea. Because that is what free trade has become: an idea leached of life and meaning but stumbling on for want of any replacement. We have a globalisation for bankers, but not for children fleeing the bombs of Syria.

  "<p>Theresa May has told Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, that the health service will get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/14/no-extra-money-for-nhs-theresa-may-tells-health-chief\">no extra money</a>, despite rapidly escalating problems that have led to warnings from the British Medical Association that hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/15/bma-theresa-may-nhs-crisis-autumn-statement\">close to breaking point</a>. </p> <p>The NHS is now at a more pivotal stage than it has ever been since I became a GP more than 30 years ago. The financial squeeze on health services will get much tighter over the next five years, with spending per person on the NHS <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhealth/139/139.pdf#page=9\">falling by 9%</a> (pdf). </p> <p>In 2014, the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted that even if the NHS budget remained protected from cuts, the growth in population would lead to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ifs-warns-of-unprecedented-squeeze-on-nhs-9109673.html\">big real terms cuts</a>. The myth that the NHS budget is protected is over. Even if health spending continued to rise with inflation, as it has since 2010, age-adjusted spending per person <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/pr/Green_Budget2014.pdf\">would be 9% lower in 2018</a> (pdf) than in 2010. On top of this, Jeremy Hunt wants the NHS to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/18/nhs-short-target-22bn-savings\">save \u00a322</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/18/nhs-short-target-22bn-savings\">bn</a> by 2020.</p> <p>These \u201cefficiency savings\u201d are unfeasible and dangerous and will push an NHS already teetering on the brink right over the cliff edge.<em> </em>If Hunt wants to save money, abolishing wasteful internal/external health markets and renegotiating private finance initiatives would be a good start.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jul/15/what-lies-in-store-jeremy-hunt-nhs-theresa-may-government\">What lies in store for Jeremy Hunt and NHS in Theresa May's government?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NHS has not faced this level of challenge in its history. The universal care it provides is in danger of becoming unsustainable. The dire prospect is that the NHS will have to ration treatment, shut hospital units, close GP surgeries and cut staff if it gets no extra money soon. </p> <p>Already, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/one-five-patients-wait-more-7137624\">one in five patients are waiting a week or more to see their GP</a>, or not getting an appointment at all, and thousands of patients wait hours in A&amp;E and on hospital trolleys.

The prime minister might say it depends on a strong economy, but I would say it depends on your commitment to the NHS. </p> <p>By reappointing Hunt as health secretary, May has signalled that she endorses the imposition of an unsafe junior doctors\u2019 contract, an unaffordable seven-day service, rock bottom staff morale, a decline in general practice and the ideologically driven privatisation of the NHS. </p> <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, May is the architect of the minimum salary for immigrants who have lived in the UK for less than 10 years (the threshold is at least \u00a335,000), if they want to continue to stay. The points-based immigration system she advocates would mean the low-skilled migrant workers who form the backbone of the care sector would be denied entry to Britain. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/oct/11/bad-it-grazed-knees-bureaucracy-nhs-staff-frustrations\">Bad IT, grazed knees and bureaucracy: NHS staff share their frustrations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This would hugely impact on the recruitment of nurses and para-medical staff in the NHS.

Praise poured from the prime minister in her speech to Tory party conference in Birmingham \u2013 bidding to be \u201cthe party of the NHS\u201d. But as she showed no sign of confronting the health service crisis, in practice she is undermining it. </p> <p>The gap between policy rhetoric and reality has never been starker.

That will be left to the regular army, federal police and Sunni tribal militias. </p> <p> The same prohibition on entering Mosul also applies to Shia militias, known as the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) or Hashd al-Shaabi. Their deputy commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, said on Tuesday, however, that his forces would fight to the west of Mosul for the town of Tal Afar.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/anyone-who-flees-is-shot-dead-mosul-locals-trapped-as-isis-digs-in-for-fight\">In interviews with the Guardian</a>, residents of the multi-ethnic city said one of their principal fears if and when Isis was defeated was that Shia forces, responsible for past sectarian atrocities, would carry out reprisal killings against Sunnis. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/jan/08/us-led-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-syria-iraq-interactive-isis\">US-led airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees told the BBC that 900 people had fled Mosul and crossed into Syria \u2013 the first large group of civilians confirmed to have escaped since the military began.

Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull\u2019s messages. But his National MPs have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split.</p> <p><strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s </strong>revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result of internal pressure from the National party and presumably some Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the \u201csplit\u201d story for the PM. Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm (given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do so, we don\u2019t know.</p> <p>So if the import ban is lifted \u2013 as at least some of the Nats would like \u2013 it will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over Turnbull.</p> <p><strong>Enter WA premier Colin Barnett</strong>. He has said this:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it\u2019s obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into this state.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and his issue with the Nats.</p> <p>If the states cannot decide on the category \u2013 as they are required to do under the National Firearms Agreement \u2013 the import ban stays for the time being. This would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision \u2013 that is the condition of the Howard laws. </p> <p>As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he fought the good fight for shooters.

Supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the couriers claim they are \u201cworkers\u201d and not self-employed \u201cindependent contractors\u201d as their companies classify them. The bike couriers work around 50 hours a week for a single firm and earn \u00a32-\u00a33 per item delivered. They say they cannot deliver parcels for other firms or turn down work and are therefore not self-employed. If they win their tribunals, it would make a huge difference, says Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the IWGB. \u201cThey would be entitled to earn the minimum wage, paid holidays, trade union representation and protection against less favourable treatment for part-time workers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/03/gig-economy-zero-hours-contracts-ethics\">The gig economy is here to stay.

And after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/20/foster-carers-fight-working-rights-trade-unions\" title=\"\">foster carers voted to join the IWGB</a> last month over concerns about their lack of employment rights, the union is looking at the viability of a legal test case to challenge their employment status. In all, it now has 1,000 members and 19 elected officials.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is a US citizen. His involvement in trade unions stems from his student days at Soas University of London. While there, as a fluent Spanish speaker, (he also speaks French, Portuguese, Italian and a smattering of Arabic and Chichewa) he helped the university\u2019s cleaners \u2013 mostly from South America, many of whom had come to England on Spanish passports \u2013 improve their English. He then helped Unison\u2019s 2011 campaign to get the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/victory-cleaning-staff-strike-at-university-of-london-wins-major-concessions-on-pay-and-conditions-8972785.html\" title=\"\">outsourced cleaners, security and maintenance staff at the University of London</a> the London living wage.</p> <p>Following that campaign\u2019s success, as a student activist Moyer-Lee helped organise the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/12/03/harry-stopes/not-a-recognised-union/\" title=\"\">3 Cosas campaign</a>. This successfully argued that there were three areas where disparity between university staff and contract workers was greatest and that they should also get the same sick pay, holidays and pension rights as direct employees of the university. The 3 Cosas campaign developed within the university branch of Unison, but in April 2013 many of the workers joined the IWGB.</p> <p>The bicycle couriers\u2019 tribunal cases are the culmination of 18 months\u2019 efforts to improve their working conditions. The outcome will undoubtedly be influenced by the test case brought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/19/uber-drivers-court-tribunal-self-employed-uk-employment-law\" title=\"\">19 drivers for the taxi-ride app Uber</a>, who are also seeking \u201cworker\u201d status.

If we are not careful, tomorrow we will wake up and none of us will have the minimum wage, sick pay or paid holidays. The IWGB has been at the forefront of the struggle for decent working conditions for these low-paid workers and we will continue to fight until everyone has decent working rights.\u201d</p> <p>But Moyer-Lee\u2019s efforts to help the low paid nearly came at the expense of his right to stay in the UK. After completing his PhD, he applied for a graduate entrepreneur visa to enable him to remain in the UK when his student visa expired at the end of 2014. Under the scheme, graduates from oustide the EU with a credible business proposal are sponsored by their university for an application to remain. Soas <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/soas-research-assistant-claims-bias-in-visa-decision/2017390.article\" title=\"\">initially turned Moyer-Lee down</a> and he could have been deported, until the decision was reversed. From a workers\u2019 rights perspective, he believes leaving the EU will be \u201ca total disaster\u201d. European courts tend to be more generous in their interpretation of statutes as they relate to workers\u2019 rights than UK courts, he points out. And without the EU blocking it, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to prevent future Tory governments from shredding rights\u201d, he adds. Furthermore, UK workers won\u2019t benefit from any new protections the EU introduces. And as many of the IWGB\u2019s members have Spanish passports, Brexit&#xa0;will \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affect its members.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee is very committed to helping the lowest paid, but is aware this makes the IWGB reliant on donors and grants to top up its funding. Members pay just \u00a34-\u00a39 a month in subs, nowhere near enough to cover the IWGB\u2019s costs. \u201cThese are mainly low-paid workers who can\u2019t afford to pay more, yet make a disproportionately high demand on our resources,\u201d he says. So the union has launched a <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.co.uk/campaigns/216/the-independent-workers-union-of-great-britain\" title=\"\">crowdfunding drive</a> to help finance its campaigns.</p> <p>Moyer-Lee has no immediate plans to return to the US, particularly given the \u201cdismal\u201d state of politics there. He grew up in Maine in a family of Democrats who have always been involved in politics. \u201cMy state is governed by a reactionary Tea Party governor, and the presidential choice is between bad on the one hand and utterly terrifying and repulsive on the other,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Bernie Sanders in the primary and will be voting [Hillary] Clinton in the general.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt is sometimes tempting to go home and try and do something about the situation rather than despair on the sidelines.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>30.</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married.</p> <p><strong>Lives </strong>south London</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>Greely high school, North Yarmouth, Maine; American University of Paris, BA international economics; School of Oriental and African Studies, Msc, development economics, PhD economics.</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>2016: general secretary, Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain; 2015-present: director, Grassroots Organiser Ltd; 2012-14: campaign organiser, 3 Cosas campaign; 2014: branch secretary, then vice-president, IWGB; 2012: admissions assistant, Soas; 2010-13: ad hoc research assistant for academic Deborah Johnston.</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Dancing, politics.</p>",

Nigel Farage\u2019s career tracked the rise and fall of the Notting Hill brand of liberal Conservatism that was espoused (but not always practised) by Cameron\u2019s ruling clique.</p> <p>It was Cameron who dismissed the Kipper tendency in his own ranks as \u201c<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4875502.stm\">fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists</a>\u201d, who amplified public anxiety about immigration without identifying a solution, who acquiesced to demands for an EU referendum and then botched the campaign. He fed Ukip as much culture-war grievance as it could swallow, then unwittingly cooked up a Brexit pudding so rich that the party struggles to digest its own victory.</p> <p>Ukip is now in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/senior-ukip-figures-back-paul-nuttall-for-leadership-after-steven-woolfe-storm\">Stephen Woolfe</a>, the immigration spokesman who earlier this week resigned from his party. He may be right; he may have spoken prematurely. For a party in total disarray, Ukip\u2019s poll rating is holding up pretty well.</p> <p>But it does feel as if Farage\u2019s reactionary parade and Cameron\u2019s Tory \u201cmodernisation\u201d project were bound in political symbiosis, each defined by the opposing force. The decline of one diminishes the other.</p> <p>In that sense, Ukip\u2019s rolling leadership crisis is the extra-parliamentary twin to the malaise afflicting the rump of pro-European Tories inside the Commons. Cameron-era liberals and Faragist reactionaries are both stumbling around the same strange new landscape, their familiar landmarks cast into darkness by the sudden all-eclipsing rise of Theresa May: a prime minster committed to Brexit but maddeningly inscrutable when it comes to the terms.</p> <p>It cannot be said that the Conservative remainers are entirely vanquished, but they are disoriented and leaderless. So it is not surprising that they are finding a degree of fellowship with refugee MPs of a New Labour disposition who are benighted in a haze of their own. They were not strangers. Some hatchets were buried on the campaign trail in pursuit of a remain vote. But now there is an emerging sympathy in shared alienation, as each side sees its party captured by an agenda hatched on their respective fringes.</p> <p>The Commons tearooms have always hosted cross-party friendships, but they tend to stay hidden behind the wall of tribal antagonism that MPs display to the public. After Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership election victory last year, Tory MPs encountered new candour in Labour counterparts feeling besieged by a radical left movement that targeted them as fifth columnists. Conversations that used to dwell on parliamentary gossip turned into something more like political trauma counselling.</p> <p>Then came the referendum, and the horror that some Tory liberals felt watching Eurosceptic colleagues cast off the robes of moderation and economic prudence to splash around in murky pools of xenophobic populism. The experience of fighting a campaign with most of Fleet Street lined up on the other side also gave pro-EU Conservatives a salutary taste of what it feels like to have reasonable arguments incinerated in flames of hysterical press partisanship (a familiar sensation on the left). A common purpose in rehabilitating evidence-based centrism was born.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a Commons majority for a softer style of Brexit, but any alliance to check the hardliners is in its infancy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is how the government was forced last week to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/theresa-may-accepts-need-for-brexit-debate-in-parliament\">accept a Labour motion demanding that parliament debate the terms of exit from the EU</a>. There was no back-channel plot. Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary, launched a tentative foray and found a platoon of eager Tories at his side. The Conservative whips defused the situation with a face-saving amendment asserting that the referendum mandate must be respected.</p> <p>The Tory rebellion was partly a spontaneous reaction against the mood at the party\u2019s conference the previous week, where \u201chard\u201d Brexiteers had set the tone. It felt, according to one former minister, \u201cas if the party was high on amphetamines\u201d in Birmingham, speeding towards disaster, and needed to come down to earth.</p> <p>That alarm blended with simmering resentment at the way allies of Cameron and George Osborne were culled and their legacy trashed in the first days of May\u2019s reign. Downing Street pulled its punches in the referendum campaign, vetoing personal attacks on Brexit-backing ministers in the hope of facilitating post-combat reconciliation. But the leavers observed no such Geneva conventions. Despite May\u2019s own notional remainer allegiance, the new era started with executions of the deposed king\u2019s officers. That massacre has not been forgotten.</p> <p>There is a Commons majority for a softer style of Brexit, but any alliance to check the hardliners is in its fragile infancy. The referendum result is an irrefutable rebuke to the remainers. They lost the vote. They lost the argument.</p> <p>The fact that Tory and Labour moderates have also lost influence in their parties gives cause for common despair. But there is no obvious mechanism for turning the sympathy they feel for each other into a political renaissance in the country. Throw in all the Lib Dems and you still have a coalition of losers. Nick Clegg and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/10/ed-miliband-mps-parliamentary-vote-brexit-terms-video\">Ed Miliband</a> made impressive, forensically argued speeches in last week\u2019s debate. But they are commentators, not commanders.</p> <p>It is hard to dispel the pall of decline over the once-mighty liberal centre that cratered when Cameron fell. Its despondent champions wear the faded colours of an ancien regime. They may still claim to represent tens of millions of voters, but they don\u2019t know how to organise their people, nor are they clear about what they are organising around. They see terrible social and economic turbulence ahead if Britain crashes chaotically out of Europe. They fear for the future, and with good reason. But it is hard to win a battle over tomorrow still dressed in mourning for yesterday.</p> <p>\u2022 You can catch up on the discussion we had on this article and others on our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/your-opinions-the-perils-of-globalisation-and-the-future-of-the-tory-left\">Your Opinions thread, which </a>is now closed.</p>",

What\u2019s the big deal about lever-action shotguns?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a lot of attention on the Adler lever-action shotgun but the issue is far bigger than that. Gun control groups \u2013 as well as police and law enforcement agencies \u2013 have raised concerns about the categorisation of all lever-action shotguns as \u201ccategory A\u201d. This is the most common type of licence that Australian gun owners can obtain; there are more than 700,000 category A licence holders across the country.<br></p> <p>By way of contrast, pump-action shotguns are listed as \u201ccategory C\u201d firearms. It is more difficult for gun owners to obtain these types of firearms, and there are greater restrictions on their use. Some firearms in this category are entirely restricted outside of specific military purposes.</p> <p>Despite their relatively low categorisation, lever-action shotguns can still fire extremely rapidly, which has been a issue of concern. Here\u2019s one illustration from Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2. In this (over-the-top) footage, Schwarzenegger is firing a Marushin M1887 lever-action shotgun.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3I7DYEmULA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k3I7DYEmULA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The debate about categorisation is being canvassed in the upcoming national firearms review, which is due to be completed this year.</p> <h2><strong>2. What has triggered the row?</strong></h2> <p>The federal government issued an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/28/after-20-years-australias-gun-control-debate-is-igniting-once-again\">import ban on all lever-action shotguns</a> with a firing capacity of more than five rounds. The justice minister, Michael Keenan, announced the temporary ban in 2015. Keenan said it had been introduced because \u201cthe government was concerned that a significant number of high-capacity lever-action shotguns were shortly due to be imported into Australia\u201d. This was in part a reference to the new Adler A-110, a model with a higher capacity magazine.</p> <p>In August 2016 the government decided <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ministerjustice.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/ThirdQuarter/Lever-action-shotguns-import-ban.aspx\">to extend the ban</a>, pending the outcome of the national firearms review later in the year.</p> <h2><strong>3. Why were people unhappy with the ban?</strong></h2> <p>The decision annoyed a lot of people for a lot of different reasons. The gun lobby was furious that all types of lever-actions weapons were subject to an import ban. Gun-friendly politicians such as Lleyonhjelm and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/19/adler-shotgun-new-south-wales-deputy-premier-backs-lifting-ban-on-imports\">some Nationals party members</a> have opposed it.</p> <p>On the other side of the fence, gun control groups see the ban as largely ineffective. This is because the Adler and other lever-action shotguns can be easily extended to increase their magazine capacity. For instance, an Adler with a five-cartridge magazine can be extended to hold 10 cartridges \u201cwith a simply DIY kit\u201d, according to Gun Control Australia\u2019s Samantha Lee. And Adler seven-shot rifles can be modified down to five-shot magazines to meet the import criteria. Various online gun outlets in Australia offer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://shop.iceng.com.au/collections/magazine-extension-kits\">cheap and easy extension kits</a> that would allow a person to legally import a firearm and then extend its magazine\u2019s capacity.</p> <h2><strong>4. Who has the power to restrict gun imports in Australia?</strong></h2> <p>The power rests with the immigration minister, Peter Dutton. To enforce the lever-action shotgun moratorium, he introduced a regulation amending the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L01233\">customs (prohibited imports) regulations 1956</a>. This added to the prohibition list \u201ca lever-action shotgun fitted with a firearm magazine having a capacity of more than five rounds\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/it-took-one-massacre-how-australia-made-gun-control-happen-after-port-arthur\">It took one massacre: how Australia embraced gun control after Port Arthur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But how lever-action shotguns are categorised is a separate issue. National laws that restrict the use of firearms have been made in agreement with the states and territories. The categorisation of weapons can essentially be changed only when all the states and territories agree.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2><strong>5. Does the federal government have the power to weaken gun control laws?</strong></h2> <p>The government could easily lift the import ban on lever-action shotguns. The immigration minister could simply repeal the regulation.</p> <p>This wouldn\u2019t change the broader gun control framework in Australia. To change the categories of weapons, or make changes to laws surrounding the use of or tests for firearms, would require that the changes be made by the states and territories.</p>",

They are feasting on the bloodied remains of a mother and young son, butchered in their own homes. It is, apparently, an open-shut case of murder-suicide: Luke Hadler, driven mad by years of punishing drought, turned a gun on his loved ones first, then on himself.</p> <p>Kiewarra is suffering the worst conditions of a century, a tiny outpost shimmering under \u201cday after day of burning blue sky\u201d. Farmers tell themselves \u201cit\u2019ll break\u201d, repeating the words \u201cout loud to each other like a mantra, and under their breath \u2026 like a prayer\u201d.

When policeman and former Kiewarra resident Aaron Falk returns home for his childhood friend\u2019s funeral he starts to ask questions. Did Luke really kill his wife and son in cold blood? Or is foul play at hand?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781743548059\">Harper\u2019s debut novel</a>, published in May, portrays the outback at its most cruel: a force that gives and takes life, as unforgiving and fierce as the bleak Nordic snowscapes that have become synonymous with great crime and horror writing.</p> <p> In the wake of The Dry\u2019s success (it has already been sold to more than 20 publishers worldwide and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s production company has <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/reese-witherspoon-the-dry-movie-1201618092/\">optioned the film rights</a>) \u2013 it is worth asking the question: how has Australian crime writing carved itself a niche using the landscape as a canvas for fear? </p> <h2>From ice and snow to the desert sun</h2> <p>There is a parallel to be drawn here with Scandinavian noir. Both regions, for example, are among the safest in the world: indeed, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-31329220\">Australian murder rates are at record lows</a>. Yet their relative peace seems to make homicide and butchery \u2013 when committed to the page \u2013 all the more alarming.</p> <p>In Scandinavia the landscape goes a long way towards creating a sense of dread, as does a bloody past and history of dark folklore. \u201cPlace matters more than ever in a globalised world,\u201d noted a 2012 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21561109\">Economist piece titled Those Bloody Scandinavians</a>. \u201cNordic crime writers understand that the more interconnected the world is, the more people crave a sense of place \u2013 the more distinctive and unusual the better.\u201d</p> <p>A number of Australian crime and horror writers have embraced the singularity of the local landscape over the last decade. Garry Disher\u2019s Bitter Wash Road (2013) is set in the bare, brittle \u201chardscrabble country\u201d of South Australia\u2019s wheatbelt. Adrian Hyland\u2019s two crime novels Diamond Dove (2006) and Gunshot Road (2010) take place in rural towns where mangy dogs swarm. As seen by Hyland\u2019s Aboriginal protagonist \u2013 amateur detective Emily Tempest \u2013 the desert in central Australia is alive and animate; to the mining companies, however, it is a resource to be exploited. </p> <p>Charlotte Wood\u2019s feminist horror novel The Natural Way of Things, published last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/charlotte-woods-novel-the-natural-way-of-things-optioned-for-a-film\">also optioned for a film</a>, sees 10 women drugged, abducted and held against their will in the outback. The remoteness of the bush drums home the savagery of their imprisonment, and their very survival depends on their embracement of that same harsh environment. </p> <p>In The Dry, Falk wanders down gloomy country roads. Nocturnal insects rattle \u201clike white noise\u201d. Birds shriek. The community is mired in poverty. And where the river should be carving its way through the fields, there is only \u201can eerie nothingness\u201d a \u201cdusty scar in the land\u201d.</p> <p>Disher, Harper, Hyland and Wood all tap into a long tradition: one in which landscape is both a trigger for psychological change, a marker for pathetic fallacy, and a mirror that draws on deep-seated fears and cultural clashes about what it means to be Australian.<br></p> <h2>Exploration and exploitation</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/25/dont-stop-there-its-a-hellhole-matthew-abbott-captures-the-murderous-majestic-australian-outback\">\u2018Don\u2019t stop there, it\u2019s a hellhole\u2019: Matthew Abbott captures the murderous, majestic Australian outback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early fiction in Australia saw the bush as land to be conquered. Late 19th century bush ballads \u2013 used as a tool to encourage exploration, exploitation and European settlement \u2013 lionised settlers able to tame the wild country. Like the cowboys of America\u2019s wild west, poems such as Banjo Paterson\u2019s The Man from Snowy River romanticised the brave and the brawny.</p> <p>Meanwhile, historical figures, most notably bushranger Ned Kelly, have gained legendary status for carving out a uniquely Australian identity, one enmeshed with the outback. Enduring hardship was celebrated. \u201cI am proud that I am Australian, a daughter of the Southern Cross, a child of the mighty bush,\u201d says Sybylla in (Stella) Miles Franklin\u2019s 1901 novel My Brilliant Career. \u201cA part of the bone and muscle of my nation.\u201d</p> <p>But if Australia views itself as a bush nation, today it is squarely suburban: nearly 90% of the population live in urban areas hugging the coast. That goes some way to explaining why portrayals of the bush have shifted from a terrain to be vanquished and conquered, to an entity that is \u201cother\u201d, far away and frightening.</p> <p>Early writers such as Henry Lawson recognised Australia as ripe for suspense: with the \u201ceverlasting, maddening sameness of the stunted trees\u201d, the suffocating loneliness and the danger of wild beasts all portrayed in his short story The Drover\u2019s Wife, there was no need to resort to the supernatural.</p> <p>True-life tales have bolstered rural Australia\u2019s reputation as a menacing place, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/we-know-who-did-this-how-solving-peter-falconios-changed-a-detectives-life\">disappearance of Peter Falconio in 2001</a>; the murders pinned on former abattoir worker <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/the-remote-australian-highways-where-murderers-have-hunted-their-victims/news-story/817aeb3e7ae69a374cf9c4a645e6a665\">Andy Albury on the \u201chighway of death</a>\u201d; and the fates of the Page family of five who <a href=\"http://www.simpsondesert.fl.net.au/perisha/\">perished from thirst</a> in 1963 on the Birdsville Track, their corpses discovered days later near Deadmans Sandhill.</p> <p>Literature and movies in the latter half of the 20th century revelled in the bush as a setting for horror, playing on gender roles for maximum impact. The 1970s saw the creation of two masterpieces of cinema: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright</a>, directed by Ted Kotcheff and based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Kenneth Cook; and Peter Weir\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/23/picnic-hanging-rock-rewatching-australian-films\">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a>, modelled on the 1967 book by Joan Lindsay. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/14/wake-in-fright-rewatching-australian-films\">Wake in Fright: rewatching classic Australian films</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former played on the isolation, pent-up violence and rampant masculinity of white outback Australia. In the latter, by contrast, schoolgirls vanish on an outing to the bush. It is noted that Hanging Rock has stood there for \u201ca million years\u201d, an ancient part of the landscape that the British could never dominate, no matter how hard they try. The girls\u2019 disappearance shatters a carefully cultivated Victorian veneer, revealing repressed sexuality and simmering madness. The landscape, quite literally, consumes them.</p> <p>Bushfires, too, are fodder to show both a combustible society \u2013 with its raw tensions between Indigenous people and settlers, between \u201crespectable\u201d femaleness and the virile, ready thump of rugged manliness \u2013 and an explosive topography. The Dry uses fire \u2013 which \u201csurged and jumped and gorged itself \u2026 like an animal\u201d \u2013 to nail-biting effect, a weapon far more deadly and devastating than any knife or gun.</p> <p>Above all else, Australian horror and crime excels in showing what can go wrong on long, lonely roads, as portrayed in the 2005 surprise-hit film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/18/wolf-creek-classic-australian-films\">Wolf Creek</a>. In The Dry the most frightening part of the outback is the \u201ccrushing vastness of the open land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe space was the thing that hit them first. There was so much of it. There was enough to drown in,\u201d writes Harper, adding: \u201cTo look out and see not another soul between you and the horizon could be a strange and disturbing sight.\u201d</p>"
