But the problem has affected three different types of bolts from three different manufacturers, suggesting the issue was industry-wide<strong> </strong>or \u201csystemic,\u201d according to US regulators.</p> <p>Tony Burke, Labor shadow minister for environment and water, was environment minister when the marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight was established. He said: \u201cThe more I look at this application, it is fast looking like a project and a process without precedent. It would be extraordinary if there is new and relevant information from the United States, for the Australian government to issue an approval without considering it.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Xenophon, senator for South Australia and leader of NXT, said he and his team would be pushing for this issue to be examined in a Senate inquiry, and called for the assessment processes to be halted until it had time to examine the issue.</p> <p>\u201cThe environmental plan is obviously predicated on certain safeguards being in place. If there are allegations of systemic problems with the bolts then the whole process must be on hold until the any risks form these bolts are assessed,\u201d Xenophon told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem here is even if the risk is minuscule, the consequences are catastrophic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Greens South Australian senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, said: \u201cThe fact that BP won\u2019t rule out the use of these dangerous, substandard bolts is concerning. The entire process has been so secretive and opaque from the beginning that even basic information like this has been impossible to come by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClearly we need to get to the bottom of what exactly is going on here and whether these questionable bolts will be used,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Wilderness Society\u2019s national director, Lyndon Schneiders, said: \u201cIt\u2019s now time the Australian Government acts and stops any new offshore oil drilling activities, including using its powers to suspend BP\u2019s exploration permits in the Great Australian Bight.\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>BP has outsourced its drilling in the Great Australian Bight to Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc, which in the US has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-worries-over-subsea-oil-well-gear-1467970202\">experienced bolt failures</a> and is working to replace many of them.</p> <p>In January Brian Salerno, the director of the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee.gov/files/memos/bsee/api-bolts-ltr-to-gerard-final-jan-2016-1.pdf\">wrote to the American Petroleum Institute</a>, saying: \u201cThe fact that these failures involved equipment from the three primary manufacturers of this equipment suggests that this is a systematic industry problem that requires immediate attention.\u201d</p> <p>The peak body for the oil and gas industry, APPEA, sent the Guardian a statement, suggesting the only action the industry had taken was to respond to Nopsema\u2019s query about the one batch of bolts that were subject to a global recall. \u201cNo operators reported using the batch in question,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Despite the US industry taking considerably more action than is apparent in Australia, the US regulator said even that wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cI am concerned that the industry is not moving quickly enough given the potential for a catastrophic failure,\u201d Salerno said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>While the industry has moved to replace thousands of bolts in the US, Nopsema wasn\u2019t aware of any bolt replacements in Australia.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Nopsema told the Guardian that it had a \u201cnon-prescriptive\u201d regime, where the regulator relied on the operator to produce a \u201csafety case\u201d that ensured that risks were reduced to a level that was \u201cas low as reasonably practicable\u201d.</p> <p>It was understood BP\u2019s contractor, Diamond Offshore, had received approval from Nopsema for its safety case, despite nobody knowing what exactly the causes of the bolt failures were or whether any bolts were free of the faults.</p> <p>Some of the bolt failures have occurred in \u201cblow-out preventers\u201d, the failure of which was responsible for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 the largest oil spill in history, also at a BP well.</p> <p>In July Salerno wrote about the bolt failures, saying: \u201cThat we have not had a major incident so far may be due to luck more than anything else. How long that luck will last is not a question I think any of us is comfortable answering.\u201d</p> <p>But unable to discover the root cause of the failures, the US regulator has convened a massive <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/newsroom/latest-news/statements-and-releases/press-releases/bsee-director-reaches-out-to-federal\">interagency group</a>, involving 17 agency partners, including Nasa, to investigate the matter.</p> <p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/sites/bsee.gov/files/bolts-teamtelecon-readout-23aug2016.pdf\">Salerno said</a> in an interagency meeting about bolt failures: \u201cWe know we have a problem, and suspect it may be a more widespread problem.\u201d</p> <p>Other officials in the agency have warned a bolt failure could lead to a catastrophe on the scale of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon spill, which killed 11 workers and released millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>BP has not released its oil-spill modelling for its operations in the Great Australian Bight, but independent modelling commissioned by the Wilderness Society has shown even a relatively small \u201clow-flow\u201d oil spill from one of BP\u2019s wells in the Bight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/bp-oil-spill-in-great-australian-bight-would-be-catastrophic-modelling-shows\">could impact the entire southern coast of Australia</a>, as well as Tasmania.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/oil-spill-trajectories/index.html\" data-alt=\"Wilderness Society modelling of a potential spill in the Great Barrier Reef\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2015/oct/oil-spill-trajectories/index.html\">Wilderness Society modelling of a potential spill in the Great Barrier Reef</a> </figure>  <p>That would affect a large fishing and tourism industry in the region, as well the globally significant ecosystems.</p> <p>BP has already had its environmental plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/bp-application-drill-oil-in-great-australian-bight-rejected-for-second-time\">rejected twice by Nopsema</a> but the documentshave not been released, so the reasons for rejection are unknown.</p> <p>Nopsema usually only allows environmental plans to be resubmitted twice but BP has split its application into two separate proposals, potentially resetting the counter.</p> <p>Schneiders said the US regulator had made it clear the subsea bolt problem could cause a repeat of BP\u2019s Gulf of Mexico oil disaster and was working with industry to fix the problem but Nopsema had done nothing.<br></p>",

No one doubts she can do tough. Her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/michael-gove-sacked-as-theresa-may-appoints-new-cabinet\">dispatch of Gove</a>, after a long period of tension in cabinet and the fiasco of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/michael-gove-to-stand-for-conservative-party-leadership\">attack on his ally Boris Johnson</a>, was a brutal reckoning, accompanied by a lesson on loyalty.

Practically she had no choice but to embrace hardline Brexiteers, given that both she and Hammond were EU remainers. She has also insisted on personally chairing the main EU Brexit committee, ensuring no policy is developed without her knowledge. A civil servant who knows her well says that when it comes to party and Whitehall organisation, \u201cno one knows better where the stop and start levers are than May\u201d.</p> <p>Distractions matter, though. Too great an indulgence of them will feed the story that Brexit is a chaotic mess or bottle up the kind of resentments on the right that undermined John Major. True, May is a more self-confident, less nervy prime minister than him. Her secret weapon is that she has a good deal of control over the coming timeline. Hence her instant resistance to triggering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a>, and insistence that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-election-pm-owen-smith-corbyn\">she does not intend to hold an early election</a>.

Outside a clique of modernisers, most Conservatives have hankered for the return of grammar schools as vital lost territory, and May is closer to their instincts \u2013 by experience and belief \u2013 than her predecessors.</p> <p>Her embrace of grammars also signals something many Tories believe but were dissuaded by Cameron-Osborne from articulating. No amount of graphs about overall outcomes, they feel, can stop a lot of parents \u2013 including those who consider themselves progressives or even on the left \u2013 wanting to send children to selective schools. Therefore, according to the May worldview, people want something the government has been stopping them from having \u2013 and that is wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People do not live in the world of big data about overall outcomes, they look to their families and immediate experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here is Mayism in a nutshell. People do not live in the world of big data about overall outcomes, they look to their families and immediate experience \u2013 just as the argument that immigration benefits Britain overall was outdone by the experience of many voters.</p> <p>With the exception of the writings of her policy guru, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/may-appoints-former-advisers-as-joint-chiefs-of-staff\">Nick Timothy</a>, Mayism has had little definition up to now, beyond a securocratic tendency, frustration at supra-national legal meddling, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/21/theresa-may-ripped-up-tory-pact-police-thatcher\">readiness to take on the reform-reluctance of the police</a>. Now that narrow offering must become broader, without much road-testing beyond the commitment of a loyal but quite narrow inner team. This entails freedom, but at the risk of over-complication.</p> <p>May seeks to offset the argument that grammars entrench social division with a push for selective schools to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/11/theresa-may-persists-with-survival-of-fittest-grammar-schools\">take many more students from poorer backgrounds</a> and expand in areas of deprivation. Far from foolish in itself, but aligning the objectives so they work together will, in the face of political opposition, tie the plan up in knots for years.</p> <p>Both the Conservative party at large and voters who, due to Labour\u2019s self-destruction, now expect continued Tory government will want to know that May is dependably in charge. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/jul/14/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-cabinet-reshuffle-amber-rudd\">Amber Rudd</a>, the home secretary who is fast becoming a mini-May \u2013 the silky explainer of what the prime minister really wants \u2013 made clear on the Andrew Marr Show today that the balance of immigration concern and openness to Europe (and beyond) matters (a slap to those who want to give up single market membership without fighting for a trade-off).</p> <p>Rudd, you may recall, enlivened the referendum campaign with the <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/watch-home-secretary-amber-rudd-says-boris-isnt-man-want-driving-home/\">insight that Boris</a> is \u201cnot the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening\u201d.

However, many are, and in the last few years there have been five court findings of \u201cinhuman and degrading\u201d treatment of detainees.</p> <p>In response to mounting criticism, the government commissioned Steven Shaw to carry out a review of the welfare of vulnerable detainees. This found that protections for vulnerable people were inadequate and made 69 recommendations that were broadly accepted by the government. Ministers promised \u201csignificant and transformative\u201d change, but have now proposed a new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adults-at-risk-in-immigration-detention\" title=\"\">\u201cadults at risk\u201d policy</a>, which comes into effect on 12 September.</p> <p>Leading organisations have voiced concerns that the new policy may lead to a worsening of protection for vulnerable people in detention. The policy limits the definition of torture, meaning that those tortured at the hands of Isis, Boko Haram and others may no longer be included. The policy increases the burden of evidence on vulnerable people and balances vulnerability against a wider range of other factors. We fear this will lead to more vulnerable people being detained for longer.</p> <p>The guidance was laid before parliament the day before summer recess and will come into effect one week after recess, meaning there has been no opportunity for meaningful debate. Considering the potential for significant harm to vulnerable detainees, we call for an urgent review before this policy is&#xa0;implemented.<br><strong>Theresa Schleicher </strong><em>Acting director, Medical Justice</em><br><strong>Adrian Berry </strong><em>Chair, Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association</em><br><strong>TJ Birdi </strong><em>Executive director, Helen Bamber Foundation</em><br><strong>Paul Dillane </strong><em>Executive director, UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group</em><br><strong>Ali McGinley </strong><em>Director, Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees</em><br><strong>Saira Grant </strong><em>Chief executive, Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</em><br><strong>John Hopgood </strong><em>Policy and research manager, Bail for Immigration Detainees</em><br><strong>Wayne Myslik </strong><em>Chief executive, Migrants Resource Centre</em><br><strong>Bella Sankey </strong><em>Policy director, Liberty</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Just two of them so far this season, both from horse wrangling\u2019s Leroy Fer. 42 last season, which wasn\u2019t the worst in the Premier League, but it wasn\u2019t the best either, to say the least. Especially when the scorers of 23 of those goals have departed this summer. So plenty of pressure on Borja Baston, new arrival from Spain who might well make his debut today, particularly since the early signs from Fernando Llorente haven\u2019t been peachy.</p> <p><strong>But wait!</strong> Here\u2019s a helping hand for the shot-shy Swans. Could it be that David Luiz is their big hope, a man whose job description differs rather from his actual job. Luiz is a defender who doesn\u2019t seemingly like to defend very much, but who provides entertainment in other ways, because we\u2019ve all got to stay occupied in this world. </p> <p><strong>Antonio Conte has admitted that Luiz perhaps wasn\u2019t his first choice to strengthen his backline,</strong> a man used to having only the finest and most intimidating centre-backs at his disposal. But this could be quite a compelling sub-plot of the season: how will Conte cope with Luiz, and how will he get his potentially very talented defender to, well, defend reliably?

  "<p>Royal Dutch Shell has started production at the world\u2019s deepest underwater oil and gas field, 1.8 miles beneath the sea surface in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>The first oil pumped from the Stones field, 200 miles south of New Orleans, comes after billions of dollars of investment from Shell over the last three years. </p> <p>The achievement will anger many climate change campaigners, but will boost annual pay for Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, under the group\u2019s controversial performance bonus arrangements.</p> <p>The field is in much deeper water than the Macondo prospect, where six years ago BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, killing 11 workers and causing environmental disaster.</p> <p>The latest costly addition to Shell\u2019s production capacity comes despite Van Beurden\u2019s repeated pledges on climate change. In May, he said: \u201cWe know our long-term success \u2026 depends on our ability to anticipate the types of energy that people will need in the future in a way that is both commercially competitive and environmentally sound.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with low oil prices and increased pressure from climate change activists, Shell has retreated from some of its most expensive production projects. In the autumn last year, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/shell-ceases-alaska-arctic-drilling-exploratory-well-oil-gas-disappoints\">ditched drilling operations in the Alaskan Artic </a>and abandoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/shell-halts-carmon-creek-oil-sands-project-in-alberta-canada\">a tar sands project in Alberta, Canada</a>.</p> <p>But the group has told shareholders it will continue spending heavily on pioneering deep water projects, which will provide a major source of future growth. Announcing production had begun at Stones, <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2016/shell-starts-production-at-stones-in-the-gulf-of-mexico.html\">Shell said</a>: \u201cOur growing expertise in using such technologies in innovative ways will help us unlock more deep water resources around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Shell has forecast that its deep water production will increase to the equivalent of more than 900,000 barrels of oil a day by the early 2020s from already discovered, established reservoirs. Major projects the group is working on include Coulomb Phase 2 and Appomattox in the Gulf of Mexico and Malikai off the coast of Malaysia.</p> <p>Shell began the costly Stones project in 2013, two years after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/09/fossil-fuel-infrastructure-climate-change\">two-thirds of proven fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground</a> to prevent the earth from warming 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a proposed temperature limit beyond which scientists warn of spiralling and irreversible climate change.</p> <p>At Stones, oil and gas is pumped from several points on the sea bed through flexible riser pipes to a specialised tanker, incorporating a detachable 3,150-tonne buoy. In the event of a hurricane, Shell says the tanker can halt production and sail away safely from the buoy and riser pipes.</p> <p>Stones will produce the equivalent of about 50,000 barrels of oil a day when ramped up to full capacity at the end of 2017.</p> <p>Van Beurden\u2019s annual bonus depends, in part, on delivering major new projects on time and on budget. For 2015, he received a bonus of \u20ac3.5m, which formed part of an overall pay and pension package worth \u20ac5.58m.<br></p> <p>Van Beurden has repeatedly insisted he is determined that Shell should play a part in helping the world take action to end global warming.</p> <p>At Shell\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last year, the board promised a group of activist shareholders, including the Church of England, to better explain how bonus schemes for Van Beurden and others were aligned with its professed ambitions to help tackle climate change. At this year\u2019s meeting, however, activist investors<a href=\"https://www.rathbonegreenbank.com/insight/royal-dutch-shell-special-resolution-one-year\"> said</a> \u201cclarification is urgently required\u201d on this point.</p> <p>Shell has stressed that <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting-and-performance-data/performance-data/greenhouse-gas-emissions/_jcr_content/par/tabbedcontent/tab/textimage.stream/1443609730440/d302cf0d4008fbfa4bbe31e515ebd3f3b8280027bff49a65ef985ee3e4653aa3/response-to-shareholder-resolution-on-climate-change.pdf\">10% of Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is tied to the group\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d performance</a>. However, these incentives target how much energy the group uses, the volume of oil spilt and water usage. They do not focus on what campaigners see as the core concern: how Shell plans to manage its way to a low-carbon global economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 20% of the Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is still tied to delivering major new production projects, such as Stones. A further 30% is linked to the group\u2019s ability to generate cash, while 12% of the bonus depends on production volumes.</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers representing a Libyan husband and wife who were kidnapped and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s prisons are seeking to overturn a decision that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute a former MI6 officer for his alleged role.</p> <p>Mark Allen, the head of counter-terrorism at the agency at the time of the so-called rendition operations, had set out his role in a letter to the Gaddafi government that came to light during the 2011 Libyan revolution. </p> <p>However the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mi6-officers-not-charges-rendition-of-libyan-families-abdel-hakim-belhaj\">Crown Prosecution Service decided earlier this year that Allen \u2013 now Sir Mark \u2013 should face no criminal charges</a>, a ruling that the victims said reflected poorly on British justice.</p> <p>Lawyers for the couple are now seeking a judicial review of the CPS decision, which they have denounced as a \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d ruling that has put the government and its intelligence agencies above the rule of law.</p> <p>Cori Crider of the legal charity Reprieve said: \u201cIt\u2019s sad that the CPS will aggressively prosecute journalists for \u2018misconduct in public office\u2019, but a top MI6 officer who helped render kids and a pregnant woman to Gaddafi walks free. It\u2019s sadder still that prosecutors felt victim families should have no role in the \u2018victims\u2019 review.\u2019 The family\u2019s view is clear. Justice was denied. The decision leaves the UK\u2019s security services basically exempt from British law. That\u2019s why they are fighting it.\u201d</p> <p>Abdel Hakim Belhaj, an opponent of Gaddafi, and his wife Fatima Bouchar, were abducted in Thailand in March 2004 while en route from Malaysia to the UK, where they had planned to apply for political asylum. </p> <p>They were held briefly at an American detention facility in Bangkok, and allegedly tortured, before being bound and gagged and flown to Tripoli. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya\">Bouchar, who was pregnant, says she was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight</a>.</p> <p>Evidence of MI6 involvement emerged in correspondence between Allen and Gaddafi\u2019s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, that was discovered during the Libyan revolution.</p> <p>Other documents included a fax from the CIA to Tripoli, which gave details of a second UK-Libyan rendition operation, in which another opponent of Gaddafi, Sami al-Saadi, was kidnapped in Hong Kong and flown to Tripoli along with his wife and four children.</p> <p> Scotland Yard spent four years investigating the kidnappings and sent a 28,000-page file to the CPS. Police are understood to believe that they had built a particularly formidable case against MI6 in the Saadi case.</p> <p>Detectives are said to have been dismayed that the CPS concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against Allen or anyone else. In making public their decision, the CPS disclosed that Allen had \u201csought political authority for some of his actions\u201d. </p> <p>In a letter to the CPS, Belhaj\u2019s lawyers at the London firm Leigh Day claim that the decision is unreasonable. They say: \u201cIt appears the CPS has erroneously proceeded on the basis that political approval would be a reasonable excuse for the conduct under investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the legal charity Reprieve has complained to the information commissioner over the government\u2019s refusal to disclose whether ministers or Downing Street officials were in any way involved in the decision to not bring charges. </p> <p>There was no comment from the CPS or Allen, who was not directly named in the CPS statement.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cAn ordinary day ended as the biggest manmade ecological disaster in history,\u201d says one of the taglines. </p> <p>Trailers for the new disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, based on the April 2010 disaster, which will be released later this month, quickly shift from sickly sweet family scenes of Mark Wahlberg bidding farewell to his wife and daughter as he goes off to work on a huge oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to a desperate fight for survival, as panicked workers scramble to escape the burning oil rig.</p> <p>The Hollywood marketeers are right with their tagline. It was a global disaster with far-reaching human and environmental consequences. Eleven people were killed and about 4.9m barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">worst spill in US history</a>.</p> <p>The story of Deepwater Horizon is also \u201ctragedy on an epic scale\u201d for BP, which operated the rig, according to the US corporate governance expert Lynn Stout. The oil company was later found to have been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/bp-reckless-conduct-oil-spill-judge-rules\">grossly negligent in its handling </a>of the well and has faced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/bp-fined-further-25bn-over-deeepwater-horizon-spill\">billions of dollars in penalties</a>.</p> <p>Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School, chose the story of how profit-driven decisions at BP led to disaster to open her 2012 book The Shareholder Value Myth.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In her view, there are wider lessons to learn from BP\u2019s tale about how costcutting and skimping on safety procedures to secure short-term shareholder gains ended up costing investors in the long run. </p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon disaster is one example of a problem that afflicts many companies, she says. That problem is the idea that the company belongs to its shareholders and exists for one purpose only: to maximise wealth for those shareholders.</p> <p>Six years on from the deadly blowout, you do not have to look far for more examples of companies misbehaving and cutting corners, which subsequently hurts shareholders. </p> <p>Last week, Sports Direct <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/sports-directs-biggest-investors-want-independent-review-mike-ashley-keith-hellawell\">faced anger from shareholders</a> after the company accepted that it had not treated employees properly. The admission followed months of pressure on the retailer\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, and Sports Direct after the Guardian highlighted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear </a>at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. As the revelations about the company began to batter its reputation, the share price fell and previously quiet stockholders emerged to voice their disquiet.</p> <p>Everyone loses here. The workers, the shareholders and business at large.<br></p> <p>Many companies, particularly smaller ones, will tell you they exist for their employees and customers, as much as for shareholder gains. Yet those who want to serve a wider base of stakeholders may find themselves hamstrung by a legal system that appears to put shareholder interests centre stage. For all their willingness to do good, is it not the primary duty of company directors to create value for shareholders?</p> <p>There does not appear to be a straightforward answer. Lawyers will disagree over how company directors should interpret the 2006 Companies Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/pdfs/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">states in section 172</a> (pdf) that \u201ca director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members\u201d. But for Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, there is no question that this statement makes shareholder primacy explicit. As he put it in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/833.aspx\">speech exploring company ownership</a> last year: \u201cFor the first time in history, shareholder primacy had been hardwired into companies\u2019 statutory purposes.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of shareholder primacy is seen in the way that a company\u2019s share price performance has increasingly become the key measure of success.</p> <p>As in Stout\u2019s Deepwater Horizon example, the pitfalls of this are obvious. When chief executives manage the share price rather than the company itself, short-termism can quickly take over. Investment suffers as shareholders hungry for dividends demand ever increasing payouts, while risk taking rises, as demonstrated to disastrous global effect by the financial crisis.</p> <p>When the shareholder is king, a company\u2019s long-term success and impact on those around it take a back seat.</p> <p>But campaigners for a different kind of capitalism say it does not have to be this way. A growing movement is putting forward a new model, where directors answer to a range of stakeholders, such as employees and the environment, not just investors. Those pushing for change may dare to hope their calls will be answered now that Theresa May is vowing tackle corporate irresponsibility and \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone not just the privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>The good news for the prime minister is that a simple amendment to company law could make a big difference. </p> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://bcorporation.uk/meet-b-lab-uk\">B Lab UK</a> is urging the government to pass \u201cbenefit company\u201d legislation. The reform would give companies the option to reject shareholder primacy and be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, according to the charity, which represents a growing number of so-called B Corps, or benefit corporations. This model has three mandatory elements: a broadened purpose, director accountability and stakeholder transparency.</p> <p>The movement behind benefit corporations <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/our-history\">started a decade ago</a> in the US to pioneer the idea that companies are \u201cbest for the world\u201d, rather than best in the world. The movement has spread to include 1,800 B Corps in 50 countries.</p> <p>In some places, laws have been changed for companies to turn themselves into B Corps, but in others, no such change has been deemed necessary. Some corporate governance experts argue that the UK is one such case and the law already allows for a wide range of stakeholders to be considered by company chiefs. At the moment, when a UK company becomes a B Corp, it changes its constitution.</p> <p>However, B Lab UK says a small amendment to the law would clear things up. As the charity\u2019s co-founder James Perry says, for directors worried about where their legal duties lie, a law \u201cgives you a fighting chance, or a platform\u201d to act in the interests of society and the environment.</p> <p>Perry, who helped set up the frozen ready meals retailer Cook, insists that the change would still leave companies with the option to continue putting shareholders first. But ultimately, the market will decide, he says. Those who choose the broader stakeholder model may find that it makes more business sense. The hope is that a sense of purpose raises longer-run success, helps recruit and retain skilled staff, and appeals to customers. The B Corps movement in the UK likes to say it is to business what Fairtrade certification is to coffee.</p> <p>If the new government is serious about shaking up capitalism, this is an easy win. Companies\u2019 corporate and social responsibility programmes can do good, but they do not address the root causes of corporate misbehaviour, misjudgments or recklessness. For that, we must move beyond a world where shareholders reign supreme.</p>",

As a child, I experienced racism at school \u2013 people telling me to go back to my country and refusing to go near me. But, before the referendum, I had a real sense of patriotism about England. I was on the verge of homelessness a few years ago and people in my local community found me a place to stay and helped me get on benefits. Because of that, I felt very at home here. I wanted to give something back. </p> <p>However, the referendum result showed me that people don\u2019t really want immigrants here. Nigel Farage\u2019s racist and hateful brand of politics won. I don\u2019t feel connected to Britain any more \u2013 I feel disappointed. I look and sound British, so luckily I haven\u2019t experienced any racism.

That\u2019s how I feel now. I haven\u2019t changed, I haven\u2019t done anything differently, yet I feel like I\u2019m constantly being watched, as if someone is just waiting for me to make a wrong move so they can say, \u201cThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re out!\u201d </p> <p>Stripped of the protective layer that the EU offered, I feel exposed and unwelcome, but maybe that was always the case. </p> <p>It seems that this referendum is being used to legitimise racism, offering people the opportunity to vent their spleen against immigrants. All of a sudden, it has become OK to be a racist because more than half of the country voted leave. In the community where I live, more than 80% of the people voted leave. The lovely elderly neighbour from across the street, the friendly butcher I visit every Saturday, the smiling cashier at my local shop \u2013 do they all want me gone? Apparently so, because my neighbour stopped wishing me a \u201cgood morning\u201d, the butcher is always busy in the back when I pop around, and the smiling cashier is not smiling back any more. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t mind the \u201cgo back to your country\u201d jokes at the beginning, but hearing about Polish people getting attacked on the streets, Romanian shops being vandalised and hate speech in the media are constant reminders of who I am: an immigrant. And, sooner or later, I could be attacked or verbally abused as well. </p> <p>I am originally from Romania \u2013 and this is embarrassing to admit \u2013 but I now avoid speaking in my native tongue whenever I\u2019m outside the house.

I came here from Poland 10 years ago, and Scottish people are fantastic \u2013 maybe there\u2019s a different view here compared with England. Most of my friends voted remain. To be honest, most of the time when I speak to people who voted leave, they said it was because of the way the refugee crisis was handled, rather than because of immigration.<br></p> <p>Racism is bad in Poland, and everywhere in Europe seems to be the same. Racism is so common these days that we don\u2019t find it shocking anymore. It is bad in England, but Polish people in their own country can be as bad to Ukrainians and Vietnamese refugeespeople who come over. Racist incidents in Poland are really on the rise at the moment.</p> <h2>Tola, 34, a web designer, Essex </h2> <p>I came here because I felt England would appreciate my skills, the fact that I want to learn and use all that to build something positive. After the referendum, I felt I had got it wrong. People on the street suddenly seemed different, and there was no friendly \u201chello\u201d in the street. However, everything eventually went back to normal. I spoke to my neighbours, who I knew voted to leave, and I told them I understood; this is their homeland and they did what they thought was best. They seemed a bit sorry. </p> <p>I have a feeling that British people wanted to change something, without fully realising the consequences. My neighbours said they welcome me and my husband here and that the vote was more about other things (for example, the security of borders). </p> <p>I have experienced one racist incident, however; a parent in school said something rude to the kids about packing their stuff and leaving after the referendum, but the principal and local authorities reacted appropriately, saying that there\u2019s no place for hate crimes in this town.</p> <p>I have been here for three years. When I moved here with my husband, before the referendum, we had plans to stay, establish a business, apply for permanent residency and citizenship. We still want to do that, but everything will be more complicated now. We hope we\u2019ll be able to comply with all new rules and requirements that a post-EU Britain will have. <br></p> <h2>Mika, 50, doctor, the Midlands </h2> <p>Most of my patients seem embarrassed about voting leave or cannot really explain why they did it, particularly when I ask why they want me to go back home. The NHS is propped up by many European doctors and it would struggle without us. </p> <p>I have not seen any examples of abuse or racist behaviour; most people are polite and, if anything, just apologetic. Most patients think I am Swedish and even when I correct them, no one makes any negative comments. I live in a village where 90% voted leave but, as a local, I am not viewed as foreign and life for me has continued as normal. <br></p> <p>My partner is British. I have now been here for 12 years and have applied for citizenship just in case there are problems in the future.

Perhaps this is because I live in the capital and work within a truly international team (Spanish, Georgian, Colombian etc). Or perhaps I have just been lucky. It\u2019s hard to deny the statistics showing an increase in hate crime. </p> <p>I hope the UK will get out of the EU on good terms, and Europe will not punish us for leaving. If I have children in the future, it\u2019ll be a shame if they can\u2019t study and work abroad. I live in Hackney and I love it here. The Victoria Park community is the best; there are many languages and many ethnicities here. </p> <h2>Albi, 68, retired civil servant, London</h2> <p>I was originally born in Czechoslovakia, but have been in the UK for more than 30 years. I still have a slight accent and since Brexit I have been asked aggressively, \u201cWhen are you leaving this country and going home?\u201d </p> <p>I fear about my future , even in London. My Yugoslav citizenship is no more (because Yugoslavia doesn\u2019t exist any more), and I have therefore requested the Croatian embassy to consider me for their citizenship, just in case things deteriorate and there are more racist attacks in Britain. Clearly, my UK citizenship will not protect me when I am having my head kicked in on a pavement. </p> <h2>Ella, 30, architect, London</h2> <p>There was tension in the office at the time of the referendum; a couple of my colleagues said that there are too many Polish people here. They said this to my face. I was let go a couple of weeks after that, with my employer saying I didn\u2019t fit the office culture. I now have a new job. I\u2019ve just started my own business and I plan to eventually move it to Warsaw.</p> <h2>Emily, management, London</h2> <p>The EU vote was an eye-opener. Although my husband is British and I have lived here for more than 15 years, working and paying taxes, I felt alienated almost overnight. I felt almost sick on the morning following the referendum.</p> <p>I felt more welcome when I first arrived here, when Poland wasn\u2019t even in the EU. I used to think of Britain with warmth and gratitude for giving me a new home; now I just see it as a country with a massive amount of small-minded, bigoted people in it, who are totally opposed to foreigners living and working here. At the same time, these people will wave flags and cheer when Mo Farah, an immigrant to the country, wins gold. People shame benefit claimants yet don\u2019t mind paying millions to the monarchy. The class system here has always baffled me, but Brexit only showed how rotten it is in reality. </p> <p>I live in London, so haven\u2019t experienced xenophobia as such, but my cousin living in Birmingham had dog poo thrown in her garden, and thus decided to move back to Poland. She works for the NHS. Good luck filling those jobs when more people go. </p> <h2>Cat, 41, works at a university<br></h2> <p>I generally do not speak much in my native eastern European language, but I am very careful now of using it in public, as I am scared of the reaction. At my workplace, people talk about eastern European scroungers and our love for vodka. I don\u2019t comment or get involved, as there has always been a hostile and unwelcoming atmosphere towards Europeans where I work. </p> <p>In general, I am very sad that European solidarity failed and people voted leave. There is enough going on in the world and we don\u2019t need to be turning our backs on each other.</p> <ul> <li><em>Some names have been changed. </em><br></li> </ul>",

Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman running as an independent and focused on balancing the federal budget, debated Bill Clinton and incumbent president George HW Bush.</p> <p>Perot was in a far stronger position than Johnson. In June 1992, he actually led the polls \u2013 he had 39% in one Gallup survey \u2013 and was able to use his vast fortune to buy up half-hour blocks of TV time.

  "<p>All of Donald Trump\u2019s strengths and weaknesses were on display this week as he kicked off the homestretch of his presidential campaign.</p> <p>From a walk through a county fair in Ohio, where throngs of people standing four and five deep along a paved path reached out to touch the waving Trump to a televised interview where the Republican nominee praised Vladimir Putin and denigrated American generals, it was a microcosm of Trump\u2019s campaign. One moment he went out of his way to be accessible to the media extending reporters (including one from the Guardian) an invitation to talk with him on a flight on his private plane. Next, he proclaimed to a shouting crowd that the journalists were a corrupt extension of the Clinton campaign.</p> <p>The Republican nominee started the week in Ohio where he sat down with union workers in the bar of an American Legion hall with a blinking LED sign announcing \u201cwings on Thursday\u201d. There, Trump waxed rhapsodic about Democrats who were now supporting him and the weakness of Barack Obama to a dozen weathered white men who looked to him as a potential savior.</p> <p>The blue-collar tour continued when Trump visited nearby Goody\u2019s Diner, which boasted its country tot bowl on a sign outside. The Republican nominee greeted individual diners there. He was particularly pleased when the first voter he met was a Hispanic who planned on voting for him. Trump pronounced \u201cMexican American supports Trump, Mexican American. It\u2019s so nice\u201d to the reporters surrounding him. Trump, looking quite pleased with himself, then gestured at the reporters and directed them to \u201cmake a note of it guys\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82678156c9481e6b7ac935b4c832010ef506ab36/0_212_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks to diners during a stop at Goody\u2019s in Brook Park, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republican nominee eventually sat down at a table with beefy, middle-aged men sitting around a pitcher of cola. He proclaimed to an assembled crowd of reporters and diners \u201cthese are the big union folks here\u201d. A longtime Trump aide standing nearby hastened to agree: \u201cAmazing,\u201d he exclaimed. </p> <p>The union folks must have been amazing as a heartened Trump invited reporters on his plane for a 30-minute flight afterwards. Not coincidentally though, the invitation was extended the same day Hillary Clinton started flying on the same plane as her press corps, something presidential candidates have traditionally done for six months before the election. Trump has declined to let reporters join him on his private plane.</p> <p>For this flight, the press sat facing Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, in the main seating area of the cabin, which featured white leather chairs and couches along with shiny wood that a Trump bodyguard anxiously warned the press not to scratch. Each seat was emblazoned with the Trump crest while television screens through the cabin showed flight data. Some reporters had to go to a separate private room for takeoff because they couldn\u2019t sit on the floor for safety reasons. As the plane taxied, Trump got up and visited them, amiably making small talk. By the time the plane landed, Trump pivoted yet again on his immigration plan. Pence had helped one reporter find a missing cellphone that had gone flying across the cabin during takeoff. </p> <p>The next stop was a county fair where Trump received a welcome more akin to the Beatles at Shea Stadium than a presidential candidate in Ohio. Even teenage boys shouted \u201cI love you Donald\u201d as the candidate struggled to walk a block past rows of corndog vendors. Instead of working the crowd, Trump simply had to wave as secret service agents protected him from the crush of humanity eager for a glimpse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7492e27227497ce0e3e801a21e12086a87170460/0_313_4696_2818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"trump supporters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throngs of Trump supporters try to get a photo of the Republican presidential candidate as he walks through the Canfield fair in Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following days for Trump were more conventional. On Tuesday, he held a town hall where in response to softball questions posed by General Mike Flynn, a longtime supporter, he demonstrated his nostalgia for the Iran-Iraq war. \u201cI always say Iran and Iraq were very similar militarily. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight and then they\u2019d rest. They\u2019d fight, fight, fight. And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas.\u201d Trump followed this with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/06/donald-trump-rally-greenville-north-carolina-clinton-attack\">a primetime rally</a> where he railed against Hillary Clinton as an adoring crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-us-military-spending-sequester-isis\">held a policy speech</a> in a wood-paneled club that has long catered to Philadelphia\u2019s elites, where he suggested \u201csometimes it seems like there wasn\u2019t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn\u2019t want to invade\u201d and railed against her legacy of \u201cturmoil, suffering and death\u201d. The policy Trump unveiled was a major and expensive expansion of the United States military to be funded through \u201ccommonsense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-trigger-happy-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/523tn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2699267\"            data-video-name=\"Trump calls Clinton 'trigger happy and unstable' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d0660ee4b0c1d95ae145a4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11850629&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907trump2_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11850629&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-trigger-happy-video\">Trump calls Clinton \u2018trigger happy and unstable\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Finally Trump made it to the USS Intrepid in New York, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/clinton-vows-no-more-troops-in-iraq-as-trump-slams-dumbest-foreign-policy\">took questions from NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer</a> on live television for almost 30 minutes. Without a script or notes or guidance, Trump flailed on policy. He praised Putin repeatedly and stood by a tweet from 2013 opining sexual assault in the military was a consequence of allowing women to serve. But, through rhetorical jujitsu, he managed to avoid major damage and even repeated his lie that he had been against the Iraq war without being challenged.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/525fa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2700631\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump: Putin is far more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"NBC News\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d10cdae4b0c1d95ae14821\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160907Trump4putin_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/donald-trump-putin-more-of-a-leader-of-his-country-than-obama-for-us-video\">Trump: Putin is more of a leader of his country than Obama is for US \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>From screaming crowds to foreign policy gaffes, these three days served as a condensed window into Trump\u2019s unorthodox and unprecedented campaign. It\u2019s unclear whether the blue-collar adoration the Republican nominee is receiving will compensate for his copious praise for Putin and cavalier dismissal of Saddam Hussein\u2019s use of chemical weapons. However, regardless of what happens, it will be as the sycophantic Trump aide said: \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Yinka Shonibare was born in London in 1962 and at the age of three moved with his family to Lagos, where he grew up. He returned to London to study fine art, and aged 18 contracted transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord, which paralysed one side of his body. Shonibare\u2019s painting, sculpture, photography and film explores themes of cultural identity and colonialism, and often incorporates vivid African batik fabric. His 2002 installation <a href=\"https://africa.si.edu/exhibits/shonibare/gallantry.html\" title=\"\"><em>Gallantry and Criminal Conversation</em></a> (2002), composed of mannequins and a suspended carriage, won him international acclaim. In 2004 he was shortlisted for the Turner prize and was awarded&#xa0;an MBE. <a href=\"http://www.stephenfriedman.com/exhibitions/forthcoming/yinka-shonibare-mbe-and-the-wall-fell-away/yinka-pattern1465573630422031305-jpg\" title=\"\">\u2018...and the wall fell away\u2019</a>, Shonibare\u2019s sixth solo exhibition at Stephen Friedman Gallery, London W1, opens 28 September.</p> <h2>1 | Garden </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9ec8314781c108314be4fc553d5151ef76bd65d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9ec8314781c108314be4fc553d5151ef76bd65d/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hauser and Wirth garden, Somerset, designed by Piet Oudolf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://oudolf.com/garden/hauser-and-wirth\" title=\"\"><strong>Hauser and Wirth</strong></a><strong>, Somerset, by&#xa0;Piet&#xa0;Oudolf</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://oudolf.com/\" title=\"\">Piet Oudolf</a> is a Dutch landscape designer famous for the perennials he plants. What I like about this garden is the way he just gives nature space to do its thing, so it\u2019s sort of organised chaos. He uses quite fragrant plants, like lavender, and lots of really lovely different types of grass. He has also done a garden in the Olympic Park, near where I live, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete\" title=\"\">High Line in New York</a>, which I go to whenever I visit my gallery there. He also did <a href=\"http://oudolf.com/garden/serpentine-gallery\" title=\"\">a garden for the Serpentine Gallery</a>, which I visit a lot, so that\u2019s how I got to know about his work. He has a close proximity to art and artists.</p> <h2>2 | View </h2> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qgeN3Jjakwc?t=14\" title=\"\"><strong>Canary Wharf on the Thames Clipper</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64398e7c1d7a76b16a2d700a11af9651b2f911e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64398e7c1d7a76b16a2d700a11af9651b2f911e5/0_19_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"A Thames Clipper passing Canary Wharf\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My favourite way to admire architecture in London is along the river. Along the way you take in all the sounds and also Tate Modern, the Globe theatre, the Shard, the Gherkin, the Walkie Talkie. I love to do this at night because Tower Bridge at night is just incredible. I always use the Clipper to get to the South Bank because it\u2019s so nice \u2013 especially in the summer \u2013 and Canary Wharf is only 10 minutes from my house. So I go and eat or go to the theatre, listen to music or whatever is on over there. Then coming back at night that way is just really great \u2013 a million times better than the tube.</p> <h2>3 | Photography </h2> <p><a href=\"http://photolondon.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Photo London at Somerset House</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d68792c1a587f285922bd583719173bdae3a3ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d68792c1a587f285922bd583719173bdae3a3ba/0_63_4399_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The opening of Photo London 2016 at Somerset House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a photo fair that launched about three years ago at Somerset House, and it\u2019s one of my favourite things to visit. It\u2019s a variety of approaches to photography, from photojournalism to contemporary art photography to fashion: you have photos by Don McCullin, Craigie Horsfield, Walter and Zoniel. This year Wolfgang Tillmans had a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/08/wolfgang-tillmans-eu-referendum-remain-campaign-posters\" title=\"\">pro-EU campaign posters</a>, but obviously that didn\u2019t work. The exhibition just goes on and on, maybe 50 rooms or something. Online I think they have <a href=\"http://photolondon.org/virtual-visit/\" title=\"\">a 3D thing where you can actually walk through the show</a>.</p> <h2>4 | Documentary </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuQVS7q7-A\" title=\"\"><strong>Pina (dir Wim Wenders, 2011)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1215c8a6ada80cba5373e126c6352366720cc135\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1215c8a6ada80cba5373e126c6352366720cc135/0_63_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pina by Wim Wenders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is one of my favourites: it\u2019s a mixture of dance, theatre and documentary made about choreographer Pina Bausch by Wim Wenders. It\u2019s absolutely fantastic: there are dancers performing in the street, in soil, in water, some of the really memorable ones are done outside. It\u2019s a very moving film. I like artists who push the boundaries of their work and go beyond a strict category, and that\u2019s what I think Pina Bausch did well, in terms of the way she uses human emotion in the work, and also movement and the kinds of dancers. They\u2019re not one type \u2013 you\u2019ve got young people, old people, different types of bodies \u2013 all of that appeals to me.</p> <h2>5 | Art </h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/etel-adnan-weight-world\" title=\"\"><strong>Etel Adnan: The Weight of the World</strong></a><strong>, Serpentine Gallery</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ad40c9e271631f9ef7ca9b25911b0dff05a4165\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad40c9e271631f9ef7ca9b25911b0dff05a4165/0_19_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Etel Adnan at Serpentine Gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was a beautiful exhibition of very small abstract paintings by <a href=\"http://www.eteladnan.com/\" title=\"\">Etel Adnan</a>. She\u2019s a poet, painter and essayist who was born in Lebanon, studied philosophy in Paris and lives in California. She\u2019s a rare artist who can combine being a very good poet and a very good painter. She produces colourful abstract paintings based on landscapes, while her writing references a lot of politics and violence in the world, making sense of things like the Vietnam war. She produces exquisite tapestries as well. I admire the fact that she is also a senior artist [she is 91], because we are in this cult of youth. It\u2019s good to see her being celebrated at the Serpentine, which usually shows hip young things. She was also there for the opening, which was great.</p> <h2>6 | Film </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hMg0sUD44\" title=\"\"><strong>Timbuktu (dir&#xa0;Abderrahmane&#xa0;Sissako,&#xa0;2014)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4845ce6f359708db6c649a6932235f6601f1b660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4845ce6f359708db6c649a6932235f6601f1b660/439_0_1425_855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timbuktu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a film that I think is absolutely fantastic. It\u2019s about the invasion of the ancient city of Timbuktu in Mali by Islamic militants. Sissako takes us through the oppression of the people, but the film is primarily about the destruction of culture, the banning of music, the destruction of African masks and ritual objects and the banning of football and rap music. Then he looks deeply into the individual characters. It\u2019s beautifully shot, with incredible deserts, dunes and landscapes, and the pace is very slow. It\u2019s a film about anger and violence, but also the nice side of humanity, and the fact that the actual militants are also victims of this system they are having to operate under.</p> <h2>7 | Book </h2> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/flash-of-the-spirit.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Flash of the Spirit: African and Afro\u2011American Art and Philosophy (Robert Farris Thompson, 1983)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d7c39ad2853fbc9d4a52faa294a8beb38c0c5b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c39ad2853fbc9d4a52faa294a8beb38c0c5b2c/0_0_448_720/311.jpg\" alt=\"Flash of the Spirit - Robert Farris\" width=\"311\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is what I\u2019m reading right now. It explores the transformation of ancient African cultures within the diaspora and the west. It traces a lot of the cultures of people in the US, Cuba, Haiti, Trinidad, Mexico, Brazil, back to five African civilisations: Yoruba, Kongo, Ejagham, Mand\u00e9 and Cross River. It\u2019s absolutely fascinating that in Brazil the ex-slaves, after hundreds of years, managed to keep the names of their Yoruba gods and deities, and they worship those now. So the book is really an education about explaining the origins of those gods and their significance culturally. I\u2019m learning a lot about my own heritage by reading this book, and also trying to understand how people come to terms with the loss of cultural memory and how resilient the human psyche is to preserve their dignity by retaining aspects of their culture after hundreds of years.</p>",

I don\u2019t know if my parents approved of acting. They never would have said. My father came discreetly to some plays but never commented.

My life would not allow me to live in France full time.</p> <p><strong>You have made almost 100 films. How much do you look back?</strong><br>I\u2019m not a rearview mirror person. I only go forward.

Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot.

So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America.

And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint.

We recently did a <a href=\"http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/elmgreen-dragset\">show in Israel</a> at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from outside, we don\u2019t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down</p> <p><strong>What response did you get?</strong><br>People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement.

We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s.

That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed.</p> <p><strong>What was the problem?<br></strong>It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite.

Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?</strong><br>It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase.</p> <p><strong>Can art work in the same way?</strong><br>I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle.

  "<p>It is lunchtime in east London. In a studio not far from her home, Maya Arulpragasam, the 41-year-old British-Sri Lankan who makes music as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mia\">MIA</a>, sits on a low sofa, her leather boots set apart and yellow-flared legs spread, better to arch over a plate of food. Arulpragasam\u2019s hair is dark and wild and hangs down in tangles over a tight white T-shirt that the musician says is on loan from her six-year-old son. She is just back from Himalayan India, there for a month to direct a music video that will accompany the release of her new album, <em>AIM</em>. While she eats, Arulpragasam tells stories about her trip. The time airport police in Delhi almost shot her. The time she argued with a production manager, in Leh, and threatened to burn his house down.</p> <p>Arulpragasam\u2019s manager, Genneah Turner, sits on the sofa listening. She hasn\u2019t seen her client for weeks. When Arulpragasam finishes telling an anecdote about disagreeing with a local physician\u2019s treatment of her altitude sickness, Turner interrupts to ask about the apparent lack of internet in northern India. How else to explain all the important business emails that Arulpragasam failed to reply to over a month? \u201cSeriously,\u201d the musician insists, chewing food, \u201cthe internet wasn\u2019t working where we were.\u201d</p> <p>Turner wonders, gently, how other people on the same trip were able to Instagram so much of it. Arulpragasam, smiling coolly at her plate, says she can\u2019t explain that. \u201cMaybe something went wrong with my phone?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"328d66dbd603dff0bf36f66f4ec453bcd248617f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/328d66dbd603dff0bf36f66f4ec453bcd248617f/591_762_2948_4983/592.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears blouse by Stella McCartney (harveynichols.com) and track trousers by Vetements (matchesfashion.com).\" width=\"592\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears blouse by Stella McCartney (harveynichols.com) and track trousers by Vetements (matchesfashion.com).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who\u2019ve followed her career, since she first emerged as MIA in 2003, will be well aware Arulpragasam has a testy relationship with authority. Across a month in India she managed to threaten a disobliging colleague with criminal arson and, at Delhi airport, provoke police into reaching for their guns.<strong> </strong>Across a decade in pop she has been vexatious, cheeking powerful peers (Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9) as well as influential tastemakers (MTV, <em>New York Times</em>, Google), meanwhile <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse\">live-Tweeting</a> more detail about the private disputes with her American record label (Interscope) than anybody there can be comfortable with. \u201cI talk talk talk,\u201d she raps on her new album, accurately, \u201cuntil I piss \u2019em off.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my head this is like the love album. It\u2019s cute compared to what I usually make</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her lunch finished, we walk to a nearby park, where Arulpragasam lists for me all the managers she\u2019s chewed through since 2003. One left inside a week, she recalls. One manager departed because of the Super Bowl \u2013 that infamous occasion, in 2012, when MIA joined Madonna on stage as part of the event\u2019s halftime show and, during some very limited time on screen, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nfl-sues-m-i-a-for-16-6-million-over-super-bowl-middle-finger-20140317\">managed to flip an unchoreographed middle finger</a> at 167 million viewers. \u201cI\u2019ve had 13 managers in 13 years,\u201d she says, claiming that one of them has since become her boss at Interscope.</p> <p>Arulpragasam triangles her legs, teddy bear-style, and puts her hands out behind her on the grass. \u201cSo there\u2019s some bridges I\u2019ve burned,\u201d she says.</p> <p>We talk about <em>AIM</em>, a curious and appealing muddle of a record that has much of the snarl fans have come to expect from MIA, but an unfamiliar gentleness, too, its softer underbelly most evident in an autobiographical track called \u201cSurvivor\u201d and in the new single \u201cFreedun\u201d, its chorus sung by <a href=\"http://inzayn.com/\">Zayn Malik</a>, one-time glowerer of One Direction. Arulpragasam says the album\u2019s sweeter parts were written after a break-up with a boyfriend late last year. \u201cIn my head this is like the love album,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a cute album, My Little Pony, compared to what I usually make.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s going too far. At least half the tracks sound as if they were written in MIA\u2019s customary battle-crouch, and the album\u2019s thorniest work, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\">Borders</a>\u201d, inspired by the Syrian refugee crisis, was recently the subject of a mean little row between her and MTV. She directed a video for \u201cBorders\u201d last year that featured an image of a boat-load of dead refugees. The film was politically timely, affecting and well praised, but when it was left off the list of nominations for an MTV video music award, Arulpragasam took to Twitter to laugh bitterly (\u201c#hahahahhaahahhaha!!\u201d) and to accuse the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/758621030965506048\">media company of being prejudiced</a> against her subject matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77c1f8131202ff121e5fe4eafd40eb810d2bc578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77c1f8131202ff121e5fe4eafd40eb810d2bc578/0_0_4682_7015/667.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears printed hoodie by Vetements (selfridges.com).\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears printed hoodie by Vetements (selfridges.com).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In conversation she suggests the lack of an MTV nomination amounted to a form of censorship. She says: \u201cIf you have a music industry that\u2019s so ingrained with the political agendas of the time that you censor art like that\u2026\u201d When I suggest another possibility, that MTV didn\u2019t think the video was one of the year\u2019s best, she answers: \u201cYou can think it\u2019s my paranoia. And you can write that, say: \u2018Oh, yeah, MIA, she was super-paranoid about all these people doing all these things, but that\u2019s not true, [her video] was just rubbish.\u2019 You can write that.\u201d But she says she wants her own suspicions registered, too. \u201cIf it\u2019s political, then people have the right to know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it\u2019s political, then people have the right to know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her war with MTV is actually one of the more manageable conflicts currently occupying her. There is a song on the new album called \u201cVisa\u201d that takes aim at American immigration policy, something Arulpragasam unwillingly knows a lot about. Her application to renew an expired visa has been stuck in mysterious bureaucratic limbo since 2014. In an age when British popstars with any sort of US fanbase are routinely granted permission to work in America, her two-year hobbling seems unconventional. \u201cObviously what\u2019s happening to me is very deliberate,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing it, it\u2019s like fucking playing Cluedo.\u201d</p> <p>She says she has a few theories as to what\u2019s going on \u2013 a few of the bridge-burnees from her past who she worries might be exerting influence. Arulpragasam keeps a <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>-style list in her head, identifying potential enemies, obstructors. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d she asks me.</p> <p>Um.</p> <p>\u201cWell shit happens. It is what happens.\u201d</p> <p>A few of her presumed obstructors cannot be named here for legal reasons. In general, though, she does not pitch her suspicions small. \u201cOn paper I\u2019ve supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a> and stuff. And now Hillary Clinton is running for president. And until that\u2019s solved I might have a problem, because anyone who ever associated with that website is going to get fucked up. Even if you delivered [WikiLeaks] their takeaway, you are going to be on a list. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>I ask her if she ever worries she\u2019s paranoid and she replies, smartly, that in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>\u2019s revelations about the NSA it\u2019s wrong \u201cto even use the word \u2018paranoia\u2019 as if it\u2019s a weird condition. Because it\u2019s common as a fucking cold now. Everyone has to have an element of paranoia.\u201d</p> <p>She reaches for her phone \u2013 \u201cI would love to not show you this\u201d \u2013 and calls up a screengrab she\u2019s been keeping for months. Last spring, Arulpragasam was removed from the billing of London\u2019s <a href=\"http://afropunkfest.com/london/\">Afropunk festival</a>, after making controversial comments in an <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/single-mother-refugee-campaigner-and-controversialist-meet-mia-a3228831.html\">interview with the <em>Evening Standard</em> </a>about Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar, and their involvement in the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. (\u201cWould Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter?\u201d) The decision that she wasn\u2019t going to perform was reported widely. Oddly, one of the US Embassy\u2019s social media feeds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/755235104994230272\">retweeted the news</a>. </p> <p>Arulpragasam, screengrabbing, interpreted this as a foreign government\u2019s approval of her difficulties. \u201cIf they care about you getting dropped off a festival,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s not really paranoia, that\u2019s <em>there</em>.\u201d She puts away her phone. Then, without any preamble, she starts a long and involved story about the summer she thought the CIA might be threatening to assassinate her\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d60aeb6a3a56ad57d12822a373170c4c77a53f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d60aeb6a3a56ad57d12822a373170c4c77a53f/468_390_3897_6225/626.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears boiler suit by Iro (selfridges.com); rollneck by Victoria Beckham (net-a-porter.com) and shoes by Nicholas Kirkwood.\" width=\"626\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears boiler suit by Iro (selfridges.com); rollneck by Victoria Beckham (net-a-porter.com) and shoes by Nicholas Kirkwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no great mystery where this inclination to mistrust comes from. Arulpragasam tracks it back to the example of her father, an activist who in the 1970s and 80s was a prominent protester against Sri Lanka\u2019s ruling Sinhalese government. He campaigned for an independent state for the minority Tamil population, and Arulpragasam recalls that when she was young her father used to tell her to write letters as if someone was reading them over her shoulder. \u201cFrom day one he was like that,\u201d she says. When civil war broke out in Sri Lanka in 1983, Arulpragasam, aged six, was moved with her mother and siblings to India while their father stayed behind. When she was 10, they arrived in the UK, the family housed as refugees in London.</p> <p>On her new album track \u201cSurvivor\u201d, she raps in reference to this period: \u201cI arrived through the sea like a pirate.\u201d For a time the young pirate struggled to fit in. Arulpragasam recently unearthed an old family photograph, and laughing over it today she wonders at her rounded Princess Di hair, her primly buttoned-up shirt. At that age, \u201cWhen I gave my seat to old ladies on the bus, they used to reply: \u2018Aren\u2019t you a nice little boy?\u2019\u201d Slowly she found a place for herself as an artist. The go-to person at school for freehand drawings, she went on to <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/\">Central Saint Martins</a> art college. In her 20s she put on visual art shows, made clothes and might have made a film, had anyone funded a documentary she was trying to make about life in Sri Lanka. Her music was encouraged by a friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/justine-frischmann-elastica-interview-volta-art-fair\">Justine Frischmann</a>, then the lead singer in Elastica. Frischmann loaned Arulpragasam one of the band\u2019s synthesisers and she began to write tracks on it.</p> <p>Nobody really knew what to make of her early output as MIA, she recalls. Her stuff was a bit hip hop, a bit dancehall, a bit funk... multi-generically <em>odd</em> in a way that her collaborator and then-boyfriend, Wesley \u201cDiplo\u201d Pentz, urged her to embrace. She remembers practical difficulties, though, getting studios and suppliers to accept oddity. \u201cI told them: \u2018If you don\u2019t know the genre, just put me near the till. You know the lollipops, next to the till? <em>That</em> is me.\u201d If distributors were wary, the music press took to her immediately (that back-story!) and the debut studio album that came in 2005, <em>Arular</em>, was a critical hit, nominated for a Mercury prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99acbf0fd58a98eb4c151c0142e11b7658ef4cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99acbf0fd58a98eb4c151c0142e11b7658ef4cbd/0_0_4678_7009/667.jpg\" alt=\"MIA wears track jacket by Neil Barrett.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIA wears track jacket by Neil Barrett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Woffinden/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arulpragasam was in her late 20s, and impatient. Against the advice of her then-manager (they split) she moved to the US. \u201cKids in America were downloading my MP3s. It was the country where George Bush was, where shit was happening. I wanted to go.\u201d Her relationship with Pentz ended and Arulpragasam <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arular-10-years-later-m-i-a-reflects-on-globe-shaking-debut-20150320\">later suggested</a> this was due to her growing embrace by the mainstream. She signed to Interscope, a subsidiary of Universal, and had meetings with Kanye West and Timbaland. After the release of her second album, <em>Kala</em>, in 2007, and its high-charting single \u201cPaper Planes\u201d in 2008, the rope properly lifted and MIA became an industry darling. She gigged at the Grammys with Jay-Z, was nominated for an Oscar, and even \u201cmarried into the music industry\u201d \u2013 Arulpragasam\u2019s words to me \u2013 when she got together with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/mia-benjamin-bronfman-son_n_2874890.html\">Ben Bronfman</a>, grandson of the CEO of Warner Music. The couple had a son together, Ikhyd, in 2009.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I came [into the spotlight], I came with all my complications</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Remembering this period of prominence, Arulpragasam says to me: \u201cWhen I came [into the spotlight], I came with all my complications.\u201d The complications started to tell around 2010, when she rowed in blockbuster fashion with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/28/mia-tweets-phone-number-journalist\"><em>New York Times</em></a> over an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1\">unflattering profile</a>, and ended up publishing the writer\u2019s personal phone number online. In <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/mia/51302\">another 2010 interview </a>she stated her belief that Google was a stooge company for the CIA, and via her intermittently written blog she got so deep into a war of words with a Sri Lankan rapper called DeLon that it led to accusations of her being a terrorist sympathiser. Her third album, 2010\u2019s <em>Maya</em>, sold a fraction of her big-hit second. After the Super Bowl fiasco in 2012, a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mia-resolves-nfls-war-super-727111\">messy compensation claim</a> followed her around for months. She came to believe her fourth album, 2013\u2019s <em>Matangi</em>, her lowest-seller to date, had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/765439547421241344\">\u201cburied\u201d by her own record label</a>, because of all the trouble she\u2019d caused them.</p> <p>\u201cStars come and go / just like every empire,\u201d she raps on her new album. Complicated as she was \u2013 as she is \u2013 Arulpragasam was never likely to have an endless career as a mainstream star. She seems relaxed about this, clearly more comfortable as a fringe-dweller, as someone who has talked, talked, talked and finally pissed them off.</p> <p>But the visa thing rankles. Arulpragasam recalls for me her last visit to the US, a brief trip to deliver her son to his father. \u201cI flew there to drop him off and flew back the same day.\u201d Arulpragasam explains that when she and Bronfman separated in 2010, she decided to move back to London to be near her mother. Tomorrow, Arulpragasam says, Ikhyd will arrive back in the UK from a month away with his paternal family. \u201cWe went through a <em>lot</em> to sort that out. It\u2019s kind of like that\u2019s when he gets taken away to get Americanised \u2013 he goes and does all his \u2018Heeeey! Awesome! America!\u2019 stuff, and I\u2019ve just got to let it happen.\u201d</p> <p>When she talks about Ikhyd I understand that her battle over the visa amounts to more than just a rebel\u2019s habitual prickliness at being told no. Arulpragasam is the mother of a dual-nationality child, reasonably appalled that whenever she sees him off a plane at JFK she cannot follow. \u201cIt\u2019s fucked up. You can have a half-American son and they won\u2019t let you in. So if anything happens to him\u2026 Y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>We stay quiet, leaving this worst-case scenario unexplored. Arulpragasam isn\u2019t much of a moper, though, and soon she is rascally chuckling. She still has one or two friends with influence, she says, and the other day she sent a text to Rihanna. Arulpragasam wanted to know if, in a pinch, her friend would help get her over the border. Perhaps via tunnel, \u201csome weird El Chapo move\u201d from Mexico. Or maybe in the boot of a car? The reply came back quickly. \u201cYeah bitch,\u201d Rihanna wrote, \u201cyou know I would.\u201d</p> <p><em>MIA\u2019s new album </em>AIM<em> is out now on Interscope/Polydor</em></p>",
  "<p><em>AIM</em> is a first for <a href=\"http://miauk.com/\">MIA</a>. Her fifth album, formerly titled <em>Matahdatah</em>, is not wall-to-wall polemic. Last year\u2019s (excellent) single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-Nw7HbaeWY\">Borders</a> remains an earworm despairing at the refugee crisis, a theme continued on Foreign Friend and Visa. But many of these songs are vignettish, poppy missives from MIA\u2019s own country, \u201cthe People\u2019s Republic of Swagistan\u201d as her (very good) Zayn-featuring song \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.vevo.com/search?q=MIA%20freedun\">Freedun</a> \u2013 has it. Sure, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGDhHxgY6uo\">Go Off</a> is satisfyingly pugilistic, but the inventive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBAmAyONR0s\">Bird Song</a> is downright cute, reuniting MIA with her ex, Diplo. If this is her last album (as she has intimated), a true original bows out on a more equable note.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/13/huxley-great-dynasties-aldous\">Thomas Huxley</a> knew a thing or two about the White Cliffs of Dover. \u201cWith vast needles and pinnacles standing out in the sea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for the weary cormorant, [they] confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur,\u201d he wrote in an essay which he simply titled <em>On a Piece of Chalk</em>.</p> <p>For Huxley, a 19th-century pioneer of evolutionary biology, the white stuff was the perfect substance to demonstrate Earth\u2019s antiquity, made up, as it is, of microscopic, calcified creatures whose powdery remains give us the means to record events and express ourselves artistically. It even gave the country its name, Albion, from <em>albus</em> the Latin for white \u2013 a reference to the White Cliffs of Dover.</p> <p>So where better to sample a new national walking route than the chalk cliffs near Dover? The place that helped define the nation and the site of a recently opened section of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/26/england-coast-path-step-closer\">England Coastal Path</a> which, by 2020, will allow outdoor enthusiasts to walk round the 2,790 miles of the nation\u2019s shoreline. This journey will begin at the Scottish border near Bamburgh and take walkers down to Kent and the white cliffs, then along the south coast to Lyme Regis and to Land\u2019s End before heading up to Chepstow \u2013 for a brief break to enjoy the 870-mile Wales Coast Path \u2013 before rejoining its England Coastal Path at Queensferry and then heading to its northwestern extremity at Gretna. According to Nature England, this will be the longest continuous coastal walking route in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad68256f143c20c3a2d709a0caa7db6892fe1580/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots: sea kale on the pebbles at Sandwich Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wouter van Caspel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of these sections will absorb existing paths that are being tarted up to the standards of a national trail while completely new sections are being constructed. My walk \u2013 from the National Trust\u2019s White Cliffs reception centre to Sandwich \u2013 would take in both refurbished path and new track and is part of the newly opened Kent section of the coastal path.</p> <p>And although only a few miles long, the section covers a startlingly diverse and strikingly beautiful chunk of countryside. The White Cliffs, in mid-summer, burst with colour and wildlife: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/16/alys-fowler-knapweeds\">greater knapweed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/24/plant-of-week-scabiosa-blue-jeans\">scabious</a>, lady\u2019s bedstraw, wild mignonette, sea kale, wild marjoram and thyme providing a multicoloured home for marbled white, chalkmill blue, skipper and meadow brown butterflies. Add the odd skylark wheeling overhead and you do indeed have a place of \u201cwonderful beauty and grandeur\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e655bbbd0bd5a1e537c22b925495d45ce787b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e655bbbd0bd5a1e537c22b925495d45ce787b78/0_113_4595_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Spectacular plant and insect life\u2019: a marbled white butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spectacular plant and insect life\u2019: a marbled white butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it soon becomes apparent as we begin our walk that these glories are based on only wafer-thin support. Patches of bare chalk protrude all along the coastal path here and reveal how painfully thin is the soil layer that supports its plants and wildlife.</p> <p>Nor are the cliffs immutable. Their chalk crumbles at a fairly substantial rate, eroding at an average of a centimetre a year. Every so often a giant chunk collapses into the sea. And for a coastal path this could be bad news. You cannot have the ravages of natures regularly wiping out chunks of your pathway.</p> <p>Fortunately, the new trail, which was launched in 2007 by the then environment secretary David Miliband, has been established so that Nature England will have the power to rebuild, further inland, any path lost to erosion. In addition, land between the coastal path and shore can now be used for recreation, for example, picnics \u2013 a right that was also established when setting up the Coastal Path\u2019s legislation.</p> <p>With its spectacular plant and insect life, together with the hustle of Dover, the world\u2019s busiest passenger port, behind you and the sight of the Calais coastline to your right, this first section was the most intriguing part of our six-mile walk. It is an exhilarating stroll which, after a couple of miles, takes you to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/20/churchill-wartime-tunnels-dover-national-trust\">Fan Bay Deep Shelter</a>, a gun battery cut out of the Kent chalk in 1941 that allowed Britain to shell enemy shipping in the Channel. Recently restored by the Natural Trust, its tunnels, scrawled with 40s graffiti, also provide access to a First World War sound mirror, a giant concrete dish which focused sound waves, rather than radio waves, as a not-very-successful method for detecting incoming planes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183e518bcc70a2d6cdabf4ffa4b2f4ea8df6cc3d/0_134_5174_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walmer Castle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient stones: Walmer Castle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Bailey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/south-foreland-lighthouse\">South Foreland Lighthouse</a>, you head down steeply to St Margaret\u2019s at Cliffe and head north to Deal and Henry VIII\u2019s Walmer Castle which later provided a home for Pitt the Younger and the Duke of Wellington (who died there). From Deal, the path then follows the coast to Sandwich along a beach made of steep shingle. The pace here is slow and heavy though the place is not without its fascinations, the coast being rich in populations of waders and wildfowl.</p> <p>Two thirds of the way to Pegwell Bay, the path used to turn east to Sandwich, but now has an extra three miles of route added to it to take walkers round the peninsula at Shellness and down the River Stour to Sandwich, creating a series of new ponds and reserves that are already being colonised by egrets and other wildfowl. It is a stunning little thoroughfare bursting with history and wildlife and as pleasant a few miles as I have ever walked.</p> <p>Chalk one up to the coastal path.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cOh my God, we\u2019ve got scobies coming out of our ears,\u201d says Clare Lattin, shutting the fridge door and placing two bottles of glowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/30/kombucha-beer-hybrid-los-alamos-new-mexico\">kombucha</a> on her vast kitchen table. For the uninitiated, a scoby is a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast used to produce fermented, effervescent tea. \u201cCome by the restaurant and we\u2019ll vac-pac one for you,\u201d she offers.</p> <p>The restaurant could be one of two. Lattin is the co-founder of the diminutive European gastro-chic <a href=\"http://ducksoupsoho.co.uk/\">Ducksoup</a> in Soho, and <a href=\"http://www.rawduckhackney.co.uk/\">Rawduck</a> in Hackney. A third venue with a focus on pickles and ferments is in the making. She also co-owns the food and drink PR company EightyFour (the client list includes the Hix restaurant group and the Chiltern Firehouse). Finally there\u2019s a ceramics line, <a href=\"http://www.vesselsandtime.co.uk/welcome/#about\">Vessel &amp; Time</a>, for which she sketches designs that are then produced by a potter in Dorset. She also finds time to handbuild her own ceramics. A board of clay vessels sits drying on the floor of her apartment. \u201cOne day, the dream is to just design and make jugs,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lattin\u2019s apartment is on the ground floor of a converted factory in Hackney Wick. The building was turned into studios by a community of artists in the 1990s. \u201cI came to a party here about 15 years ago, so I knew the community existed,\u201d explains Lattin. \u201cThen, four years ago, my friend [the artist <a href=\"http://www.timnobleandsuewebster.com/\">Sue Webster</a>] heard an apartment was coming up for private sale. I came to view it and that was that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787b797247807038d4fa896931509400fc5efce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787b797247807038d4fa896931509400fc5efce9/0_743_5744_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The book-lined sitting room with a large faded rug.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The book-lined sitting room with a large faded rug.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I visit, the <a href=\"https://www.crittall-windows.co.uk/\">Crittall</a> front door is left permanently open.

Slowly, she has transformed the space, opening up the spare bedroom to create an office, adding internal French windows to the one remaining bedroom, and replacing the bathroom and kitchen. The industrial proportions of the property have been softened and apportioned with hanging fabric from <a href=\"http://www.caravane.fr/en/\">Caravane </a>and <a href=\"http://www.thelinenworks.co.uk/\">Linen Works</a> . By the front door, Lattin has stitched offcuts of vintage Berber skirts from <a href=\"http://www.theclothshop.net/\">The Cloth Shop</a> on to a plain linen panel. \u201cI love hanging fabric,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way to divide space and it creates a sense of airiness that reminds me of being on holiday.\u201d</p> <p>On open shelves throughout the space are groupings of carefully collected objects. \u201cI\u2019m fairly minimalist,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cI look for objects with texture and character, but it\u2019s really hard to find things in the UK alone \u2013 you end up having to pay a fortune.\u201d She points out some of her favourite finds, including a pink and blue tin plate from Damascus, and a pair of cracked French earthenware pots. For her, the faded pink and grey rug (from <a href=\"http://www.maroctribal.com/\">Maroc Tribal</a>) recaptures the colours of the Nevada desert where she recently travelled to see the artist <a href=\"https://utah.com/wendover/sun-tunnels\">Nancy Holt\u2019s salt tunnels</a>. \u201cIt was the most peaceful experience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94066d98cd677c6de0f23efea1cc26153e5283ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94066d98cd677c6de0f23efea1cc26153e5283ee/0_2289_2804_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A board of drying clay pots in the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A board of drying clay pots in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m really interested in the way people sit and congregate,\u201d says Lattin. \u201cAnd I love the idea of creating corners of different experience.\u201d This is clear in her personal space and the way different forms of seating are used within it. In front of a bookshelf is an unupholstered armchair with a nude-pink cushion, and a birch plywood occasional table and stool from the Shoreditch-based workshop <a href=\"http://unto-this-last.myshopify.com/\">Unto This Last</a>. There\u2019s an Ercol bench, vast sofa and secondhand Thonet rocking chair gathered around a patchwork of monochrome rugs. In the kitchen, a Windsor chair faces the dining table and beside the desk space is a deep, built-in daybed.</p> <p>This interest also informs the spirit of her restaurants. \u201cI wanted to open somewhere where you could pitch up by yourself, grab a seat at the bar and find good food, with good wines by the glass without paying a fortune for it or booking it two weeks in advance. The seating, the menu, the wine list\u2026 It\u2019s all about promoting conversation in an intimate environment.\u201d And sharing scobies, of course.</p>",
  "<p>The number of vegans has been rising in the UK \u2013 up by 360% over the past decade. At the moment there are more than half a million in this country, and as ever more disturbing information proliferates regarding the costs of meat and dairy production to the environment, many more look set to switch from steak to seitan. With vegan foodstuffs now commonplace in supermarkets and chefs getting creative with animal-free offerings, what\u2019s stopping the remaining 99% of us? Well, it might just be the reputation. Who wants to be labelled a sanctimonious tofu tout or a clean-eating vanity case? Which is how vegans still tend to be perceived, despite the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/03/veganuary-stars-sign-up-animal-free-month\">Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/30/ellen-page-being-out-became-more-important-than-any-movie\">Ellen Page</a> flashing their credentials, Emma Watson going to the Met Ball in an \u201canimal-friendly\u201d dress and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/10/beyonce-fur-vegan-restaurant-veganism-lifestyle-celebrity\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> investing in a vegan meal delivery service. It\u2019s time the lifestyle\u2019s profile got a make-over.</p> <h2>Sean O\u2019Callaghan </h2> <p>42, London, Fat Gay Vegan blogger and PR. Founder of the Vegan Beer Festival</p> <p>I was driving along a freeway on a hot summer\u2019s day in Sydney and got stuck behind a truck taking chickens to be killed. I went to KFC all the time then and it made me realise what I was empowering with my money. A few days later, there was a cattle truck accident, some died and some were staggering around hurt, and I thought, \u201cOK, I\u2019m vegetarian.\u201d Later I moved to London and my sister, who teases me about everything, was living with me. She wasn\u2019t vegetarian, but would say: \u201cYou\u2019re going on about how you are ethical, but you\u2019re drinking milk and you know what happens to dairy cows, don\u2019t you?\u201d One day I was like, \u201cActually, you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been a hypocrite.\u201d I changed overnight. When I switched I realised I hadn\u2019t really done anything. And this was back in 2000 when it wasn\u2019t as easy as today. Now you\u2019ve got almond milk, hemp, soya, even in places like Iceland. I was in Chelsea earlier and there are two vegan ice cream shops just on the King\u2019s Road.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One hot summer\u2019s day I got stuck behind a truck taking chickens to be killed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before becoming a vegan I was a primary school teacher, then I started blogging and putting on events and it got so busy that I stepped away from teaching. It was hard, but I believed in what I was doing. I want non-vegans to see that they can do everything they do now as vegans, but also support and celebrate those who have made the choice. We\u2019ve just put on the fourth London Vegan Beer Festival and 1,000 people came. It was beautiful. I\u2019m going to hold it in Manchester and Glasgow soon, too.</p> <h2>Diana Pinkett</h2> <p>44, London, Vegan Peasant Catering</p> <p>There is the stereotype of the granola-eating hippie. That\u2019s not me. I became vegan for environmental reasons which really resonated with me. The amount of grain that has to be produced to feed cattle and other livestock doesn\u2019t make much sense when, with all that arable land, you can feed people directly while using less water. You then also have less methane and other polluting waste ending up in the atmosphere and waterways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The amount of grain produced to feed cattle doesn\u2019t make much sense</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many vegans are not necessarily foodies, especially animal rights people. Their food choices can be made solely on whether something is vegan or not, whereas my chef partner and I are both very interested in food. Some of what we make can be healthy-ish, but it doesn\u2019t come under the health-blog banner, and not the vegan junk food banner either, as it\u2019s a bit more formal. We cater for events like weddings, 60th birthday parties and fundraisers, like the one we just did for Greenpeace.</p> <h2>Joseph Sheridan-Ruddy </h2> <p> 32, Preston, engineering buyer and trainee counsellor</p> <p>People are always saying, \u201cI bet you miss steak don\u2019t you?\u201d But I don\u2019t. I miss Dairy Milk and Nike Air Max more than meat. When I was 28, a friend turned. He didn\u2019t push me, but a couple of things he said prompted me to think about it. One being that he didn\u2019t like the fact that a cow was being \u201craped\u201d for its milk \u2013 almost a feminist perspective. Cows are artificially inseminated to keep them lactating and then their babies are taken off them so there\u2019s a growing part of the vegan community who see it as rape because humans are aware of the concept of consent so we hold that responsibility. That started me thinking about the meat and dairy industry. But I was never sold on the \u201cmeat is murder\u201d thing. It was the word \u201clivestock\u201d that struck me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I miss Dairy Milk more than meat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back then I was working in stores and stock is something that you put on a shelf and sell. I felt so uncomfortable that an animal\u2019s life was being used to make money for a human. I had a fridge full of meat at the time and couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat it. It was the classic eureka moment.</p> <h2>Denai Moore</h2> <p>22, London, musician</p> <p>I grew up in a Jamaican household, where the diet is heavy on animal protein and I was obsessed with pizza, but I started to get tonsillitis often and it always seemed to be after I\u2019d eaten lots of dairy. I celebrated a tour by eating loads of chocolate and immediately became ill so I stopped eating dairy for my voice; the rest followed out of curiosity. It\u2019s been a life changing experience as it\u2019s made me question everything. I had no idea that meat and dairy consumption affected the environment before watching the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\"><em>Cowspiracy</em></a> and <em>Earthlings</em> literally destroyed me, it\u2019s very blunt and took me several weeks to watch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Creating vegan Jamaican food is what I\u2019m all about at the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s amazing having access to so much information online which is why I think so many teenagers are becoming vegan. Also, they\u2019re being introduced to veganism without feeling judged. Seeing people blog and post pictures and youtubers living it shows how accessible and inexpensive it can be to be vegan. And you can still enjoy a lot of the foods you ate growing up, like Oreos. Creating vegan Jamaican food is what I\u2019m all about at the moment so I can do my own supper club. And there\u2019s loads of exciting vegan restaurants, too. <a href=\"http://fedbywater.co.uk/\">Fed By Water</a> in Dalston make amazing vegan pizzas with their own mozzarella \u2013 that\u2019s a massive thing for me.</p>"
