  "<p>Donald Trump has said the 2016 presidential election is \u201cgoing to be the last election that the Republicans can win\u201d, because if he is not victorious undocumented migrants \u201clegalised\u201d under a Hillary Clinton presidency will \u201cbe able to vote and once that happens you can forget it\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the last election that the Republicans can win,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2016/09/09/brody-file-exclusive-donald-trump-says-this-will-be-the-last-election-that-the-republicans-have-a-chance-of-winning\">told the Christian Broadcasting Network </a>on Friday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win this election, you\u2019ll never see another Republican and you\u2019ll have a whole different church structure. You\u2019ll have a whole different supreme court structure.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Trump has made immigration a central issue of his campaign, promising to build a wall on the southern border, to be paid for by Mexico, although Mexican leaders have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">rejected </a>the idea. His promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/donald-trump-deport-11-million-migrants-is-that-even-possible\">deport some 11 million </a>undocumented migrants who live in the US have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/donald-tump-immigration-mixed-messages-republicans\">recently been thrown into doubt</a>, however.</p> <p>CBN host David Brody asked Trump whether he was referring to \u201cwhat Michele Bachmann was talking about\u201d, which was Clinton providing potential citizenship for \u201cmany of these illegals\u201d, because \u201cthat means Texas and Florida could be gone\u201d.</p> <p>Bachmann, a former congresswoman from Minnesota who made a brief run for the White House in 2012 and is <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/bachmann-boasts-role-trump-adviser-multiple-issues\">an adviser</a> to the Trump campaign, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/michele-bachmann-2016-last-election-demographic-change\">last week told CBN</a>: \u201cIf you look at the numbers of people who vote and who live in the country and who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to bring in to the country, this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles. This is it.\u201d</p> <p>Both Texas and Florida have large populations of undocumented people, relative to other states, and the latter has been tightly contested in recent elections.</p> <p>Trump repeated: \u201cI think this will be the last election if I don\u2019t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you\u2019re going to have people flowing across the border, you\u2019re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they\u2019re going to be legalised and they\u2019re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it.\u201d</p> <p>Two successive presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, have failed to pass immigration reform plans through Congress that would have created very gradual paths to citizenship. Despite steady support by moderate Republicans for such plans, Trump has consistently rejected citizenship unless migrants leave and return to the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have one Republican vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s already a hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps.\u201d</p> <p>In the Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">head-to-head</a> poll average, Clinton leads Trump 45.6% to 42.9%. The same site\u2019s poll average for <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_clinton-5635.html\">Florida</a> puts the Democrat up by 44.8% to 44.5%. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_clinton-5694.html\">Texas</a>, Trump leads by 45.7% to 37.3%.</p> <p>Data journalism site FiveThirtyEight has <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">forecast</a> that Clinton has a 71.3% chance of winning the White House. The website makes Florida the state most likely to tip the election, with an 18.7% chance. Solidly Republican Texas, it says, has a 0.7% chance of deciding who makes it to the White House.</p>",

But this week in Flushing Meadows, he\u2019s making a different kind of history. Injuries to Jiri Vesely\u2019s forearm, Mikhail Youzhny\u2019s hamstring and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga\u2019s knee made Djokovic the first men\u2019s player in the Open Era to reach a grand slam semi-final following three retirements and/or walkovers. Djokovic\u2019s nine sets and 84 games completed are the fewest en route to a semi at any major in the Open era that featured a 128 draw and only best-of-five set matches. Should Djokovic win his third US Open, the numbers to beat belong to John McEnroe, who played 16 sets and 150 games to secure his first major title at the 1979 US Open.</li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Djokovic\u2019s opponent on Friday, No10 seed Ga\u00ebl Monfils, has enjoyed a smooth road of his own to the semi-finals. Monfils is the 10th player in the last 25 years to reach the US Open semi-finals without dropping a set. However, eight of the previous nine players did not win the title, and no US Open champion during the Open era has ever had a perfect set record. The bad omens only start there for Monfils, who is 0-12 against Djokovic dating back to the 2005 US Open. Both 18 years old at the time, Monfils and Djokovic engaged a five-set, first-round match that lasted four hours and two minutes. Djokovic overcame shoulder pain and cramps to win 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(5), 0-6, 7-5.<br></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li>Monfils\u2019 four-set loss to Roger Federer at 2008 Roland Garros started a string of eight straight defeats suffered by Frenchmen in grand slam semi-finals. Djokovic was responsible for two of those losses, beating Tsonga at 2011 Wimbledon and Richard Gasquet at 2015 Wimbledon as part of his 53-1 run against French opponents. Currently, Djokovic has won 16 straight matches overall against Frenchmen and 22 in a row at grand slam tournaments. </li> </ul> </ul> <p>Plenty more to come from Flushing Meadows.

  "<p>A 14-man Worcester side were left to rue the dismissal of flanker Alafoti Fa\u2019osiliva, which denied them a morale-boosting victory. The Samoan\u2019s sending-off after 62 minutes, for leading with his elbow, gave the Cherry and Whites a timely lifeline and extended the Warriors\u2019 sequence of Premiership outings without a win to six games.</p> <p>Carl Hogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/04/harlequins-bristol-saracens-worcester-mo-farah\" title=\"\">the Worcester coach, </a>had little doubt \u201cthe red card changed the outcome of the game\u201d after the television match official ruled Fa\u2019osiliva had illegally flattened the Argentine lock Mariano Galarza. First-half tries from Ben Te\u2019o and Cooper Vuna and a spectacular effort from 21-year-old replacement Perry Humphreys might still have seen the hosts safely home, only for final-quarter tries from Matt Scott and Henry Purdy, both converted by Greig Laidlaw, to drag Gloucester level at a stadium where they had not won since 2010.</p> <p>Gloucester\u2019s modest record on Worcester turf had little bearing on this occasion. This was the first league game on the Warriors\u2019 new artificial pitch, a stretch of green sufficiently flat and manicured to put the cricket square at New Road to shame. The downside was a stadium so dimly lit it resembled an old-school training night on a remote third-team back pitch. When the electronic scoreboard also gave up the ghost it really did feel as if a nearby meter needed feeding. The digital advertising hoardings were comfortably the most luminous thing in the ground, which might have been the subtle intention all along.</p> <p>What the Warriors badly needed after their sizeable opening weekend defeat to Saracens was a brighter performance on the field. Gloucester looked the sharper initially, Charlie Sharples having a possible try ruled out for not releasing in a tackle just short of the line, but Worcester gradually slowed the game down to a more manageable pace and began to exert some territorial control.</p> <p>It paid dividends when scrum-half Jonny Arr nipped in behind the defensive line to create a chance out wide gratefully taken by the powerful England squad centre, Te\u2019o. With 31 minutes gone and advantage being played an increasingly confident Worcester scored again, Vuna finishing strongly in the corner despite suspicions of a forward pass in the buildup. Gloucester\u2019s night took another turn for the worse when their barnstorming Welsh back-rower Ross Moriarty was knocked cold and had to be replaced. Losing to Leicester having led 31-7 was clearly a bitter disappointment and basic handling errors compounded their frustration in front of the watching England head coach Eddie Jones.</p> <p>When their passing clicks they have a backline with enviable pace and elusiveness but the maddening inconsistency that has dogged them for years shows little sign of disappearing. A good angled penalty from Ryan Lamb, to add to his earlier conversion, extended the Warriors\u2019 half-time advantage to nine points and left the visitors with a Malvern-sized hill to climb.</p> <p>Laidlaw did claw three points back immediately after the break but, despite a concussed Te\u2019o failing to reappear, Worcester did not appear initially flustered. Any sense of complacency, however, disappeared with Fa\u2019osiliva, who will consider himself a touch unfortunate to have been red-carded for simply carrying the ball into contact.</p> <p>Worcester\u2019s tight forwards did their best to take no notice, making a mess of Gloucester\u2019s scrum on a couple of occasions. Lamb will rue a penalty attempt that bounced away off a post but the athletic Humphreys will long remember his try in the left corner, shrugging off three tacklers en route. Gloucester, though, hit back at the start of the final quarter with a smart try from Scott from Mark Atkinson\u2019s inside ball before conceding a stupid penalty for offside.

  "<p>With so many passions aroused in Europe by the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">refugee crisis</a>, rising populism, fear of terrorism, not to mention confused debates over secularism and burkinis, exploring what European Muslims think has arguably never been more important. One interesting figure is the grand mufti of Slovenia who I met at a recent conference in Austria, held by the International Peace Institute. Slovenia is a predominantly Catholic country of two million people \u2013 among them, an estimated 50,000 Muslims. The country\u2019s first mosque is currently under construction in the capital, Ljubljana. Building it required the overcoming of many political and administrative hurdles \u2013 these were eventually cleared when Slovenia\u2019s constitutional court ruled that denying a minority the right to a place of worship ran counter to religious freedoms. Unsurprisingly, Grand Mufti Nezad Grabus thinks these are difficult times for Muslims in Europe. They constantly have to fend off suspicions of links with radical Islamism or terrorism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/muslim-woman-kicked-off-american-airlines-flight-islamophobia\">I didn't realize how often Muslims get kicked off planes, until it happened to me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grabus is a quiet, smiling man in his late 40s. If there is one thing he wants to stress, it is that \u201cIslam is part of European civilisation\u201d. Islam is by no means a new religion in Europe, \u201cbut it has new manifestations\u201d, he says. He was shocked by this summer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">burkini ban</a> in some French seaside resorts, and he\u2019s bluntly opposed to any legislation outlawing the niqab. But he also says the niqab is something European Muslims must work to counter, because it prevents Muslim women from finding a rightful place in society. Grabus was born in the Bosnian town of Travnik (his father later moved the family to Slovenia where he\u2019d found work, when it was part of communist Yugoslavia). He is a Balkan Muslim. Islam certainly isn\u2019t new in the Balkans, a region that was dominated for centuries by the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>Just as Europe is a patchwork of cultures and nations, Europe\u2019s Muslim populations are extremely diverse, as is their history. This may sound obvious, but it\u2019s something that gets easily pushed aside in all the heated debates about Islam, migration and identity politics. Muslims tend to get lumped together as a single entity. \u201cIn Europe, we Muslims have to acknowledge that we have no common narrative,\u201d says the mufti, \u201cthere are many differences.\u201d For example, he points to how ethnic characteristics play a more important role than many observers realise. Muslims can relate as much to their ethnic or national roots (Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Kurdish, Algerian, Pakistani etc) as they do to their religious beliefs. Religious revival, as in any faith, doesn\u2019t mean you sweep away other parts of your identity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many people know that the first mosque in France was built by the French secular republic (in Paris, in the 1920s)?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that\u2019s not to say there can\u2019t be a \u201ccommon narrative\u201d, and Grabus is adamant that: \u201cAs Muslims in Europe, our duty is to create one, in which we would expose our understanding of Islam belonging here.\u201d Much of this, he points out, has to do with education and overcoming ignorance, both among Muslims and non-Muslims. How many people, he asks, know that Austro-Hungary, under the Habsburgs, recognised Islam as an official religion as long ago as 1912? How many know that the first mosque in France was built by the secular French republic (in Paris, in the 1920s) as a tribute to the tens of thousands of Muslims who died in the first world war? And how many people are ready to consider that the medieval scholar Averroes, born in C\u00f3rdoba when Andaluc\u00eda was ruled by the Arabs, was a European Muslim?</p> <p>With all the current obsessing over terrorism and radicalisation, it\u2019s easy to forget about Europe\u2019s variety, and the diversity of its Muslim populations. Days after talking with Grabus, I was in Cologne, meeting representatives of the Turkish-Islamic Union for religious affairs (as part of a study group on Germany and the refugee crisis, organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation). The central mosque in Cologne is a beautiful, modern building with concrete and glass walls, and an Ottoman-styled dome. It is still under construction, and it stands as proof of some of the societal changes now under way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/526q4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701651\"            data-video-name=\"Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d17b30e4b013613fffb500\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908hollande_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908hollande.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908hollande_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/08/francois-hollande-islam-can-co-exist-with-a-french-secular-state-video\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Islam can co-exist with a French secular state</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A million Muslims live in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia \u2013 a third of Germany\u2019s three-million-strong Turkish community.

That disappeared in the 1960s, as did the habit of including it at the end of the day\u2019s BBC Television transmissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/09/broncos-brandon-marshall-knee-anthem-nfl\">Broncos' Marshall refuses to stand for anthem: 'I'm against social injustice'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing anthems for winners in international competitions \u2013 at the Olympic Games, for example, or at Formula One grands prix \u2013 seems relatively harmless, although the major tournaments in golf and tennis manage quite well without them. Too often it seems a part of the process of creating a closer identification between sport and the military. Where the Ryder Cup\u2019s US organising committee co-opt their fighter pilots, the RFU has soldiers recently returned from foreign wars marching in to raise the flags at Twickenham.</p> <p>But perhaps it is worth supporting the retention of anthems at sporting and other events simply in order to provide a platform for non-violent protest. As Obama suggested, Kaepernick\u2019s gesture in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign was in the tradition of the black power salutes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\" title=\"\">made by Tommie Smith and John Carlos</a> on the Olympic podium in Mexico City in 1968, supported by the man who finished between them in the 200m final, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/oct/05/guardianobituaries.australia\" title=\"\">Peter Norman of Australia</a>.</p> <p>In the nature of things, such protests are bound to come mostly from one side of the political spectrum. No Ukipper or member of France\u2019s Front National, after all, is likely to disrupt God Save the Queen or the Marseillaise. Just as in three weeks\u2019 time no golfer wearing the US team blazer, a representative of one of the most privileged and self-protective castes on the planet, is going to turn his back on those roaring F-18s.</p>",
  "<p>Juan Gabriel, who has died of a heart attack aged 66, was a hugely successful Mexican pop star, with a remarkable rags-to-riches story that saw him become a hero across the Spanish-speaking world. A flamboyant performer and versatile songwriter, he was best known for his emotional ballads and often pained lyrics, though he also covered a variety of distinctively Mexican styles, from mariachi to ranchera and banda.</p> <p>Gabriel never bothered to court English-speaking fans or followers of world music, simply because he had such a vast Latin following. But his final recording showed that he could have appealed to a wider audience. His Spanish-language treatment of the Creedence Clearwater Revival hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqnfoRXKgLs\" title=\"\">Have You Ever Seen the Rain?</a> appeared on the compilation album Quiero Creedence, released in July. It provided a reminder that he could have been an impressive rock performer, had he wished.</p> <p>Two days before his death, he gave what was to be his final concert, in Inglewood, Los Angeles, during his MeXXico Es Todo (Mexico is everything) tour of the US. He was dressed, as ever, in extravagant stage clothes \u2013 he favoured sequin-covered outfits in bright colours \u2013 and backed by a well-drilled full mariachi band in large hats, playing guitars and brass, and by an orchestra. His show included many of his best-known songs, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsfNW4zlwI\" title=\"\">Querida</a> (Beloved), a slow, weepy ballad of lost love, which was a big hit in 1984, and other grand, tragic songs.</p> <p>The youngest of 10 siblings, he was born Alberto Aguilera Valadez to Gabriel Aguilera Rodr\u00edguez and Victoria Valadez Ojas, poor farm workers who lived in Par\u00e1cuaro, to the west of Mexico City. After his father was taken to a psychiatric hospital, his mother moved to the border town of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to work as a maid. But she could not afford to care for her children, so at the age of four Alberto was placed in an orphanage, where he remained for eight years, seeing his mother only once a year.</p> <p>By the age of 14 he was selling food and trinkets in the street, but at the same time he started writing songs. He sang in local bars, and later travelled to Mexico City to try to break into the music business. There were times when he slept rough, and he was jailed for 18 months for stealing a guitar \u2013 a theft he insisted he did not commit.</p> <p>He continued to sing and to write songs, and in 1971, when he was 21, his fortunes changed. He signed a recording contract and, under his new stage name, Juan Gabriel, notched up his first big hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn2Xy2cbcWA\" title=\"\">No Tengo Dinero</a> (I Don\u2019t Have Any Money), which appeared on his first album, El Alma Joven. It marked him out as different from other singers. Rather than bragging, he was expressing the problems of many ordinary Mexicans. He went on to record more than 60 albums, selling more than 100m worldwide, including Recuerdos, Vol II, which sold 8m copies and included Querida. Another of his emotional songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKqxLAhRKE\" title=\"\">Amor Eterno</a> (Eternal Love), was a lament for his mother, who died in 1974, and was often played at funerals. He made his debut as an actor in the 1975 film Nobleza Ranchera.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s popularity continued for more than four decades, both because his often highly emotional songs appealed to Mexicans of all classes and regions and because he was a larger than life, hard-working live performer \u2013 an increasingly important skill in an era when record sales have declined but major artists can earn a fortune from stadium shows. His live shows included a 1990 appearance at the Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico City, which had previously staged only classical concerts. The event was recorded and led to yet another bestselling live album. In the US he performed at leading venues including Madison Square Garden, New York.</p> <p>Gabriel was ranked at No 18 on Billboard\u2019s 2015 Money Makers list, reportedly earning $11.6m from touring that year. He never forgot his painful childhood, and founded an orphanage in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and gave benefit concerts to aid children\u2019s homes across Mexico.</p> <p>Gabriel is survived by the four children, Ivan, Jean, Hans and Joan, he had with Laura Salas.</p> <p>\u2022 Juan Gabriel (Alberto Aguilera Valadez), singer and songwriter, born 7 January 1950; died 28 August 2016</p>",

They are not just arguing with a puny little union any more \u2013 we have the law on our side now.\u201d</p> <p>It was on 11 March that the New Zealand government unanimously passed legislation banning zero-hours contracts across the nation of 4.5 million people. </p> <p>\u201cThis is an incredible victory and I am still shocked by it to be honest,\u201d said Unite\u2019s0 national director, Mike Treen, when the law was passed. \u201cThe fact that the ban was unanimously supported in parliament is pretty unbelievable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/16/zero-hours-banned-new-zealand-unite-union-mcdonalds-sports-direct-hermens-deliveroo\">Yes, zero hours work can be banned: New Zealand has just done it | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Treen estimates hundreds of thousands of Kiwis were employed on zero-hours contracts, which demanded availability for seven days a week with no guaranteed hours. As in the UK, the contracts were especially insidious in the fast-food, cinema, hotel and casino industries. They included big names such as McDonald\u2019s, Pizza Hut and the hamburger chain Wendy\u2019s.</p> <p>From 1 April it became illegal for any new workers employed to be offered zero-hours contracts and any current workers must be offered compliant employment terms by 1 April 2017.</p> <p>Unite members have since been run busy negotiating new employment contracts for their members \u2013 and travelling internationally to share their success story with other unions. </p> <p>The new legislation stipulates that workers must be offered a fixed, minimum number of hours each week, and will not be penalised for refusing any extra work they are offered at short notice. </p> <p>\u201cWe have been pretty in demand, everyone wants the nitty-gritty details of how we pulled it off,\u201d said Joe Carolan, a senior organiser for Unite.</p> <p>\u201cInternationally, activists think the speed of the victory was startling. But we\u2019ve been campaigning since 2005. We\u2019ve had long drawn-out scraps. Endless fights.\u201d </p> <p>This week the union has been celebrating the conclusion of a significant and lengthy negotiation with Restaurant Brands New Zealand (which includes the KFC, Starbucks and Pizza Hut franchises) agreeing to move its 4,000 zero-hours employees on to fixed-hour contracts. The company will now guarantee workers a minimum number of hours each week, and \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for any time they are expected to be available. </p> <p>Intense negotiations are also continuing with Burger King and Wendy\u2019s, said Carolan. But one fast-food chain is continuing to dig its heels in: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s are tough,\u201d said Carolan. </p> <p>Hehir said the zero-hours contracts demanding 24/7 availability from employees were evidence of poor management \u2013 and using modern technology most companies had been able to accurately pinpoint the busiest times, when extra workers may be needed, to a 10-hour window each week. </p> <p>The introduction of minimum fixed hours had also taken away any tools some managers use to discriminate against workers on a personal basis \u2013 and reward or punish them with more or less hours arbitrarily. </p> <p>\u201cIf you forget to smile at your boss on their birthday, that\u2019s no longer something they can punish you for by withholding shifts,\u201d said Hehir. \u201cWorkers have more stability, more confidence they will not be punished for personal slights \u2013 real or imagined.\u201d</p> <p>Shirley Wang, who is employed at Sky City Casino in Auckland on a fixed-hour contract and is an active Unite member, says the next hurdle is to move workers to banded employment contracts \u2013 in which the average hours they work are measured over a year, and the employee is then offered that many hours on a regular basis. Unite is also making moves towards unionising and defending migrant workers in New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cThe legislation was a massive win,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t still huge challenges ahead of us. Before, no-one wanted to talk to us, we were dismissed. Now, businesses are finally realising that a lot of what we\u2019re saying is actually common sense. That a more insecure, higher turnover of staff was actually costing them money. A loyal workforce is something every employer should strive for, because in the end it is always good for business. And that is our strongest argument.\u201d</p> <p>Carolan says what pushed the New Zealand ban on zero-hours contracts over the line was the swift, bipartisan support that became united by a common outrage: that Kiwi workers could not be guaranteed earning a living.</p> <p>\u201cWhat really ignited the campaign was when it became single-issue, and when we called it \u2018zero hours\u2019. The terms before that \u2013 underemployed, flexible hours \u2013 nothing resonated, But zero hours hit home. It\u2019s not just about persuading and mobilising the workers \u2013 you\u2019ve got to get everyone to see common sense. When we did, we were unstoppable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>West Suffolk hospital chose dementia as its annual fundraising campaign in 2014; the My WiSH charity\u2019s Forget-Me-Not campaign set out to raise \u00a325,000 to fund a memory walk within the hospital, but thanks to a fantastic community response we have raised over \u00a395,000.</p> <p>The Forget-Me-Not Walk is now complete and runs along a 100m stretch of previously uninspiring hospital corridors. The aim of the memory walk is to distract patients, to trigger memories and to help orientate patients to where they can feel safe and confident. The images on the corridor reflect a theme of \u201cthrough the ages\u201d running from the 1950s to the 1980s depicting national events \u2013 cultural, sporting and entertainment \u2013 as well as local community images of the towns and villages that West Suffolk hospital serves.</p> <p>We set up a working party to plan the concept of the walk and to agree on the types of images we wanted to use. Ian Donaghy allowed us to use images from his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dear-Dementia-Laughter-Ian-Donaghy/dp/1874790868\" title=\"\"><em>Dear Dementia</em></a>, which help to get the message across to staff and visitors to see the person and not focus on their dementia.</p> <p>Our local papers, the <em>East Anglian Daily Times</em> and the <em>Mercury,</em> supported the campaign by having a weekly dementia related story which kept the profile of the work we are doing in West Suffolk Hospital in the public eye. The campaign has reduced stigma and raised awareness about dementia both within the hospital and the local community.</p> <p>Reminiscing about the past can have benefits for all of us, but for people who have dementia it is a way to help them to talk about things that they do remember. Snippets of conversation overheard range from discussions about the blackout in the 1970s to favourite Queen songs inspired by the picture of Freddie Mercury, to looking for familiar faces in local pictures.</p> <p>A linen cupboard has been disguised behind a picture of Sainsbury\u2019s from the 1970s advertising chickens for 64p per lb and ice cream for 36p. On the opposite wall is the old bus station. Neither building is still in the town centre.</p> <p>From being a dull corridor at the back of the hospital the Forget-Me-Not Walk has now transformed the area into a local talking point, where you can see patients, visitors and staff in conversations inspired by the images on the walls.</p>",

  "<p>One of my best friends has a penchant for canned sweetcorn: when no one is looking, she sneaks to the fridge, spoon in hand, to gobble up the odd mouthful. As guilty pleasures go, that\u2019s a fairly innocent one (mine are far worse), but I still cannot fathom it: the very smell of canned sweetcorn makes me shudder, and is to blame for putting me off corn for several decades. That all changed when I began to travel, especially in Mexico, where savoury, multi-coloured corn is the stuff of legend \u2013 packed with essential vitamins and minerals, it\u2019s practically a superfood \u2013 and I found that I loved the stuff (so long as it had never come into contact with a tin).</p> <p>Corn is grown worldwide, and its sweet flavour is just made for spices and heat, ideal for me. And while cooking so much of it in Mexico, I discovered that frozen sweetcorn is almost (but not quite) as good as fresh. As with broad beans and peas, freezing arrests the aging process and stops the sugars turning into starch. This leaves lovely sweet kernels with none of the flavour that the canning process produces \u2013 unless, of course, that is your guilty pleasure, too.</p> <h2><strong>Indian spiced sweetcorn fritters with ginger yoghurt</strong></h2> <p>Use plain flour if you can\u2019t get gram (chickpea). Incidentally, you can also deep-fry small spoonfuls of this batter, which is perhaps a little less healthy although absurdly good. Serves four to six, as a first course.</p> <p><strong>3 corn cobs (or 500g frozen kernels)</strong><br><strong>150g gram (or plain) flour </strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp baking powder </strong><br><strong>1 tsp garam masala </strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp mixed spice </strong><br><strong>1 tsp turmeric </strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp paprika </strong><br><strong>3 free-range eggs, separated</strong><br><strong>140ml milk</strong><br><strong>2 spring onions, chopped </strong><br><strong>\u00bd-1 red chilli, finely chopped, according to taste</strong><br><strong>2 limes, zested and juiced</strong><br><strong>1 big handful chopped coriander leaves</strong><br><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>15g butter </strong><br><strong>1-2 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> <p>For the yoghurt<br><strong>100g greek yoghurt </strong><br><strong>1 tsp nigella seeds </strong><br><strong>1 lime, zested and juiced</strong><br><strong>1 tsp grated ginger </strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Hold the corn upright and, using a sharp knife, carefully shave off the kernels (do this inside a large, wide bowl, so it catches all the flying kernels). Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl, add the spices and make a well in the centre. Put the egg yolks and half the milk in the well, beat the mixture until smooth, then slowly whisk in the rest of the milk. Fold in the corn, onions, chilli, lime juice and zest, and coriander. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, gently fold them into the batter and season.</p> <p>Heat a heavy-based frying pan on a medium high heat and add a small knob of butter and a dribble of oil. Drop two heaped tablespoons of batter into the pan and fry on medium heat for three minutes a side, until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to the oven while you repeat with the rest of the batter.</p> <p>Mix all the yoghurt ingredients, then season. Serve the fritters with the yoghurt on the side; a simple salad of coriander leaves, baby gem and finely chopped spring onions wouldn\u2019t go amiss, either.</p> <h2><strong>Quail and spicy warm corn salad </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb96d0f7c7af395692a15f86a19ddc552a7fd2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb96d0f7c7af395692a15f86a19ddc552a7fd2c/0_92_1881_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 quail and spicy warm corn salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 quail and spicy warm corn salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

One of my favourite way of cooking whole cobs is to barbecue them and then douse them in a mix of butter, chipotle mayonnaise, feta and fresh lime; harissa butter, feta and chopped coriander is another good combo. The corn salad makes a delicious lunch \u2013 I like it sprinkled with feta, lancashire or pecorino cheese and stuffed into a warm pitta bread.</p>",

The trip up to the Stonewall lookout in Montana is, as you\u2019d expect, gorgeous. But also stark. A big fire scorched the forest in 2003 and it\u2019s still recovering. One dilemma with this story was using the term \u201cfreaks\u201d. Lookouts use the term themselves as an insider, jokey term but in print it could seem harsh and mocking. Judging by the near universally positive reactions of readers \u2013 everyone seems to want to do this job \u2013 I think the article makes clear lookouts have an important and special role.</p> <p><em>What articles did you enjoy this week?

Labour's dead. And it wont take a long time before the tories realise that the same thing is going to happen to them. The party's been captured by the hard right-wing and, at some point, the centrists will become a complete irrelevance.</p> <p>What we may see is a fragmentation, even atomisation, of mainstream political parties. In both the case of Labour and the Tories, the parties are increasingly becoming representative of narrow interest of core members. Tory members have always been very euro-sceptic and held a strong anti-immigration line. The brexit vote has legitimised those views and those euro-sceptic MPs who were once on the fringes and largely dismissed by their peers are now the ones calling the shots. The narrow victory by the Leave campaign has given them the confidence to push forward policies and ideas that are hugely divisive in the mistaken belief that these policies are supporters by a broad church. The way in which the Tory party has framed the Brexit vote as an almost exclusively anti-immigration vote and have pushed for grammar schools (despite the fact it was not in their manifesto) are good examples of this phenomenon. With Labour, you have a so-called social movement which <i>demands</i> that <i>all</i> MPS reflect the views of the majority of the membership, instead of looking to reflect the wide spectrum of interest and views of Labour voters. Just like the Tories they believe that this narrow movement holds great support across the UK. If only the media would give them a fair shot. If only the MPs would support the leader. If, if ...</p> <p>There is of course no need to have parties that act as broad and inclusive churches. There's nothing wrong with having parties that represent very specific and narrow interest. But if the political system is dominated by such parties then you need a system of proportional representation. And we wont get that until the Tories realise its in their interests to have one.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904934\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:17pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>It's not quite that Labour's dead, which is why I talk about the end of the Labour Party <b>as we know it</b>.

The Paralympics does to much to educate society about disability and imparts a really positive message, but it also leads people to be more dismissive of real physical and mental conditions that are real and do need to be taken into account. The DLA or PIP is essential for some disabled people who need extra help. Disability already saps one's confidence because you effectively cannot trust your body, or indeed other's reactions. I have been made fun of for having no hair- having no eyelashes and eyebrows makes one look strange but also abused simply for having to stop walking suddenly because I felt my legs give way and someone pushed me aside. The Job Centres need to stop bullying disabled people into work they simply cannot do or can only do on a good day, by alluding to the Olympics and &quot;can do&quot; attitude.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>What do you think? <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:30:58.586Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d2a7c6e4b013613fffb9a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T12:19:16.249Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More thoughts on the left from below the line:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4019864\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for PSmd\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4019864\" title=\"View PSmd\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">PSmd</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904377\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:10pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The left will always have a future. Especially in a country where inequality is becoming less popular.</p> <p>However, what does this mean for Labour party? The Labour party was the party of progress of the 20th century. Great party. But ultimately, undone by the breakdown in 1970's. Wilson's voters. don;t forget, remembered the depression and world war 2. Today's baby boomers have no memory of those things, just the 1970's and 1980's. Left boomers remember 1980's as unemployment, pit closures, factory closures. The right boomers remember the property ownership, share ownership, white collar jobs. And they were in the majority. Neoliberalism, polarised, because it widened wealth gaps, and as a result, many areas became more left wing (merseyside, glasgow etc). But they were minority by geography. Most Brits liked neoliberalism and did well out of it.</p> <p>Right wing baby boomers have such bad memories of the 1970's, that they'll insist on the economics that took us to the 1930's.<br />Where does this leave the labour party? Divided by geography. The party became a monopolist on left politics, and like monopolistic corporations who become bad for capitalism, the Labour party at it's electoral height, 1997-2010 became bad for socialism. The future may lie with Greens, or it may lie with various community action groups. The electoral and economic geography of this country is too difficult to consolidate for labour. In effect, they have pander to and to win the votes of, people who don't give two shits about low wage workers and renters, while holding onto the votes of people who do. Can;t be done anymore, I'm afraid.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>And a response ... <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/1864914\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JHarris\"> </a>  <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1864914\" title=\"View JHarris\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JHarris</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82904646\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:14pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Pretty good, that.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Some of you have been talking about <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-crushed-sheffield-election-just-8796901\">a council by-election in Sheffield yesterday</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/16499314\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Roel1963\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16499314\" title=\"View Roel1963\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Roel1963</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/82903636\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">09 September 2016 1:01pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The Mosborough (Sheffield) Byelection result, where a Labour safe seat was lost, must come as a wake-up call for all who wish Labour to thrive.</p> <p>Losing Labour candidate was Julie Grocutt from Stocksbridge, an anti-Corbyn, pro-Smith groopie, who previously also put her 2 cents in regarding the Brick-through-&quot;Eagle's&quot;-window incident.</p> <p>Clearly, reality has just gobsmacked the claim by the rebel PLP and their right-wing handlers, that they and only they are &quot;electable&quot;, whilst Corbyn is not.<br />Put simply: in the UK there's two simultaneous political bottom-up revolutions going on.

Is Labour dead? What would a new party look like? Here is his response.</em><br></p> <p>The most basic point that arises from what my piece says is that the revival of the political left, here and across the world, is probably going to be a long haul. The break-up between social democracy and the new radical left (e.g Podemos in Spain, elements of Syriza in Greece, many of the forces behind the Bernie Sanders campaign) has only just happened. Debate and thought about how much economies have changed and what the left should do about it is still in the foothills. <br></p> <p>If you want a sense of what a long political haul looks like, start with the historian <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1045411/the-road-to-1945/\">Paul Addison\u2019s book</a> The Road To 1945. My stock example of what it deals with is that campaigning for universal Child Benefit began in 1917, and it arrived nearly 30 years later. The same will apply to a Universal Basic Income (or UBI), which I think has to be the core of any new left politics \u2013 given that it addresses insecurity rooted in technology, and holds out the prospect of automation being a liberating rather than a destructive force. Ditto the fight for Proportional Representation. This isn\u2019t to say that elections in the meantime aren\u2019t worth fighting, but that the left should be thinking strategically, and understanding what an onerous task it faces.</p> <p>As to which political forces will be involved as this goes on \u2013 who knows? Personally, I have a sense that the Labour party as we know it is probably finished. The current battle over its control will be one chapter in a series of ruptures: over time, you\u2019ll probably see elements now seen to be hostile to each other coming together, and others falling away (for flavour of this, look at some former New Labour insiders and supporters who support UBI and PR, or the people working creditably hard for Jeremy Corbyn whose politics are a bit more forward-looking and radical than his). There will also be lots of people involved from beyond Labour, which is why I think one of the most interesting initiatives right now is the <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/the-urgent-need-for-a-progressive-alliance/\">Progressive Alliance idea</a> being pursued by Compass, which involves Labour people, Greens, Lib Dems, people from the SNP etc etc.</p> <p>This is a time when politics is changing in front of our eyes, and uncertainty rules. My own belief is that the values of equality, solidarity and a world beyond the market will endure. But what form they will take is still to become clear.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:27:57.020Z\">at 12.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d243ebe4b07ac3d446a696\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/johnharris\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-09T11:23:25.718Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Does the left have a future?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Below John Harris comments on the biggest questions that came to mind when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/does-the-left-have-a-future\">writing his long-read on whether the left has a future</a>.</em></p> <p>One of the biggest themes in the piece was about the changing nature of work, the roots of that change in technology, and the idea that in a world of temporary employment and the gig economy, work can\u2019t be the main way we give people security and stability.

But there is also something of the alchemist to Matthews \u2013 his stream-of-consciousness texts, his lyrical way of speaking and his frankly eccentric work practice. \u201cBig grey seals often pop up,\u201d says Matthews, who has been working for years around the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall, wild-camping on the cliffs near Coverack. \u201cWhen I\u2019m exhausted and lie on the rocks to try and generate a bit of heat, the seals come up really close. Those unexpected things in nature are fascinating.\u201d</p> <p>It would be wrong to describe Matthews as a nature artist. Although his work is literally soaked in seawater and scattered with the imprint of small shellfish, he is far more interested in exploring the fluid midpoint between sea and land, thought and form. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a period of time in the early morning and again at twilight that\u2019s beyond words,\u201d he says, his soft Derbyshire vowels still just about detectable. \u201cThat\u2019s when the scrawlings ignite. It\u2019s almost caveman-like. Approaching the ocean is quite mysterious in itself: seeing it, and that visceral experience of listening to it, smelling it, touching it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f493d655fee92fdf55bf0649116dbb3ef593823\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f493d655fee92fdf55bf0649116dbb3ef593823/0_0_3600_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"5 Hours In and With the Atlantic Ocean #2 (England)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">5 Hours In and With the Atlantic Ocean #2 (England)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Matthews/Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, there are practical obstacles to working in the sea. As well as numb hands, the odd fall into a rockpool and concerned dogwalkers peering out at him on the horizon, Matthews has to contend with the unpredictability of waves. \u201cThere\u2019s a romantic side to me that\u2019s drawn to the wild, breaking white. But I\u2019ve also lost quite a lot of drawings that way,\u201d he tells me, as I try to picture this floating male selkie pulling pencils out of his sleeve like a magician. \u201cThe waves crash over, it tears off the board, and ebbs away into the abyss.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his works dance along the border of the brilliant and the ridiculous. For the piece With the Forces of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Matthews rigged up a CD player on a floating tripod, then spent days bobbing about in the Atlantic, listening to a recording of the Pacific, trying to capture the watery confusion between the two. For A Mystical Exchange of Energies he sprayed nine litres of Pacific ocean, collected during typhoon Nanmodal in August 2011, into the Atlantic using a fire extinguisher \u2013 transferring one ocean into the other. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf7f356a1b893fa440653e3f80a1b39c10be29ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf7f356a1b893fa440653e3f80a1b39c10be29ba/0_0_800_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Working flat out \u2026 Matthews with his paintings.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working flat out \u2026 Matthews with his paintings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Matthews</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be easy to laugh, to dismiss Matthew\u2019s whole creative practice as the wishy-washy silliness of an oceanstruck romantic.

Perhaps it is dangerous. Or perhaps floating in the ocean with a huge sea-soaked sheet of paper is as close as Matthews can get to what Keats called tracing with the magic hand of chance. \u201cI love how the sea writes itself,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cI\u2019m just following the ocean, really.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.wirksworthfestival.co.uk/events/nature-here-and-now\">Nature, Here and Now</a> is at St Mary\u2019s Church, Wirksworth, Derbyshire on 11-12 and 17-18 September, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.wirksworthfestival.co.uk/\">Wirksworth festival</a>, until 25 September.

The world can\u2019t afford that approach.\u201d</p> <p>The reason why Sri Lanka\u2019s success is so symbolic is because we have been here before. In 1955, the UN committed to ending the scourge of malaria. It was optimistic because it thought there were effective tools. The pesticide DDT had been found to kill the mosquitoes that were spreading the disease in US army camps in the Pacific during the second world war. Widespread use of DDT and the drug chloroquine drove malaria out of many countries in the Americas, Europe and parts of Asia.<br></p> <p>But it all fell apart. There was no real attempt to tackle malaria in sub-Saharan Africa because it was thought to be too difficult. Elsewhere, elimination fell foul of the problem that has bedevilled all malaria control efforts: resistance of the malaria parasite to drugs and of the mosquitoes to pesticides. Then in 1962, Rachel Carson\u2019s blockbuster Silent Spring was published, alerting the world to the environmental devastation wreaked by DDT. The UN\u2019s malaria eradication plan was officially scrapped in 1969.</p> <p>Sri Lanka had been so close. Two million cases a year had dropped to just 17 in 1963. But when control efforts ended, the numbers surged back up and malaria was endemic once more. By 1998, there were more than 250,000 cases a year.</p> <p>\u201cIn the world of malaria, Sri Lanka carries a special weight,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt is often cited as the example of what happened during the first malaria eradication programme. They didn\u2019t complete the job and malaria came back with a vengeance. We need to learn from the past so we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/10/should-we-wipe-mosquitoes-off-the-face-of-the-earth\">Should we wipe mosquitoes off the face of the Earth?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elimination means the end of malaria in a country or region.

But as one country after another succeeded in eliminating malaria, it was possible they would obtain all of those things and be on track to end the disease.</p> <p>Eradication has been achieved in only one disease so far: smallpox. The eradication of polio is so close and yet so far, with small numbers of cases in just a few countries but also a constant sliding back, as seen recently in Nigeria, which had been considered polio-free.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dinitha Rathnayake</em><br></p>",
  "<p>I started ice skating in 1975, when I was four and a half and growing up in Berlin. It was fun in the beginning, but soon after I started school, things got serious, and my childhood took a back seat as my parents pushed me to excel. I trained six to eight hours a day.</p> <p>After two years, I was given \u201cvitamins\u201d by my trainers, all kinds of pills and powders. We had to take them on the ice, in front of everyone. We had not been raised to think critically, so many of us never dared ask what they were. We just thought, this will help me win. I didn\u2019t feel any immediate effects and had no idea they were drugs. I later discovered that East Germany\u2019s communist party had issued a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_East_Germany\">\u201csecret directive\u201d in 1974</a>, declaring that all team sports would be subject to doping. Unsurprisingly, East Germany managed to win 572 medals at the winter and summer Olympics in its 41 years in existence.</p> <p>When I was 16, I went to see one of the sports officials to tell him I wanted to quit: I wanted to live a normal life. He became angry and called me a \u201ctraitor to the fatherland\u201d. That broke me: that\u2019s one of the worst things you could call someone in a dictatorship. I started crying profusely, but he didn\u2019t care. He said, \u201cYou will go right back out there and continue training\u201d, which I did.</p> <p>I skated competitively until I was 17. I was crowned East German champion twice and came third in the 1987 European Figure Skating Championships in Sarajevo, but I can\u2019t bring myself to be proud of my achievements. Injury forced me to stop: after 14 years of professional sport, I had had two knee operations and my back was badly damaged.</p> <p>In 1997, I got a letter from the state police in Thuringia, revealing that I had been part of a nationwide forced doping programme. I was shocked and couldn\u2019t believe there had been such an abuse of power. Four years later, when I was 30 and working at a magazine, I began to show symptoms of a psychotic breakdown, which eventually cost me my job. It manifested in sensitivity to sounds: I felt as if the trains passing by were racing right through me. Then came paranoia: I was suspicious of people all the time. I started to imagine that the former <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stasi\">secret police</a>, and then the Nazis, were stalking me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/15/my-cat-saved-me-from-fire-experience\">Experience: my cat saved me from a fire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I saw a psychiatrist, who eventually convinced me I needed medication. The doctors gave me psychotropic drugs to pull me out of it, and told me that my episode was the direct result of a steroid, Oral-Turinabol, I had been given as a professional skater. I felt betrayed.</p> <p>My chronic illness was a constant reminder. Between 2001 and 2006, I was unable to work because of my repeated psychotic episodes. I broke off all contact with my former trainers and team-mates, and eventually sought counselling, which really helped. I am still on medication and have been stable since 2006. I now work at an NGO that offers counselling to survivors of forced doping. While undeniable links to side-effects have been hard to prove, many of our clients come to us with liver and heart damage. Some have tumours; 70% have psychological problems; among women, there is a lot of breast cancer and infertility.</p> <p>In 2000, the state brought charges against <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/738098.stm\">Dr Manfred H\u00f6ppner and Manfred Ewald</a>, leaders in the East German sports fraternity. They were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/29/guardianobituaries.sport\">10,000 sports people affected by doping</a>, and were given a suspended sentence. They should have gone to prison. The state gave those who were worst affected (194 people) a one-off compensation of \u00a410,500 each. I was one of them. Most of us spent it on our continuing medical expenses; others took their first holiday in a long time. Although the money was nice to have, what was more important was the acknowledgment of the injustice done to us. East Germany\u2019s nationwide doping was a crime.</p> <p>Now, at 45, I can see that it didn\u2019t only rob us of our childhoods, it also caused terrible harm to our health. Even watching this year\u2019s Olympics, I realise that we as a society haven\u2019t learned anything.

Yet he reconciles all these contradictions with a philosophical clarity that, though highly maverick, is surprisingly coherent.</p> <p>He is in excellent spirits when we meet in parliament this week. The froideur I once observed towards that other defector, George Galloway, is strikingly absent; fellow MPs, among them his former colleagues in the Conservative party, offer warm smiles and greetings as we queue in the Portcullis House coffee shop. On TV, Carswell tends to have a ramrod sergeant majorish air about him, but in person, he is much more relaxed. Even as his party prepares for a leadership election this week that has laid bare its essential amateurism, the 45-year-old says he has never been happier than since 23 June. His cheerful verdict on this week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/05/david-davis-vows-to-build-national-consensus-on-brexit\">Commons statement from David Davis</a>, the minister for Brexit, is: \u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p> <p>Were Carswell in charge, I ask, what would his version of Brexit look like? \u201cWell, unless you want to become like North Korea, labour mobility is going to happen.\u201d He neither expects nor wants Brexit to reduce immigration, and thinks that within 40 years, the current level of labour mobility in London will be UK-wide. But in Carswell\u2019s ideal Brexit model, the public would be content, \u201cbecause the people, through the ballot box, would have control\u201d. Parliament would vote each year on how many work visas to issue, just as it currently does on how much tax to levy, and the immigrants we decided we wanted \u2013 doctors, bright students, farmworkers \u2013 could all come. \u201cWe\u2019d have a system of migration that people would accept. By advocating an end to the unrestricted freedom of movement, you\u2019re not advocating closing the borders.\u201d</p> <p>A large number of people who voted to leave the EU, I suggest, did so precisely because they thought it <em>did</em> mean closing the borders. He shakes his head firmly. \u201cThe prime reason why people voted to leave the EU was they wanted to take back control. It was not primarily immigration. The reason why there was such a fundamental strategic difference of opinion between the two campaign groups vying to run the leave side is precisely because one side believed, erroneously, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36167329\">that it was all about migration</a>. And, frankly, if that side had been put in charge of running the referendum, we would have lost 60-40.\u201d</p> <p>Many commentators thought it was only when Vote Leave began to scaremonger about immigration towards the latter stages of the campaign that it overtook remain. Carswell looks good humoured, but gives another shake of the head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-woolfe-james-labour-weakness\">No matter who becomes Ukip leader, Labour will be the biggest loser | Matthew Goodwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSince the referendum, some on the remain side have been very quick to say it was a nativist reaction against immigration. Not only is that not true, we knew that that couldn\u2019t win a referendum beforehand. Which is precisely why Vote Leave\u2019s campaign was optimistic, not angry, about immigration. It actually talked positively about immigration \u2013 I heard Boris Johnson and Michael Gove again and again and again emphasising the positives of migration. Let\u2019s not rewrite history. It is grossly unfair to Vote Leave to characterise it as somehow anti-immigration. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that is quite how I remember it, but to characterise the \u201cother side\u201d \u2013 Leave.eu \u2013 as anti-immigration would plainly not be unfair.</p> <p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t the campaign,\u201d points out Carswell, looking faintly bemused. \u201cThey didn\u2019t run the campaign.\u201d He starts to laugh. \u201cYou know, Eddie Izzard campaigned for the remain side. You\u2019re not suggesting to me that I should take what Eddie Izzard said as a reflection of what remain wanted. Let\u2019s not look at our equivalent of the Eddie Izzards on our side and pretend that\u2019s what Vote Leave was campaigning for. The reason why Vote Leave won was precisely because it was the antithesis of those <a href=\"http://\">anti-Syrian migrant posters we saw Nigel unveiling</a> a few days before the referendum. If that way of campaigning had been allowed to define Euroscepticism, we would have lost catastrophically \u2013 and quite rightly and deservedly. I think we won only narrowly precisely because, during the campaign, posters like that did enormous damage.\u201d</p> <p>This would be a perfectly unremarkable opinion if Carswell were still a Tory MP. But he is talking about his own party\u2019s posters. What is he doing in a party that he thinks actively damaged the great political cause of his lifetime? His answer is simple. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t triggered a byelection and joined Ukip, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got the promise of a referendum.\u201d Then isn\u2019t the job done? \u201cFor me personally, to a very large extent, it is.\u201d So why not now leave? He grins. \u201cI\u2019m having far too much fun. I\u2019m just going to carry on. I feel very cheerful, and I\u2019m going to carry on.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m struggling to understand how he can have fun in a party that produced the Breaking Point poster. \u201cOh, I thought it was truly awful. But such was the vitality of Vote Leave that even despite that repellent nativism we still managed to win.\u201d Before defecting to Ukip in 2014, Carswell explicitly said he \u201cwould never join a party that was racist\u201d. Weren\u2019t Ukip\u2019s posters racist? \u201cThe phrase I use is nativist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76375efd64858a46853cbfe277d36634ea78b8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76375efd64858a46853cbfe277d36634ea78b8f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell canvassing in Clacton-on-Sea in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Carswell canvassing in Clacton-on-Sea in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a rather cunningly convenient distinction \u2013 and even arguably accurate \u2013 but the next thing he says is uncharacteristically specious. \u201cLook at the Labour party: there are some people who\u2019ve said some vile and antisemitic things. Are you suggesting that every Labour MP should leave their party?\u201d But Jeremy Corbyn hasn\u2019t personally unveiled posters saying we can\u2019t cope with any more Jews.</p> <p>The only other time Carswell starts to sound more like a conventional politician comes when I bring up the dramas surrounding Ukip\u2019s leadership election. The leading candidate, Suzanne Evans, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36892561\">forced out of the race</a> after Farage suspended her for mysterious reasons. The second-favourite, Steven Woolfe, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/ukip-leadership-steven-woolfe-excluded-from-ballot\">isn\u2019t on the ballot either</a>, following an equally mysterious failure to apply before the deadline. Woolfe insists he did submit his paperwork on time, prompting speculation that opponents within the party deliberately stalled it on the Ukip computer system. Carswell takes care to confine his comments to bland platitudes \u2013 \u201cI admire all those who are putting their names forward.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask about the party\u2019s future direction, however, he becomes intently animated.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that Ukip, having broken down the consensus on EU membership, now tries to break down other cartels,\u201d by which he means everything from housing associations to monetary policy. \u201cThese cartels all need breaking open. This is rich territory for Ukip. We\u2019re at a key juncture here. Either we become the British equivalent of the Northern League in Italy, we become angry, backward-looking, nativist and we\u2019ll be a rump. Or we say look, there\u2019s this huge opportunity here. The Tory party is weaker than they think they are. The Labour party is in meltdown because of Corbyn. The Lib Dems are on a holiday from history. This is our chance. We offer traditional Labour supporters a very compelling retail proposition.\u201d</p> <p>It is starting to sound more like a manifesto than an answer to a question. \u201cThere\u2019s this assumption among pundits and politicians in Westminster that the only way you appeal to traditional Labour voters is to offer them Fabianism. Thatcher beautifully understood that is not so. She allowed those people to buy their council houses, which meant she created a huge electoral alliance beyond her traditional base.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe equivalent of allowing people to buy their council houses is this: most houses have access to Netflix; they can allow their kids to watch whatever their kids want to watch. But they have zero control over their child\u2019s education. What if you gave mums and dads the legal right to request and receive control over their child\u2019s share of local authority funding? What if you allowed people to control their health budgets? This is potentially a vast area which could have huge traction. People have Netflix; they\u2019re used to the idea of self-commissioning.\u201d</p> <p>Is he sure Ukip is fertile soil in which to propagate these ideas? \u201cWell, it would require a boldness and an originality of thought that I hope is there \u2013 but may not be. It\u2019s precisely because we haven\u2019t developed these ideas that we\u2019re only on 11 or 12 points in the polls. If Ukip has a future, it is in embracing this agenda. And, if it does, it could hoover up a huge share of the market. There is a once-in-a-generational opportunity. You\u2019ve got a huge segment of the electorate that is unrepresented by lazy party cartels that treat their views with contempt, don\u2019t understand their aspirations and talk down to them. The single biggest cartel is the political parties.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if Carswell would like to see parties disappear altogether. \u201cParties are nine-tenths of the problem in our democracy,\u201d he agrees urgently. \u201cParties are the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Does he consider himself, I ask, more an independent than a Ukip MP? \u201cWell, what\u2019s the difference between the Ukip parliamentary party and just me at the moment? I mean, not a great deal!\u201d he hoots. \u201cSo yes, you could see it that way. But I\u2019ve never really felt bound by any party. I didn\u2019t always agree with the Conservative party.

Farage certainly thinks it is a bit rich to harness the support and machinery and funding of his party while disavowing so much of what it says. If Carswell thinks parties are the problem, why not quit and stand as an independent?</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m enjoying myself. I\u2019m having much too much fun.\u201d That makes him sound selfish and hypocritical, I point out. \u201cOK then. Because I\u2019m too excited about the party conference on Saturday.\u201d He laughs teasingly. \u201cNo really,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so looking forward to the party conference.\u201d Come off it, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d He is suddenly serious. \u201cAt some point, a party is going to come along, like the Labour party did in the 1890s, and it\u2019s going to break the cartel. And I would hate to climb off Ukip just before Ukip became the vehicle that did that. Does the political party that breaks the cartel come from the libertarian right \u2013 Ukip? I hope it does. But if we\u2019re not quick \u2013 and the window of opportunity is closing fast \u2013 I suspect it will come actually from a grassroots, non-Corbynista, Tristram Hunt-type left.\u201d</p> <p>And if it does, he says, he will be only too happy to help. Carswell is genuinely happy to help whoever first challenges the current party system orthodoxy. He thinks Labour will split, \u201cwhen the Corbynistas get around to deselecting some of the decent MPs\u201d, and says he would happily share with those MPs his insights from Clacton about winning byelections. \u201cI mean this very seriously. The techniques I learned, I\u2019d be very happy to share those with people on the left who wanted to escape from the tyranny of parties, too.\u201d</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t join a new leftwing movement, he adds hastily. \u201cAnd they obviously wouldn\u2019t want me front of shop.

  "<p>In a refugee camp near the Greek city of Thessaloniki, I treated a Kurdish woman in her early twenties for a throat infection. Before she left, the translator asked her if there was anything else we could help her with. She broke down in tears. She had four children who she was struggling to look after and keep clean. She showed us a photograph of her children, just one year ago, well dressed and smiling. This woman was not only tired and desperate, she was ashamed of her living conditions. The food was bad, toilets revolting and she could not properly look after her family.</p> <p>This refugee crisis is the worst in living memory. The UNHCR currently estimates that <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html\">there are 65.3 million people displaced from their homes by conflict and persecution globally</a>. Many are women and 41% are children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women were deliberately not drinking water so they could avoid a trip to the revolting portable toilets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In times of crisis women bear the brunt. All refugees are marginalised, but the women are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and physical and sexual harm. Many are victims of unimaginable atrocities as they flee their home countries. Pregnant women and those with small children are uniquely vulnerable on the dangerous journey to Europe. Throughout these camps there are widespread reports of gender-based violence.</p> <p>In the camps women are under extraordinary pressure. Many have young families to provide for. Living in small tents they need to look after their children, feed their families, keep them clean and try to retain some normality with dignity.</p> <p>Women are hit hardest by poor access to sanitation and water. Washing clothes for large families in a refugee camp becomes an impossible task. Summertime Greece is hot, in the camp where I worked women felt they could not keep clean and were deliberately not drinking water so they could avoid a trip to the revolting portable toilets; just six for a camp housing 600. They were risking dehydration and kidney and urine infections. One woman cried as she described the shame she felt about having to urinate in a bucket inside a tent that she shared with her large family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19dace4a776585bf06bd54a6ba3e5eb2ecbbad18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19dace4a776585bf06bd54a6ba3e5eb2ecbbad18/0_623_2448_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti at the camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"969\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Small acts of kindness do not solve the problems but they do give some comfort and dignity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asides from the issue of sanitation, the toilet area was poorly lit and women felt afraid and unsafe going there at night, with reports of intimidation and fights.</p> <p>In the rush to respond to the large numbers of refugees arriving, many of the camps have sprung up in previously abandoned warehouses. They were not designed for human habitation. However, provision of clean, well-lit sanitation facilities, which a large number of people can use is not a difficult task and something that could be easily addressed in the camps.</p> <p>Another recurring theme was that women did not want to be intimate with their partners. Many felt pressured into having sexual relations and there were newly pregnant women in the camps. Women have distinct health needs that can easily be overlooked in the response to acute medical needs. Provision of good maternity care and being pragmatic about access to family planning should be prioritised.</p> <p>Many of the women had previously assumed the role of carer in their family, and many were deeply upset by their inability to carry out that role in the camps. The UNHCR emphasises that women must be involved <a href=\"http://www.refworld.org/docid/479f3b2a2.html\">specifically with the management and distribution of resources</a>. There was little evidence of this on the ground in the camps. Unfamiliar and unpalatable food was given out. Many of the women complained that by the time it arrived it was hardly edible. </p> <h2>We need to empower women in the camps</h2> <p>Central to the humanitarian response should be empowering these women who have lost everything. Many of the women felt they weren\u2019t being listened to. Here simple, pragmatic things can make a huge difference; volunteers in one of the camps organised distribution of fresh fruit and vegetables, which were needed to cook traditional meals from back home. Another gave out cooking utensils. Many of the women were delighted by this. Another volunteer gave pillows to each of the tents. These small acts of kindness do not solve the problems but they do give some comfort and dignity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These women see no solution to their problems ... They wait with their children for their lives to start again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the painful reality is that these women see no solution to their problems within reach. They wait with their children for their lives to start again. They are terrified for their children\u2019s future as they have no access to formal education. One said that a prison sentence would be better than being in the camps, because at least then they would know when they would get to leave.</p> <p>The responses of local people in the towns hosting the refugees was mainly one of kindness and compassion. The volunteer response, though at times chaotic, shows some of the large amount of goodwill towards refugees in Europe. The response of some of the European countries to the refugees is shameful, especially the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/02/child-refugees-calais-failed-by-britain\">failure of the UK to provide a safe haven for the many unaccompanied child refugees</a>. </p> <p>The world has been slow in its response to the refugee crisis, but this is an issue that will affect us all for many generations. These women have faced the most appalling conditions with the utmost of resilience and dignity. As the refugee crisis slips down the news agenda and out of the public\u2019s mind, these families are going nowhere. If Lebanon, a country with a population of under 5 million can host 1.5 million refugees, then surely the rest of the world can play its part too. </p> <p><em>Translation by </em><em>Nada Sarsour, Amer Sawaf, Mohamad Abou Ras, Mariam Saleh and Mohamad Namo. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>Immigration officers are investigating after a 20-day-old baby was smuggled into Britain in the back of a lorry.</p> <p>Police discovered the baby girl with her parents and siblings at Watford Gap service station on the M1, after a road worker heard shouts for help coming from the vehicle, the Sun reported.</p> <p>Immigration officers are investigating after 10 people \u2013 including at least three children \u2013 were discovered inside the lorry by Northamptonshire police. A Home Office spokesman said nine of the group were from Iraq, with one person from Iran. They are believed to have entered the country via Calais. </p> <p>Road worker Richard Glover, 24, alerted police after hearing banging from inside the lorry, he told the Sun newspaper. \u201cI could see no food or water in the lorry. It had been a muggy night and it was a warm day, so conditions would have been stifling,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could all have suffocated in there \u2013 including the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe heard banging and shouting from the lorry. The driver was standing looking confused. We could hear a male voice shouting to be let out. He was saying \u2018No air\u2019 in a foreign accent and sounded desperate \u2013 but the driver made it clear he was not opening the cab without the police present.\u201d</p> <p>Police arrived after 20 minutes, he said. The newborn was checked at a local hospital and was said to be healthy. <br></p> <p>Glover said the child\u2019s father explained they had travelled 2,500 miles, and their six-year-old son had died during the journey. He said: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be here but you\u2019d need a heart of stone not to feel sorry for them. It just brought it home how desperate they are to get to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThis incident is of concern and is under investigation. Would-be migrants need to be aware that they are putting their lives, and those of their loved ones, at risk by attempting to reach the UK illegally.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why we have increased security and boosted technology used at border controls and are working with law enforcement at home and abroad to target the criminal gangs who are often behind such attempts.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Thursday, 22 October 2015, was the day I realized just how alien I really was.<br></p> <p> I\u2019d come home from work to read the most astounding blog headline I\u2019d ever believed I was misreading: \u201c<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/13942305/olympic-freeskier-x-games-star-gus-kenworthy-first-openly-gay-action-sports-athlete\">Olympic Freeskier Gus Kenworthy: \u2018I\u2019m Gay\u2019</a>.\u201d </p> <p>I sent my best friend six texts in a row that each said \u201cOH MY GOD\u201d even though, long gone from the homophobic church days of my childhood, I still felt guilt about taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain and still avoided using \u201cOMG\u201d by writing \u201cOMGosh\u201d.</p> <p> An attempt to describe Gus Kenworthy\u2019s good looks would be an insult to God as well as the gods I\u2019d been told were false idols (Buddha, Allah, Katharine Hepburn). Thus, at the risk of being smote, I will simply say that his is an impossible beauty \u2013 Gus is a grinning, blond, jocular jock, a golem of eugenics involving a Disney prince and a Ralph Lauren model. </p> <p>But this resplendence of his wasn\u2019t quite the cause of my paroxysm. Before that moment of revelation, Gus was someone I\u2019d not only fawned over but had studied. Over the years I\u2019d scrutinized even his most casual interviews in the hopes of emulating what he seemed to be: gregarious, kind, chill. </p> <p>In short, he was a dude. </p> <p>When I was a boy, I didn\u2019t know I was gay but I did know I was the opposite of a dude: bookish, sensitive, shy. I was also the son of a minister in the Bible Belt, a place as conservative as it was homogeneous. To adapt, I gradually took on palatable mannerisms and interests until, by the time I\u2019d graduated from the glass-closeted world of an Ivy League school, new acquaintances inexplicably treated me like what I\u2019d once thought was my antithesis \u2013 the bro. </p> <p>Along the way, I\u2019d changed the way I talked and walked and played (I\u2019d taken up rugby, surfing, lacrosse) until I couldn\u2019t quite discern the difference between what was fun and what was survival. </p> <p>And so it was with an alarmed possessiveness, and then an unnerved bewilderment, that I watched as the newly out Gus absorbed global acclaim as he threw off his hard-won dude-isms to appear like other gay guys whose effeminate \u201cpride\u201d I had never quite understood. Somehow, Gus had skipped the quasi-closeted stage of his journey where he and I were finally in the same place: waiting outside a strange house but hoping to be invited in. </p> <p>Instead, Gus was more distant than ever: out, proud, less masculine-acting and a member of the preposterously attractive gay phalanx that made me feel that I had none of the requisite traits that would help me connect with my tribe.</p> <p>It was in these throes of discombobulation that I saw, just two weeks later, a headline on the New York Times\u2019 homepage that read <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/arts/marvels-iceman-cometh-out.html\">Marvel\u2019s Iceman Cometh Out</a>. It was not about Gus but, to my tepid delight, a member of the fictional X-Men. </p> <p> Earlier that year, Brian Michael Bendis\u2019s comic book series All-New X-Men \u2013 which brought the original, 1960s-based team of superheroes time traveling to the present day \u2013 featured the adolescent Iceman being outed by a telepathic teammate. What the Times<em> </em>had just reported, though, was a new development: the adolescent Iceman finally meeting back up with his older, present-day self to ask why the hell his adult counterpart had spent his whole life pretending to be straight. </p> <p>At first, adult Iceman is speechless, and then defensive, but then goes silent: there is a panel of adult Iceman looking down; the next panel, teen Iceman waiting for an answer; the next panel, just a shot of adult Iceman\u2019s sneakers; and then, the same panel but with something hitting the floor next to adult Iceman\u2019s shoes and making a \u201ctink\u201d noise as it bounces up. It took me a moment to realize what the falling object was: one of adult Iceman\u2019s tears, frozen before it could even hit the ground.</p> <p>I\u2019d read comics as a kid but didn\u2019t think they had a place in adult life. In fact, I thought their increasing influence on modern art was one of the main causes of what literary critic James Wood referred to as \u201cthe infantilization of our literary culture\u201d. Yet after Iceman\u2019s confrontation with himself, I put a pause on reading Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian \u2013 which I had been boasting to everyone was \u201clikely the <em>great</em><em>est</em> prose I have ever read\u201d! \u2013 to try and uncover every freezing fractal of Iceman\u2019s life. </p> <p>At first, it was merely <em>seeing </em>him: to observe exactly what he had to say, to watch just how the addition of superpowers allowed him to handle the quandaries of life. But then my project broadened to getting a feel for his personality. And the more I read, the more I discovered, with a feeling not unlike pride, that the way I imagined myself was the way Iceman\u2019s writers imagined him, too: hilarious, loyal, agile yet powerful, and willing to acknowledge his sexuality even if he didn\u2019t yet know how to embrace it. </p> <p> In the restless intervals between the release of X-Men issues, I caught up online with reviews of past stories that included Iceman. I learned about the character\u2019s inception and subsequent, more powerful mutations over the decades. I found out that he had a conservative upbringing, too. I even bought a vintage Iceman shirt on eBay.</p> <p>What really entranced me, though, was how the reveal of Iceman\u2019s sexuality intersected with something called retcon (short for \u201cretroactive continuity\u201d), which is when a story\u2019s previously established facts are altered from a later time in the tale\u2019s chronology \u2013 it\u2019s some element of a story, in other words, that\u2019s supposedly always been there even though it\u2019s not revealed until later. </p> <p>After learning of retcon, I spent night after night trying to find a textual causality, from decades of X-Men comics, that hinted at Iceman\u2019s sexual identity. And for every vitriolic comments section of a comic book blog \u2013 in which some commenter would inevitably remark that they were not homophobic but then still ask why a character who seemed straight had to be \u201cmade\u201d gay \u2013 there were also annotated theories from others that supported why Iceman had, in fact, always been a homo. </p> <p>Every time I found one of these particularly compelling theses, sometimes from comic book writers themselves, I felt gratified: \u201cSee\u201d, I would think to the critics in the ether, \u201cthis has always been a part of him, even if he couldn\u2019t show us.\u201d </p> <p>It was a few months into my ice-ploration, after a particularly fruitless Friday night out at some gay bars \u2013 the kind of night where you believe that gay culture\u2019s only viable currency is an extreme, unobtainable beauty \u2013 that I came home alone and dispirited, to really feel the weight of my imagined disconnect from the gay community.</p> <p>There had been other nights like this, even one a few months before that when my sense of isolation was so unbearable that I drafted Gus a note, telling him how similar we were, even though I knew we were now such disparate species that I would never actually send him the message.</p> <p>So on that night I came home alone, with the miasma of tequila still strong at 3am , I appealed to a different idol: I took All-New X-Men #40 from my bookshelf and read the scene that I\u2019d only seen until then in bits and pieces on the internet. It was a six-page conversation of a girl making her friend come out to her. The friend is resistant and angry and ashamed, but he\u2019s also, ultimately, grateful, because he becomes a little less alone. </p> <p>The scene included telepathy and ice walls but it also had the most realistic dialogue I think I\u2019ve ever read and I cried over its words until I fell asleep.</p> <p>Knowing Iceman the way I now know him, what I feel is still not a crush, not even in the playful way readers swoon over Heathcliff or Holden Caufield or even, Christ forgive us, Christian Grey. What I\u2019ve somehow found is a commonality. I can only see very little of Iceman: he\u2019s made up of ink dots and plot points and, in his ice form, is just shades of white with a minimal but evocative smirk. And yet, when I look at him and let myself feel our natural similarities, I don\u2019t mind that neither of us is not the most beautiful one, not yet the dazzling image of a fully fleshed-out form. In the ice of his face what I see is myself reflected. I\u2019m grinning, I\u2019m chilling, I\u2019m mutating.</p> <p><em>Jonah Wynne is a pseudonym for a novelist who lives in New York City.

  "<h2>Friday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood</h2> <p>The scratching of Mizzou, the favourite, from Friday\u2019s Doncaster Cup has left <strong>Quest For More (3.40)</strong> as the new market leader at a top price of 7-2, and that looks like a very fair price now that the only horse in the field with a higher rating is out of the running.</p> <p>Roger Charlton\u2019s runner was not known as a front-runner before his victory in the Lonsdale Stakes at York last month, but the new approach seemed to coax some further improvement from the six-year-old, who recorded a comfortable three-and-a-half length success.</p> <p>Similar tactics today will lack the element of surprise, but George Baker should still have the lead to himself, and then get a chance to make Quest For More\u2019s class tell in the closing stages.</p> <p>Two horses from Mark Johnston\u2019s yard who seem to have two ways of running pose problems for punters in the first two races on the card.</p> <p><strong>Lumiere (1.55)</strong> finished last in the 1,000 Guineas, then bolted up in a Listed race at Newmarket\u2019s July meeting before finishing ninth of 10 in the Prix Rothschild last time out. That race came 24 days after her Newmarket outing and she has had 40 to recover from her run at Deauville, and at the prices on offer, it may be worth taking the chance that this will be one of her good days.</p> <p>Yalta, one of Johnston\u2019s runners in the Flying Childers Stakes, was last of the 19 runners in the Nunthorpe Stakes, three weeks after breaking the track record to win the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood. He is better than his York form suggests, but also faces a very useful opponent in <strong>Tis Marvellous (2.30)</strong>, who could not live with Lady Aurelia in the Prix Morny last time out but has every chance here on the form of his win in the Prix Robert Papin in in July.</p> <p><strong>Wall Of Fire (3.05) </strong>is improving fast and will take all the beating in the Mallard Handicap, while <strong>Cloudberry (4.40)</strong> and <strong>Chocala (5.00)</strong> both have outstanding chances in handicaps at Sandown and Chester respectively.</p> <h2>Tipping competition, day five</h2> <p>Our winners so far:</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>Green Zone 5-1</p> <p>Purple Party 9-2</p> <p>Fast Act 10-1</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>Heir To A Throne 13-2</p> <p>Noble Peace 8-1</p> <p>Baysbrown 13-8</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Priceless 4-1</p> <p>Phosphorescence 7-1</p> <p>Singeur 14-1</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>Simple Verse 3-1</p> <p>Mubtasim 4-1</p> <p>Handsome Dude 25-1</p> <h2>Standings after Day Four</h2> <p>jakebuckfast +45.63</p> <p>Crasivo +21.50</p> <p>Bacciodilupo +19</p> <p>BearRides +14.50</p> <p>wiggy12 +14.50</p> <p>Copshaw +12.50</p> <p>lcprestes +9.13</p> <p>sandiuk +8.50</p> <p>wemeanyounoharm +4.50</p> <p>FinsburyPark +3.50</p> <p>titusisashambles +3</p> <p>GandT123 +3</p> <p>AshleyBrook +2</p> <p>yasmin11 +2</p> <p>GForce1 +1</p> <p>orso +0.13</p> <p>slackdad38 +0</p> <p>cerises -1</p> <p>LansonUproar -1.37</p> <p>Harrytheactor -1.50</p> <p>diegosigod -3</p> <p>melonk -3</p> <p>joehow -3</p> <p>ID3814422 -3</p> <p>Toptrapper -3</p> <p>Goldkid999 -4</p> <p>Rivercity -4.50</p> <p>Esherhammer -4.50</p> <p>MrWinnersSonInLaw -4.50</p> <p>ubikubik -6</p> <p>jamesstod -6</p> <p>72luca -6</p> <p>DrKelso -6.50</p> <p>Mulldog -6.50</p> <p>moidadem -6.50</p> <p>elliot45 -6.50</p> <p>Ormrod76 -7</p> <p>chris1623 -7</p> <p>ps4999 -7</p> <p>TheVic -7</p> <p>PHILYERBOOTS -7</p> <p>jaxfahy -8</p> <p>23skidoo -9.37</p> <p>johne5knuckle -9.37</p> <p>William36 -9.37</p> <p>Perry Tang -9.37</p> <p>Fixxxer -9.37</p> <p>AndieAndson -9.37</p> <p>robertkeen -9.37</p> <p>GipsyHiller -12</p> <p>millreef -12</p> <p>Geoff Staddon -12</p> <p>Renzofan -12</p> <p>BatmanKaisers -12</p> <p>donlewis -12</p> <p>kingklynch -12</p> <p>Ellandback -12</p> <p>JahLion -12</p> <p>slowhandray -12</p> <p>gregcwb -12</p> <p>waltersobchak -12</p> <p>TL127 -12</p> <p>LexLondon -12</p> <p>ID0228872 -12</p> <p>kmill68 -12</p> <p>Blitzwing -12</p> <p>16heathermac01 -12</p> <p>maghazi -12</p> <p>Ben Leo -12</p> <p>Bonzodrongo -12</p> <p>spudpt -12</p> <p>goodfellow1 -12</p> <p>Bigboozer -12</p> <p>Lindsey6677 \u00ca-12</p> <p>Sportingbest -12</p> <p>scarletdragon -12</p> <p>dean055 -12</p> <p>Cairo -12</p> <p>jessie69 -12</p> <p>The last of our every-week competitions needed an impressive winning performance and, whatever happens now, we\u2019ll certainly end up with that.

That outsider pick was the more impressive because Jake was already a handy fourth and had no need to seek a big-priced winner.

Running to 1,100 pages and retailing at \u00a375, it is a big, beautiful record of the last jumps season, including many of the famous Timeform essays discussing the major performers and the issues raised during the winter.

She\u2019s a fine person beyond reproach.\u201d</strong> \u2013 5 September, Cleveland<br></p> <p>Trump has denied speaking to Pam Bondi, Florida\u2019s attorney general, before his Donald J Trump Foundation made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general\">$25,000 donation in 2013 </a>to a political group supporting her. Four days before the gift, Bondi\u2019s office had announced that it was considering whether to prosecute Trump University, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/31/donald-trump-university-playbook-real-estate-courses\">accused of defrauding students</a> of tens of thousands of dollars.</p> <p>Bondi\u2019s spokesman, Marc Reichelderfer, has contradicted Trump\u2019s account, saying she personally solicited Trump before her office announced a potential investigation. \u201cThe process took at least several weeks, from the time they spoke to the time they received the contribution,\u201d Reichelderfer told the Associated Press. Trump also <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-pam-bondi-trump-university_us_57cf2c6ce4b0a48094a64854\">held a $3,000-per-person fundraiser</a> for Bondi after she declined to prosecute Trump University, according to the Huffington Post.<br></p> <p>Political donations by charities are illegal, and the IRS fined Trump $2,500. </p> <p>The businessman has previously boasted about paying for political influence. \u201cI give to everybody.

He ended the interview by saying he was not interested in running for president in 2016. </p> <h2>Conspiracy</h2> <p><strong>\u201cDo you think your birther position has hurt you among African Americans?\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

Do you regret even bringing it up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about it any more,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s refusal to talk about the conspiracy theory that vaulted him into national politics \u2013 and had him mocked him at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TwRmX6zs4\">the 2011 White House correspondents dinner</a> \u2013 is relatively new. At a conservative conference last year he not only <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/02/27/about-that-donald-trump-speech-at-cpac/\">rehashed the saga</a> but bragged about drawing Obama into the fracas. He also questioned the actual certificate: \u201cNow all we have to do is find out whether or not it\u2019s real.\u201d</p> <p>In the year since, Trump has never renounced the conspiracy theory, though his running mate, Mike Pence, has rejected it.</p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p><strong>\u201cAs much as I didn\u2019t want to be there, we should\u2019ve left a small force [in Iraq], and really Isis just evolved out of all of the turmoil, all of the weakness, all of the stupidity of decisions from Hillary Clinton, from Barack Obama.\u201d</strong> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t57g0HtH_G4\">5 September, Virginia Beach</a></p> <p>Besides Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/trump-fact-check-iraq-war-san-bernardino-nato\">false claim that he always opposed the Iraq war</a>, he also supported complete withdrawal<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-cites-iraq-withdrawal-he-passionately-supported-to-say?utm_term=.xhMYJNVWN#.qpgXZWm3W\"> from Iraq in 2007 and 2008</a>. </p> <p>\u201cYou know how they get out?

A <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2375\">recent Quinnipiac poll </a>found 74% of 1,498 likely voters want Trump to release his tax returns, as every major presidential candidate has done for the last 40 years. Sixty-two percent of Republican voters said they wanted Trump to release his returns.</p> <p>A recent<a href=\"http://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_US_082916/  \"> Monmouth University poll</a> found 62% of voters believe it\u2019s important that the candidates release their returns. Fifty-two percent of the voters surveyed believe that Trump has something in his tax returns that he does not want the public to know. Only 24% believe his excuse that he should not release them during an IRS audit. No law prohibits the release of tax returns during an audit.</p> <h2>Deportation</h2> <p><strong>\u201cI never talked about dragging people out of their homes, Bill.

  "<p>I was seven years old when my father died. His body was brought home to lie in my gran\u2019s front room. I believed he was my uncle, and could not understand why I had to kiss him every morning and at bedtime. I led the funeral procession, and said goodbye for ever without knowing who he really was. At the time my aunt and uncle were acting as my foster parents after a period of being looked after by my beloved gran and being cared for in a hospital when she could no longer cope. It was 1950 and I was rebellious, described as \u201cimpossible to manage\u201d by my foster parents. I felt unloved and unwanted. </p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until much later in life that I learned my father, who had mental health problems, had been in what was then known as the county asylum for much of the first seven years of my life and when I was just a few months old, my mother had been imprisoned for shoplifting and child neglect. It was decided that I would never be returned to her, or told the truth about my parents. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/aug/03/social-workers-learn-from-experience-care\">Social workers, please learn from my experience in care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I became ever more difficult to control, I was assessed as being in need of prolonged psychiatric and social work help with an urgent recommendation that I should be removed from my foster parents and live where I could experience safety and stability \u2013 the Caldecott Community. Located in a magnificent country mansion in Kent, it had grown from a nursery in London in 1911 to an innovative therapeutic environment headed by its founder, Leila Rendel. It offered a place of safety to distressed children, with the opportunity to grow and take a place in the world.</p> <p>This was well before the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://graham-taylor0.tripod.com/historyoffostercareinenglandandwales19461989/id1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curtis Report in 1946</a>, which insisted that children\u2019s homes should serve as \u201cplaces of safety and refuge\u201d for children needing assessment, care and protection. In 1947, with the help of the Nuffield Foundation, Caldecott set up the first assessment centre with the intention of providing evidence and experience for local authorities. Before this, children\u2019s homes were mainly provided by voluntary organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.barnardos.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barnardo\u2019s</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Children\u2019s Society</a>, whereas Rendel, along with Barbara Dockar-Drysdale of the Mulberry Bush in Oxford, proposed a much wider and therapeutic response \u2013 the first of the children\u2019s therapeutic communities.</p> <p>Writing at the time, Rendel was clear, she said: \u201cIt is useless to camouflage a children\u2019s home or foster home as a \u2018home from home\u2019. That it could never be. For these children of misfortune, there could be no adequate substitute.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s true the Caldecott environment was never \u201chomely\u201d. That was its joy and salvation for children like me who felt out of place in a conventional family. It could cope with our impulse to break out, to run away, to act out feelings of anger and distress. We needed to be able to breathe, and do all these things without fear of sanctions, to be understood and cared for whatever we did. </p> <p>The community met these needs exactly. We had space to express ourselves through education, art, literature, music, sport and work in the garden. We rode horses and bikes, went camping and stayed in youth hostels. We made friends, sometimes for life. The discipline, timekeeping, rituals and continuity created the sense of safety. All of this was a far cry from the suffocation I experienced in the domestic family environment. Although my foster parents were blood relatives, I had nothing in common with them, and reacted against their attempts to control me. </p> <p>During my eight years at Caldecott I thrived on the environment, the opportunities for self-expression, especially through music and drama, and learned how to manage my uncontrollable temper, night fears and dreams, and attempted self-destruction. I responded to the discipline, which was reasonable and fair (not hysterical as at home), and the routine of regular meals, clean clothes, and feeling of being important to my peers and those around me. I was rewarded appropriately for success, and my failures were understood. It did not matter that affection was not overt, this would have frightened me, and many others, who had already learned to distrust adults at an early age. The sense of belonging was most important. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/apr/20/dont-force-young-people-out-childrens-homes-18\">Don't force young people out of children's homes at 18</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Returning to the family home at the age of 16 was a great challenge for me and within months I was literally thrown out into the snow with nowhere to go. By then, I had learned enough skills to survive and never returned to live with the family again. It would be good to record that I lived \u201chappily ever after\u201d but some of the damage left scars that have never healed. Only in recent years have I fully come to understand the truth about my background and parentage, and this has helped a great deal in resolving some of the questions. The sense of loss and abandonment has never left me. </p> <p>In the 1950s Rendel identified not only the needs of the children at the time but in the future, setting out a strategic plan for the future with children always at the heart. An individual response, assessment, fostering where appropriate, a variety of facilities ranging from small family homes, to larger creative environments for those children who needed more space. Finally, support and aftercare for as long as needed. </p> <p>Rendel, Dockar-Drysdale, and others believed that some children are so hurt, so damaged, so vulnerable, that an escape from family life \u2013 not a return to it \u2013 is what is needed. For those who cannot return to families and for whom fostering is not appropriate, skilful preparation for an independent life in the community is a vital part of any programme. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/20/children-in-care-reunification-failure-nspcc\">Research for the NSPCC</a> has shown that about half of the children who go into care because of abuse or neglect suffer further abuse if they return home and and later have to return to care.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard for me to be objective given my own experience, but I think the organisations that have developed the concept of a more personal approach in smaller living units, while retaining the concept of community, have been and are the most successful.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from a piece <a href=\"http://www.thetcj.org/in-residence-articles/child-misfortune-cyril\" rel=\"nofollow\">originally published in the Therapeutic Care Journal</a>. </em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

  "<h2>Is NYC FC\u2019s Frank Lampard an MVP nominee?<br></h2> <p>\u2018Frank Lampard is the worst signing in MLS history.\u2019 <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/frank-lampard-nycfc-worst-signing-in-mls-history\">Remember that headline?</a> I do. It was early in May and the 38-year-old midfielder, perennially injured, had not played a single minute for NYC FC in 2016. The vultures were out \u2013 and they decided Lampard was by far the biggest waste of money the league had ever seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SBondyNYDN/status/725457319690158081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Updated worst signings in MLS history: 1) Frank Lampard, 2) Rafa Marquez.</p>&mdash; Stefan Bondy (@SBondyNYDN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBondyNYDN/status/725457319690158081\">April 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>He made his season debut a few weeks later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/mls-frank-lampard-new-york-city-fc\">when he came on the 75th minute in the Hudson River derbv. The Red Bulls were winning 5-0</a> at Yankee Stadium on their way to a 7-0 thrashing, and what followed was 15 minutes of nothingness for the ex-England international, who was booed every time he touched the ball.</p> <p>Fast forward to September, and Lampard has had a ridiculous summer where he has scored 11 goals in 16 games, including a fantastic brace which helped his team beat DC United 3-2 last week. Can we add Lampard\u2019s name in the MVP conversation? If the discussion centers around a player\u2019s effectiveness, which propels his team to not only move up the table but also transforms them into legitimate contenders for the MLS Cup, just like Sebastian Giovinco does for Toronto or Bradley Wright-Phillips for the Red Bulls, then the answer is clear. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Union take on Impact in the race to stay home</h2> <p>With seven games left in the regular season, Montreal Impact find themselves in a precarious position. Currently sitting in fifth place on 37 points, the Canadian franchise are only seven points away from top spot and a victory this Saturday would move them level with their next opponents, Philadelphia. A loss, however, coupled with wins from New England and DC United would mean their playoff status would begin to look really shaky.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Mauro Biello\u2019s team suffered a disastrous 4-1 loss against conference rivals, Orlando City, and after the game, the 44-year-old manager didn\u2019t mince his words. \u201cWe\u2019re not that good of a team,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/08/mauro-biello-doesnt-mince-words-after-impact-loss-were-not-good\">Biello said.</a> \u201cWe\u2019re not. A good team is in first place and we need to understand that. We need to be a team that has to fight for their life to make the playoffs. And to me, that\u2019s what has to change, is that mentality because at the end of the day, when our backs are against the wall, that\u2019s when we show up.\u201d</p> <p>Philadelphia, meanwhile, are also looking to get back to winning ways after their 3-0 loss to Chicago Fire last weekend. One more win for Philly and that will tie their club record for season victories, but for Jim Curtin, the most important thing is to climb up the table. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s no secret,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.phillysoccerpage.net/2016/09/07/transcript-and-video-jim-curtins-weekly-press-conference-34/\">he said during his weekly press conference.</a> \u201cYou don\u2019t want to just get in at the six or five spot because you put almost nine or ten months of work together to have, all the sudden, get thrown out there on a Wednesday and it can be over in a second on the road.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not kidding. Historically, the importance of home advantage in the playoffs has proven to be extremely important. Last season, every team playing at home in the knockout round made it through the conference semi-finals. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Dallas aim for 20 unbeaten at home against low-scoring Colorado</h2> <p>Another big game in the west on Sunday \u2013 but not as big as it might have been a month ago. The Rapids have slipped in recent weeks, and their 2-0 defeat by New England has left them winless in four, with just one victory in the last seven.</p> <p>As always with Colorado, it\u2019s the goals for column where alarm bells are ringing. Twenty-eight goals from 26 games represents the second lowest in the conference \u2013 only San Jose have scored fewer. Jermaine Jones\u2019 injury has been a blow, it\u2019s true, but the Rapids need more from Kevin Doyle and Shkelzen Gashi, two well-paid designated players whose goalscoring output has been substandard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a767ab744f3f930fe8416298d7df8d1a77af15bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a767ab744f3f930fe8416298d7df8d1a77af15bc/0_6_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Howard has backed up a solid defence, but the Rapids are struggling in attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Howard has backed up a solid defence, but the Rapids are struggling in attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dallas, on the other hand, just keep on winning. They\u2019ve broken the 50-point barrier and now sit seven points clear of RSL and LA in the conference standings. Can anyone stop them lifting the Supporters\u2019 Shield? Nineteen games now unbeaten at home now, and this could be a special season for Oscar Pareja\u2019s team: they\u2019re still going in the US Open Cup and the Concacaf Champions League, and they want silverware.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve said it since the beginning of the year \u2013 we want to win something for this club and for us,\u201d Victor Ulloa said after last week\u2019s 3-1 win over Portland. \u201cTonight the guys did great and we showed that character and resilience, even with the guys gone for the national team. We\u2019re built to win a championship, and we\u2019re built to step up. Everybody stepped up a little bit tonight.\u201d</p> <p>They should have their international stars back for the Colorado game, too: Kellyn Acosta, Carlos Gruezo, Maynor Figueroa and Tesho Akindele were all unavailable last week.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I like the most is that this group is taking the journey one step at a time,\u201d coach Pareja said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to overthink too many things. I want them just to come and perform every day the way they are. That made me feel very honored to coach them.\u201d <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Watch out, NYC FC \u2013 the Red Bulls are right behind you</h2> <p>The Red Bulls are doing everything they can to make sure they don\u2019t come second in the conference. Jesse Marsch\u2019s squad, unbeaten in 10 league matches, are pushing their bitter rivals NYC FC to the very end, and this week they travel to the nation\u2019s capital to face DC United \u2013 who are themselves desperately hunting that last playoff spot.</p> <p>The Red Bulls will be happy to welcome back their creative midfielder Sacha Kljestan, who returns after an impressive outing with the US men\u2019s team in their World Cup qualifiers against St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Kljestan had two goals and two assists in those two matches and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/06/sacha-kljestan-credits-red-bulls-jesse-marsch-he-shines-us-return\">he credits everything to his domestic club</a> and his relationship with Marsch, a bond that started back when they played for Chivas USA, a team that was shut down by the league in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cWe [Red Bulls] have a system and a style of play that benefits me,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/06/sacha-kljestan-credits-red-bulls-jesse-marsch-he-shines-us-return\">Kljestan said</a>. \u201cI have a coach that believes in me more than anyone else I have ever played for. Jesse is a guy, we played together for a long time. We have a great relationship. He really pushes me every day and he challenges me.\u201d</p> <p>With the inclusion of Bradley Wright-Phillips\u2019s firepower (joint top MLS goalscorer with 17 goals) and the return of their captain, Dax McCarty \u2013 who has been out through injury since July 31 \u2013 the red side of New York are pushing Patrick Vieira\u2019s men all the way to the end.</p> <p>As for seventh-placed DC United, they need this one after experiencing a heart-breaking defeat against NYC FC last week. \u201cThat one hurts,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2016/09/01/ben-olsen-dc-uniteds-topsy-turvy-loss-nycfc-one-hurts\">said head coach, Ben Olsen, after the 3-2 loss at Yankee Stadium.</a> \u201cBut there are games in the season that hurt. I\u2019ve never gone through a season in my career as a coach or a player that you don\u2019t have games like this.\u201d</p> <p>If they lose on Sunday and Orlando City (currently occupying the sixth spot) beat LA Galaxy, the gap would widen to five points. <strong>LME</strong></p> <h2>Orlando travel to Galaxy after eye-catching win over Montreal</h2> <p>Wednesday night\u2019s game at Stade Saputo was billed as Drogba v Kaka. Notwithstanding the other 20 players on display in Montreal, it was the Brazilian who came out on top: he helped himself to two more goals and a 4-1 victory for his in-form side.</p> <p>Drogba opened the scoring inside a minute on a goalkeeping howler from Joe Bendik, but then Kaka set to work: making the first one for Brek Shea, and twice staying ice-cold in front of goal, the second a penalty after Montreal keeper Evan Bush was harshly sent off. Orlando ran out convincing 4-1 winners, and their second straight victory lifted them into sixth position in the East, two points clear of DC United in the race for a playoff spot. All the more impressive since it was done without Cyle Larin and Kevin Molino, away on international duty.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased. I\u2019m pleased with two wins in a row for these guys. They\u2019ve been working extremely hard. Some things really went our way tonight,\u201d Lions head coach Jason Kreis said.</p> <p>Galaxy, Orlando\u2019s opponents on Sunday, played out a 3-3 draw with Real Salt Lake on Wednesday night, but they should have won it, considering they were 3-1 up with 25 minutes to play, thanks to two goals and an assist from Giovani dos Santos. Alas for LA, Joao Plata reduced the deficit shortly afterwards, and then Burrito Martinez equalised in stoppage time with a shot that Brian Rowe really should have saved.</p> <p>\u201cWe shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d admitted Galaxy coach Bruce Arena. \u201cWe walk away with a point when we should be walking away with three. Not an easy game, our guys worked really hard. It\u2019s a shame that they didn\u2019t reward themselves with three points. We could have been better on both of those plays \u2026 They\u2019ve been through this enough this year. They should have it right. We\u2019re in the 28th game of the season. This should not be a mystery at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Galaxy are pretty much certain for a postseason slot, but their Supporters\u2019 Shield hopes are vanishing fast \u2013 they sit seven points behind Dallas with six games to play. Despite having lost just four MLS games all season, draws have cost them: 14 ties is a league high. \u201cWe have seven games left in this season, and we need to improve,\u201d Giovani said after the game in Utah. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do our best against Orlando.\u201d <strong>TH</strong></p>",

First up, we have more from Reuters on the impact the nuclear test has had on Asian stock markets, and is likely to have on European markets.</p> <blockquote> <p>Asian shares extended losses after North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test on Friday, heightening geopolitical tensions in the region at a time when investors are grappling with slowing global growth.</p> <p>Stocks were already on the back foot when the North Korean news rattled markets, with uncertainty over the prospect of further easing from the European Central Bank pressuring global equities and bonds. </p> <p>European shares look set to follow Asia lower, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 to all open down 0.1 percent. </p> <p>MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent after touching a 13-month high on Thursday. The decline shrank gains for the week to 2.5 percent. </p> <p>Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed flat after pulling back earlier on reports of the North Korean nuclear test.

  "<p>\u201cIf you come to this country, you have to learn English.\u201d That old adage. Somehow, it seems to unite bigots and those of a relatively progressive mindset, frequently appropriated as an endnote to what can often be explosive discussions over immigration.</p> <p>If the phrase were a country, it would be Switzerland. In my experience, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/27/more-than-half-of-voters-disliked-tone-of-eu-immigration-debate-report-finds\">when a debate over foreign nationals turns bellicose</a>, the assertion that one has to learn English if they\u2019re going to live in the UK seems to corral everybody into neutral territory, garnering affirmative noises from all camps.</p> <p>As a standalone statement, I don\u2019t dispute it: if you live in another country, be it the UK or otherwise, attempting to learn the language will make life far easier, from both a work and social perspective. Indeed, you as the language learner should have the final say over exactly what you need to learn in order to get by.</p> <p>What I take issue with is this: people seldom debate the details that get overlooked when they insist that foreign nationals learn English. And perhaps more importantly still, because it\u2019s a point that is difficult to dispute, as well as one that can bring closure to an argument, we often miss the opportunity to challenge those who may use it to mask viperous anti-immigration sentiments.</p> <p>The details that the assertion misses pertain to two main ideas. First, it doesn\u2019t quantify how much English one must learn in order to be acceptable in the eyes of those making the demands. For me, it sets the same admonitory precedent as the phrase \u201cI\u2019m not racist, but \u2026\u201d The statement \u201cI\u2019m not anti-immigration, but they should learn English\u201d, if left unchallenged, can become a dangerous criterion by which some people decide which foreign nationals they\u2019ll tolerate, and which they won\u2019t.</p> <p>Therein also lies the possibility that those heard speaking their own language are assumed not to be able to speak English, or to have failed to learn it. Following the recent vote to leave the EU, I\u2019ve had friends from France, Bahrain and Poland tell me they\u2019ve been ordered to speak English by people who\u2019ve overheard them speaking their mother tongue. They can all speak English exceptionally well but are now worried about being heard speaking anything else in case they\u2019re met with abuse. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Even if they could not speak English, it is utterly deplorable to intimidate and scorn somebody on the basis of their language. But worse, it demonstrates how the goalposts are constantly shifting for the non-native speaker; not only do they have to meet an arbitrary standard of English set by the listener, woe betide them if they ever slip into their own language for a few moments.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Not only this, but the demand that people who live here learn English also fails to take account of people\u2019s financial situation, ability and motivation. Even learning the basics of a language takes dedication, focus, incentive, access to resources, time and some sort of financial commitment, be it funding a course or saying no to a shift in order to attend a class. A lot of people coming to the UK \u2013 either for work or to flee war or persecution \u2013 could only dream of enrolling on a five-day-a-week private English course, and have to make do with learning through interaction, on the job, free Esol classes and/or by using applications and books, all while juggling the demands of work and life.</p> <p>While many people do attain a high level of English by these means, some are never really afforded the opportunity to grasp the intricacies (particularly grammatical) that English contains. A friend of mine from Iraq came to the UK to seek asylum six years ago, and in spite of his efforts and hard work, people still assume he has never bothered to learn English properly as he still struggles with his speaking. Because he\u2019s had to rely on sporadic, volunteer-run classes, self-study and simply picking things up, he feels he can only get so far, yet any progress he has made is promptly negated whenever anyone deems his English to be below par.</p> <p>This underlines the danger in having \u2013 at best \u2013 fluid criteria by which to judge how much English foreign nationals ought to learn, and \u2013 at worst \u2013 no criteria at all. My Iraqi friend can get by very well and could certainly get along in a work environment, but this didn\u2019t stop a woman in the post office telling him that he should improve his English if he is going to live in the UK.</p> <p>In the current climate, it is more important than ever that we meet foreign nationals with support and solidarity, rather than unquantifiable expectations and oversimplified demands. We can\u2019t judge people\u2019s efforts to engage in the process of picking up English, nor their dedication to learn, by what we hear in fleeting conversations. Nor can we shirk our duty to challenge any anti-immigration sentiment we suspect is being expressed, just because it\u2019s embedded in seemingly harmless terms.</p>",
  "<p>Recent events in the Middle East and Europe seem to breathe fresh life into the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d thesis. Western incursions into the Middle East have triggered an Islamic backlash that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">driven millions of Muslim refugees westwards</a> and inspired terrorist attacks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack\" title=\"\">Orlando</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/14/nice-bastille-day-france-attack-promenade-des-anglais-vehicle\" title=\"\">Nice</a>; now the EU is unravelling as European voters abandon multicultural dreams in favour of xenophobic local identities. Allegedly, this has happened because the west has chosen to ignore the deep logic of history. According to the clash of civilisations thesis, humankind has always been divided into diverse civilisations whose members view the world in different and often irreconcilable ways. These incompatible world views make conflicts between civilisations inevitable, and these conflicts in turn fuel long-term historical processes. Just as in nature different species fight for survival, so throughout history civilisations have repeatedly clashed, and only the fittest have survived. Those who overlook this grim fact do so at their peril.</p> <p>The clash of civilisations thesis has far-reaching political implications. Its supporters contend that any attempt at&#xa0;reconciliation between \u201cthe west\u201d and \u201cthe Muslim world\u201d is doomed to failure. They further maintain that the EU can work only if it renounces the multicultural fallacy in favour of an unabashed \u201cwestern\u201d identity. In the long run, only one culture can survive the unforgiving tests of natural selection, and if the EU refuses to save western civilisation from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\" title=\"\">Islamic State</a> and its ilk, Britain had better <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">go&#xa0;it&#xa0;alone</a>.</p> <p>Though widely held, this thesis is misleading. Isis may indeed pose a radical challenge, but the \u201ccivilisation\u201d it challenges is a global civilisation rather than a uniquely western phenomenon. Not for nothing has Isis managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\" title=\"\">unite Iran with the&#xa0;United States</a>, and to create rare common ground between Israeli PM <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. And even Isis,&#xa0;for all its medieval rhetoric, is grounded in contemporary global culture far more than in seventh-century Arabia; it caters to the fears and hopes of alienated, postmodern youth rather than to those of medieval shepherds and merchants. In pure organisational terms, Isis has more in&#xa0;common with a large corporation like Google than with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Umayyad-dynasty-Islamic-history\" title=\"\">the Umayyad caliphate</a>. The surest sign of a real clash of civilisations is mutual incomprehension. Isis, in contrast, comprehends its enemies only too well&#xa0;\u2013 otherwise, its propaganda would not have been so effective. It is better, therefore, to see Isis as an errant offshoot of the global culture we all share, rather than as a branch of some mysterious alien tree.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Human groups may have distinct social systems, but these seldom endure for more than a few centuries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crucially, the analogy between history and biology that underpins the clash of civilisations thesis is false. Human groups \u2013 including human civilisations \u2013 are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts differ greatly from natural selection processes. Animal species have objective identities that endure for thousands of generations. Whether you are a chimpanzee or a&#xa0;gorilla depends on your genes rather than your beliefs, and different genes dictate diverse social behaviours. Chimpanzees live in mixed groups of&#xa0;males and females. They compete for power by building coalitions of supporters among both sexes. Among gorillas, in contrast, a single dominant male establishes a harem of females, and usually expels any adult male that might challenge his position. As far as we know, the same social systems have characterised chimpanzees and gorillas not only in recent decades, but for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>You find nothing like that among humans. Yes, human groups may have distinct social systems, but these are not genetically determined, and they seldom endure for more than a few centuries. Think of 20th-century Germans, for example. In fewer than 100 years, the Germans organised themselves into six very different systems: <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hohenzollern-dynasty\" title=\"\">the Hohenzollern empire</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;Weimar republic</a>, the Third Reich, Communist East Germany, the federal republic of West Germany, and finally democratic reunited Germany. Of course they kept their language and love of beer. But is there some unique German essence that distinguishes their country from all other nations, and that has remained unchanged from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" title=\"\">Wilhelm II</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a>? And if you do come up with something, was it also there back in the&#xa0;days of Goethe, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/martin-luther-renegade-prophet-lyndal-roper-review\" title=\"\">Martin Luther</a> and of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-I-Holy-Roman-emperor\" title=\"\">Frederick Barbarossa</a>?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eed8128952a999f869a98d9827f968f10d46b85/27_0_3155_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Proyas\u2019s I, Robot from 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What will happen when computers replace people in an increasing number of jobs? \u2026 Alex Proyas\u2019s <em>I, Robot</em> from 2004</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2938272.stm\" title=\"\">Preamble of the European Constitution </a>(2004) begins by stating that it draws inspiration \u201cfrom the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of&#xa0;the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, democracy, equality, freedom and the rule of law\u201d. This may easily give one the impression that European civilisation is defined by these values. Countless speeches and documents draw a direct line from ancient Athenian democracy to the present-day EU, celebrating 2,500 years of European freedom and democracy. This is reminiscent of the proverbial blind man taking hold of an&#xa0;elephant\u2019s tail and concluding that an elephant is a kind of brush. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy\" title=\"\">Athenian democracy was a half-hearted experiment</a> that survived for barely 200 years in a small corner of the Balkans. If European civilisation for the last 25 centuries has been defined by democracy and human rights, what are we to make of Sparta and Julius Caesar, the Crusaders and Conquistadores, the Inquisition and the slave trade, Louis XIV and Goebbels, Lenin and Mussolini?</p> <p>European civilisation is anything Europeans make of it, just as Christianity is anything Christians make of it. And they have made remarkably different things of it over the centuries. Human groups are defined more by the&#xa0;changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills. No matter what revolutions they&#xa0;survive, they can weave old and new into a single yarn. Even an individual may knit revolutionary personal changes into a coherent life story: \u201cI am that person who was once a socialist, but became a capitalist; I&#xa0;was born in Senegal, and now live in France; I married, then got divorced; I&#xa0;had cancer, and then got well again.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, a human group such as the Germans may come to define itself by the very changes it has lived through: \u201cOnce we were Nazis, but we have learned our lesson, and now we are peaceful democrats\u201d. You don\u2019t need to look for some unique German essence that manifested itself first in Hitler and then in Merkel: this radical transformation itself makes the Germans who they are.</p> <p>Isis, too, may uphold an allegedly unchanging Muslim identity, but their story of Islam is a brand new tale. Yes,&#xa0;they used some venerable Muslim texts and traditions to concoct it, but if&#xa0;I bake a cake from flour, oil and sugar that have been sitting in my pantry for&#xa0;the past two months, does it mean the cake itself is two months old? Conversely, those who dismiss Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or even \u201canti-Islamic\u201d are equally mistaken: Islam has no DNA. Just as with Christianity, Islam is whatever Muslims make of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d2110b0b2cbddd6ba6d6f9c5ab061675aee20f/21_0_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palmyra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isis wrecked the ancient site of Palmyra in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet there is an even deeper difference distinguishing human groups from animal species. Species often split, but never merge. About seven million years ago, chimpanzees and gorillas had common ancestors. This single ancestral species split into two populations that eventually went their separate, evolutionary ways. Once this happened, there was no going back. Since individuals belonging to different species cannot produce fertile offspring together, species can never merge. Gorillas can\u2019t merge with chimpanzees, giraffes can\u2019t merge with elephants, and dogs can\u2019t merge with cats.</p> <p>Human tribes, in contrast, tend to coalesce over time into larger and larger groups. Modern Germans were created from the merger of Saxons, Prussians, Swabians and Bavarians, which not so long ago wasted little love on one another.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/on-the-origin-of-species-voted-most-influential-academic-book-charles-darwin\" title=\"\"><em> </em></a>The French were created from&#xa0;the merger of Franks, Normans, Bretons, Gascons and Provencals. Meanwhile across the Channel, English, Scots, Welsh and Irish gradually came together (willingly or not) to form Britons. In the not too distant future, Germans, French and Britons might yet&#xa0;merge into Europeans.</p> <p>Mergers don\u2019t always last, as people in London, Edinburgh and Brussels are well aware these days. Brexit may&#xa0;well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the EU and the UK. But in the long run, history\u2019s direction is clear-cut. Ten thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these merged into larger and larger groups, creating fewer and&#xa0;fewer distinct civilisations. In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been merging into a&#xa0;single global community. Political and ethnic divisions endure, but they do not undermine the fundamental unity. Indeed, some divisions are made possible only by an over-arching common structure.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The process of human unification has&#xa0;taken two distinct forms: weak heterogeneous unification and strong homogeneous unification. The weaker heterogeneous form involves creating ties between previously unrelated groups. The groups may continue to have different beliefs and practices, but are no longer independent of each other. From this perspective, even war&#xa0;is a bond \u2013 perhaps the strongest bond of all. Ten thousand years ago, no&#xa0;tribe in America had any quarrel with Middle Eastern enemies, and no African clan bore grudges towards any European. In contrast, during the second world war, people born on the shores of the Mississippi went to their deaths on Pacific islands and European meadows, while recruits from the heart of Africa fell fighting among French vineyards and Alpine snows.</p> <p>Historians often argue that globalisation reached a first peak in 1913, then went into a long decline during the era of the world wars and the cold war, and recuperated only after 1989. They fear that new conflicts may again put globalisation into reverse gear. This may be true of economic globalisation, but it ignores the different but equally important dynamics of military globalisation. War spreads ideas, technologies and people far more quickly than commerce. War also makes people far more interested in one another.<strong> </strong>Never had the US been more closely in touch with Russia than during the cold war, when every cough in a Moscow corridor sent&#xa0;people scrambling up and down Washington staircases. People care far more about their enemies than about their trade partners. For every US film about Thailand, there are probably 20 about Vietnam. The global \u201cwar on terror\u201d simply continues the process of&#xa0;military globalisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6166d8782835abdc7f8685fa59fe38acd936bda/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and a coin are seen at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Nowadays, the global unity of conflict is perhaps most apparent on the internet, where Isis and the drug cartels are rubbing shoulders with Google and Facebook, and YouTube offers funny cat videos alongside instructions on how to make bombs. Islamic fanatics, murderous drug dealers and geeky hackers don\u2019t exist on unrelated planets; they share the same global cyberspace. All are thrilled&#xa0;by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/07/blockchain-answer-life-universe-everything-bitcoin-technology\" title=\"\">blockchain technology</a> that gave us the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\" title=\"\">bitcoin</a>; all count on easy accessibility via ubiquitous smartphones, and all are antagonised by national governments attempting to wrest control of the net.</p> <p>Yet the world of the early 21st century has gone way beyond the heterogeneous unity of conflict. People across the globe are not only influenced by one another, they increasingly share identical beliefs and practices. A thousand years ago, planet Earth was home to dozens of different political models. In Europe you could find feudal principalities vying with independent city states and minuscule theocracies. The&#xa0;Muslim world had its caliphate, claiming universal sovereignty, but also experimented with kingdoms, emirates and sultanates. The Chinese empire believed itself to be the sole legitimate political entity, while to its north and west tribal confederacies fought each other with glee. India and south-east Asia contained a kaleidoscope of regimes, whereas polities in America, Africa and Australasia ranged from tiny hunter-gatherer bands to sprawling empires. No wonder even neighbouring human groups had trouble agreeing on diplomatic practices, not to mention international laws. Each society had its own political paradigms, and found it difficult to understand \u2013 let alone respect \u2013 alien political concepts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today there are nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on diplomatic protocols and common international laws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, in contrast, a single political paradigm is accepted everywhere. The planet is divided between nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on the same diplomatic protocols and on common international laws. Sweden, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay are all marked on our world maps as the same kind of colourful shapes; they are all members of the UN; and despite myriad differences they are all recognised as sovereign states enjoying similar rights and privileges. Indeed, they share many more political ideas and practices, including at least a token belief in representative bodies, universal suffrage and human rights. When Israelis and Palestinians, Russians and Ukrainians, or Kurds and&#xa0;Turks court global public opinion, they all use the same discourse of human rights, state sovereignty and international law.</p> <p>The world may be peppered with various types of \u201cfailed states\u201d, but it knows only one paradigm for a successful state. Global politics follows \u201cthe Anna Karenina principle\u201d: healthy states are all alike, but every failed state fails in its own way, by missing this or that ingredient of the dominant political package. Isis stands out in its complete rejection of this package, and its attempt to establish an&#xa0;entirely different kind of political entity \u2013 a universal caliphate. But it is unlikely to succeed precisely for this reason. Numerous guerrilla forces and terror organisations have managed to establish new countries or conquer existing ones, but they have always done so by accepting the fundamental principles of the global political order. Even <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970415.sc6357.html\" title=\"\">the Taliban sought international recognition as the legitimate government</a> of the sovereign country of Afghanistan. No group rejecting the principles of global politics has so far&#xa0;gained lasting control of a significant territory.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In pre-modern times, humans experimented not only with diverse political blueprints, but with a mind-boggling variety of economic models. Russian <em>boyars</em>, Hindu maharajas, Chinese mandarins and Amerindian tribal chiefs had very different ideas about money and taxation, and none was even aware of the existence of such a&#xa0;thing as \u201cthe economy\u201d. Nowadays, in contrast, almost everybody believes in slightly different variations on the same capitalist theme, and we are all cogs within a single global production line. Whether you live in Mongolia, New Zealand or Bolivia, your daily routines and economic fortunes depend on the same economic theories, the same corporations and banks, and the same currents of capital. When finance ministers or bank managers from China, Russia, Brazil and India meet, they have a common language, and can&#xa0;easily understand and sympathise with their counterparts\u2019 woes.</p> <p>When Isis conquered large parts of Syria and Iraq, it murdered tens of thousands of people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/islamic-state-destroyed-ancient-saint-eliane-monastery-syria-says-priest\" title=\"\">demolished archaeological sites</a>, toppled statues and systematically destroyed the symbols of previous regimes and of western cultural influence. Yet when Isis fighters entered the banks and found stashes of US dollars covered with the faces of American presidents and English slogans praising American political and religious ideals, they did not burn these dollars. For the dollar bill is universally venerated across all political and religious divides. Though it has no intrinsic value \u2013 you cannot eat or drink a dollar bill \u2013 trust in the dollar and in the wisdom of the Federal Reserve is so firm it is shared even by Islamic fundamentalists, Mexican drug lords and North Korean tyrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97eb1359d21a3bf9bfaf6a009db19569faae78b1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the homogeneity of contemporary humanity is most apparent when it comes to our view of the natural world and of the human body. If you fell sick in 1016, it mattered a great deal where you lived. In Europe, the resident priest would probably tell you&#xa0;that you&#xa0;had made God angry, and&#xa0;that in order to regain your health, you should donate something to the church, make a pilgrimage to a sacred site, and pray&#xa0;fervently for God\u2019s forgiveness. Alternatively, the village witch might explain that a demon had possessed you, and that she could cast the demon&#xa0;out using song, dance and the&#xa0;blood of a black cockerel. In the Middle East, doctors brought up on classical traditions might explain that your <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/humours\" title=\"\">four bodily humours</a> were out of&#xa0;balance, and you could harmonise them anew with a proper diet and foul-smelling potions. In India, Ayurvedic experts would offer their own theories concerning the balance between the&#xa0;three bodily elements known as <em>doshas</em>, and recommend a treatment of&#xa0;herbs, massages and exercises. Chinese physicians, Siberian shamans, African witch doctors, Amerindian medicine men \u2013 every empire, kingdom and tribe had its own traditions and experts, each espousing different views about the human body and the nature of sickness, and each offering its own cornucopia of rituals, concoctions and&#xa0;cures. Some of them worked surprisingly well; others were little short of&#xa0;a death sentence. The one thing that&#xa0;united European, Chinese, African and American medical conditions was that everywhere at least a third of people died before adulthood, and nowhere did average life expectancy exceed 40.</p> <p>Today, if you are taken ill, it makes far less difference where you live. In Toronto, Tokyo, Tehran or Tel Aviv, you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors who learned the same scientific theories in not-too-different medical colleges. They will follow identical protocols and use identical tests to reach very similar diagnoses. They will then dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies. There are still some minor cultural differences, but Canadian, Japanese, Iranian and Israeli physicians hold much the same views about the human body and human diseases. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/life-under-isis-raqqa-mosul-giant-prison-syria-iraq\" title=\"\">Isis captured Raqqa and Mosul</a>, it did not tear down the hospitals; rather, it launched an appeal to Muslim doctors and nurses throughout the world to volunteer their services there. Presumably, even Isis doctors and nurses believe that the body is made of cells, that diseases are caused by pathogens, and that antibiotics kill bacteria.</p> <p>And what makes up these cells and bacteria? Indeed, what makes up the entire world? Back in 1016, every culture had its own story about the universe, and about the fundamental ingredients of the cosmic soup. Today, learned people throughout the world believe exactly the same things about matter, energy, time and space. Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/irans-nuclear-programme\" title=\"\">Iran\u2019s nuclear programme</a>. The whole problem with it is that the Iranians have exactly the same view of physics as the Israelis and Americans. If the Iranians believed that E=mc\u2074, Israel would not care an iota about their nuclear programme.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; their struggle defined what it meant to be western at that moment in history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People still claim to believe in different things. But when it comes to&#xa0;the really important stuff \u2013 how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a weapon \u2013 almost all of us belong to&#xa0;the same civilisation. There are disagreements, no doubt, but then all&#xa0;civilisations have their internal disagreements \u2013 indeed, they are defined by these disagreements. When&#xa0;trying to outline their identity, people often make a grocery list of common traits. They would fare much better if they made a list of common conflicts and dilemmas instead. In 1940, Britain and&#xa0;Germany had very different traits, yet they were both part and parcel of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d. Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; rather, the struggle between them defined what it meant to be western at that particular moment in history. In contrast, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people\" title=\"\">!Kung</a> hunter-gatherer in 1940 wasn\u2019t western, because the internal western clash about race and empire would have made little sense to him.</p> <p>The people we fight most often are our own family members. Identity is defined by conflicts and dilemmas more than by agreements. What does it mean to be European in 2016? It doesn\u2019t mean to have white skin, to believe in&#xa0;Jesus Christ, or to uphold liberty. Rather, it means to argue vehemently about immigration, about the EU, and about the limits of capitalism. It also means to obsessively ask yourself \u201cWhat defines my identity?\u201d and to worry about an ageing population, about rampant consumerism and about global warming without really knowing what to do about it. In their conflicts and dilemmas, 21st-century Europeans are very different from their early-modern and medieval ancestors, but are increasingly similar to their Chinese and Indian contemporaries.</p> <p>Whatever changes await us, they are&#xa0;likely to involve a fraternal struggle within a single civilisation rather than a clash between alien civilisations. The&#xa0;big challenges of the 21st century will be global in nature. What will happen when pollution triggers global climate changes? What will happen when computers replace people in an&#xa0;increasing number of jobs? When biotechnology enables us to upgrade humans, extend lifespans, and perhaps split humankind into different biological castes? No doubt, we will have huge arguments and bitter conflicts over these questions. But these arguments and conflicts are unlikely to drive us apart. Just the opposite. They will make us ever more interdependent, as members of a single, rowdy, global civilisation.</p> <p>\u2022 Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/homo-deus.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em></a> is published by Harvill Secker. <a href=\"http://www.ynharari.com/\" title=\"\">ynharari.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Legion of Christ was founded in Mexico in 1941 by the Vatican\u2019s favourite fundraiser, <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/father-marcial-maciel-and-popes-he-stained-62811?rm=eu\" title=\"\">Father Marcial Maciel</a>. A friend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism\" title=\"\">Pope John Paul II</a>, in his time he made millions of dollars for the Roman Catholic church and recruited thousands of young men into the priesthood. He was feted by wealthy Mexican widows and the neocon right. But that was before he was outed as a serial abuser of children and young men and discovered to have fathered at&#xa0;least three children with two women, whom he kept in luxury apartments in different countries. He <a href=\"http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/414/34/scandal-hit-legionaries-announce-fresh-start-and-denounce-founder\" title=\"\">embezzled funds</a>. He was a drug addict. He was even accused of <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/father-marcial-maciel-dad-sexually-abused-raul-gonzalez-claims-lawsuit-article-1.181520\" title=\"\">abusing his own children</a>. As he was considered too old for a trial, the Vatican quietly retired him to Florida in 2006. He died two years later. But the order he founded struggled on, under new leadership.</p> <p>The year after Maciel died, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/world/middleeast/a-resort-in-galilee-rises-where-jesus-may-have-taught.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">digger on a construction site in the Galilee region hit something solid in the ground</a>. The&#xa0;Legion of Christ had bought the site for $16m in order to build a hotel and retreat centre on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee \u2013 a freshwater paradise of fish and fruit blighted by occasional earthquakes and a long history of terrible politics. Jesus was born and died in the Jerusalem area. But the location for most of his adult ministry was <a href=\"http://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/capernaum.html\" title=\"\">Capernaum in Galilee</a>, just up the road from the construction site. For Christian pilgrims, this tiny area has long been the perfect location for a&#xa0;\u201cJesus experience\u201d.</p> <p>But when experts from the Israeli Antiquities Authority arrived, what they found was the first-century town of Magdala, complete with an extremely rare first-century synagogue. Destroyed by the Romans after the Jewish rebellion some time around AD67, the Magdala synagogue (unlike that in Capernaum) was not overbuilt and so provides a fascinating portal to the world in which Jesus lived and taught. Arfan Najar, the Muslim archeologist who made the original find, showed me around.</p> <p>Still being excavated, this is the important new stop on the pilgrim tour of the Galilee. And scholars are excited at the evidence of how provincial religious life developed for those who were too far away from the Jerusalem temple to visit it regularly. Here, the local synagogue was a hybrid of community hall and teaching space, more a venue to debate the Torah than a quiet place of pious reflection. It&#xa0;was in this argumentative atmosphere that Jesus\u2019s theology developed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21c22ab43c0885916df118b931f9c37361fd3fa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c22ab43c0885916df118b931f9c37361fd3fa1/0_50_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ruins of the ancient city of Magdala with the partially constructed hotel behind it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ruins of the ancient city of Magdala with the partially constructed hotel behind it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Fraser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Magdala was also the hometown of Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus and witness to his death and resurrection. She has been depicted since the early middle ages as a repentant prostitute and even Jesus\u2019s lover or wife, none of which has any basis in the Bible or other historical sources. But as a powerful, single woman in a man\u2019s world, the idea that she was a prostitute has been hard to shake off, despite increasing efforts. This summer <a href=\"http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mary-magdalene-apostle-to-the-apostles-gets-upgraded-feast-day-77857/\" title=\"\">Pope Francis elevated Saint Mary Magdalene</a> to the same level of importance as the apostles. She wasn\u2019t a prostitute. She was an early church leader, \u201cthe apostle to the apostles\u201d as Thomas Aquinas called her.</p> <p>So this is how the Legion of Christ, of all organisations, came to be the custodian of the home town of Mary Magdalene, someone increasingly regarded as the standard bearer for women\u2019s developing role in the Catholic church, and even, for some, for women\u2019s ordination. And it is unsurprising that the organisation has struggled to get it right. In a pamphlet entitled Magdala: God Really Loves Women, the current director of Magdala, Father Juan Solana, compared <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/legionaries-christ-apologize-maciel-magdalene-parallel\" title=\"\">Mary to Marciel himself</a>.</p> <p>They were both people, he wrote, who understood what it was like to be at the centre of a scandal. Father Maciel\u2019s initials \u201care also MM, just like Mary Magdalene\u201d. And, he went on: \u201cWe should be quieter and less condemning.\u201d Solana subsequently apologised and withdrew the pamphlet. But these do not feel like the words of an organisation that has learned its lesson from the scandal that engulfed it. Two thousand years on, and the struggle for redemption continues on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\"><em>@giles_fraser</em></a></p>",

We moved into the Exciting Times, and the relief around the country was palpable. It was as if a dark cloud, slung low across the landscape, misting out the sun, had suddenly lifted. Business could barely contain its rejoicing, the polls soared, the country was permitted to think beyond the cartoonish black and white propositions of the Abbott era. A quick package on science and innovation, a couple of passions. Then a swerve into the tax reform debate, which was supposed to be about reinforcing Turnbull\u2019s intrinsic strengths as some kind of futurist guru, a seer with the mental acuity and entrepreneurial capacity to know how to recalibrate Australia\u2019s economy from a mining boom to something else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"534130db5ea0442dfe8bbb2971bce3e2f8724355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534130db5ea0442dfe8bbb2971bce3e2f8724355/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull announces his new cabinet at a press conference with Julie Bishop on 20 September 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull announces his new cabinet at a press conference with Julie Bishop on 20 September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the tax debate quickly fell into chaos. Turnbull\u2019s tendency to want 100 flowers blooming simultaneously, his venture capitalist instincts to extend mightily, contract sharply when reaching the limits of a concept and recalibrate instantly into the next thought, looked more unsteady than bold. The brash and the rash collided inelegantly into the punishing demands for simple answers generated by a news cycle that throbs in the thrall of the new, lives to punish, and never sleeps.</p> <p>It also became clear that Turnbull and his treasurer, Scott Morrison, were not really on the same page. There were petty power struggles obvious enough to spill over into the public domain. Then competitive federalism enjoyed a short boom, bust cycle. The states would levy their own income taxes. Actually they wouldn\u2019t, because they didn\u2019t want to.</p> <p>The gloss was coming off, and the stampede to an early election was gathering pace.

After an eight week campaign that comprehensively failed to detect and speak to the national mood, Turnbull is back in power by a whisker. His fury at the apparent indifference of fate to what is supposed to be the inexorable rise of Malcolm rang out just after midnight on election night on 2 July: shock, anger, disbelief, utterly unvarnished; the director\u2019s cut.

The conservative wing, apart from the loyal old factional generals, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews, switched over into post-Tony mode, moving on to next generation options, cutting their losses with a person who had failed their common cause.</p> <p>But Abbott is a politician of vaulting ambition. As a person, he\u2019s driven and hyper-competitive. He pushes himself to physical extremity. The events of last September proved to be not an end, but the opening of a new phase.</p> <p>Abbott\u2019s first cycle of rapprochement with colleagues has been contrition. The second has been public forays that are designed to have demonstration effects: they are designed to show that he can lob simple rhetorical bombs that resonate with the base, and pierce the default distraction of ordinary voters going about their lives. Colleagues are invited by inference to compare and contrast the style with the current occupant of the Lodge. </p> <p>Word around the Coalition is Abbott is writing a book about how to be a conservative political party, a new manifesto post Battlelines. The internal feedback in the Coalition suggests Abbott is currently feeling out the landscape, working out where various people are, building bridges, trying to cultivate networks.</p> <p>But Abbott is not the only person positioning out of a calculation that the Turnbull experiment won\u2019t last.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s relationship with his deputy, Julie Bishop, suffered a blow post-election when he very obviously hung her out to dry during the cabinet deliberation about whether or not to anoint Kevin Rudd as Australia\u2019s candidate to lead the United Nations. Bishop is an incredibly hard worker who is assiduous with the backbench, doing what needs doing, being where they need her to be, and in politics, that counts for a lot.</p> <p>Peter Dutton is the most important conservative figure in the parliament. Scott Morrison\u2019s ambition is ever present on Ray Hadley\u2019s morning program on 2GB, more present, in fact, than the consistency of his performance as treasurer.</p> <p>In the next generation Josh Frydenberg is a man on the move if we\u2019ve ever seen one, an relentless networker, a builder of bridges between the moderate wing and the conservative wing. It was notable Turnbull gave Frydenberg climate change when he refashioned his ministry post election, something of a poisoned chalice. A meaty conundrum to occupy a fellow of momentum.</p> <p>Christian Porter also has a lot of fans internally because of his grasp of complex and complicated policy issues. Of the generation beyond, Angus Taylor is one of those parliamentarians who succeeds in putting himself on a travelator, understanding the art of the calculated intervention on issues that colleagues care about.</p> <p>This catalogue of ambition is not meant as one of those dispiriting race call assessments that now pour out of Canberra in substitution for investigations or deep policy analysis, it is not meant to be another manifestation of our apparently endless appetite for instability \u2013 in truth, I\u2019m exhausted by it. The whole system feels diminished and frayed and rudderless.</p> <p>Politicians live to plot, but the political class is also exhausted by the relentless zero sum of the past few election cycles. That exhaustion factor is one component that makes Turnbull\u2019s future hard to predict.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turnbull has been too preoccupied righting the wrongs of 2009 to understand that he\u2019s now in a wholly different phase</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But a few things are clear one year down the track.</p> <p>There were always people inside the Liberal party who were going to resist the Turnbull experiment, because they view him as an interloper, a person in the wrong party, too centrist, too dismissive of conservative shibboleths, too unbound by the conventions of the institutional game of politics, a person without a power base, a person too intent on a frolic of his own.</p> <p>Those people were never going to shift. They were never going to be pacified by charm, or appeasement, by genuflection, or collaboration, they would take it as weakness, and use the weakness to wear him down before tearing him down. Turnbull\u2019s appeasements to enemies have disconcerted the public, damaging the source of his power, his bankable currency for the Liberal party, which has been his strong connection with the public.</p> <p>Turnbull has been too preoccupied righting the wrongs of 2009 to understand that he\u2019s now in a wholly different phase of operation, and time has already wrenched him past the zenith of his authority.</p> <p>Currently he seems preoccupied with having an ideal prime ministership, the prime ministership you would have in the best of times, except there\u2019s a persistent, gnawing vacuum.

  "<p>To my mind spring drinking is all about optimism: as the days slowly, almost imperceptibly, become longer and flowers start to bud and bloom, you want to cast off the dark beers, red wines and unctuous brown spirits for a drink that feels as fresh and new as the season itself.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>1. A better spritz</h2> <p>Future cocktail historians may well date peak Aperol spritz to the summer of 2015-16. The drink has become so trendy in Australia it has been made with Mo\u00ebt, not prosecco, at the spring races \u2013 a tragic betrayal of the drink\u2019s demotic nature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/08/make-your-own-aperol-spritz\">Make your own aperol spritz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, this spritz fever is understandable. It\u2019s hard to shake a taste for the spritz once it has been acquired \u2013 just ask the Venetians, who have been putting them away for almost a century. But just because the Aperol spritz is halfway to becoming the pumpkin spice latte of the cocktail world doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy a cheeky spritz or two this spring: just swap out the Aperol for another Italian aperitivo bitter. </p> <p>Select, the Venetian bitter that claims to be the original spritz base, makes an excellent spritz: dryer than Aperol with a hint of extra bitterness and a whisper of ginger on the palate. The wine-based Cappelletti gives a rounder, smoother spritz, and Amaro Montenegro makes a spritz loaded with tempting citrus and rosewater aromas. </p> <p>For varsity-level spritz variations, pick up a copy of Talia Baiocchi and Leslie Pariseau\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spritz-Italys-Aperitivo-Cocktail-Recipes/dp/1607748851\">Spritz: Italy\u2019s Most Iconic Aperitivo Cocktail</a>, which features more spritz twists than you might ever have thought possible \u2013 including a frankly incredible mai tai spritz from Martin Cate, the man behind the acclaimed San Francisco rum bar <a href=\"http://www.smugglerscovesf.com/\">Smuggler\u2019s Cove</a>.</p> <h2>Make it at home: spritz Veneziano</h2> <p><strong>60ml aperitivo bitter of your choice (Select, Campari, Cappelletti, etc)<br></strong><strong>90ml prosecco<br></strong><strong>30ml sparkling water</strong></p> <p>Build all ingredients in a tumbler or wine glass.

If you\u2019re after something a little more fancy, try it in the classic Cuban cocktail el presidente, below. </p> <p><strong>Tip: </strong>At the bottle shop, make sure you\u2019re getting a sweet white rather than a dry vermouth \u2013 it\u2019s easy to mix up the two.

She also uses these channels to liaise with stakeholders across the health service.

  "<h2><strong>BBC Proms 2016: Verdi Requiem </strong><br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Anyone who doesn\u2019t already know about the screaming heavy metal that is the Dies Irae section of this Proms staple would be well advised to check it out. Scholars who knew about it before hearing it on film trailers can learn more from a chat with conductor Marin Alsop. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment perform with the BBC Proms Youth Choir and soloists Tamara Wilson, Alisa Kolosova, Michael Fabiano and Morris Robinson. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Countrywise: Guide to Britain <br>8pm, ITV</h2> <p>This gentle series is ITV\u2019s answer to Countryfile \u2013 and a decent answer it is, too, featuring bucolic scenes held together by Ben Fogle\u2019s inimitable, plummy charm. As it begins a new spinoff, he\u2019s on the Isles of Scilly, presenting what is effectively a tourism advert for this verdant, virtually crime-free corner of Britain. Elsewhere, Liz Bonnin explores Dorset\u2019s Jurassic coast and Victoria Pendleton gets horsey at Holkham Sands in Norfolk. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Would I Lie to You? </strong><br>8.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>The Rob Brydon-helmed panel show is on its 10th series now, and it has endured for a reason: it\u2019s reliably good \u2013 albeit formulaic \u2013 fun, thanks to the counterintuitive chemistry of David Mitchell and Lee Mack, plus the well-chosen guests. Tonight\u2019s episode features the irascible Michael Smiley, the mordant Diane Morgan, the always\u2011inspired Bob Mortimer (look out for a marvellous riff on early 1980s haircuts) and the game, but mildly bewildered, Nadiya Hussain. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>We Love Sitcom </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>With the Beeb currently, and in some cases ill\u2011advisedly, reworking classic sitcoms, here\u2019s a tie-in quiz show hosted by Ben Miller in which celebrity funny folk test their knowledge of the genre that made them famous. Jennifer Saunders, Stephen Mangan, Jessica Hynes and Lee Mack are among the contestants. As Pointless fans will attest, however, celebrities are useless at quizzes \u2013 none of the luminaries get the Reg Varney question, an old pub quiz chestnut. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Joanna Lumley\u2019s Japan </strong><br>9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Silky of voice and enthusiastic of spirit, Joanna Lumley is the perfect tour guide as she travels 2,000 miles across Japan. This week, she\u2019s in the northern island of Hokkaido before heading to Sapporo, where the annual snow festival is in full swing. She charms the locals, talks to monkeys and hugs an ice sculpture. However, one of the most poignant moments comes when she meets a man who stayed in Fukushima, the site of the devastated nuclear power plant, to look after pets. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>The Strain <br>9pm, W</h2> <p>Series three of the horror drama co-created by Guillermo del Toro. The strigoi, a vampire herd created during an epic underworld disagreement, are rampant in New York and evolving into smarter predators \u2013 another bad day for alcoholic epidemiologist Eph (Corey Stoll) and pest exterminator Fet (Kevin Durand), humanity\u2019s best hopes. As good-but-grumpy ghoul Quinlan, Rupert Penry-Jones offers a masterclass in big speeches delivered through restrictive prosthetics. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>The Roast of Rob Lowe <br>10pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>After holding Justin Bieber\u2019s feet to the fire last year, Comedy Central targets another perpetually boyish celebrity: Wayne\u2019s World and West Wing star Rob Lowe. The roasters lining up to launch near-the-knuckle putdowns at the handsome actor who practically invented the sex tape include David Spade, former Karate Kid Ralph Macchio, quarterback Peyton Manning, Bo Derek and \u2013 perhaps weirdest of all \u2013 our own Jimmy Carr. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Steve Jobs </strong>(Danny Boyle, 2015) Friday, 1.45pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</p> <p>Following the success of his Mark Zuckerberg biopic, The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin penned this portrait of another hi-tech/commercial genius \u2013 the Apple-designer-cum-cult-hero of the title. It\u2019s arranged into three acts, concerning the fraught launches of the original Apple Mac in 1984, the dodgy NeXT computer in 1988 and the beautiful iMac of 1998. Along with the tour de force of screenwriting, Michael Fassbender is a striking mix of technical wizardry, rage and omniscience in the lead role. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Frances Ha</strong> (Noah Baumbach, 2012) 11.05pm, BBC2</p> <p>After working together on Greenberg, director Baumbach and star Greta Gerwig co-wrote this portrait of a 27-year-old dancer. Shifting from the Brooklyn apartment she shares with former college friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner), Frances (Gerwig) goes on a quest for unspecified fulfilment. Shot in black and white, it\u2019s a funny, touching, angsty journey, even if Frances can be infuriatingly self-deceptive. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</strong> (Tomas Alfredson, 2011) 11.10pm, Film4</p> <p>John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s old-school spy George Smiley gets a top-class remake from Alfredson. Cold-war Britain is powerfully evoked in all its down-at-heel detail as Smiley (Gary Oldman) negotiates a mind-bogglingly complex plot of double- and triple-cross. Among the superb cast are Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Paralympics 2016 </strong>Day two from Rio includes the debut of Sophie Thornhill. Later, Hannah Cockroft makes her 2016 bow, and there\u2019s action in the pool and the velodrome. 1pm, Channel 4</p> <p><strong>Tennis: the US Open</strong> Including the mixed doubles final. 5pm, Eurosport 1</p> <p><strong>Championship football: Reading v Ipswich Town </strong>Action from the Madejski Stadium. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 1</p>",

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.  But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can\u2019t blame people for thinking that.\u201d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-08T17:08:40+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 8, 2016 at 10:08am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the post, Clinton recalled sitting down to take a law school admissions test at Harvard.

In August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">US created 151,000 jobs</a> - about 30,000 below expectations. However, on average the US economy added about 230,000 a month over the last three months. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation- longest streak on record. It was also the 77th consecutive month of private sector job growth.</p> <p>The Obama administration insists that the jobs added over the past few months tend to be good, middle class jobs rather than \u201cbad jobs\u201d as Trump described them. According to US labor secretary Tom Perez, education and health sectors have added the most job in the last year, followed by professional and business services.</p> <p>\u201cI use these two examples to highlight what we are seeing in this recovery, which is over the last two to three years, not only do we see a growth in the quantity of jobs but we are seeing a distinct growth in the quality of jobs. More and more middle class and above jobs are being created in the last two to three years,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAnother sector that is really rebounding - especially in the last few months is government, which during the early stages of the recovery it usually recovers really fast but it didn\u2019t. And now we are seeing some real rebound in government jobs, which tend to be solid middle class jobs. I am heartened not just by the number of jobs we are creating but by the quality of jobs that are being created.\u201d</p> <p>One of the main reasons for the delay in recovery in government sector is the sequester - the automatic budget cuts that were included in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Had it been not for the budget cuts championed by Congress Republicans after the 2008 economic crisis, unemployment rate might have been higher, said Perez.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had the investment rates that we saw during the Reagan administration now, we would have an unemployment rate that would be probably two to three tenths of a percent lower than it currently is,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/barack-obama-us-minimum-wage-republicans-tom-perez\">he said</a>. The US unemployment rate is 4.9%. \u201cBut the lingering effect of sequester has a dramatically negative impact on government hiring and it also had on a federal level and on state and local level.\u201d</p> <p>Despite better jobs being created, there are still more than six million Americans who want full time jobs, but are only working part-time at the moment. Additionally, there are 7.5 million Americans who are working more than one jobs to make ends meet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/11/us-economy-recession-republicans-hillary-clinton-policy\">Republicans have themselves to blame for the slow economy, study says</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d1c2eee4b013613fffb61f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-08T20:01:40.739Z\">9.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Esquire Magazine has added an editor\u2019s note to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">a profile of Donald Trump</a> that the Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly cited as proof that he never supported the invasion of Iraq, calling the characterization inaccurate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room.  I was feeling nervous.  I was a senior in college.  I wasn\u2019t sure how well I\u2019d do.  And while we\u2019re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be here.\u2019 And \u2018There\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u2019 It turned into a real \u2018pile on.\u2019 One of them even said: \u2018If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I&amp;#39;ll die.\u2019 And they weren\u2019t kidding around.  It was intense.  It got very personal.  But I couldn\u2019t respond.  I couldn\u2019t afford to get distracted because I didn\u2019t want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.  But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that\u2019s a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to seem \u2018walled off.\u2019 And sometimes I think I come across more in the \u2018walled off\u2019 arena.  And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility.  I don\u2019t view myself as cold or unemotional.  And neither do my friends.  And neither does my family.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared back-to-back on TV Wednesday night to take questions about foreign policy, veterans\u2019 affairs and, in Clinton\u2019s case, her emails. </p> <p>Clinton was criticized for not getting to her points quickly enough for the tight format. Trump was criticized for not having any points to make, instead ordering \u201coff his familiar campaign menu of word salads\u201d, as Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/donald-trump-lies-that-he-opposed-iraq-war-from-beginning-an?utm_term=.wt2E7Y2rwP\">lied about opposing the Iraq war</a>, criticized Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal and repeated his now-boilerplate advocacy of stealing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2013 a measure that he evidently believes would require a minimal force presence, despite the certainty that the well-armed locals might have a problem with their principal source of wealth being plundered by a foreign power.</p> <p>Speaking before an audience of veterans, Trump unexpectedly attacked the current generation of generals and flag officers. The current senior officer corps has been \u201creduced to rubble\u201d, Trump said, and were \u201cembarrassing for our country\u201d. While previously Trump had said he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/13/the-remarkably-unappealling-anger-of-donald-trump/\">knew better than the generals</a> about fighting Isis, this time he intimated that he\u2019d get \u201cdifferent generals\u201d \u2013 a habit more typical of caudillos than American presidents.</p> <p>He followed up by saying his ultimate plan to defeat Isis would be some parts of his still-unspecified plan, and some parts of his unspecified generals\u2019 unspecified plan. He waved away his lack of specifics for a war in which 5,000 US troops are currently serving as not wishing to \u201cbroadcast\u201d his plans to the enemy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/for-clinton-a-skirmish-with-history-from-trump-an-ambush-of-the-facts\">For Clinton, a skirmish with history.

  "<p>A three-week-old baby was among a group of 10 people discovered in the back of a lorry at a motorway service station on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1751777/20-day-old-tot-rescued-from-back-of-lorry-in-watford-after-being-smuggled-from-calais-jungle/\">The Sun reported</a> that the group, mostly from Iraq, had travelled from Calais and spent 10 hours in the Spanish-registered lorry.</p> <p>The alarm was raised at Watford Gap services on the M1 in Northamptonshire after people could be heard banging from inside the vehicle and shouting \u201cno air\u201d.</p> <p>Police who opened the lorry\u2019s doors found the group struggling to breathe in the stifling heat along with the infant. A toddler was also among the group.</p> <p>Richard Glover from Wellingborough told the Sun: \u201cI could see no food or water in the lorry. It had been a muggy night and it was a warm day, so conditions would have been stifling. They could all have suffocated in there \u2013 including the baby.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said the incident was concerning and was being investigated: \u201cWould-be migrants need to be aware that they are putting their lives, and those of their loved ones, at risk by attempting to reach the UK illegally.</p> <p> \u201cThat is why we have increased security and boosted technology used at border controls and are working with law enforcement at home and abroad to target the criminal gangs who are often behind such attempts.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said Northamptonshire police had alerted immigration enforcement officers. Nine of the migrants said they were from Iraq, with another from Iran. </p> <p>They all had medical checks and the infant was said to be healthy. </p> <p>According to the Sun, the parents of the infant paid a people-smuggler to travel from Turkey to Greece before making their way to France. Their six-year-old son, who was not travelling with them, reportedly drowned when the boat he was in sank, killing a further 21 people.</p> <p>The baby was born last month in \u201cthe Jungle\u201d refugee camp that is home to about 10,000 people.
