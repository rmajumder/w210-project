But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating \u2013 the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant.</p> <p>Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. \u201cFor a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth,\u201d Nasa astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics. Europa might be such a place.\u201d</p> <p>The finding, Nasa\u2019s astrophysicist Paul Hertz said, \u201cincreases our confidence that water and other materials in Europa\u2019s ocean, Europa\u2019s hidden ocean, might be ... available for us to study without us landing and digging on those unknown miles of ice\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/feb/04/nasa-europa-mission-has-people-excited\">Why Nasa\u2019s Europa mission has people excited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists have collected clues for decades of an ocean beneath Europa\u2019s icy shell. In 1979, Voyager spacecraft showed that the ice was cracked in some places, like ice floes on Earth, and the 1990s Galileo mission, which spent eight years orbiting Jupiter, confirmed the ocean under Europa. A 2016 study suggested that Europa <a href=\"http://www.space.com/32995-jupiter-moon-europa-energy-life.html\">produces 10 times more oxygen than hydrogen</a>, and a 2014 study suggested the moon may have <a href=\"http://www.space.com/27059-jupiter-moon-europa-plate-tectonics.html\">plate tectonics</a>, qualities that would make it like Earth.</p> <p>Nasa scientists have been working on proposals for a Europa mission for 15 years, and has a tentative plan to send a spacecraft on a flyby near the moon in the 2020s, zipping past its intense, electronics-frying radiation field.

  "<p>Anyone requesting an Uber ride in a 12-sq mile area in the center of Pittsburgh might now be randomly allocated a self-driving Ford Fusion rather than a human-operated vehicle.</p> <p>But passengers riding in Uber\u2019s computer-controlled cars today might be surprised at just how experimental the technology is. According to documents obtained by the Guardian under public records laws, until as recently as June anyone not employed by Uber riding in one of its autonomous vehicles (AVs) had to sign a legal document waiving the company of any liability for their injury or death.</p> <p>One senior Pittsburgh police officer signed a waiver on 23 June: \u201cI acknowledge that some or all of the AVs in which I ride are in a development phase, are experimental in nature, and that riding in an AV may involve the potential for death, serious injury, and/or property loss.\u201d</p> <p>The document was required by Uber\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/info/atc/\">Advanced Technologies Center</a> (ATC), a research hub that in early 2015 hired dozens of robotics experts from nearby Carnegie Mellon University. Since then the ATC has been working furiously to catch up with the likes of Google and Tesla in self-driving technology \u2013 a task Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has described as \u201cbasically existential for us\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/uber-self-driving-cars-pittsburgh-how-driverless-cars-could-change-our-future-lyft-john-zimmer\">How driverless cars could change our whole future | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the summer, ATC ran a \u201cFriends &amp; Family\u201d program that allowed contacts and family members to ride in the same self-driving cars that are now being used in the public trial. </p> <p>The legal document obtained by the Guardian details what might have gone wrong on any ride. \u201cRisks associated with riding in an AV may include, without limitation, those caused by equipment failure, development vehicle operators or other safety drivers, actions of other motorists, weather, temperature, road conditions, negligence or human error,\u201d it says.</p> <p>\u201cNobody has set up software that can reliably drive a car safely without a human,\u201d Kalanick told <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-08-18/uber-s-first-self-driving-fleet-arrives-in-pittsburgh-this-month-is06r7on\">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> in August. \u201cWe are focusing on that.\u201d In the current self-driving Ubers, a human is always in the driver\u2019s seat to cope with technical failures and unexpected situations \u2013 such a family of geese crossing the road. </p> <p>At the moment, self-driving Ubers can be hailed between 7am and 10pm, and only in a downtown area that has previously been meticulously mapped to within centimeters. Uber would not confirm whether the pilot program would operate in challenging weather conditions like heavy rain, fog, snow or ice. All rides are currently free during the trial.</p> <p>While transporting passengers does not materially affect the way autonomous vehicles navigate or drive, it does allow Uber to see how riders react to being driven by a machine. </p> <p>Uber admits it is filming passengers, inside and outside the car, to inform how it develops the technology. Picking up and dropping off customers may be trickier without a human driver to wave to, for example, or to point out a safe place to stop. </p> <p>During the Friends &amp; Family program, users were obliged to assume complete responsibility for riding in Uber\u2019s AVs, including \u201cany risks that may arise from the negligence or carelessness of [Uber and the ATC], operation of the AVs and/or dangerous or defective equipment\u201d. They also had to release the company of liability from beyond the grave, with a clause that stated: \u201cI hereby agree on behalf of myself, my executors, administrators, heirs [and] next of kin\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/us-government-regulators-self-driving-car-proposal\">Self-driving car design needs to involve regulators more, US government argues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Public passengers today do not have to sign any such waiver, and Uber confirmed to the Guardian that all riders in self-driving Ubers are covered by $5m of accident insurance, in line with pending legislation in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that, by not charging for rides, Uber\u2019s pilot program avoids Pennsylvania\u2019s rules for taxicabs,\u201d says Bryant Walker-Smith, a professor at the <a href=\"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/bws\">University of South Carolina</a>. \u201cCourts generally hold that providers of transport for hire have a heightened responsibility for the safety of their passengers.

It could take 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>Kalanick wants driverless self-driving Ubers much quicker than that. \u201cWe are going commercial,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek. \u201cThis can\u2019t just be about science.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/calais-migrant-camp-must-go-by-end-of-year-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">visited Calais</a> on Monday, his first visit since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/francois-hollande-wins-french-election\" title=\"\">he came to office</a> in 2012. He promised that the sprawling, inadequate refugee camp would close \u201cby the end of the year\u201d. Last week, President Hollande\u2019s predecessor in the Elys\u00e9e palace, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37428424\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy, also went to Calais</a>, making the kind of radical statements he believes will earn him the sympathy of far-right voters in the run-up to rightwing presidential primaries due in November. French politics is swerving towards populism; identity politics is overtaking most public discourse. And humanitarian concerns for the fate of the migrants in Calais risk being swamped by electoral politics.</p> <p>On his visit, Mr Sarkozy said France risked being \u201coverrun\u201d by migrants, the kind of rhetoric that sits squarely with the views of Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National, Europe\u2019s largest far-right party, whose ideology is increasingly becoming the reference point in France\u2019s political battles. Mr Sarkozy has also suggested that anyone holding a French passport should accept that their ancestors were \u201cthe Gauls\u201d.</p> <p>France is still reeling from the impact of terrorism. Old tensions between ethnic or religious communities have been exacerbated by a wave of paranoia about minorities and migrants, and it is being cynically amplified by politicians. The left is not entirely innocent. President Hollande, who has yet to announce whether he will seek re-election, recently tried to cast himself as the republic\u2019s bulwark against xenophobia by trying, and failing, to rewrite the constitution to introduce measures to strip dual nationals of their citizenship. One far-left presidential candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/jean-luc-melenchon-leftwing-enters-french-2017-presidential-race\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,</a> has suggested refugees would do better to stay in their own countries.</p> <p>In this dive to the bottom, Ms Le Pen is the winner: polls indicate she is a racing certainty for the second round of the 2017 elections, while so severely is the left divided, its chances of reaching the second round currently appear close to zero. Like the rest of European social democracy, France\u2019s centre-left sees its base fast eroding. Centrist votes are now being courted by an outsider, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/frances-emmanuel-macron-launches-political-movement\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the 38-year-old ex-banker who resigned last month as economics minister to launch the En Marche! (Forward!) political movement. He certainly fascinates the media, but his programme, like his intentions, remains vague.</p> <p>So the main battle is being waged on an increasingly populist right. The exception is Alain Jupp\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/alain-juppe-from-cold-grey-automaton-to-saviour-of-france\" title=\"\">prime minister in the 1990s</a>, whose moderation could be the antidote to Mr Sarkozy\u2019s polarising postures. Mr Jupp\u00e9 believes a steady, principled and inclusive message is the best way to counter the Front National. Elsewhere in Europe, when mainstream politicians have pandered to anti-migrant sentiment, it\u2019s often the populist parties that have gained. That Mr Jupp\u00e9, a 72-year-old Gaullist, looks the best bet against Ms Le Pen says a lot about the weakness of the French left. The stakes have never been higher: and all Europe is watching to see if France\u2019s slide into populism can be averted.</p>",
  "<p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the man who spent a decade grappling with the world\u2019s response to the global refugee crisis, has taken a step closer to becoming the UN\u2019s next secretary general, with the latest in a series of clear victories in a security council straw poll. <br></p> <p>Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister and UN high commissioner for refugees, <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/UN-ELECTION/0100213T2QL/index.html\">strengthened his clear lead</a> in the contest on Monday, maintaining his support as his principal challengers fell back. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/my-replacement-should-be-a-woman-says-un-secretary-general\">My replacement should be a woman, says UN secretary general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, odds rose for a late entrant to the race in the form of the EU budget commissioner, Kristalina Georgieva, after the poll showed weakening support for her fellow Bulgarian, Irina Bokova, the director general of Unesco, the UN education and culture organisation. </p> <p>Bulgaria\u2019s prime minister, Boyko Borisov <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgarian-pm-no-kristalina-georgieva-un-candidacy-for-now-boyko-borisov-irina-bokova/\">suggested earlier this month</a> that he would withdraw support for Bokova if she did not finish first or second in Monday\u2019s ballot, potentiallyclearing the way for Georgieva to replace her. There was no immediate confirmation from Sofia on Monday evening on whether he would deliver on that threat. <br></p> <p>Even if he did, Georgieva would then have to decide whether she wanted to enter a race so far dominated by one candidate. </p> <p>\u201cThe timing might not be right for her,\u201d said a diplomat at the UN. \u201cIt is not as if the field is in disarray. There is a clear leader she would be up against.\u201d</p> <p>In the fifth security council ballot on Monday, Guterres received 12 votes encouraging his candidacy, against two discouraging it in the 15-seat council, with one abstention. It was the same score as the <a href=\"http://www.1for7billion.org/archive-straw-polls\">previous poll on 9 September</a>, but his main challenger then, the Slovakian foreign minister, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, dropped back into third position with eight encourages and seven discourages. The result was behind the former Serbian foreign minister, Vuk Jeremi\u0107, whose score was eight to six. Both men lost support since the last vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/lot-of-factors-east-west-north-south-inside-the-race-for-un-secretary-general\">Deal-making and dirty tricks: inside the race for UN secretary general</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guterres is a surprise frontrunner, as many people had expected the next secretary general to be an east European and a woman, to break new ground. But the former UN refugee chief was generally considered to have performed well in public hearings in the general assembly, and his advocacy on behalf of refugees is seen as important at a time of mass displacement from wars, terrorism and climate change. </p> <p>However, his lead is not decisive. A winner must gain at least nine votes and no vetoes from the five permanent council members. It is possible that one or both of the votes against Guterres come from one of the permanent five (P5). Moscow has said it wants an eastern European as the international community\u2019s next top diplomat. A potential veto will only make itself clear in the next round of voting, on 5 October when P5 states will cast coloured ballots. </p> <p>A Russian veto of Guterres in the face of such broad support could bring western retaliation in the form of vetoes on Russian favourites among the other eight remaining candidates.</p> <p>\u201cIf Guterres is blocked, everyone on the list will be blocked, and we will be looking for new entrants,\u201d said a senior security council diplomat. </p> <p>Georgieva could face the same barriers as Guterres. She is a senior member of the European commission that is currently imposing sanctions on Russia over its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Both Guterres and Georgieva would be expected to be activist secretary generals, using all of the powers in the post to put pressure on the security council on humanitarian issues. For that reason, both may seem unpalatable to Russia, and possibly China too. Moscow was <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/moscow-slams-un-chief-ban-ki-moon-for-syria-comments/articleshow/50908723.cms\">furious with</a> the current secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, when he challenged Russia on its role in Syria earlier this year.</p>",
  "<h2>NEXT UP \u2026 WORLD PEACE</h2> <p>Considering it took them just three years to eliminate racism from football, the Fiver can\u2019t help but feel that, rather than hastily disband the task force they assigned to the job, Fifa might be better advised to put this crack team to work sorting out the many other problems pertaining to colour that continue to blight the game: half-and-half friendship scarves, Sunderland\u2019s emetic mauve and purple third kit and the glaring lack of consistency that means some Premier League referees brandish circular red cards while others prefer rectangular ones.</p> <p>Set up by Sepp Blatter in 2013 to tackle the pressing issue of racism and discrimination in football, Fifa\u2019s website announced at the time that the group \u201chas been tasked with identifying tougher sanctions on the one hand and initiatives in the area of education and prevention on the other, in order to eradicate this scourge on the beautiful game\u201d. Despite several hiccups, most notably the arrest on charges of corruption of its head, Jeffrey Webb, Fifa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/fifa-anti-racism-task-force-russia-2018-world-cup\">has now declared the task force dissolved</a> on the grounds that its work is done. An impressive achievement by any standards, not least when you consider the force tasked with the job didn\u2019t gather for a single meeting for two of the three years of its existence.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The task force was officially disbanded by Gerd Dembowski, who glories in the title of Fifa\u2019s diversity and anti-discrimination manager and must surely be worried for his own future following the elimination of discrimination and bigotry of every kind in the world of football. \u201cI wish I could say that I am shocked by the decision, but unfortunately I am not,\u201d task force member, lawyer and journalist Osasu Obayiuwana said on Sunday. \u201cThe problem of racism in football remains a burning, very serious and topical one, which need continuous attention.\u201d<br></p> <p>With the next World Cup slated to take place in Russia, traditionally a hotbed of racism in football until Fifa sorted it all out, some cynics have suggested that disbanding the task force responsible for solving the problem might have been a tad premature. Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, Fifa\u2019s secretary general, Fatma Samoura, was keen to stress that while the group no longer exists, her employers will continue to act on their recommendations. She also promised that Fifa would commit itself to combatting \u201cnot only racism but any kind of discrimination including violation of human rights\u201d. So, some good news there for the put-upon of this world, not least the families of the many hundreds of migrant workers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while helping to prepare Qatar for another of Fifa\u2019s harmonious global jamborees. <br></p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT!</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Follow Burnley 1-1 Watford</a> with Simon Burnton\u2019s minute-by-minute report at 8pm. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfcd85ee7e8327f24c8757b2c798b361f99403ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfcd85ee7e8327f24c8757b2c798b361f99403ec/468_175_1227_736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Moyes doing some touchline thinking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Moyes doing some touchline thinking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Lee/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to get a better team, it\u2019s as simple as that\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/david-moyes-sunderland-crystal-palace-premier-league\">Sunderland boss David Moyes has his eureka moment</a>.</p> <h2>FOOTBALL WEEKLY LIVE!</h2> <p>AC Jimbo and his pod squad have been allowed to return to London\u2019s London Palladium, and <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/football-weekly-live-in-london-26602443625\">tickets are now available</a> for their show on 15 November.

  "<p>Stephen King has said that listening to Donald Trump\u2019s speeches \u201cis like listening to a piano fall down stairs\u201d, as he admitted that the Republican presidential candidate has a \u201creal shot\u201d of winning this November\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>The horror novelist was speaking <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/libraryofcongress/videos/10153921112813059/\">at the National book festival in Washington DC</a> on Saturday, where he was being honoured by the Library of Congress for his lifelong work promoting literacy. King has long been an outspoken critic of Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/25/stephen-king-joins-hundreds-of-authors-petitioning-against-donald-trump-colm-toibin-lydia-davis\">putting his name to a statement</a> opposing \u201cunequivocally, the candidacy of Donald J Trump for the presidency of the United States\u201d earlier this year, and needling him regularly on Twitter. Earlier this month, he joked that \u201cDonald Trump is actually Cthulhu. The absurd hairdo isn\u2019t absurd at all. It hides the tentacles.\u201d On Sunday, he added that \u201cTexas may go for Trump, but they have a saying for guys like him: \u2018He\u2019s so low, he could put on a top hat and crawl under a rattlesnake.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/768557766231425024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The most basic fact about Donald Trump: If brains were black powder, the guy couldn&#39;t blow his nose.</p>&mdash; Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/768557766231425024\">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/25/stephen-king-joins-hundreds-of-authors-petitioning-against-donald-trump-colm-toibin-lydia-davis\">Stephen King joins hundreds of authors petitioning against Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Saturday, King attacked Trump from a different angle: as a former English teacher, the author spoke about the joys and importance of reading \u2013 and how a decline in literacy means that politicians are able to voice meaningless statements.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the so-called dumbing down of America, but as everyday reading declines \u2013 and it has \u2013 analytical thought also declines. Reading is for fun and for me that\u2019s a big deal, but it also sharpens the nose for the unmistakable odour of bullshit,\u201d said King.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a society where many believe that libraries and other cultural endeavours, everything from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_the_Park_festivals\">Shakespeare in the Park</a> to poetry slams and free concerts, are of minor importance. As if learning to think is a thing that just happens naturally, like learning to walk. Believe me, it\u2019s not. Learning to think is the result of hard work and steady effort.\u201d</p> <p>This \u201cdisregard\u201d for culture, said King, leads to \u201cilliteracy or semi-literacy in a national population where large numbers of people are lazy thinkers without any of that nose for bullshit\u201d.</p> <p>This means, he said, that politicians \u201care allowed to slide by with generalities rather than specifics\u201d, and \u201celected officials who are supposed to be the best, the smartest, often resort to outright misinformation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNote the way that Donald Trump falls back on saying this-and-such is going to be huge or this-and-such is beautiful. Any writer or reader worth his salt will say those words by themselves mean absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump makes me wince not as a Democrat, which I am, but as a writer and reader. Listening to his speeches is like listening to a piano fall down stairs. It\u2019s all dissonance and no music. God, I\u2019m going to miss Obama \u2026 There was poetry, always music, in what he said.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with Ron Charles at the Washington Post, also this weekend, King admitted to being frightened that Trump might actually win this November.</p> <p>\u201cA Trump presidency scares me more than anything else,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/24/master-of-horror-fiction-stephen-king-says-trump-presidency-scares-me-to-death/\">he told Charles</a>. \u201cI would have laughed three or four months ago, but I think that Trump has a real shot. I think that Hillary Clinton has been a lacklustre candidate, frankly, and there\u2019s been a sense of entitlement about her campaign like: \u2018Ah, it\u2019s my turn and I\u2019m running against a buffoon therefore I am already president.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>King, author of novels from It to The Shining, said he believed that the key to the situation was fear. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid the government is going to take away our guns, we\u2019re afraid that Mexico is going to invade the United States, we\u2019re afraid of this, we\u2019re afraid of that, we\u2019re afraid of taxes, we\u2019re afraid of transgender bathrooms \u2013 the whole thing,\u201d he told Charles. \u201cAs long as people are fearful, it\u2019s hard to have a rational discussion.\u201d </p> <p>Speaking at the festival, King also singled out the governor of Maine, his own state, Paul LePage, for criticism. LePage <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-lepage-ziki-fly_us_56c4eaf1e4b0b40245c8e429\">said earlier this year that asylum seekers were bringing the \u201cziki\u201d [LePage\u2019s words] fly to Maine</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/paul-lepage-maine-trump-like-governor\">Paul LePage: is this one outburst too many for Maine's Trump-like governor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe statement is mind-boggling in its own right. That governor LePage might have believed it is more so. That many accept it as a fact is the most mind-boggling of all,\u201d said King, urging his listeners to support reading and libraries, because \u201cthe ability to think clearly and logically leads to good decision-making, and I believe that the ability to think clearly grows along with the ability to read.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor my wife and me, libraries were a lifeline at a time when we could rarely afford books \u2026 and the same is true for others today. We live in a rural state where many, most even, small-town libraries are flat broke. It\u2019s because the small towns can\u2019t afford to support them; and the reason they can\u2019t is because the people in those towns vote for the dough to go to other places. Libraries are not seen as a priority when there are potholes in the road. Sure, cash is tight but it always is,\u201d said King. \u201cThe question becomes how to grow literacy in America, and supporting those small-town libraries is the way my wife and I chose to do it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is generally considered bad luck to toast someone with a soft drink, but in the case of legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/arnold-palmer-us-golf-dies-aged-87\">died at the age of 87</a>, it might just about be acceptable. Although he won more than 90 tournaments in the course of a career spanning over half a century, those of us whose interest in golf extends no further than the 19th hole will remember him chiefly for his favourite thirst-quencher.</p> <p>The Arnold Palmer is, like the man himself, a crowd-pleaser \u2013 a mixture of two American summer classics, iced tea and lemonade \u2013 and the King claimed to have come up with it at home after a morning\u2019s practice. A woman heard him describing it to a waitress, demanded the same, and a classic was born. At first, Palmer was too embarrassed to order it by name, but he got over it; no doubt a lucrative <a href=\"http://arnoldpalmerteastory.com/arizona.html\">licensing contract with a drinks company</a> helped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c0fe940e0569baeea0e3a497ba3260f202dd983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c0fe940e0569baeea0e3a497ba3260f202dd983/0_0_3302_4952/667.jpg\" alt=\"Arnold Palmer the drink.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arnold Palmer the drink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But just like golfers, some Arnold Palmers are better than others. It shouldn\u2019t be too sweet, for a start: its creator was adamant that \u201ciced tea dominates the drink, and if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not really right\u201d. And not just any iced tea, either: Palmer\u2019s wife used to make it herself, and so should you. Stewed breakfast leftovers just won\u2019t do: steep a tablespoon of loose-leaf black tea (or four teabags) in a litre of cold water in the fridge for about four hours, then remove the tea.</p> <p>Decent lemonade is easier to come by, but to make your own, cut up an unwaxed lemon and whiz it up, peel, seeds and all, in a blender with the juice of one and a half more, plus 50g white sugar, a pinch of salt and 550ml water. Then add plenty of ice, and combine with iced tea to taste \u2013 Palmer preferred three parts tea to one part lemonade. He was also partial enough to Ketel One vodka to <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080310005058/en/Ketel-Vodka-Pays-Tribute-Arnold-Palmers-Accomplishments\">endorse it</a> \u2013 which should serve as a hint as to your final ingredient. Just in case there is any truth in the old superstition about toasting without booze \u2026</p>",

To the west, Thailand has some of the best air and sea connections in South East Asia; and to the east, across the narrow strip of Laos, are the markets of Vietnam and China, bursting with the wealth of their new economies and hungry for the flesh, skin, claws and bones of exotic wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\" data-alt=\"The trafficking network\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/wildlife-trafficking-network/giv-1406nXN0sgoCEN4t/\">The trafficking network</a> </figure>  <p>Today the Guardian exposes the crime family that controls this gateway. And we name three mainstream Lao companies with powerful political connections as leading brokers in the global trafficking of wildlife. Together with other suppliers they have been trading many tonnes of elephant tusk, rhino horn and lion bone from Africa and truckloads of tigers, turtles, snakes, monkeys and pangolin anteaters from Asia. A substantial amount of their business is illegal. All of these traders earn a good living; the kingpins are millionaires. All the animals they handle lose their freedom; almost all of them also lose their lives. Some species are now facing extinction as they are shovelled relentlessly into this booming black market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/26/animal-trafficking-cites-criminal-industry-policed-toothless-regulator\">Animal trafficking: the $23bn criminal industry policed by a toothless regulator</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The investigation has been led by a counter-trafficking organisation, Freeland, which is based in Bangkok and has previously exposed key players in this trafficking network. But when law enforcement agencies failed to act, Freeland pushed deeper, working with a Thai government surveillance team, persuading some of the traffickers to talk to them and stepping round the corrupt public officials who guard the network to gather intelligence from reliable police sources in Africa and Asia.</p> <p>Freeland has shared its evidence with the Guardian in the hope it will finally jumpstart cross-border police action against this and other networks. Over the past year, we have followed Freeland\u2019s work, met key informants and the head of the surveillance team, and widened the investigation into other parts of the supply lines that link African bush and Asian forest to the plush new suburbs of Hanoi and Beijing. Told now in full for the first time, this is the story of the Asian connection.</p> <h2>The Asian connection</h2> <p>The secret life of Nakhon Phanom revolves around one crime family, the Bachs. Four wildlife traffickers, speaking independently, name two of the Bach brothers as the key players who control the smuggling gateway from Thailand into Laos: Bach Mai, known to his friends as \u2018Boonchai\u2019, 38; and his older brother, Bach Van Limh, 45. Although they are active in Thailand, the brothers are originally Vietnamese and have networks in both countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f665cfc93d9c2d7a2989e125da7fb61d2062eda/0_0_720_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bachs\u2019 base in Nakhon Phanom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boonchai runs the operation in Nakhon Phanom with a dozen men and a handful of women. The surveillance team has seen them meeting African wildlife traders, unloading meat from refrigerated trucks, loading cars with hidden compartments and delivering a package to local police. Bank records show Boonchai\u2019s girlfriend, who acts as cashier for the business, has sent money to Asian wildlife suppliers. Apart from the export of wildlife through Laos, Thai police intelligence reports also link Boonchai with the importing of drugs from Laos into Thailand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab7c54a5876eb00eb393eb04f62344ba0897fa6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7c54a5876eb00eb393eb04f62344ba0897fa6d/0_10_720_928/388.jpg\" alt=\"Boonchai poses with elephant tusks.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boonchai poses with elephant tusks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His older brother, Bach Van Limh, runs the Vietnamese end, from a town called Son Tay, which is strategically placed just inside the border from Laos and a few hours by road from Hanoi. He originally set up the family business in Nakhon Phanom some 15 years ago but recently left, allegedly after Thai police started investigating his involvement in the drugs trade. In Son Tay, according to Vietnamese police sources, Bach Van Limh is involved in running prostitutes and in smuggling cars as well as wildlife. He owns a hotel, a cafe and legitimate businesses trading gold and placing migrant workers.</p> <p>The Bachs are key players in a busy market, buying from whoever will sell to them. Among numerous smaller suppliers, three Lao companies have been operating for as long as the Bach brothers. One is already notorious in the animal world: the Xeosavang Trading Company run by Vixay Keosavang, who has been hammered by a combination of policing and publicity, much of it organised by Freeland. But just as the Bachs, until now, have escaped public attention, so too have the other Lao companies. Vinasakhone and Vannaseng are big players \u2013 both breaking the law and both still enjoying one of the world\u2019s most destructive trades.</p> <p>All three Lao companies opened wildlife farms in the early 2000s. They imported tigers bred in captivity, which was legal so long as they were used for science and education, not for commercial trade. One of them \u2013 Vannaseng \u2013 illegally imported 2,000 macaque monkeys captured and sold by villagers in Cambodia, according to an internal Lao government report. All three companies went on to break international and Lao law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b544c81b07f111b18b7598771286700724bc93/57_38_587_734/400.jpg\" alt=\"Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leuthai Tiewcharoen aka \u2018Fatty\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At that time, the Bach brothers were already smuggling wildlife, primarily from a dealer widely known as \u2018Fatty\u2019, though his real name is Leuthai Tiewcharoen. He ran a farm in Nonthaburi, just outside Bangkok, where he stored and bred animals he had illegally smuggled into the country \u2013 tigers from Myanmar and Malaysia as well as bears, snakes and turtles. According to a source who worked at the farm, Fatty was earning 500,000 Thai baht ($14,400) a week killing these animals in a special slaughter area and shipping the carcasses eastwards to be used in food and medicine and as jewellery and home decoration.</p> <p>Sometimes, he sent them across the Mekong himself. There was a standard technique that Fatty and other Thai traffickers used, according to the source. The trafficker would go to a remote spot on the Thai side of the river, signal to a contact on the Lao side and drop a carcass in a sealed body bag into the water. The Lao contact would row over, haul the bag back across the river, weigh it and then make a phone call to send money to the trafficker\u2019s bank account. Some of these consignments would go straight into the farms set up on the Lao side of the Mekong by the three big companies. But, according to the source, Fatty also routinely sent carcasses direct to his best smuggling contacts \u2013 the Bach brothers.</p> <h2>The South African link</h2> <p>One day late in 2002 or early in 2003, Fatty came up with a new scheme. He had met an ambitious man called Chumlong Lemonthai, then aged 35, who had been earning a living selling fruit in a street market in Bangkok but who wanted to move into the wildlife trade. Chumlong reckoned he knew somebody who could provide rhino horn, originally sourced from Africa, and bones of big cats from the dry forests of central Thailand. Fatty set up a meeting between Chumlong and the Bach brothers at his farm, hoping to earn a commission as a middleman. At first, it went well. The Bachs brought with them a suitcase containing 40 million baht (about $1m), which impressed Chumlong. He agreed to supply the horn and bones. Then it went bad for Fatty: the Bachs cut him out of the deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436546463470a551b3ceae2c4ecc062ea293f918/0_74_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chumlong Lemonthai.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chumlong Lemonthai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong went on to thrive in the trade and, apart from selling to the Bachs, he made a connection to one of the big Lao companies, Xeosavang, owned by Vixay Keosavang, who was to become notorious as a wildlife trafficker. From his base in Paksan, western Laos, Keosavang was sucking in animals from all over Asia and illegally churning out body parts at up to ten tonnes a week, investing his profit in hotels and a transport business. By 2005, Chumlong was having trouble supplying his customers from the dwindling sources of wildlife in South East Asia, and he decided to move to the biggest potential source in the world, South Africa.</p> <p>There, Chumlong rapidly made friends with Thai sex workers in the bars of Pretoria. Through them, he got to know white South African landowners who bred lions on their ranches. Chumlong commissioned the killing of hundreds of lions and supervised the boiling of their corpses to separate the bones from the flesh. He then parceled up the bones in ten-kilo bags - roughly one bag for each dead animal - and shipped them back to the Bachs and to Keosavang, who variously sold them onwards to Vietnam and China to be boiled and brewed as a cheap substitute for tiger bones in health tonics (although there is no evidence of its medicinal effect).</p> <p>This was potentially illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which allows commercial trade in lions only within set limits. The first two white farmers he dealt with had a licence to export a limited quantity of lion bone, which could be sent to Thailand under cover of official Cites paperwork. However, the evidence also suggests that some of Chumlong\u2019s lion trade was illegal. Often, he would have the teeth and claws of lions smuggled out of South Africa by Thai sex workers; they were helped through Johannesburg airport by an airline worker whose identity is known to the Guardian. In Bangkok, a corrupt airport official guarded Chumlong\u2019s packages as they arrived in Thailand.</p> <h2>The \u2018pseudo\u2019 hunt</h2> <p>With his lion bone business flourishing, Chumlong turned his attention to rhino horn, which was in huge demand in Vietnam after 2007 when a rumour spread that a government official had used it to cure his cancer. The international sale of rhino products is prohibited in Cites, but Chumlong and other Vietnamese traffickers now started to exploit a loophole which allowed hunters in South Africa to take home one set of rhino horns each year as a trophy. They set up \u201cpseudo\u201d hunts in which a willing stooge was paid to stand next to a professional hunter while a rhino was shot dead and had its horn removed. The stooge would then have a photo taken with the corpse and allow their name to be used on the paperwork to take the horn to Asia. There, instead of being displayed as a trophy, it would be sold and ground down for traditional medicine, although rhino horn is materially no different to fingernails and no more effective as medicine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f0c058e1883a594251c7b41a2bf5322ceb5aa5d/0_151_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lion bones are ground and used as a tonic in alternative medicines desired by wealthy Chinese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chumlong started to import stooges from Thailand, paying them 5,000 rand (about $350) for their help. The Bach brothers sponsored some of these pseudo hunts. Paperwork seen by the Guardian shows that at least six members of their extended family travelled from Vietnam to South Africa to take part. Then in a neat money-saving manoeuvre, Chumlong substituted Thai prostitutes from his favourite bar in Pretoria, who played the same role for him without the cost of the international air fare. In this way, Chumlong arranged the killing of dozens of rhinos, earning himself $20,000 a time for their horns, which were shipped back to Keosavang and the Bachs.</p> <p>All this was illegal, though the pseudo hunts gave him the bogus protection of Cites paperwork for their export as trophies. The evidence suggests that Chumlong was also trafficking rhino horn from poachers, whose killing of rhinos in southern Africa escalated fast from 2008 as the demand from Vietnam and China increased. By this time, Chumlong, the former street trader, had bought himself two new houses in Bangkok.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\" data-alt=\"High profit margins\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/09/ivory_prices-zip/giv-140668ah2gcJJjDl/\">High profit margins</a> </figure>  <p>In June 2011, following work by Freeland and a Johannesburg private investigator called Paul O\u2019Sullivan, Chumlong Lemtongthai was arrested by South African revenue officers in a high-profile operation. They seized his laptop, which contained commercial records and photographs recording the death of hundreds of animals and the despatch to Asia of millions of dollars worth of ivory, lion bone, and rhino horn.</p> <p>During one six-month period, the laptop documents revealed, Chumlong had paid a total of $1,394,282.40 to a white South African hunter who was shooting rhinos in his pseudo hunts. The same documents show that Chumlong was paying $6,500 per kg for the horn \u2013 a tenth of the end-user price in China, meaning that for that six-month period his rhino traffic alone was potentially worth $13.9m to those involved. Invoices also revealed the rate at which he was commissioning the death of lions: 327 of them during one two-year period, roughly one every couple of days, for which he personally received some $350,000.</p> <h2>A kingpin falls, but the trade continues</h2> <p>In November 2012, a South African court jailed Chumlong for 40 years, though this was reduced to 13 years on appeal. Bach Van Limh tried to save him, offering $600,000 to a key official in Johannesburg to release him. Chumlong has since claimed that the official was willing to accept the bribe if his money could be paid into an offshore account, but that this alarmed Bach Van Limh, who feared that with no record of the payment, the official would renege on the deal. So Chumlong stayed behind bars.</p> <p>Keosavang was hit hard by the documents in Chumlong\u2019s laptop. A combination of publicity and pressure from the US government finally forced him to step back in early 2014. At the time, his fall was celebrated as a turning point; the removal of the kingpin from the global machine. But when Freeland followed up on their investigation, they found that the Asian connection was as busy as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71ae0a98074caa2c57a10458578df401258e937a/0_44_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rhino mutilated by poachers for its horn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They started to focus on the Bach brothers, who had not been exposed, realising that they were key players. It emerged that Keosavang was not the only kingpin, that the other two Lao companies had been working alongside him for years and were still busy.</p> <p>The Guardian has reviewed compelling evidence that since Keosavang\u2019s decline, Vinasakhone and Vannaseng have been involved in the illegal trafficking of hundreds of tonnes of wildlife from Africa as well as Asia, following the same route used by Keosavang and the Bachs, through Laos and into Vietnam and China. During 2014 \u2013 the first year after Keosavang\u2019s departure \u2013 the evidence suggests that between them they traded $45m of animal body parts including derivatives from three iconic endangered species: tigers, rhinos and elephants. </p> <p>Other evidence separately suggests that both companies have been breaking the law on the farms they opened in Laos in 2002; that Vinasakhone has been illegally killing and selling tigers to order for buyers in Vietnam and China and also selling tigers to the notorious Golden Triangle area on Laos\u2019s borders with Myanmar and Thailand where they are sold as meat, drink and decorative skins; and that Vannaseng, on one of its farms, has been breaching Cites by trafficking hundreds of tigers and bears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a8419ee02f5e9c52d30c1fc03fec21b2c970ae3/62_129_634_380/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boonchai, Keosavang and Bach Van Limh pictured together on holiday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keosavang himself is not known to have been directly involved in wildlife trafficking since 2014.

The team have photographed multiple visits by two South African lion bone merchants with whom Chumlong was working. They have also identified one of Boonchai\u2019s men as a Thai courier, known as \u2018Jimmy\u2019, who was caught at Johannesburg airport after Chumlong\u2019s arrest and convicted of attempting to bring undeclared cash into the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec614d22b2639cfbf3363a90b1af7001243bad3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec614d22b2639cfbf3363a90b1af7001243bad3b/166_12_379_473/379.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Daoreung Chaimat.\" width=\"379\" height=\"473\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay Daoreung Chaimat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thai police have traced a sequence of payments from the Bachs to other animal dealers including a 40-year-old Thai woman, Jay Daoreung Chaimat, whose \u201czoo\u201d was raided by Thai police in 2010. She was married to a police officer and was said to have other good police contacts. After the raid, she travelled to Bangkok and lobbied senior officials to sack the officer who had organised it. Following an inquiry by the Thai Anti Money Laundering Organisation, Amlo, a court in May 2014 ordered her to hand over $35.6m as the proceeds of crime. This year the order was revoked. Her Facebook page displays a photo of her smiling over a basket full of cash.</p> <p>In a town with few sources of wealth, the surveillance teams have identified warehouses, apartment buildings and a nightclub as Bach properties and videoed the Bachs and their men driving a fleet of new high-end vehicles, some of which have had their licence plates changed. Members of the surveillance teams have backgrounds in military and police work and believe that some of the network are carrying firearms and using sophisticated anti-surveillance tactics, putting two or three people on their boss\u2019s route to see if he is being followed.</p> <p>One of the sources in the network says that they have been working on a new product: a pill made up of blood from a cobra mixed with powder ground from tiger bone. He says they reckon they can sell it for $300 a pill.</p> <h2>The main players</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileOne/embed.html\" data-alt=\"1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileOne/embed.html\">1</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileTwo/embed.html\" data-alt=\"2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileTwo/embed.html\">2</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileThree/embed.html\" data-alt=\"3\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileThree/embed.html\">3</a> </figure>  <h2>The network</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileFour/embed.html\" data-alt=\"4\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileFour/embed.html\">4</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileFive/embed.html\" data-alt=\"5\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileFive/embed.html\">5</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileSix/embed.html\" data-alt=\"6\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileSix/embed.html\">6</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileSeven/embed.html\" data-alt=\"7\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileSeven/embed.html\">7</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileEight/embed.html\" data-alt=\"8\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileEight/embed.html\">8</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileNine/embed.html\" data-alt=\"9\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/wildLifeProfileNine/embed.html\">9</a> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Tomorrow: the political corruption behind the Asian connection</strong><br></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Poor Douglas Carswell. On Twitter last week he confused the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon and got crushed by the far stronger forces of social media.</p> <p>It all happened so quickly. To illustrate the point that Britain trades more with its near neighbours in Europe than larger but more distant economies such as the US or China, <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/16479\">Paul Nightingale</a>, professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, tweeted a gravitational analogy that drew a brisk response from Carswell:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DouglasCarswell/status/777610290502524929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nightingale_P\">@Nightingale_P</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon\">@DuncanWeldon</a> actually it&#39;s the gravitational pull of the sun.

An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=askcarswell&amp;src=typd\">#AskCarswell hashtag</a> soon popped up to poke further fun at the member for Clacton and the story was gleefully <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/douglas-carswell-tides-ukip-experts-science-mp-a7318461.html\">picked up by the press</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy1Hunt/status/778272793943212032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskCarswell?src=hash\">#AskCarswell</a> Why are OUR tides controlled by unaccountable (heavenly) bodies OUTSIDE THE UK?

In the eyes of many Carswell already has a difficult relationship with facts, revealed by his loud insistence during the referendum campaign that the UK would be better off to the tune of \u00a3350m a week if it left the EU, a claim repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/uk-statistics-chief-vote-leave-350m-figure-misleading\">debunked by the head of the UK Statistics Authority</a>. He had also been patronising in responding to the Sussex professor, <a href=\"surprised%20head%20of%20Science%20research%20at%20a%20university%20refutes%20idea%20sun's%20gravity%20causes%20tides.\">expressing surprise</a> that the \u201chead of Science research at a university refutes idea sun\u2019s gravity causes tides\u201d. Yet it\u2019s also true that Carswell was less wrong than many people realised. One tweeter pointed out that the sun\u2019s gravitational influence on the tides is actually <a href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tide.html\">about 40% that of the moon\u2019s</a>, which was news to me \u2014 and I have a degree in physics. </p> <p>Judging from his timeline, Carswell has so far admitted no scientific error. Instead he tried to move the conversation back to trade and Brexit (though even here, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nightingale_p/status/777777622365401088\">weight of evidence appears to be on Nightingale\u2019s side</a>). I suspect he was mildly embarrassed by the faux pas but felt little desire to acknowledge as much before the sneering chorus on Twitter. Why expose yourself to further mockery? But I\u2019m speculating here \u2013 I\u2019ve never met Carswell so don\u2019t really know what makes him tick. </p> <p>Today, the incident is largely forgotten. Just another twitterstorm in a teacup. But the trouble is that this is how it goes day after day on social media. Thanks to the internet, communication far beyond our real life social circles has never been easier but it\u2019s hard to escape the impression that the quality of our public discourse has never been poorer. Carswell\u2019s gravitational spat may pale beside the pervasive currents of misogyny, racism, homophobia, antisemitism and islamophobia that wash daily across the online world, but the descent into mockery and vitriol is all too rapid, whatever the topic. When was the last time you saw an enlightening exchange between a Corbynista and a Blairite?</p> <p>What is it about life online that unleashes our inner demons? We seem to have made a leap in technology for which evolution, in its blind stumbling, has not prepared us. Most likely it is another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect\">distancing effect</a>, this time due to computerisation. We might now be able to connect with half the world but we do so from behind a keyboard. The faces \u2013 and the humanity \u2013 of the people that we interact with are easily lost in the rapid fire of typed exchanges. It is little wonder that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">some newspapers are closing down their comment threads</a>. Though this may partly be for economic reasons, it is surely also an acknowledgement that they add little to public debate.</p> <p>I\u2019ve succumbed myself from time to time \u2013 and in these pages. I have on occasion taken exception to what I felt to be largely ill-founded critiques of science and scientists by the Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins, and responded with outrage, with mockery and with facts. But after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/jun/10/scientists-human-as-simon-jenkins\">the latest exchange</a>, I paused to re-consider. It might have been cathartic to vent my frustration and then to be cheered from the sidelines by friends and followers (almost all of them of a scientific stripe), but to what real end? We just seemed to be talking past one another. </p> <p>So I tried a different tack. I bought a copy of one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/25/vital-question-lifes-greatest-secret-reviewed\">my favourite popular science books</a> (Matthew Cobb\u2019s Life\u2019s Greatest Secret) and sent it to the columnist with a conciliatory note, to follow up on the offer of buying him a drink that I had appended to my latest broadside. And blow me if he didn\u2019t email back to accept the invitation. </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago we met in a quiet bar around the corner from where I work and over a couple of pints of a rather tasty Kent lager talked about science, universities, Brexit, grammar schools, Northern Ireland, and the travails of online discourse. I won\u2019t go into specifics since it was a private encounter but, while we still might not agree on everything, face-to-face there was plenty of cordiality and common ground. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/22/the-web-we-want-how-do-we-make-the-guardian-a-better-place-for-conversation\">How do we make the Guardian a better place for conversation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cTwo people who write for the Guardian had a drink and found that they agreed on some stuff?

Although anonymity is often blamed for online rudeness, it can also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-psychology-of-online-comments\">foster participation and risk-taking</a>, opening up new opportunities for discussion. But how do we find the right balance between open, constructive argument and ending up in an echo-chamber? This question is at the core of the Guardian\u2019s laudable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/the-web-we-want\">The Web We Want</a> campaign.

On Twitter I try to use the mute button sparingly \u2013 only when the rancour gets too much. Each time I do feels like a defeat but I just don\u2019t have the time or the heart to engage with <em>every</em> dispute. And although it\u2019s not possible to have a drink with everyone you end up arguing with on the internet, I have resolved to try to imagine doing so. That strategy will make little headway with the out-and-out trolls or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts\">shitposters</a>, but there are still plenty of people of good faith out there that I disagree with profoundly.

As Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), points out, it is unusual for trade agreements such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/internationaltrade\">Trans Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) to take center stage in a presidential election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

Public statements by both nominees on key issues, as well as their publicly available lobbying records, have been documented by the Washington DC-based Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and its Opensecrets.org site, which together provide a rich trove of data about the issues major technology companies care about in the context of this year\u2019s elections. </p> <h2>Google: anti-competitiveness, labor issues and copyright</h2> <p>According to CRP, the number one technology company spender on lobbying is Alphabet, the parent company of Google. So far in 2016 (up to the last CRP update on 9 August), Alphabet has already spent $8.04m on lobbying \u2013 putting it on pace to spend a little less than the $16.66m it spent for the whole of 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/google-lobbyists-congress-antitrust-brussels-eu\">Revealed: how Google enlisted members of US Congress it bankrolled to fight $6bn EU antitrust case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The top issues Alphabet attempted to tackle with that money were copyright, patent and trademark issues (a common item for all the tech companies on the list), labor, antitrust and workplace issues, consumer product safety, science and technology \u2013 and homeland security.

The company used that money to lobby on issues around computers and technology, taxes, consumer product safety, transportation and trade. </p> <p>It was also no surprise to see Amazon lobbying on issues related to aviation, airlines and airports \u2013 given its involvement in both the use of drones and shipping goods by air. </p> <h2>Facebook: national security, intelligence and patent law</h2> <p>Facebook is the third-largest lobbying spender, according to CRP, spending $4.97m so far this year. And it has a lot of government issues to care about. </p> <p>Homeland security, intelligence, computers and information technology, copyright, patent and trademark issues \u2013 and taxes \u2013 make up the top five issues on which it has chosen to lobby. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/us-tech-firms-visas-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-immigration\">Facebook, Apple and Amazon to lobby next president over tech worker visas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amongst the bills on which Facebook has offered comment is the \u201cRequiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act\u201d \u2013 which the Washington-based Center for Democracy &amp; Technology criticized as requiring \u201call providers of Internet communications services to report to government authorities when they obtain \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of apparent \u2018terrorist activity\u2019 on their services\u201d. </p> <p>Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg has also been very active in lobbying for immigration reform.

David Axelrod, the former chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama, has a great story in his 2015 memoir, <em>Believer,</em> in which he describes a phone conversation with the late Apple cofounder, Steve Jobs \u2013 one in which Jobs appeared to be deeply unimpressed with political media consultants, despite Jobs having requested the meeting after a personal visit from then Senator Barack Obama to Apple\u2019s offices in Cupertino. </p> <p>Axelrod quotes Jobs as saying: \u201cWhat your industry does, if you can call it an industry, is bullshit.

  "<p>Colombians are facing their most important vote in at least 50 years. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/colombian-president-juan-manuel-santos-sign-peace-deal-with-farc-rebels-today\">peace negotiations concluded</a> between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/farc\">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (Farc) guerrillas, Colombia needs to decide whether to support the peace agreement on the table, or reject it in favour of the continued use of violence to resolve the conflict.</p> <p>As ever with this kind of decision, there are many compromises to be made; the pursuit of peace is often balanced precariously with the pursuit of justice. But while we should perhaps leave the ethical considerations up to Colombians to decide, one thing seems obvious.<br></p> <p>If Colombians are interested in development \u2013 in social progress and more equality, better infrastructure, good quality schools, functioning healthcare for all, more foreign investment and jobs, rising wages; in short, in living up to their country\u2019s potential as one of the world\u2019s great 20th century success stories \u2013 then they need to vote for an end to the conflict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/18/colombia-women-frontline-making-peace-last-ceasefire-grassrooots-activism\">Women are on the frontline of making peace in Colombia last | Yifat Susskind and Stella Duque</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Violent conflict is the nearest thing there is to de-development. Evidence <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/documents/Development.and.Conflict2.pdf\">has shown</a> that the more violence there is in a region or country, the less development. It is fairly obvious why. How can you set up schools and hospitals when there is a danger they will be bombed? Where will the doctors and teachers come from? And how can businesses grow if they are in constant fear of losing their investments, or having to pay off armed groups? </p> <p>No business means no jobs; no schools means no education. No development. De-development, in fact, because existing schools, hospitals and businesses may fall into disuse or go under. </p> <p>Of course, the relationship also works the other way. Factors such as inequality and human rights violations provoke grievance and lead to conflict. The social conflict that has divided Colombia into haves and have-nots for centuries is not about to miraculously disappear, but breaking the vicious cycle offers a chance for differences to be aired in political debate rather than mountain skirmishes, and for development initiatives to get a stronger footing in often remote areas. <br></p> <p>The danger is that post-conflict scenarios can also be highly violent. There has already been a demobilisation in recent Colombian history, of the right-wing paramilitary forces. But many are concerned that, rather than return to civilian life, many former members of these organised terrorist forces simply formed criminal gangs and continued to wreak havoc among defenceless communities, controlling not only the illicit drug trade but also many legitimate businesses and government positions.<br></p> <p>The end of civil war does not mean the end of violence. El Salvador and Honduras have proved that. Moreover, there are countries, like Mexico and Jamaica, where there has been no formal armed conflict in living memory, but where incredibly high levels of violence can often be just as antagonistic to development efforts.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time for a new designation to describe countries that have no formal conflict, but where violence is so rife that it seriously and systematically affects efforts to govern and develop. Violence-affected states?<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/20/colombia-city-of-women-safe-haven-from-violence-conflict\">Colombia's City of Women: a haven from violence | Sibylla Brodzinsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assuming Colombia does vote for peace, there are three priorities.<br></p> <p>First, a huge peace dividend must be felt by all sections of society. Those who have suffered under the poverty and inequality that has accompanied the prolonged civil war need to feel this most. Then there will be the \u201cno\u201d voters, who still need convincing that a decisive rejection of violent conflict is the best way forward for Colombia, and who could yet stand in the way of a successful peace.<br></p> <p>Second, the already significant focus on improved governance, accountability and democratic institutions must continue. These areas have suffered greatly as people of violence have taken control of important levers of power. Only gradually, and with care, can corruption be rooted out.<br></p> <p>Finally, a focus on security is needed. The development sector has sometimes failed to appreciate the importance of investing in policing and security interventions. However, in a post-conflict situation where people are expecting less violence but the threat of more is just around the corner, security has to be a key priority. It is incredibly difficult to get right \u2013 especially as Colombia\u2019s security services have themselves been strongly implicated in corrupt and violent practices \u2013 but it cannot be ignored.</p> <p>For these reasons and many others, the international community will be needed more than ever if Colombians vote \u201csi\u201d. Rather than exiting the scene as though the job were done, international agencies \u2013 both official and non-governmental \u2013 should be doubling or tripling their presence and levels of investment. The history of Colombia and of countless other conflict countries shows that a return to violence of some kind is, depressingly, a likely scenario.</p>",

From her point of view it\u2019s a smart strategy, trying to demonstrate she is her own person, allowing her to have her cake and eat it, but it doesn\u2019t seem fair on DC, who has treated her well,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>There was further concern within No 10 when May was \u201cplaying her cards close to her chest\u201d during a conversation about the EU in cabinet. \u201cHer sphinx-like approach is becoming difficult, with the press questioning which way she will jump. The conversation turns around this being the biggest thing the PM has faced and him not even knowing if the home secretary is backing him,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Cameron ended up telephoning May during a train journey to Chippenham for a speech and demanded she make her position clear. \u201cWhen he hangs up he seems to think he\u2019s made an impact,\u201d Oliver wrote. \u201cLater, the home secretary issues a statement saying she believes there\u2019s \u2018the basis for a deal here\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThis is interpreted as the moment she climbed down off the fence. After all the concern around her, it all seems to have ended not with a bang, but a whimper.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan Smith said: \u201cCraig Oliver\u2019s is one of a growing number of foolish attempts by ex-government remainers who lost to shift responsibility for their failure. The grown-up thing for them to do, instead of carping, is to show some humility and get behind Theresa May as she seeks to get back control of migration with the EU as we leave.\u201d</p>",

Disabled children are overwhelmingly represented, and can remain in institutionalised care for life. Harrowingly, young adults raised in institutions are <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/stories/8-million-children-are-institutions\">500 times more likely kill themselves</a>. </p> <p>For the last 13 years DRI has been working on a worldwide <a href=\"http://www.driadvocacy.org/learn-about-the-worldwide-campaign-to-end-the-institutionalization-of-children/\">campaign</a> to shut down orphanages and institutions that, in far too many cases, neglect or even abuse the rights of the children. In particular, they focus on people with disabilities. Over their years of research, DRI has documented abuse within state-run, and donor-funded facilities \u2013 including orphanages and psychiatric wards \u2013 from the Ukraine to Guatemala. In the process they have exposed institutionalisation as a worldwide human rights issue.</p> <p>Last year, when investigating Mexican institutions for children with disabilities, DRI found \u201catrocious abuses that fall inside the definition of torture\u201d. Investigators recorded prolonged use of restraints in centres \u2013 like those in San Luis Gonzaga \u2013 that caused high levels of suffering, physical deformities and dislocations. Any restraint of people with mental disabilities \u201ceven for a short period of time, may constitute torture and ill-treatment\u201d, according to the UN\u2019s rapporteur on torture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Dent</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Paraguay, researchers found autistic children locked in cages at a state-run hospital.

Children classed as level three or four were considered to be \u201cuneducable\u201d, and were expected to remain in an institution for life.</p> <p>Though the organisation has come across well-equipped, clean facilities and many families believe they\u2019re doing the right thing for their children, DRI\u2019s president Laurie Ahern maintains \u201cthere is no such thing as a good orphanage. Nothing replaces a family. Children still have psychological and developmental delays \u2013 you need someone to look into your eyes, a primary caregiver, and that doesn\u2019t happen in an orphanage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven in the best of institutions children don\u2019t get their full needs met,\u201d says Helen Dent, professor of clinical and forensic psychology at Staffordshire University. Dent watched DRI\u2019s videos from the institution in Mexico, and her impression is of a \u201cclean and modern\u201d facility where \u201cthe staff are trying to care for the children with apparently few resources\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThe young man banging his teeth against the cot side was clearly in need of adult attention both to stop him from self-harming and to provide positive stimulation to remove the need for self-harm. Most people kept in such circumstances would suffer serious consequences and show unusual behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>The alternative, argues DRI, should be that development funding is moved to community- and family-based care.

DRI, Lumos and other organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.replace-campaign.org/\">Replace Campaign</a> all support the idea that we should change this culture of institutionalisation and work on keeping families together, supporting communities, and improving social networks. Lumos believes that the institutionalisation of children can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/17/jk-rowling-fairytale-orphanage-lumos\">eradicated globally by 2050</a> (backing this statement with figures including the 70% reduction of the number of children in institutions in Moldova over the last decade, despite the country\u2019s high poverty rates).</p> <p>There is also an economic argument, Ahern adds: \u201cIt\u2019s so much less expensive for government to support families to [help] children with disabilities go to school, than it is to pay to keep them in an orphanage for a long time.\u201d For example, in Tanzania\u2019s Kagera region, the yearly cost for one child in institutional care is <a href=\"https://wearelumos.org/sites/default/files/In%20Our%20Lifetime_2015_Sept2015_0_0.pdf\">reportedly $1,000</a> (\u00a3770) \u2013 six times the cost of supporting a child in foster care.

  "<h2>1) Cahill and Ivanovic in the firing line <br></h2> <p>The moment that summed up the discord in the Chelsea defence came on 64 minutes, when Gary Cahill wanted Thibaut Courtois to come to collect; the goalkeeper stayed on his line and Branislav Ivanovic bludgeoned the ball into touch. Cahill and Courtois argued. But errors had disfigured the performance to leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/24/arsene-wenger-gift-arsenal-chelsea-ozil-football\">Chelsea 3-0 down at half-time</a>: it was shocking, for example, to see how easily Mesut \u00d6zil accelerated away from the defensive midfielder N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 before he scored Arsenal\u2019s third. Antonio Conte did not cancel his players\u2019 day off on Sunday but they can expect a video inquest when they return to Cobham and the manager will, surely, consider changes. John Terry is almost fit again while Marcos Alonso is pushing for inclusion. Conte, who tried a 5-2-3 formation in the second half, said that he would not sleep for two nights. Cahill and Ivanovic are most obviously in the firing line. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Arsenal 3-0 Chelsea</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/granit-xhaka-arsenal-arsene-wenger-francis-coquelin\"><em>\u2022 Coquelin injury gives Xhaka chance to stake claim for place</em></a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/24/antonio-conte-we-are-a-great-team-on-paper-not-on-the-pitch-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54gcd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2747938\"            data-video-name=\"Chelsea's Antonio Conte: \u2018We are a great team on paper, not on the pitch\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e6df0ce4b03598d1ce847e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/24/160924Conte_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/24/160924Conte.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/24/160924Conte_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/24/antonio-conte-we-are-a-great-team-on-paper-not-on-the-pitch-video\">Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte: \u2018We are a great team on paper, not on the pitch\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>2) Barkley left in the shade by resurgent Wilshere<br></h2> <p>Ronald Koeman was in no mood to chew the fat after Everton\u2019s disappointing performance in their defeat by Bournemouth. His side were second best throughout, with the presence of Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley hardly felt. \u201cI don\u2019t answer about that question,\u201d said a prickly Koeman, when asked for his thoughts on Barkley\u2019s lacklustre display on the south coast. It was not just Barkley who struggled to stamp his authority on the game although Jack Wilshere\u2019s best performance in a Bournemouth shirt to date did little to remove the spotlight from Barkley, who other than heading wide in the second half was chasing shadows for much of a one-sided affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like that every game I need to explain the performance of Barkley,\u201d the Dutchman said. Everton lacked the attacking midfielder\u2019s impetus, which frankly goes missing far too often. Everton also sorely missed the left-back Leighton Baines, out with a hamstring injury. Bryan Oviedo, who again deputised for the defender, struggled to contend with the goalscorer Junior Stanislas while Idrissa Gueye and Gareth Barry never had a grip on the midfield. A return to Goodison Park is on the horizon, against an in-form Crystal Palace on Friday, where Koeman will doubtless ask for considerably more from Barkley and others who under-performed. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/bournemouth-everton-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 1-0 Everton</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/jack-wilshere-step-back-in-time-bournemouth-eddie-howe\"><em>\u2022 Wilshere lauded for \u2018step back in time\u2019 by Howe</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1791728870b69516f0318bdc6163f3bf916a5ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1791728870b69516f0318bdc6163f3bf916a5ee5/100_181_3044_1826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bournemouth v Everton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross Barkley made little impact for Everton at Bournemouth while Jack Wilshere impressed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Liverpool\u2019s options and flexibility leave Hull on the floor<br></h2> <p>There was no point pretending Ahmed Elmohamady\u2019s early dismissal changed the context of a one-sided match at Anfield and, to his credit, Mike Phelan made no attempt to do so. \u201cLiverpool are flying at the moment,\u201d said Hull City\u2019s caretaker manager on what was his miserable 54th birthday. \u201cYou come to a newish Anfield and there are more supporters, more expectations and a real desire to achieve something. It is difficult to play against a team in that mood with 11 men, or even 12.\u201d Again, Liverpool\u2019s prowess and range of options in front of goal was notable. It is now 24 goals in eight matches for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team this season compared to six at the corresponding stage of last season. But what also impressed in Liverpool\u2019s latest eye-catching display was the willingness and ability of players to adapt to new demands from their manager \u2013 Jordan Henderson as a holding midfielder, James Milner commanding at left-back, for example \u2013 and relentless counter\u2011pressing throughout the team. \u201cThe rule is be an option or be protection,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIf you are not involved in offensive situations then protect. The centre-halves can do what they want at set-pieces but otherwise they are always in a protective situation. But for the rest it is about being creative, changing, movements.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/liverpool-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Liverpool 5-1 Hull City</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/jurgen-klopp-adam-lallana-hard-work-liverpool\"><em>\u2022 Lallana being rewarded for hard work, says Klopp</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8c3a7100d9c2d1e9478f6a8dd7881806600df4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8c3a7100d9c2d1e9478f6a8dd7881806600df4/0_15_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Lallana turns away from Hull\u2019s Ryan Mason during Liverpool\u2019s 5-1 win at Anfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Lallana turns away from Hull\u2019s Ryan Mason during Liverpool\u2019s 5-1 win at Anfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Ranieri has work to do on Leicester\u2019s ailing defence<br></h2> <p>Leicester City\u2019s 4-1 hiding from Manchester United was largely due to the concession of three goals from corners. This is a rare occurrence at the game\u2019s highest level and Danny Simpson conceded the rule change concerning pulling and pushing in the area is affecting the Foxes\u2019 ability to defend as robustly as last term. Then, solidity in defence was the rock on which their championship triumph was founded. The right\u2011back said: \u201cIt is in your mind. It is something we have to learn to adapt to as players. They have changed the rules. The way it was last season, I thought we were very good at defending set pieces and we made it tough for the opponents and you have been doing that for all your career and suddenly you have got to change it, but it\u2019s the same for everyone, it\u2019s something we have got to work on and look at.\u201d Leicester have now lost as many games this term as in all of last year (three). They host Porto on Tuesday in the Champions League, then Southampton on Sunday in the league. Claudio Ranieri has some work to do on the training ground to eradicate his side\u2019s issues in defence or they face losing more games in the same manner. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/juan-mata-wayne-rooney-manchester-united\">Juan Mata\u2019s mastery may push Wayne Rooney to Manchester United margins</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/manchester-united-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Manchester United 4-1 Leicester City</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united\"><em>\u2022 Paul Wilson: Mourinho scorns expert opinion but is quick to change himself</em></a></p> <h2>5) Son\u2019s sparkling run of form timed to perfection<br></h2> <p>Having scored four Premier League goals this season, as many as during the entire last campaign, Son Heung-min is in blistering form.

Son not only has ample energy and impressive strength but he seems to have added a decisiveness to his finishing in recent weeks.

Pochettino will be hoping the 24\u2011year\u2011old can continue to excel during a crucial week, with Spurs potentially depleted for games against CSKA Moscow and Manchester City.

In fairness, the performance on Saturday against West Bromwich Albion offered some grounds for optimism despite the concession of a late equaliser, the goal again coming from a set piece. Stoke were generally vibrant and the attacking trio of Marko Arnautovic, the fit-again Xherdan Shaqiri and, in particular, Joe Allen played very well. But still the Stoke attack did not function as well as it needs to and that was because Wilfried Bony still looks short of peak fitness. The Ivorian was good when he got the ball but his relatively limited mobility meant that was not very often. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get him up to speed as quickly as possible,\u201d said Hughes, who can at least take hope from the fact that Bony seems to be progressing, as his fourth appearance for Stoke was his best yet, even if not yet good enough, and certainly not on a par with that of Albion\u2019s Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n. The Venezuelan is emerging as one of the best forwards in the league at leading a line on his own. Hughes needs Bony to find Rond\u00f3n\u2019s dynamism and finishing soon, otherwise his prophecy looks doomed and his future bleak. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/sep/25/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/stoke-city-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Stoke City 1-1 West Bromwich Albion</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/23/tony-pulis-1000th-match-manager-west-brom-stoke\"><em>\u2022 Tony Pulis interview: \u2018You get pigeonholed.

Partly attributable to Alan Pardew\u2019s sometimes underrated coaching nous, this also reflects excellent summer recruitment. Losing Scott Dann and Wilfried Zaha to injury last week proved surmountable with the \u00a310m invested on James Tomkins seemingly money well spent. \u201cPalace have bought so well,\u201d David Moyes said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sold Yannick Bolasie to fund buying Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend but you\u2019ve got to say \u2018good on them\u2019.\u201d Palace\u2019s net summer spend was almost \u00a38m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/david-moyes-sunderland-crystal-palace-premier-league\">Sunderland\u2019s nearly \u00a321m</a>.

That was the viewpoint of Swansea City\u2019s Mike van der Hoorn, after he conceded the penalty that helped Manchester City maintain their winning start to the Premier League season. The Dutch defender insisted he had done nothing wrong when he challenged Kevin de Bruyne, even if the referee, Neil Swarbrick, saw it differently. \u201cI have watched it back and I did hit him but I do not think it was a penalty,\u201d Van der Hoorn said. \u201cIt is a natural movement for a defender who wants to make himself big and use his body, he is a lot smaller than me so when we battle like that his head is around the height of my elbow. He fell because he had nowhere to go and he thought he would fall and hope for a penalty, and the ref gave it.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if decisions like that go for big clubs, he said: \u201cThey do. I played for Ajax in Holland and as a top club those things go for you. That is how you can become champions, those little things. The big clubs get the big decisions. Ajax are a big club and we would get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d Swansea could count themselves unlucky to lose after a spirited performance, particularly from Leroy Fer and Fernando Llorente. That will be of little solace to manager Francesco Guidolin, who nonetheless insisted afterwards he is not feeling the pressure. Van der Hoorn hopes the Italian is given more time, amid speculation that he could be on his way should they lose to Liverpool next week. \u201cNo one is happy when you have bad results but respect for the manager has never been a problem,\u201d he said. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: Swansea City 1-3 Manchester City</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/pep-guardiola-raheem-sterling-kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-hamstring-injury\"><em>\u2022 Guardiola wants Sterling to fill gap with De Bruyne sidelined</em></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9168a6093b3f7cff47f422fdc49bf561300c1222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9168a6093b3f7cff47f422fdc49bf561300c1222/0_74_3326_1996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swansea v Man City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike van der Hoorn is shown a yellow card by Neil Swarbrick during Swansea\u2019s defeat by Manchester City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Names change but Saints\u2019 formula is still working<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/player/card/competition/attack/438082/18/100\"> <div data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"player-card player-card--football\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div class=\"player-card__image-container\"> <img class=\"player-card__image\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://sport.guim.co.uk/football/player-images/100/438082.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Charlie Austin\"> </div> <div class=\"player-card__player\"> <div class=\"player-card__position\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Striker</div> <div class=\"player-card__name\" itemprop=\"name\">Charlie Austin</div> </div> <dl class=\"player-card__stats\"> <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Appearances</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">4</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Goals</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">2</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">8</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Shots on target</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">50%</dd>  <dt class=\"player-card__stat-name\">Offsides</dt> <dd class=\"player-card__stat-value\">3</dd> </dl> </div> </figure>  <p>Southampton sell their best players and change their manager more often than Paul Pogba gets his hair cut, but the system largely remains the same. Since getting back into the Premier League under Nigel Adkins, the Saints have, at times, played 4-4-2 and with three centre\u2011backs, but generally they are a 4-3-3 side and the challenge so far for Claude Puel, the latest manager, has been to find the right pieces to fit in the holes \u2013 on Sunday it worked effectively. Oriel Romeu was at the base of the three, and was efficient enough, without ever causing anyone to mistake him for Morgan Schneiderlin. But C\u00e9dric Soares and, especially, Ryan Bertrand provided great width from full-back, just like Luke Shaw and Nathaniel Clyne. Further inside, the front three of Dusan Tadic, Nathan Redmond and Charlie Austin interchanged at will. Austin may not stretch defences (there is Redmond for that) but there is no doubting he can finish and Puel\u2019s decision to opt for the former QPR forward over Shane Long looks like a telling one. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/25/west-ham-united-southampton-premier-league-match-report\"><em>\u2022 Match report: West Ham United 0-3 Southampton</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/mark-noble-west-ham-slaven-bilic\"><em>\u2022 Noble attacks \u2018laughable\u2019 defending in defeat to Southampton</em></a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/25/west-ham-fans-give-their-verdict-clubs-new-stadium-premier-league-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/54k4m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2750647\"            data-video-name=\"West Ham fans give their verdict on the club's new stadium \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e82ee0e4b0f55a9f4032bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/25/160925hammers_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/25/160925hammers.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/25/160925hammers_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/sep/25/west-ham-fans-give-their-verdict-clubs-new-stadium-premier-league-video\">West Ham fans give their verdict on the club\u2019s new stadium</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/25/west-ham-southampton-disarray-on-field\">West Ham restore order off the field but are in disarray on it</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>10) Bamford must seize his chance for Burnley<br></h2> <p>For a squad as relatively thin as Burnley\u2019s, any unnecessary absences will hit them harder than most. Particularly when it is Andre Gray, the man who scored 23 goals on their way to promotion last season, who will serve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/23/burnley-andre-gray-four-match-ban-twitter\">the first of a four-game ban</a> on Monday night for homophobic tweets. Options are limited for Sean Dyche, but one available to him is Patrick Bamford, the young forward on loan from Chelsea. This is a huge opportunity for Bamford, and perhaps the last he will have for a while if he does not take it. Bamford\u2019s reputation currently rests on a good season with Middlesbrough in the Championship two years ago, but after two spells with Crystal Palace and Norwich in which he scored zero goals and made only two starts, how much longer will that stretch? Bamford has not scored a competitive goal since April 2015, and a Burnley side who have only three from their five games so far need him to end that run. <strong>Nick Miller</strong></p> <p><a

But what I do have, on a yellowing sheet of A4 paper, is a recipe in her distinctive cursive handwriting for something she called \u201cmock mousse\u201d, involving marshmallows, black coffee and whipped cream \u2013 a popular combination, it seems, way back when.</p> <p>Have I ever made this? No. Will I ever make it? Unlikely.

As a child, we had a box every Christmas. I think it was the law. I have an early memory of my grandmother and mother counting each type of chocolate to see if they were evenly distributed. (Yes, that\u2019s what passed for entertainment in the 1980s.) If you\u2019re interested, there were more Toffee Fingers than anything else. Invariably, I still buy Quality Street at Christmas, impelled by some misplaced sense of tradition, even though it\u2019s all wrong \u2013 the tin is a different shape, and is, in fact, no longer even a tin.</p> <p>Food nostalgia, as well as being intensely personal, is big business.

But until someone invents a time machine, we\u2019ll have to make do with the brief moments of respite our childhood foods offer us. Sorry, Toffee Deluxe lovers, you\u2019re out of luck.</p>",
  "<p>Jump first, ask later. That\u2019s the motto of the Fairfield-based Dauntless Movement Crew (DMC) and the name of their show at the Sydney Opera House. This slight 50-minute performance exhibits the urban extreme sport of parkour, a mishmash of scaling walls, leaping off blocks and sprinting along rooftops. On the street, however, they don\u2019t ask authorities for permission; they just jump right in. </p> <p>Now the dance company Force Majeure, in collaboration with the Powerhouse Youth Theatre, is bringing parkour to the mainstream, providing a platform to six founding members of DMC: Joseph Carbone, Johnny Do, Jimmy James Pham, Patrick Uy, Justin Kilic and its sole female representative, Natalie Siri, to show off their acrobatic skills. All six performers come from immigrant backgrounds, ranging from Italy to Vietnam; they also all grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield, a place recently referred to in the media as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/four-shootings-in-two-weeks-and-a-gang-war-on-the-rise-inside-australias-most-dangerous-suburb/news-story/b5df1aa69cf2f4d1d2c884760e315745\">Australia\u2019s most dangerous suburb</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac45f7a5a66290c0c5c7000515414585d2df0499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac45f7a5a66290c0c5c7000515414585d2df0499/0_0_2464_3948/624.jpg\" alt=\"All six performers in Jump First, Ask Later come from migrant backgrounds and grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All six performers in Jump First, Ask Later come from migrant backgrounds and grew up in Sydney\u2019s Fairfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Elwood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fairfield has been in the news for gang violence but Jump First, Ask Later director and designer Byron Perry wanted to portray a different side to the suburb: one in which kids on the block used parkour to find community and purpose. To drum that home, statistics regarding the multicultural make-up of the region are sprinkled liberally throughout the dialogue; we are reminded, above all, that western Sydney is one of Australia\u2019s most culturally diverse regions (in Fairfield itself, more than half the population was born overseas).</p> <p>Force Majeure\u2019s strong sense of social responsibility is clear from its previous productions. Nothing to Lose, which had its premiere at the Sydney festival in 2015, saw seven plus-sized dancers challenge the preconception that thin means beautiful. Never Did Me Any Harm (2012) was a frank look at parenthood. Jump First, Ask Later seeks to rebut stereotypes about street culture and celebrate its possibilities. </p> <p>The show opens with the crew warming up on stage, followed by group exercises including push-ups and the plank. In what boils down to a basic introduction to parkour, each member introduces an isolated movement, from backflips to something more akin to breakdancing. It\u2019s a stilted structure, made all the more awkward when the crew stops dancing to tell their own stories. </p> <p>Everything from parental disappointment to anger management, shyness and the mind-numbing boredom of factory work is touched on, often with intimacy and vulnerability. But DMC is not an acting troupe and it shows. The issues are discussed in too shallow a form to have much impact; worse, what should come off as casual chitchat and funny riffs between the crew is often mistimed. Conversation is designed to look impromptu but, when the performers regularly stumble, it seems heavily scripted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/09/my-workout-shirley-darlington-rowat-parkour\">My workout: Shirley Darlington-Rowat, parkour - \u2018It forces you to focus on the moment\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bumps might be bearable if there was a pay-off in the form of dazzling acrobatics or a big set piece. But while the performers are clearly talented and driven, the choreography is simply not strong enough to carry the show and it falls flat as a consequence. The fact that circus is today very much having a renaissance \u2013 and audiences are used to more sophisticated and physically impressive displays \u2013 only adds to the disappointment.</p> <p>Ultimately, this feels more like a social project and self-help guide (right down to the inclusion of R Kelly\u2019s song I Believe I Can Fly) than a polished production. No doubt its heart is in the right place, yet Jump First, Ask Later does not quite manage to shake its aura of amateurism. DMC makes cash by <a href=\"http://www.dauntlessmc.com.au/about-us\">hiring out its members</a> for events, including as undercover waiters at weddings. Here, sadly, they never manage to get beyond party tricks.</p>",

  "<p>Did Boris Johnson have a Brexit wobble? Certainly, and not just as Craig Oliver \u2013 the director of communications for David Cameron \u2013 complains in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/brexit-books-david-cameron-theresa-may-party-split\" title=\"\">the first of a round of score-settling memoirs</a> from the erstwhile No 10 team. Johnson is an exciting but uncertain political unicyclist, who swerved and side-slipped his way to supporting Vote Leave. If Camp Cameron was surprised to find the great Tory manchild still head-scratching and evoking Eeyore\u2019s depression about the chances of a leave victory while campaigning for it, they were not paying attention to Boris\u2019s mood swings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/25/that-didnt-go-to-plan-cameron-spin-doctor-brexit-vote-craig-oliver\">\u2018Well, that didn't go to plan\u2019: Cameron\u2019s spin doctor on the Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Liam Fox, then in the wilderness, now re-elevated to the outer part of the May inner circle as trade secretary, threw a party early last year dominated by pumped-up Tory leavers, Johnson spent much of his time sighing and hair-ruffling about the referendum \u2013 and confided to me (and I guess, several others) that he was still \u201ccompletely torn\u201d on \u201cthis EU thing\u201d.</p> <p>It did not always suit No 10 to acknowledge the reality \u2013 that loyalty to Cameron was skin deep and that aspirations beyond the referendum would nuance how senior Conservatives behaved in the campaign. Ambitious politicians, given an open goal, tend to take a shot at it.</p> <p>When the wound-licking is done, the more important matter will be what kind of relationship Britain should have with the EU after the divorce. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s powerful but testy finance minister, has just got shirty with the foreign secretary\u2019s blithe suggestion that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/france-and-germany-brush-off-johnsons-eu-baloney-jibe\" title=\"\">not necessarily a trade-off between the single market and freedom of movement</a> inside the EU. That will not necessarily please Angela Merkel, who has phrased her response to Brexit with deliberate calm. \u201cShe knows punishment beatings won\u2019t help get this sorted,\u201d a confidant in the Kanzleramt tells me. Merkel does not remotely like Brexit and believes it a mistake for Britain and Germany. But as a child of the old East Germany, she is keenly aware that elites sounding bitter or resentful about a popular movement is counterproductive.</p> <p>Absolutists on both sides are reluctant to move on. Yet they must, for the good of Britain and also the wider EU, which is more afflicted by post-referendum turbulence than it can readily admit. Practical inquiry will soon turn to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/george-osborne-brexit-won-majority-hard-brexit-did-not\" title=\"\">whether Brexit should be of the soft or hard variety</a>. The \u201csofty tendency\u201d wants to retain single market access, or at least as much of it as can be salvaged via trade deals. And while Sch\u00e4uble is right that the Lisbon treaty links freedoms of movement to single market access, that does not account for the EU\u2019s tendency to state that things are inviolable \u2013 and then, under pressure, negotiate on them.</p> <p>A generous offer on freedom of movement for those with guarantees of work and study places, for instance, would get a better reception in Europe than the hardline anti-immigration suggestion that Fortress Britain needs very few incomers to prosper. Hard Brexit advocates are already staking out their ground: \u201cSome vainly advocate retaining features of EU membership after leaving but this is not practical,\u201d raps the longstanding Tory Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin.</p> <p>But the ghosts of pre-EU diplomacy stalk post-referendum Europe. Better to&#xa0;look to the early 19th century and Count Metternich, wheeler-dealing to save the fortunes of Austria by dogged pursuit of d\u00e9tente with France and alignments with Prussia/Russia (\u201cunthinkables\u201d and \u201cimpracticals\u201d in their day too), rather than the trumpet blasts of Boris or Jean-Claude Juncker. \u201cEvents which cannot be prevented must be directed,\u201d the great Austrian diplomatic fixer once remarked \u2013 a lesson for those who have to deliver on the Brexit promise.</p> <p>Many convinced, outraged, piqued or spuriously confident voices will say that hard Brexit is the decisive way to go. Nigel Farage is already priming his comeback in defence of this proposition. Perversely, it appeals to avowed sceptics in Britain and those in the institutional EU who still believe that putting Britain out in the cold is the best way to cauterise revolt elsewhere. Here is a recipe for deepening animosity. Geography is master of all our fates and post-Brexit, we still have to share a continent.</p> <p>A gentler methodology requires patience about the pace of negotiations from the British, government and an acceptance in the EU that since Britain is the first big \u201cex-member state\u201d, its final status will, by definition, be something that has not existed before. The hardest part might not be finding a fudge on freedom of movement, via work permits and a broad deal on student visas \u2013 but the right recipe for maintaining trade and cultural links. If soft Brexit\u2019s contours are still vague, it starts with a state of mind, which understands that Brexit needs to be delivered and does not only harp in bad faith on the defeat of remainers, but which also accepts the great jeopardy in leaving the EU, and thus that the process is best undertaken as circumspectly as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will cause ructions inside the Conservatives, but the least worst option is better than the alternatives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A \u201cUsain Bolt\u201d model, in which a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\" title=\"\">race to trigger article 50</a> becomes the starting gun for the fastest possible Brexit, will cut off compromises, deepen misunderstandings and leave a sulky UK offshore from a bruised and crosser EU, with practical details of how we will associate with member states dangerously unclear.</p> <p>The softy tendency must start to build a coalition of support and make its case. Rather more than is reflected by the true believers on either side, many voters shared a dollop of Boris\u2019s vacillation: neither so convinced by the EU\u2019s self-praise that they yearned to stay in it, nor convinced by the \u201cbetter off out\u201d simplicities of outright Brexiters. The May-Hammond duumvirate needs to start defining what the gentler road to Brexit looks like and outline its benefits. It will cause ructions inside the Conservatives and a wider argument about what Brexit is to mean, but the least worst option is better than the alternatives.

But not by insulting them | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves: the poll reveals a substantial constituency into which Hansonism can tap.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth then considering the difference between the first and the second incarnations of Pauline Hanson.</p> <p>The 90s-era One Nation targeted \u201cAsians\u201d and Indigenous people, denouncing the bipartisan commitment to multiculturalism in the name of an older Australia and its cultural norms. That rhetoric was largely nostalgic, since the Anglo monoculture of the Hansonite imaginary had, at least in the cities, already given way to multiracial cosmopolitanism. </p> <p>Since then, of course, the integration of Australian capitalism into Asia has only intensified with, for instance, recent economic prosperity driven by a mining boom dependent upon Chinese markets.</p> <p>The widespread pandering to Hanson after her early electoral successes masked the extent to which One Nation was pushing against the prevailing economic and political winds.</p> <p>The rebooted project is rather different.</p> <p>In Hanson\u2019s recent speech, Asians barely featured. In their place, we heard an almost exclusively anti-Muslim rhetoric. That rhetoric built on 15 years of warnings by the major parties that al-Qaida (and then Islamic State) represented a near-existential threat to Australia.</p> <p>The \u201cwar on terror\u201d has fundamentally reshaped both foreign and domestic policy. In its Defence Budget Brief 2014-2015, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/iraq-deployment-to-cost-australia-about-400-million-a-year-20140915-10h35o.html\">the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates</a> the nation has allocated nearly $20bn on military deployments in the past two decades, overwhelmingly in Muslim nations. Since 9/11, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/reactive-anti-terror-laws-risk-further-eroding-freedoms-without-making-us-safer-50959\">Australia has enacted more than 60 separate anti-terrorism laws</a>, many of which challenge basic principles of democratic jurisprudence.</p> <p>The most recent budget allocates over $35bn to defence, national security and law enforcement. \u201cKeeping Australia and Australians safe and secure is the highest responsibility of the government,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/glossy/nat_sec/html/nat_sec-01.htm\">we\u2019re told</a>.</p> <p>In other words, if the original One Nation was swimming against the tide, Pauline Hanson 2.0 is surfing a wave. Since 2001, Australians have been told again and again to be very scared of Muslims. The Hansonites repackage that message in a more plebeian format, presenting Islam as an all-purpose scapegoat for social and economic anxieties.</p> <p>Presented in that light, the Essential Poll isn\u2019t that surprising.</p> <p>Yet an explanation of anti-Muslim sentiment shouldn\u2019t become a justification for it.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/progressives-can-attract-hanson-supporters-but-not-by-insulting-them\">response by my colleague Peter Lewis</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/04/pauline-hanson-takes-centre-stage-again-but-this-time-we-should-listen-not-lampoon\">others</a>, deserve to be debated. </p> <p>\u201c[H]ere\u2019s the challenge to everyone concerned or affronted by these findings,\u201d Lewis writes. \u201cHow do you tell half the population that they are wrong? The answer is you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis notes that one quarter of voters think they\u2019ll be less secure in their job in the next two years, and only a third expect to be employed by the same boss in five years time.</p> <p>That genuine uncertainty, he says, fuels populism of the left and the right. Rather than denouncing Hanson voters, we should be addressing their real concerns. He argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a progressive political agenda that can resonate with all these disengaged and distrustful people, while at the same time taking the heat out of their fear and insecurity.</p> <p>It\u2019s about such unfashionable ideas as income distribution, workplace bargaining rights, industry development and corporate responsibility.</p> <p>That\u2019s the political challenge to responding to Hanson and her supporters: not to call them names that may make us feel superior but to listen and harness their sense of protest to more constructive ends.</p> </blockquote> <p>Certainly, we\u2019ve seen a depressing tendency in which so-called progressives respond to Hansonism and other manifestations of conservative populism by denouncing ordinary people as incorrigible bigots and suggesting measures to short circuit the democratic process so as to keep the oiks under control.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a lot to like in Lewis\u2019 call for a different kind of politics.</p> <p>Nevertheless, you can\u2019t build a \u201cprogressive political agenda\u201d without tackling bigotry.</p> <p>In Jim Crow America, for instance, the vast majority of whites identified African Americans as inferior. Would anyone really argue that, in that context, progressives should have opted not to say that white supremacy (a majority sentiment) was wrong? </p> <p>In any case, Islamophobia, like other forms of racism, isn\u2019t merely a moral obscenity. It\u2019s also a material obstacle for those committed to progressive change, undermining unity against our common enemies. How, for instance, do you campaign for workplace rights if your co-workers want to deport you for wearing a headscarf? How do you mobilise people against corporate power if they\u2019re obsessed with banning halal foods?</p> <p>To put it another way, reconstructing a different kind of politics depends on defeating racism, just as much as defeating racism rests on rebuilding a different kind of politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/23/first-dog-on-the-moons-reverse-racist-history-of-australian-racial-intolerance\">First Dog on the Moon's reverse-racist history of Australian racial intolerance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Furthermore, while popular Islamophobia might sometimes be a cipher for economic uncertainty, that doesn\u2019t mean that activists fighting for economic justice should orient to Islamophobes. On the contrary, precisely because the left\u2019s so weak, attempts to reconstruct a progressive alternative should begin with those who reject bigotry, not those who embrace it.</p> <p>In particular, progressives need to build support among those communities facing the brunt of contemporary racism. How will that ever be possible if we\u2019re not willing to denounce Islamophobia whenever we encounter it?</p> <p>Again, it\u2019s not simply a moral question.</p> <p>Almost as soon as any serious movement gets off the ground, activists will be confronted by questions about national security, Islam, terrorism and the like, simply because those issues are so central to contemporary politics. That\u2019s part of the reason the anti-globalisation movement of the late 90s collapsed: anti-corporate campaigners weren\u2019t prepared for the post-9/11 world.</p> <p>You can\u2019t dodge the key issues of the era \u2013 and, as the Essential Poll shows, one of the key issues today is Islamophobia.</p> <p>Though the survey\u2019s definitely worrying, there\u2019s no reason to conclude the bigots can\u2019t be defeated. But if we\u2019re going to win, we need to actually fight.</p>",

  "<p>Film-goers have endured such a punishing onslaught of young adult adaptations, it\u2019s enough to make you want to sulk and dream of escaping into some sort of fantasy realm. Think back, if you can, to recent duds like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/22/the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-review\">The Mortal Instruments: City of Bone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/maze-runner-the-scorch-trials-review-a-ya-franchise-runs-out-of-steam\">The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials</a> or, Rowling help us, that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/19/twilight-saga-new-moon-review\"> second Twilight film</a>, before they wised-up and added a bit of intentional camp. Survivors of this cinematic drudgery (and there ought to be support groups) have been wondering just what would happen if you took one of these wholly by-the-numbers affairs and hired a director who at least had a little bit of style. With Tim Burton behind the camera, and the always-sharp screenwriter Jane Goldman keeping him on course, we have our answer in Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home For Peculiar Children.</p> <p>The source material is a whopper of an elevator pitch: X-Men done up all British and gloomy and gothic. (If Winona Ryder\u2019s Lydia Deetz from Beetlejuice read comics when she was 13, they\u2019d have been something like this.) To add additional spin, our young English mutants are caught up in a Groundhog Day of their own creation, so we get the playfulness of seeing quirky magic powers mixed with the familiarity of how a time loop plays out. Add in Burton\u2019s authorial visual stamp and what we\u2019ve got is an extremely pleasing formula. It gels as Tim Burton\u2019s best (non-musical) live-action movie for 20 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV_IhWE4LP0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tV_IhWE4LP0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That\u2019s a lot of modifiers for a compliment, but I do want to manage expectations. The plot is extremely predictable and the third act\u2019s action set-pieces, even with a loving homage to Ray Harryhausen, seems to go on forever. Asa Butterfield is quite good as Jake, a nervous dreamer whose voice couldn\u2019t get any lower if it were in his shoes. Out of place in the tacky, palm-tree dotted Florida (Burton\u2019s aesthetic has always mixed in pink flamingo camp with Hammer Films castles) Jake follows the maps left behind by his dead grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp), a Polish refugee who spent the war at the domicile referenced in the film\u2019s title.</p> <p>Run by Eva Green, who smokes a pipe and looks as if she\u2019s just heard a joke she mustn\u2019t share, the home (on a small island off the coast of Wales) is a safe haven for kids with strange abilities. Some are more standard superhero than others \u2013 would you like the ability to be invisible or to manipulate air, or would you like to have bees living in your mouth or the capacity to grow root vegetables with tremendous speed? Jake, with his dad (the always wonderful Chris O\u2019Dowd) visit the island at the suggestion of Jake\u2019s therapist (Allison Janney) and it\u2019s there that he\u2019s able to enter Miss Peregrine\u2019s hidden time loop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80a04fcacff6b400f4862f10f49290d1481cb9d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a04fcacff6b400f4862f10f49290d1481cb9d8/104_0_1792_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children New film by Tim Burton coming out in 2016 Stars: Eva Green\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some of the film\u2019s rules are definitely of the \u201cI\u2019m not going to put too much mental energy to make sure this all checks out,\u201d but I will say there are some innovative uses of time travel. Less interesting is the motivation of the baddies \u2013 yes, there are baddies \u2013 who want to kill Miss Peregrine for some reason. The creatures, all tentacles and teeth, look tremendous and Samuel L Jackson, perhaps on a dare from Christopher Walken, chomps up the scenery in glorious fashion. It is unfortunate in 2016 that the only person of colour is the bad guy, but at least this is the type of bad guy that the movie is not-that-secretly cheering on. He eats a giant bowl of children\u2019s eyeballs - in Tim Burton\u2019s world that practically makes him a hero.</p> <p>There are additional books in the series, but I hope they never make it to film. This movie ends on a lovely note (it\u2019s high time Tim Burton visited a pier in Blackpool) and the kids are all at the age where this won\u2019t seem as cute two years from now. Moreover the important themes, one of sanctuary and growth, are nicely (but not overly) developed in this singular entry. Not every film needs to grow into a franchise, sometimes it\u2019s best to let things live in their own isolated world.</p> <ul> <li>Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home For Peculiar Children is released on 30 September</li> </ul>"
