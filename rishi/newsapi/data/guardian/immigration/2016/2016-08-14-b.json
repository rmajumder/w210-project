  "<p>Given that this is Michael Phelps\u2019 fifth Olympics, one would think there would be few new things left for him to do. But he found one just this week.</p> <p>This was the first time Phelps had served as the captain of the USA\u2019s men\u2019s team. It is not a job that requires any strategising. It simply means he had to lead, inspire and support the team. The captain has to make time for everyone else as well as worry about himself.</p> <p>\u201cMichael did a really great job of being vocal, helping people, leading the younger guys,\u201d said his coach and consigliere, Bob Bowman. \u201cThat really helped us get into the right frame of mind and find the cohesion we needed to do what we did, which has been historic in many ways.\u201d The USA won 16 gold medals in the pool. The rest of the world managed 17 between them.</p> <p>There has been a lot of talk about what Phelps has done for his sport in the past. The more interesting question right now is what he will do for it in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see what the future is going to bring,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cI\u2019m just able to start the next chapter in my life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-olympic-career-swimming-gold\">Michael Phelps caps a glittering Olympic career with one final swimming gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am retiring but I\u2019m not done-done with swimming. This is just the start of something new.\u201d It is a sport in serious need of the kind of leadership Phelps bought to the US team. He did not want to talk about what he is planning. But he said at various points that \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever competed in a clean sport\u201a\u201d and that there were \u201cheadline issues\u201d which he wanted to address once he had settled into his retirement.</p> <p>On Friday Phelps\u2019 old rival George Bovell, who won bronze behind him in the 200m medley in 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/george-bovell--olympics-swimming-reality-tv-show\" title=\"\">spoke with disarming honesty</a> about exactly how disenchanted he had become with Fina, the sport\u2019s governing body. Bovell said he felt the medals had become devalued and that he was so disillusioned that he felt like: \u201c\u2018Why fight against it?\u2019 Afterwards he added on Twitter that he was speaking out for \u201cwhat 95% of my colleagues believe is fair and right\u201d. A lot of conversations are going on behind the scenes, in warm-up rooms, ready rooms, hotel rooms.

In Wada\u2019s independent report into Russian doping, Richard McLaren was clear that those same Kazan championships had been compromised. Fina\u2019s president Julio Maglione responded by attacking the credibility of the report and claiming Wada had exceeded its powers.</p> <p>Away from the medal contenders, Fina also failed to address the mistakes made in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/olympic-swimming-credibility-doubt-questions-entry-times\" title=\"\">entry times of many of the slower athletes competing here. </a>All they did was put out a short statement insisting that they \u201cdid not have any impact whatsoever to the outcome of the competition\u201d. Tell that to Sidni Hoxha, the Albanian whose entry time for the 50m freestyle was out by seven seconds. He spent two days trying to get it corrected and still ended up swimming in the first heat along with swimmers who were 10 seconds slower than him. Hoxha had spent two years preparing for these Olympics. All this after Mexico were found to have faked all their entry times for that same world championships in Kazan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/yulia-efimova-michael-phelps-doping-criticisms\">Yulia Efimova drags Michael Phelps into doping criticism row</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It just may be that change is on the way. Last year a group of elite coaches launched the World Swimming Association. They want to take over control of the sport from Fina. They are also planning to start a Professional Swimmers Association, like the PGA in golf, and to launch a series of new major events to run alongside the Olympics and world championships. Where does Phelps fit in? John Leonard, the executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association and one of the leaders of the new WSA, confirmed he had been in positive discussions with Phelps and around a dozen other of the world\u2019s leading swimmers.</p> <p>\u201cThere is huge interest among the males,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThe men are ready to go tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Phelps\u2019 coach, Bowman, serves with Leonard on the board of the WSCA. \u201cThis all started with one little dream as a kid,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cTo try and change the sport of swimming.\u201d</p> <p>The suspicion is he is not finished yet. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot,\u201d Phelps said, \u201cbut there is still a lot more work to be done.\u201d</p>",

Neither the British nor the French government have put in place a proper process to deal with the Dublin cases in Calais and instead seem to be deliberately adding delays to the work done by charities.\u201d</p> <p>The 40 children and teenagers from the camps in Calais who have so far been reunited with family in the UK under the Dublin agreement have only arrived as a result of legal cases taken by Citizens UK and and other charities, rather than proactively by the British and French governments, Cooper said. </p> <p>In her letter, Cooper called for child protection procedures to be immediately applied in the cases where the requests had been agreed, \u201cwhen with each day that goes by these children and teenagers are at continued risk of abuse, sexual exploitation, trafficking, psychological trauma and disease in the Calais camp\u201d.</p> <p>Charities working in Calais have also identified a further 200 child refugees who do not have family anywhere in Europe and would be eligible for sanctuary in Britain under the Dubs amendment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/child-refugees-sexually-assaulted-at-official-greek-camps\">\u2018Sexual assaults on children\u2019 at Greek refugee camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Child refugees at risk of sexual abuse and trafficking in government-run camps in Greece must also be offered sanctuary in Britain, Cooper said. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/13/child-refugees-sexually-assaulted-at-official-greek-camps\">An Observer investigation</a> found children as young as seven had been sexually assaulted in official European refugee camps, according to volunteers working in the camp, including in a former Softex toilet roll factory on the outskirts of Thessaloniki. </p> <p>The concerns over safety in the camps were raised by Cooper directly with the Home Office in her letter. \u201cGiven the concerns I and others have repeatedly raised about lone child refugees in camps and on the street in Greece, where the children\u2019s homes are full and the authorities are struggling to cope, why has there not been urgent UK action to help?\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said that more than 30 children had been accepted for transfer to the UK under the Dubs amendment, the majority of whom had already arrived in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe are consulting with local authorities to confirm available capacity and to ensure appropriate support systems are in place,\u201d the Home Office said in a statement. \u201cWe are also in active discussions with the UNHCR and the Italian, Greek and French governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to the UK and ensure this in their best interests.<br><br>\u201cThis is in addition to supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who arrive from Europe.

  "<p>Summer is a time when natural light can lend an otherness to almost any subject. From Ryan McGinley\u2019s playful homage to Renaissance nudes, to Nadav Kander\u2019s eerie inlet at Mont Saint-Michel, these shots by contemporary photographers are testament to that. </p> <p>As the holiday snaps that flood Instagram show, the light can also enhance even the most cliched chronicle of a summer vacation. We take a different kind of photograph in the sun, sensing that it makes us look better because it makes us feel better. The self we display in a selfie, or so we tell ourselves, is leaner, lither, more tanned, more relaxed and less self-conscious.</p> <p>A snapshot of a sandy beach and a blue sea, especially taken through the V of tanned feet, would once have been consigned to a pile of envelopes in a cupboard, to be looked at briefly and bemusedly years later in a bout of decluttering. Now, shared in real time on Instagram, it is something else: more knowing, artful and presumptive. \u201cI am here and you are not,\u201d is the subliminal message it carries to friends back home. Yet sunlight falling on skin or sand bestows a shimmer of lightness \u2013 literal and atmospheric \u2013 on even the most inane snapshot. </p> <p>Against all of this, I can understand why even a contemporary master of deep colour such as Alec Soth would choose to shoot someone diving into a rocky swimming hole in monochrome. Here is the chill of summer, the childhood risk of summer, the dark dreamtime of an adolescent summer in which limits are being tested. It is an antidote to the dappled days of sun, sea, sand and luminous light. <em>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/seanohagan\">Sean O\u2019Hagan</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148fb3ebadd816161c25e7166d926d74abc3b8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148fb3ebadd816161c25e7166d926d74abc3b8e9/0_0_2200_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Near Kaaterskill Falls, New York, 2012 by Alec Soth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Near Kaaterskill Falls, New York, 2012 by Alec Soth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alec Soth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I tried a cliff-dive myself.

The area has a curious Rip Van Winkle quality at that time of year, which made for a deeply romantic trip. I had created this kind of imaginary newspaper called the LBM Dispatch, naming myself chief photographer. I was working with a friend, a writer. We would drive around a region, allocating time to stop and report on whatever we found.</p> <p>I had mapped out various swimming holes. There are loads dotted across upstate NY: places where people gather to swim and, as it turns out, cliff-dive. It wasn\u2019t at this spot, but at another, that I tried it out for myself \u2013 and it was totally thrilling. That feeling of letting go fascinated me. It tied in to ideas of escape that I have explored for years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suicide fantasies, escape fantasies \u2013 this has elements of both</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was experimenting with flash, working like a news photographer, who pauses and instantaneously zeroes in on someone\u2019s life. There is something about the result here that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">evocative of Weegee</a> [Arthur Fellig, famed for his black-and-white photographs of New York crime scenes from the 1930s]. It seems timeless too: I don\u2019t think you could ever guess when it was taken.</p> <p>The image was published in Songbook, my most recent work, but it\u2019s linked to two earlier projects. I shot a series called Niagara, attracted to the area and its motels by the falls \u2013 and the suicides. A more recent project was Broken Manual, which focused on men who run away, attempting to escape from the world and their lives. This cliff-dive is reminiscent of elements in both: fantasies of suicide, fantasies of retreat \u2013 it\u2019s all in there.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s depressing, too depressing for a snapshot of summer, but my work is often chilly. To me, seasons are somewhat abstract, but summer is almost mythical in its ability to evoke childhood, unfamiliar places, a moment outside day-to-day life, like a dream. That\u2019s what the picture is: a dream-like moment of total release. <em>(Interview by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edward-siddons\">Edward Siddons</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7f85614cb96eb1fd0d59a868854dc38e879716d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7f85614cb96eb1fd0d59a868854dc38e879716d/0_0_1384_2076/667.jpg\" alt=\"Barn Flip (Red), 2013 by Ryan McGinley\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barn Flip (Red), 2013 by Ryan McGinley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan McGinley/Courtesy Team Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018They\u2019re like the nudes in the Sistine Chapel\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/apr/13/ryan-mcginley\">Ryan McGinley</a></h2> <p>I love shooting out in nature during the summer because it\u2019s warm and people are comfortable being naked. I can shoot all day and take my time to find the surprises that make an image exceptional. Something about being outside at this time of year seems extra spiritual and serene.<br></p> <p>This shot consists of three friends of mine, all artists: photographer Carlotta Kohl is on the left, painter Christopher Bostwick is in the middle, and film-maker Petra Collins is on the right. The location is deepest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia\">West Virginia</a>. For my shoots, I look for properties to rent that have lots of land to explore, usually farms with unique old structures that I like to include in my shots. When I rent a place like this in the middle of nowhere, they are usually inexpensive, so I am easily able to take my crew of 15 along.</p> <p>This was shot at dusk, a time I like because the sky turns beautiful shades of blue. I set up an airbag for the models to jump on to. When Christopher started doing flips, it reminded me of looking up at the nudes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/30/why-vatican-thinks-tourists-idiots-3d-michelangelo-sistine\">the Sistine Chapel</a>. I grew up Roman Catholic and was influenced by Michelangelo\u2019s nudes. Actually, the flying nudes of the Renaissance have been in my DNA from a very early age. One of the reasons I initially cast Petra was because she looked as if she had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.</p> <p>While we were shooting, one of the owner\u2019s friends, a biker, stood there watching us. He was drunk and kind of mumbling things to himself as all the models were jumping out of the barn. I told him to go away, to let the models have their privacy, but he kept coming back. The following morning, at around 3am, he walked into our house and yelled: \u201cWho wants to party?\u201d We were all terrified. That afternoon, the owner told us, he had gotten on his motorcycle at around 7am, driven off, crashed and died. <em>(<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-beaumont-thomas\">Ben Beaumont-Thomas</a>)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"371e7f48906117345814958b52551bcb27955f03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371e7f48906117345814958b52551bcb27955f03/0_0_2538_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mont Saint-Michel, Normandy, France 2002 by Nadav Kander\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mont Saint-Michel, Normandy, France 2002 by Nadav Kander</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nadav Kander</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018This shot only exists in summer\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nadav-kander\">Nadav Kander</a></h2> <p>Water has always been important to me. There is something enchanting about its stillness, how it covers everything, how it flows along the path of least resistance and submerges everything in a level way. There\u2019s something starkly beautiful \u2013 and calming \u2013 about it. I think you are either a mountain person or a lake person. I\u2019m a lake person.</p> <p>I took this around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/22/supertide-mont-saint-michel-france\">Mont Saint-Michel</a> in France, just over the Channel from Cornwall. In autumn, the area turns orange, and in winter it has hardly any colour at all, so summer is the only time that this shot really exists.</p> <p>I found the flatness of the scene captivating. When I made my way through it, all these inlets started to look rather surreal. That\u2019s something I\u2019m always searching for elements of, in among the normal. I never photograph nature in its purity, hence the castle looming in the distance. It\u2019s a symbol of man, whose traces can be detected elsewhere in the landscape. Sheep aren\u2019t native to the area. The sea grass ought to be much longer, but the introduction of livestock means the floodplain is grazed. That\u2019s what gives the picture its clean lines and gently folding greenery.</p> <p>My work always has something to do with man, or at least his mark, whether that is a felled tree, concrete objects or, in this case, a whole fortress built into the sea. Artists in earlier times, especially in England, would be asked to paint a landscape and, even if it was fictitious, they would insert a ruin into a far hillside. It lent reason, the weight of past lives. The castle\u2019s inclusion here tells us that man has lived here, much has come before us, our own life is short.</p> <p>So you could say the shot is more portrait than landscape. Without that building, I think it\u2019s just pictorial and nothing more. The castle adds a history, a layer into time, access to humanity across the years. <em>(ES)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fbbce263b8eb7c4a5459a13a2a3c76e2b9be023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fbbce263b8eb7c4a5459a13a2a3c76e2b9be023/0_0_4200_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ox and Angela, plastic surgeon and wife, Rio, Brazil, October 2002 by Zed Nelson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ox and Angela, plastic surgeon and wife, Rio, Brazil, October 2002 by Zed Nelson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zed Nelson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018He\u2019d a gun down the back of his trousers\u2019 <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zed-nelson\">Zed Nelson</a></h2> <p>I spent five years working on my Love Me series, travelling to 17 countries to look at the phenomenon of body obsession and self-image.

At the time, he was having an operating theatre built on the top floor of his apartment. Smiling and posing for the camera has become such a social contrivance that I usually discourage it. But look at her body, look at that pose \u2013 she probably learned how to sit as a child. What a flattering angle it is. And that\u2019s an interesting thing to document.</p> <p>The two hours I spent there were rather surreal. He had a gun tucked down the back of his trousers. A year later, I found out he had been shot and killed in his own home.

I was working with <a href=\"http://counterpointsarts.org.uk/\">Counterpoints Arts</a>, an organisation that connects artists with refugees and vice versa. People wept as they came ashore, some in grief, others in elation. They had been driven out of their homes and forced to run away. More than anything, they were just desperate to protect their children.</p> <p>Those who survived the journey were segregated into camps according to their country of origin: Afghan refugees went to a settlement called Moria, Syrians to Kara Tepe. The man in the photo is Syrian. His name is Mohammed Ganom. He avoided the camps due to his disability and his urgent need for medical attention. He was taken to Pikpa [now called the Lesbos Solidarity camp], something of a sanctuary on Lesbos, where pregnant women, the injured, severely ill and dying find some form of respite.

On a white, plastic chair, just outside of this shot, sat his colostomy bag, in dire need of emptying. His sister had travelled with him and did her best to nurse him. To me, the shot speaks of vulnerability. It demonstrates how easily politics can pose a threat, not only to the human spirit, but to our physical being.</p> <p>There were holidaymakers on the island complaining about being disturbed by the flood of people. Refugees were turned away from hotels, even when they could afford a room. Some locals would rail against newcomers in the middle of the street. It was a stark reminder of what was going on \u2013 both in the rest of the world and right on Europe\u2019s doorstep.</p> <p>For these refugees, summer meant warmth. It meant sleeping rough was a little easier, the hostile, choppy waters were slightly calmer. Summer was a form of kindness to these people\u2019s bodies.

I was in Alcon\u00e0sser in Mallorca and a couple of us decided to meet up at one of the small, stony beaches at the foot of some cliffs. Over the course of the day, more and more people arrived. Our small party swelled into this big group.</p> <p>Some went floating around in the sea, others lazed on the beach chatting or quietly reading. This shot was all about capturing the mood of the moment in the moment. I took it at the end of the day, which is perhaps why it is so relaxed. Everyone was exhausted.</p> <p>These days, everyone knows how to get a good photo. People are much more aware of how to hold themselves. Tiredness minimised that. What I really love is that everybody has their own individual character.

It was 1979 and I was studying at Yale. I wasn\u2019t interested in people of another class per se. I was interested in people who had no interest in photography. The obvious focus is the young girl standing in the paddling pool. The inflatable around her waist is ridiculous. She couldn\u2019t have drowned \u2013 the water was less than a foot deep.</p> <p>Summer is fleeting, just like youth. This shot harks back to that time in your life when standing in 12 inches of water was truly fun. There\u2019s a kind of innocence to it: you would think it was just an innocuous snapshot taken at random \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t. In those days, I didn\u2019t use a handheld. My work all had to be rather deliberate because I was shooting with a tripod.</p> <p>There is a weirdness to the scene, but that\u2019s good. I wanted it to be slightly suspicious.

It was summer when he died, not in our home state of Virginia, but in Italy where he spent his summers and winters. In the spring and fall, he would alight in Lexington, the town in Virginia where we both grew up, and almost as soon as his bags were unpacked he would begin painting.</p> <p>He had been a friend of my parents, to whom he gave his first sculpture. They supported him by buying, out of his arms, a painting he was carrying down the street one day in 1952. Cy had made it with pencil and house paint.</p> <p>He loved our part of the south and his work reflected southerners\u2019 innately contradictory qualities of ambiguity and plain-spokenness, cruelty and kindness, illumination and obscurity. Like all southerners, he was keenly aware of death, but the shadow of mortality failed to darken his brilliance, and the famous slow pace of southern life only reminded Cy how much harder he had to work.</p> <p>And work he did. Considering he was in the fall of his life, his later paintings were extravagant with colour and gesture, import and whimsy. It was the poetic force of his personality that compelled me to take pictures in his studio. These bright colours, these brilliant vestiges, suggest both an absence and a great presence.

In the morning, somebody called me to say an airplane had flown into a skyscraper. Of course, I wanted to go and see it. I took my car out, thinking I would take a shortcut through Brooklyn and go over one of the southern bridges. But the bridges had been closed.</p> <p>As I drove, I heard on the radio that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/september11\">a second plane had crashed</a>. Just by chance, I came to this little spot on the East River that looked directly across the water at what was happening. In front of me was this group of five people chatting. So I pressed the shutter \u2013 just three times \u2013 and moved on. I was still trying to get closer. I\u2019m not sure if I was using my Leica or my Canon, but I was definitely shooting on film.</p> <p>When I got to the Magnum office that afternoon, I saw what my fellow photographers had done. Steve McCurry lives in a high-rise just a kilometre from Ground Zero \u2013 all he\u2019d had to do was go on to his roof to get the most amazing pictures. As the others came in and developed their images in the darkroom, I felt I\u2019d got nothing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I'd asked their permission, it would have spoiled the moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the days following the attacks, there were all sorts of interesting, horrific and depressing things to photograph. We had so much material, we decided to make a book: New York September 11, by Magnum Photographers. I used very few of my own shots because I thought I\u2019d blown it. Then, five years later, the director of a photography museum in Munich asked to do a retrospective of my work. He was going through my pictures and suddenly came to the 9/11 shots. He said: \u201cThese are incredible \u2013 the contrast of the young people in the sunshine, looking so relaxed, with the smoke and death in the background.\u201d Of course, unconsciously, I might have seen those two trees as a frame to the group, but it was pure instinct. I was there for less than a minute.</p> <p>Later, I found out that the people in the shot got a little upset when they saw the picture. That blonde woman in the centre is a photographer herself, a portraitist, and that\u2019s a very different ballgame. Had I asked if I could take their picture, I would have already spoiled the moment. Or they might have told me to fuck off.</p> <p>It was September, the end of summer \u2013 and the end of naivete, in a way. It was also the beginning of what we are all living with now.

The vote on the mosquito release is non-binding, and three of five mosquito control board members have agreed to abide by the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a scientific debate and come to some kind of conclusion,\u201d Goodman said. Goodman fears a slippery slope, where every new insecticide will require public approval.</p> <p>The district has already invested in the experiment. It donated space to Oxitec to build a laboratory in Marathon, in the middle Keys, and expects to donate up to $200,000 in free labor each year the experiment goes forward. </p> <p>Certainly, the current methods employed by mosquito control districts against the Aedes are imperfect.</p> <p>The notoriously difficult-to-control bug was nearly eradicated in the <a href=\"http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1020-49891997000100023\">1950s by governments</a> in Latin America, who undertook a military-style campaign to spray DDT inside homes. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes also spread <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/dengue/entomologyecology/\">dengue</a>, yellow fever and chikungunya, diseases with potentially life-threatening symptoms. </p> <p>Miami-Dade County began spraying Naled in August, after the first mainland cases of Zika transmitted by local mosquitoes were found in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/10/zika-virus-miami-florida-cases-mosquito-wynwood\">Wynwood neighborhood</a>. About 6m Floridian acres are sprayed each year. But Naled\u2019s effectiveness in Aedes control is widely debated, both for its effectiveness and its adverse impacts. </p> <p>\u201cI got a complaint the other day \u2013 someone found 30 dead bees on the side of the road,\u201d Goodman said. Naled kills just about any flying insect the size of a mosquito aloft when planes spray overhead. </p> <p>Public education can also only go so far. </p> <p>In the Keys, ubiquitous door hangers remind residents to empty standing pools of water. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in pools as tiny as a bottle cap, making every wrinkle of a tarp potential habitat. Goodman suspects some Aedes mosquitoes are breeding in abandoned cisterns on the islands, which used to supply residents\u2019 water. </p> <p>Oxitec\u2019s trial wouldn\u2019t be the first one the company conducts, nor the last. The company has released GMO mosquitoes in <a href=\"http://www.oxitec.com/oxitec-vector-control-solution-in-brazil-attacking-source-of-zika-virus/\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitecs-genetically-engineered-mosquitoes-in-panama-pilot-achieve-over-90-control-of-the-mosquito-responsible-for-outbreaks-of-dengue-fever-and-chikungunya/\">Panama</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/01/gm-mosquito-release-malaysia-surprises-opponents-and-scientists-again\">Malaysia</a> and recently the Cayman Islands.

The longest such trial has been approximately two years, increasing Keys residents\u2019 concerns about unknown long-term consequences. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Opening this Pandora\u2019s box, sometimes you don\u2019t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road</p> <footer> <cite>Mila de Mier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most trials have resulted in reduced Aedes populations, Oxitec has said. Nimmo cites a 90% or better rate of reduction in most populations. But the same rate of effectiveness is likely to be significantly lower in locations with more complex geography.</p> <p>Opponents have raised other concerns as well: for every 1,000 mosquitoes released, one will be female, the sort that bite.</p> <p>De Mier and other opponents ask: what happens if a female Oxitec mosquito bites a woman? What if it passes the \u201ckill gene\u201d, as opponents call it, to people? Oxitec scientists analyzed the saliva of roughly six mosquitoes, the gene was not detected, and scientists concluded that humans were unlikely to be exposed. But that hasn\u2019t soothed critics. </p> <p>\u201cOpening this Pandora\u2019s box, sometimes you don\u2019t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road,\u201d De Mier said. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not against genetically modified at all,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t know what I put on my table, but that\u2019s the difference \u2013 it\u2019s about choice,\u201d she said, referencing the GMO food supply. \u201cPermission has not been asked or given \u2026 This is only for Oxitec\u2019s benefit.\u201d </p> <p>What about the impact on tourism, de Mier asked?

  "<p>Sitting in Turkey\u2019s biggest airport watching the Hollywood film The Terminal, Fadi Mansour hoped to find common cause with the protagonist. While Tom Hanks\u2019s character is a fictional refugee barred from leaving an airport owing to the vagaries of visa law, Mansour is a real-life one \u2013 a 28-year-old Syrian trapped for more than a year inside Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport.</p> <p>\u201cHe was in the same situation as me, so I thought it would be useful,\u201d says Mansour, who would watch films on his tablet to pass the time. \u201cBut when I watched the movie, I realised they were dealing with it in a comic way, and my situation was not very comic.

As borders have shut to Syrians fleeing war at home and legal limbo in the Middle East, many have drowned in the Mediterranean, and some have been shot on the boundary between Turkey and Syria. </p> <p>Mansour managed to reach Turkey in November 2014, but instead of finding sanctuary, he found that Syrians were barred from legal work. So three months later he bought a fake passport and took a flight to Germany \u2013 or so he hoped. The plane went via Kuala Lumpur, and the border police there detected his false paperwork. He was promptly sent back to Turkey, where he was taken to a detention room, instead of being readmitted.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it would be hours before they would let me back in,\u201d Mansour says, recalling his immediate detention. \u201cPeople said they would send me back [to Malaysia], but I said that\u2019s impossible, I\u2019m Syrian.\u201d</p> <p>But his fellow detainees were right. After a few hours, Turkish border guards told Mansour he was to be sent back to Malaysia. \u201cI said I wanted to apply for asylum. But they said: \u2018We have 2 million Syrians here [in Turkey], and we don\u2019t want any more.\u201d</p> <p>Malaysia didn\u2019t want him either. After a three-day wait in Kuala Lumpur, he was returned again to Atat\u00fcrk airport.

I don\u2019t know how I got out of that room capable of walking. </p> <p>\u201cEven now I can\u2019t walk 300 metres without getting exhausted. You can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be in a room like that without any space and any natural light.\u201d</p> <p>Worst of all, one of the other detainees, an extremist, took a dislike to him, allegedly attacking Mansour three times. \u201cHe used to make things very hard for me,\u201d says Mansour. \u201cHe used to call me an infidel, and he literally used to say to other people that they should kill me and then they\u2019d go to heaven.\u201d</p> <p>After the third attack, eight months into his limbo, Mansour tried to go to Lebanon. But there he was also stopped at the airport, and sent back to Turkey on the same plane he came by.</p> <p>To sustain himself, Mansour would watch films on his iPad, and he took particular strength from a book by a Syrian activist, Mostafa Khalifa, documenting life inside the prisons of President Bashar al-Assad. He found The Terminal ultimately hard to relate to \u2013 but found affinity with the nonfiction book on which the film is based, the story of an Iranian who spends 18 years stuck in Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that the character in the book was much closer to me than Tom Hanks in the movie,\u201d says Mansour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Fadimans0ur/status/711152333154099200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"rtl\">Thanks God \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0644\u0644\u0647 <a href=\"https://t.co/YriI31wu9g\">pic.twitter.com/YriI31wu9g</a></p>&mdash; Fadi Mansour (@Fadimans0ur) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fadimans0ur/status/711152333154099200\">March 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Mansour can laugh about this now, because he was ultimately released. <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/get-involved/take-action-now/good-news-turkey-fadi-mansour-released-ua-28215\">Following a campaign by Amnesty International</a>, Australia heard of his case and agreed to give him asylum.

The noise inside the R2-D2 suit was said to be so loud that a crew member was assigned to tap on its shell with a hammer to signal to Baker the end of each take. With the character communicating via a combination of beeps, squeaks and whistles, the possibility of giving any kind of performance was limited. \u201cMy R2-D2 has got a definite movement to it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI can bend it forwards and backwards quite quickly and wobble it from side to side and say \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 but there\u2019s not a lot else I can do with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d252309f00ead99cf0fac504f857ae60f3fd019d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d252309f00ead99cf0fac504f857ae60f3fd019d/8_250_2788_1673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenny Baker in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenny Baker in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Return of the Jedi, Baker doubled up by appearing not only as R2-D2 but also as one of the furry <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewok\" title=\"\">Ewoks</a>.

We kept tripping over branches and, when you were down, you couldn\u2019t get up \u2013 you just had to lie there until someone picked you up.\u201d</p> <p>Baker\u2019s acting career was not limited to the Star Wars series. He had roles in David Lynch\u2019s The Elephant Man (1980), Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s Amadeus (1984) and Neil Jordan\u2019s thriller Mona Lisa (1986), though it was the fantasy genre that provided his main source of employment: he can be glimpsed, partially obscured by heavy makeup or outlandish costumes, in Flash Gordon (1980), Labyrinth (1986) and Willow (1988).</p> <p>Sometimes he would even appear with his face uncovered, as he did in Terry Gilliam\u2019s jolly fantasy Time Bandits (1981). He was warm and winning in that film as Fidgit, one of a band of dwarves who use their knowledge of the holes in the fabric of the universe to steal from the likes of Napoleon and Robin Hood.</p> <p>Born in Solihull, near Birmingham, and raised in Cheltenham, Kenny was the son of Harold, a draughtsman and engraver, and Ethel, a dressmaker, who performed locally in their own dance band, Harry Baker and His Collegians. When his parents separated during the second world war, Baker was put in the care of the <a href=\"http://www.livability.org.uk/about-us/history-and-track-record/\" title=\"\">Shaftesbury Society</a>, a Christian charity helping children with disabilities, which enrolled him in a boarding school in Sevenoaks, Kent.</p> <p>After leaving school at 16, he was approached by a company member from the performance troupe Burton Lester\u2019s Midgets and introduced to the Texan producer and impresario Lester, who gave him a part in the touring production despite his lack of previous experience. Work in pantomimes and ice shows followed. He was a clown for Billy Smart\u2019s Circus and, with Jack Purvis, formed the popular comedy double act The Mini Tones.

  "<p>The former Republican, marijuana-smoking, Everest mountaineering ex-governor of New Mexico and presidential nominee of the Libertarian party has a problem: he\u2019s barred from the presidential debates. To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn, Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15% from <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-5949.html\">around 8%</a> now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/11/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-anti-trump-republicans\">Libertarian Gary Johnson: Jeb Bush and anti-Trump Republicans will vote for me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without that national exposure, and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, it\u2019s hard for anyone to see how Johnson, 63, or either of two other minor-party candidates, the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/republican-evan-mcmullin-presidential-run-trump\">Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old former CIA counterterrorism officer</a>, could ever become more than mere electoral curiosities.</p> <p>But the emergence of three independent candidates, during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases. </p> <p>Soft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, he had a chance: \u201cI might be the next president of the United States.\u201d</p> <p>A just-released <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/polls-clinton-ahead-trump-midwest-battlegrounds-n626541\">WSJ-NBC poll </a> gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted. </p> <p> \u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you\u2019ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.\u201d</p> <p>Stein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominees in US history. <br><br>\u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d <br></p> <p>Stein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.<br></p> <p>On the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he\u2019d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.</p> <p>McMullin\u2019s best hope \u2013 and likely his only one \u2013 to make an electoral dent would require Trump\u2019s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said in his announcement. </p> <p>\u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d</p> <p>But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/us/1992-elections-president-overview-clinton-captures-presidency-with-huge.html?pagewanted=all\">18% of the vote</a>, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000\">won a paltry 2.74%</a> of the vote, and his supporters were <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-that-love-and-hate-third-party-candidates/\">split</a> between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he\u2019d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.</p> <p>But that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited. </p> <p>\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our production people may have said, \u2018Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,\u2019\u2019 McCurry <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/debates-clinton-trump-johnson-stein-226806\">told Politico</a>. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,\u201d he said, \u201cand in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019 as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said. </p> <p>Stein advanced a similar argument. \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d </p> <p>She argued that it was by elections about \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d that the country inherited many of its problems. </p> <p>But first, the two have to get on TV. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d</p>",

For the sixth duke, and most of his predecessors, it\u2019s absolutely all about those little guys. This strange fact struck me last week amid all the chatter about the unjust ramifications of the duke\u2019s sudden&#xa0;death.</p> <p>In case you missed them, here are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/11/inheritance-tax-why-the-new-duke-of-westminster-will-not-pay-billions\" title=\"\">those unjust ramifications</a> again.</p> <p>1) Of the late duke\u2019s approximately \u00a39bn, approximately \u00a30bn goes to the taxman. I\u2019m sure the Treasury gets some money, but nowhere near a billion quid, let alone the \u00a33.6bn that would be owing if the estate were liable for the standard 40% inheritance tax rate. But it isn\u2019t, obviously, for reasons that are as literally legal as they are figuratively criminal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d7a40e8f7968b399ccb637b81f2a87f7b7a9819\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7a40e8f7968b399ccb637b81f2a87f7b7a9819/0_0_1344_1539/873.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of a tree growing over a headstone.\" width=\"873\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>2) Of the late duke\u2019s approximately \u00a39bn, approximately \u00a30bn goes to his three daughters.</p> <p>3) Of the late duke\u2019s approximately \u00a39bn, approximately \u00a39bn, and the titles of Duke of Westminster, Marquess of Westminster and Viscount Belgrave, go to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/new-duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-inherit-fortune\" title=\"\">third child and only son, Hugh</a> (25).</p> <p>A lot of people don\u2019t like inheritance tax. It feels like stealing from the dead. It isn\u2019t, but it feels like it. The reasoning goes: I worked hard for my money, I paid tax on it when I earned it (not all of the above quite applies to the late duke), so why shouldn\u2019t I be able to leave it all to my children? Why should the taxman&#xa0;get&#xa0;any?</p> <p>The answer is that, in order to pay for public services, the government should take money out of the economy where it\u2019ll be least missed, where its absence is least likely to plunge people into poverty or reduce consumer spending. The money of the dead is therefore ripe for taxation: the owner no longer needs it, and his or her heirs have been doing OK without it up to now. Inheritance tax doesn\u2019t discourage earning, it discourages dying, which I think we can all get behind.</p> <p>But I understand why many people balk at that tax. I find it harder to understand where the late duke is concerned. What if \u00a33.6bn were paid in tax? That would still leave unimaginable wealth for the next generation. Even at the same rate of tax, their children would also be stratospherically well off. The financial wellbeing of his family would be assured as far into the future as he could meaningfully look. Meanwhile, his country would benefit from a significant windfall that would help millions today. That\u2019s just not the same as bereaved kids having to sell the house they grew up in to meet a tax demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk\">Sign up to the Guardian's daily email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The late duke doesn\u2019t strike me as greedy. \u201cGiven the choice I would rather not have been born wealthy, but I never think of giving it up.

He was a quiet man, obsessed with the Territorial Army and duty. But what duty? A duty to humanity, a duty to those he loved? No, a duty to the longevity of the Grosvenor family\u2019s prominence.</p> <p>So he denied both his country and his daughters significant portions of his wealth, just to keep it all together, to increase its chances of lasting, like one big ice cube instead of several smaller ones \u2013 to maximise the length of time for which people of his name will still be rich, even though they are as distant strangers to him as his ancestor, the original \u201cGros Veneur\u201d (fat huntsman), who came over with William the Conqueror.</p> <p>Those remote, theoretical Grosvenors with whom he\u2019ll share a fleck of DNA mattered more to him than his own daughters, never mind the patients of the NHS.

  "<p>When Kate Mara was 19 she skipped college \u2013 a place at the highly respected <a href=\"http://tisch.nyu.edu/\">Tisch School of Performing Arts</a> at New York University \u2013 and bought a dog, Bruno, a Boston Terrier with one blue eye. \u201cI knew I would need the company,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause where I was going, I knew literally no one.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than remain at home with her big Irish family in New York, she was headed to Los Angeles to be a star. Fourteen years later, we\u2019re at the Broome Street General Store, a small coffee shop in Silverlake, to talk about her latest movie. But Mara\u2019s is not a sentimental story \u2013 it\u2019s about ambition. She was a painfully shy girl who loathed school and couldn\u2019t bear the thought of college. \u201cI look back and think, wow, that\u2019s how ambitious I was,\u201d she says. \u201cI was prepared to go through all that. But I\u2019m glad I did. It was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Mara and her arguably better-known actor sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rooney-mara\">Rooney</a> are arm in arm on red carpets, A-listers both. But it was Kate, 33, the elder by two years, who first made the leap. Today, wearing a red sundress, she directs me to a shaded table outside. \u201cI\u2019m Irish,\u201d she says. \u201cI burn.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem the carefree, sundress type \u2013 there\u2019s a steeliness to her; precise and clear, with an almost clinical intelligence behind the eyes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWlJqsF_WVw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rWlJqsF_WVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ice queen: Kate Mara in her latest film, Morgan.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Zoe Barnes in <em>House of Cards</em>, she shone as the ruthlessly ambitious political reporter who stops at nothing until Kevin Spacey shoves her in front of a train. This part has made her a global name. \u201cI was just in London,\u201d she explains, \u201cand every time I took the tube, people would stare.\u201d In last year\u2019s Oscar contender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\"><em>The Martian</em></a>, she was a computer expert in a crew of astronauts, a nerd among nerds. In <em>Morgan</em>, her latest project, she is excellently cast as Lee Weathers, an icy executive \u201cfrom corporate\u201d who has been sent to shut down an AI research project that has gone awry. The android (Morgan) has turned violent, and while the scientists who raised \u201cher\u201d (Toby Jones and Rose Leslie) insist that she ought to be given another chance, their heartfelt appeals bounce uselessly off Mara\u2019s pinstriped trouser suit and heels. She\u2019s so tough that, though it seems improbable at first, the petite Mara spends the last third of the movie in a series of brutal fight scenes, getting hurled through windows and suchlike.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot of bruises,\u201d she grins. \u201cBut it was fun. I think when you have a tense movie like this, and you spend all day in a dark house in life-and-death scenarios, you become delirious. We\u2019d be crying with laughter at the most stupid things.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Mara is a good deal warmer than Weathers. When she learns that I, too, have a Boston Terrier, she coos over photos of the dog on my phone. She\u2019s not a reclusive celebrity. They know her here at the general store; regulars come up to say hello, and she\u2019s often seen walking her dogs with her boyfriend, the British actor Jamie Bell. \u201cIt\u2019s really therapeutic,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f59ee2859c588672a6921de94cf403795f8ed/0_86_1392_835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young at heart: in Brokeback Mountain (2005).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t fame that propelled Mara, unlike Bell, to a life of privilege \u2013 she was born that way. Her father and his siblings own the New York Giants (estimated worth $2.1bn), and her mother\u2019s side of the family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers (estimated worth $1bn). With sister Rooney she is one of four siblings who enjoyed an idyllic upbringing of football and church and huge family gatherings \u2013 her father is one of 11, and there are 22 aunts and uncles in all. She tells me they grew up about an hour north of New York city, in a suburb called Bedford \u2013 not to be confused with Bedford-Stuyvesant, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/18/michael-lavines-best-photograph-biggie-smalls-notorious-big\">Biggie Smalls</a> grew up. \u201cHaha! No, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/martha-stewart\">Martha Stewart </a>lives in Bedford. It\u2019s a bit different,\u201d she says. \u201cMind you, she went to prison too\u2026\u201d Her greatest challenge growing up was remembering the name of the new baby at Thanksgiving. \u201cThere\u2019s always a new baby in our family.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you have a tense movie like Morgan, you become delirious, crying with laughter at stupid things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they were young, their mother would regularly take her two daughters to Broadway shows and the movies. At nine years old, Mara decided she would act. \u201cRooney was different,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe explored other interests. Also, she was much better at school than me.\u201d</p> <p>She was successful even as a 14-year-old, with a bit part on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, one of the tried-and-tested stepping stones for an emerging actor. But she says she learned a valuable lesson as a teenager: that if one door closes, maybe it was meant to be, because another will surely open. \u201cI was up for a part in <em>The Sound of Music</em> on Broadway, and I was completely devastated when I didn\u2019t get it. It was like someone died. And my mum said, \u2018It\u2019s happening for a reason, just wait.\u2019 And soon afterwards I got this part in <em>Random Hearts</em>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/27/obituaries\">Sydney Pollack</a> movie, which was incredible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a4f639d079d92f27145d85ba2446d9cbe24f12/58_179_3619_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture this: In 127 Hours with James Franco and Amber Tamblyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C.Fox Search/Everett/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It stood her in good stead when she moved to LA with Bruno.

Like, don\u2019t blink so much, don\u2019t raise your eyebrows\u2026 I crave that now, but making <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, I didn\u2019t understand. I just thought I was doing a terrible job and I was going to be fired!\u201d</p> <p>Doors started to open. Movies like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/10/dvd-review-transsiberian\"><em>Transsiberian</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/127-hours-danny-boyle-review\"><em>127 Hours</em></a> got her name ever closer to the poster, and then <em>House of Cards </em>changed everything. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/fantastic-four\"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, where she met Bell, followed but wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing \u2013 widely panned, it garnered just 9% of positivity on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/\">rottentomatoes.com</a>, a hub of movie criticism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the career of the other Mara \u2013 Rooney \u2013 was soaring. Twice nominated for an Oscar, she may have entered the business long after Kate, but she has arguably surpassed her in many ways. The rivalry narrative doesn\u2019t wash. \u201cI know conflict is more interesting,\u201d says Mara, \u201cbut honestly, I just feel so grateful that we\u2019re both living our dreams successfully and to be able to share that with someone you grew up with \u2013 it\u2019s really special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be9dda8d0caaddb337ea04c51875c74cadcc8df/84_105_1747_1048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister act: Kate, left, with her sister and fellow actor, Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pace/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they\u2019ve never been up for the same job?

Her current campaigns include trying to save chimps in Liberia, putting an end to the dogs of the horrific Yulin dog meat festival in China and protecting the marine life of SeaWorld. \u201cHave you seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/08/tilikum-seaworld-orlando-killer-whale-trainer-blackfish\">Blackfish</a>?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat movie destroyed me.

  "<p>When novelists decide to write a book about contemporary political or social events, they always engage in a narrative gamble: will the episodes they\u2019re choosing to chronicle still feel timely and relevant come publication?</p> <p>Short of being in possession of a crystal ball, there was no way Gavin Extence could have known, as he sat down to write his third novel, <em>The Empathy Problem</em>, a story about a London hedge fund manager set against the backdrop of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\">2011/2012 Occupy movement,</a> that by the time the novel was published, the Occupy camp outside St Paul\u2019s would feel historical rather than contemporary. There was no way he could have predicted that the banking crisis would have long since been replaced in the headlines by the Syrian refugee crisis, the EU referendum, Islamic State and almost weekly terror attacks across Europe. As such, the backdrop for a story Extence no doubt conceived of as a state-of-the-nation tale instead feels curiously anachronistic.</p> <p>Political backdrop aside, the idea for <em>The Empathy Problem</em> holds much promise. A 32-year-old hedge fund manager, Gabriel Vaughn, discovers he has a brain tumour and only six months to live. The diagnosis \u2013 or perhaps the tumour itself \u2013 begins to alter Gabriel\u2019s behaviour profoundly , transforming him from a selfish, self-absorbed and self-aggrandising sociopath into someone who experiences \u2013 for the first time \u2013 feelings of empathy, love and slivers of social conscience.</p> <p>This is an enticing premise, with its elements of redemption. And much like Extence\u2019s bestselling debut novel in 2013 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/17/universe-alex-woods-extence-review\"><em>The Universe Versus Alex Woods</em></a>, which won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterstones_11\">Waterstones 11</a> prize \u2013 it is the kind of plot that makes you want to enjoy the book before reading has begun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <em>The Empathy Problem</em> never quite delivers on its emotional potential and the redemptive course of action Gabriel embarks upon feels underwhelming and hollow. Rather than, for instance, using the last six months of his life, and his extreme wealth, to some greater social good, Extence\u2019s protagonist chooses to wreak financial revenge on his employers and colleagues, which even he admits at the end of the book won\u2019t effect any lasting change: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a small hit to their personal fortunes, but they\u2019re still multimillionaires. They get to walk away from this relatively unscathed. In that sense, I\u2019m not sure anything I did made a huge difference.\u201d</p> <p>He sells his flat to an oligarch, despite his suspicions that the purchase is purely for money-laundering purposes, and is unable to part company with his beloved yellow Ferrari. None of this creates the emotionally edifying story the book could have been. Gabriel does help the 11 secretaries at his firm escape their menial and unfulfilling jobs, but this feels like a small victory in a novel that had the potential to be a genuinely life-affirming narrative.</p> <p>The Occupy backdrop is also underutilised. It serves as a physical manifestation of Gabriel\u2019s conscience \u2013 his office window overlooks the camp and the sight of it increasingly unsettles him \u2013 and it is the place where he meets the novel\u2019s love interest, Caitlin. There is a scene in which Gabriel meets a number of protesters, leading to some rather heavy-handed political discussions and pointed character self-justifications, but beyond this, the two story strands never really coalesce.</p> <p>Although the central relationship in <em>The Empathy Problem</em> is between Gabriel and Caitlin, whose romantic trajectory follows a conventional path of love, loss and reconciliation, it is the encounters between Gabriel and his father that provide the most touching moments. Emotionally estranged since the death of Gabriel\u2019s mother, there is a quiet tragedy to their inability to communicate.</p> <p>This is a novel that never quite gets under the skin of its story or its characters. Unlike the financial gambles that have made Gabriel a millionaire, Extence\u2019s creative gamble never quite reaps the potential rewards.</p> <p><em> The Empathy Problem is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/empathy-problem.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a313.93 </em></a></p>",

A hit on Broadway, this Tony-nominated production, attentively directed by John Tiffany, makes me see this broken ornament of a play afresh \u2013 as a tragedy of parental interference. The actors never lose sight of its emotional core: Tennessee Williams understood pity, that most uncomfortable of human emotions, better than any playwright.

This is anti-theatre \u2013 and surprisingly powerful.

The effect is of distance from performers, displacement, a sense that the story is happening inside one\u2019s head. It is a bold, unusual, moving piece about two journeys; the epic ascent of astronaut Yuri Gagarin contrasted with the frantic anonymous traversing of refugees between Morocco and Spain in a dinghy. The atmosphere is intent, peaceful \u2013 the cast is united. Suspense builds and music is used inventively \u2013 skittish riffs on a guitar stand in as the panicky reactions of a mother to her refugee daughter\u2019s plight. The contrast between the astronaut coached to stay positive, although possibly under-explored, is suggestively set against the untaught fortitude of the refugees.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/the-destroyed-room-international-festival\"><strong>The Destroyed Room</strong></a> (Lyceum, also international festival) could almost have been devised as a commentary on <em>Last Dream</em>.

It looks into the complicated reasons that people might look at images of, say, the Paris killings. Cameras on stage film the conversation (which we can also see on screen) and mediate it. Does watching other people\u2019s disasters make us feel more alive? I admired the way the piece swerves between the lives of the speakers and the subjects scrutinised.

Satie was an eccentric, a misanthrope and a hypochondriac \u2013 prone to despair about his compositions and his life. He would only eat white food, liked what he perceived as a whiteness in his own music, and wore a black bowler hat.

They play with the idea of betrayal: there is a not-always-to-be-trusted affection between them \u2013 a hand caressing another\u2019s head, a smile, an I\u2019ll-be-there-to-catch-you-when-you-fall glance. It is magical, at one point, to see the gigantic climbing shadow of one of the acrobats (looking disconcertingly like Ralph Fiennes) projected against the wall. Sitting on the rim of their circle, I succumb to the fancy that these performers are immortal.</p> <p>The following day, asylum-seekers rule once more. David Greig and Cora Bissett\u2019s buoyant musical <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/content/default.asp?page=home_GlasgowGirls\"><strong>Glasgow Girls</strong></a> (Assembly Hall) lets us into a secret: Glasgow girls can come from anywhere. Callum Cuthbertson is great as Mr Girvan, an unconventional teacher who delights us by setting Burns\u2019s poem about a mouse to music (there is a touch of Alan Bennett\u2019s Hector in <em>The History Boys</em> about him). He teaches English/Scottish to his asylum-seeker pupils, makes them feel at home. The musical\u2019s achievement is to wear its generous Glaswegian heart on its sleeve without losing the seriousness of its plot to sentimentality.</p> <p>I loved <a href=\"http://www.terryneason.co.uk\">Terry Neason</a>\u2019s Noreen, a working-class matron who claims to have been dragooned into the show by mistake.

Shvorne Marks plays Patricia with a fidgety brightness that reveals her nerves about coming home. Michelle Greenidge is her rejecting mother and Rebecca Omogbehin is Jemima, her peace-seeking sister. The performances are perfectly focused and every word compels. <strong>Amongst the Reeds</strong>, by Chino Odimba, is a snapshot of a story about what happens to a pregnant Vietnamese asylum-seeker (Jan Le\u2019s affecting Gillian), holed up with her 17-year-old friend, Oni (the charismatic Omogbehin again). Gillian thinks only of her unborn child. Oni worries persistently about deportation.

  "<p>Nightclubs \u2013 for many of us, for good or bad \u2013 were a rite of passage, a setting for myriad \u201clife-shaping moments\u201d, in the words of <a href=\"http://www.davehaslam.com/\">Dave Haslam</a>, a DJ and stalwart at the Ha\u00e7ienda in Manchester and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/10/life-after-dark-history-british-nightclubs-dave-haslam-review\"><em>Life After Dark: A History of British Nightclubs and Music Venues</em></a>. So last year, when <a href=\"http://www.mixmag.net/read/number-of-clubs-in-the-uk-have-almost-halved-since-2005-news\">news broke of the dramatic, near-halving in the number of clubs</a> in the UK, from 3,144 in 2005 to 1,733 in 2015, columnists lined up either to mourn their passing or dance joyously on their graves.</p> <p>Further indignity would soon be heaped on nightclubs. Earlier this year the Office for National Statistics announced the annual \u201cinflation basket\u201d: the 700-plus list of goods and services that are used to calculate the rate at which prices are changing. There was a clutch of new entries for 2016, including coffee pods, women\u2019s leggings and computer game downloads. There were also some telling omissions of things that are no longer so relevant to Britain now. Among the things taken off the list were: CD-Roms, rewritable DVDs and nightclub entry fees.</p> <p>What has happened to explain this dramatic fall from favour? Well, it\u2019s something of a perfect storm of factors, but the bottom line is that young people are now less inclined to gravitate towards nightclubs at the end of an evening. Contributing factors include: the spiralling costs of student life; the unstoppable rise of festivals; the launch of apps such as Tinder and entertainment sites like Spotify; the fact that nightclub selfies look dark and not especially aspirational.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Millennials would rather save their money for a blowout at a summer festival or a city break than go clubbing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some ways, though, nights out have simply diversified, as the following pages show. Where once there was only pubbing and clubbing, adventurous night owls can now choose between street-food night markets, live cinema \u201cexperiences\u201d like <a href=\"http://www.secretcinema.org/\">Secret Cinema</a>, exercise classes that kick off at midnight and a revival of bingo.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t only go to the pub any more,\u201d says Lucy Woodbridge, who organises <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/dino-snores-for-grown-ups.html\">Dino Snores for Grown-Ups</a>, an occasional adult \u201csleepover\u201d at the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for surprise, something that makes them go, \u2018Whoa, what is that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nightclubs have faced considerable external pressures, too, in the past decade. Alongside greater competition from pubs and bars, which since 2005 have been permitted to serve booze after 11pm, club owners\u2019 lives have often become entangled with increased regulation. \u201cWhen we had the End we had a 24-hour licence, we could do what we wanted, it was so free,\u201d recalls Layo Paskin, whose club ran in central London from 1995 to 2009, a golden age \u2013 its resident DJs included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fatboy-slim\">Fatboy Slim</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/05/roni-size-favourite-tracks\">Roni Size</a>. \u201cBut when I talk to people who are still involved, now the police, the council, everyone is all over you. You are trying to get hundreds, maybe 1,000-plus people who are there to have a good time to behave impeccably all the time. It\u2019s kind of tricky.\u201d </p> <p>While it is easy to become nostalgic over nightclubs, clearly one generation outgrew them and the next weren\u2019t so keen to go to them. A <em>Guardian</em> survey of 196 millennials earlier this year found that expense was a big turnoff. For students already buried under \u00a39,000 annual tuition fees, a night of taxis, entrance fees and overpriced drinks was an extravagance they couldn\u2019t afford. They would rather save their money for a blowout at a summer festival or a city break. And if going to a nightclub was always an unreliable way to find a new squeeze, online dating platforms have made it look positively prehistoric.</p> <p>This also fits with the picture of Generation Abstemious: <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/compendium/opinionsandlifestylesurvey/2015-03-19/adultdrinkinghabitsingreatbritain2013#tab-Key-points-in-2013-\">one-fifth of Britons aged 16-24 are now teetotal</a>, a number that has increased 40% between 2005 and 2013. \u201cPeople don\u2019t drink as much as they used to because they don\u2019t want to have the hangovers, because they think it\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d says Greg Drach, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.midnightrunners.co/#intro\">Midnight Runners</a>, whose six-mile bootcamp runs, accompanied by music, are proving a hit with twenty- and thirtysomethings who still want a night out. The Midnight Runners often end up finding somewhere to dance, as well. \u201cPeople are still going out, to gigs, to events of all kinds, and to dance,\u201d says Haslam. \u201cA certain kind of venue \u2013 the traditional chain-owned high street discotheque \u2013 has lost its appeal; it\u2019s those establishments that are closing. People are frequenting bars, and of course with the licensing changes many of them open late and feature DJs. But there are also some great \u2018found\u2019 spaces like old warehouses and mills, even churches.\u201d </p> <p>Paskin, who now owns the Palomar restaurant in Soho, thinks a new generation is just putting their stamp on how they want to find their fun. But that doesn\u2019t mean nightclubs are quite as anachronistic as CD-Roms. \u201cAs good as drinking and eating and socialising can be,\u201d he says, \u201cdancing is amazing in a totally different way. It\u2019s not like everyone is going to stop dancing \u2013 we\u2019ve been dancing since we were in the caves.\u201d</p> <h2>Theme nights: \u2018It\u2019s queering the norm and bringing fabulosity\u2019 </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158f56984ae4a3514b058b976d7e462d4c36c1f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158f56984ae4a3514b058b976d7e462d4c36c1f9/0_216_4877_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Redmond, AKA Amy Zing, right, with friend Tracey Ermine at Margate\u2019s Dreamland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Redmond, AKA Amy Zing, right, with friend Tracey Ermine at Margate\u2019s Dreamland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonja Horsman/Observer New Review</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps it seemed inevitable that when Amy Redmond moved to Margate three years ago the town\u2019s nightlife would soon feel her presence. <a href=\"http://amyredmond.blogspot.co.uk/?view=classic\">Redmond</a> is better known as Amy Zing, co-founder of the infamous London club night, queer collective and, in their words, \u201cmassive genderfuck\u201d <a href=\"http://www.sinkthepink.co.uk/\">Sink the Pink</a> \u2013 feted for its celebrations of dancing, drag artistry and dressing up that have carried them from house parties to the 3,000-capacity <a href=\"http://www.troxy.co.uk/\">Troxy</a>, to <a href=\"http://prideinlondon.org/\">Pride</a>, to festivals around the world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dreamland.co.uk/events/listings/eventdetail/186/9/cockles-and-muscles-margate-pride-after-party\">Cockles &amp; Muscles</a> launched in Margate last August. \u201cIt\u2019s a seaside version of Sink the Pink,\u201d Redmond explains. \u201cQueering the norm and bringing fabulosity.\u201d She wondered at first whether a small seaside town with only one gay bar would welcome such an extravaganza, but then she realised that \u201cthere\u2019s something inherently queer about Margate in its punk spirit \u2013 the culture and arts scene is so contemporary and progressive; there\u2019s a queer arts culture here that is different to anywhere I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d And perhaps even more importantly, she recognised that \u201cPeople love the silly here. And when you don\u2019t define it as being about sexuality, people realise we\u2019re all just dressing up and having lots of fun, and you can have your mind opened.\u201d</p> <p>Each event is themed: there was a Halloween party and an Under the Sea, and one that took as its inspiration Margate itself \u2013 people dressed as each other, or as local landmarks. One went as an estate agent\u2019s sign \u2013 a nod to the rapid gentrification of the area. Redmond went dressed as the Lido tower, but changed the letters to read \u201cDILDO\u201d.</p> <p>Ted Rogers, 24, moved to Margate last September. An artist and sometime dancer for Sink the Pink, he is a staunch supporter of Cockles &amp; Muscles. \u201cIt challenges the crap out of everyone,\u201d he says of its impact on the town. \u201cLike love terrorism.\u201d He says the average Cockles &amp; Muscles night is \u201clike an off crossover of an adult nursery and a sex party. By the end of the night everyone\u2019s covered in floor grime and glitter and a bit naked. It\u2019s sexy and trashy. It\u2019s a love-binge, and it feels a completely necessary, wonderful response to the state of the world right now.\u201d</p> <p>Last weekend, Margate saw its first Pride, and when we speak, Redmond is busy mapping out its route: floats, rollerskates, a procession through town past the lifeboats and the <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, home-made banners in the station, a drag race outside Sundowners, dolled-up shopfronts and DJs at <a href=\"https://www.dreamland.co.uk/\">Dreamland funfair</a>. That evening she is making carnival crowns at Out Margate, the youth programme she put together with Glynfamous, her Sink the Pink co-founder, and which she describes as being \u201clike a gay WI\u201d. Her influence on the town\u2019s nightlife is not solely reserved for the spectacular. Earlier this year, she and her husband, artist Luke Vandenberg, launched <a href=\"http://margateartsclub.tumblr.com/\">Margate Arts Club</a> \u2013 a home for late-night dancing and drinking, as well as an artists\u2019 residency programme, dinner clubs and screenings, built \u201con a shoestring, with a lot of love and trips to eBay\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud to bring what I do here, and so moved that it\u2019s been loved,\u201d she says. And it is through small changes, she believes, that you can open people\u2019s minds. \u201cThat energy is infectious. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d Still, for Redmond the best part of the night is when she gets to simply \u201cgo quiet and watch\u201d the delight and revelry around her. \u201cIt gives me so much joy.\u201d <strong>Laura Barton</strong></p> <h2>Night swimming: \u2018Sparkles come off your body as you move in the water\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"981b06be8c63044a65cc6d5cc00b1dac78cf26a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/981b06be8c63044a65cc6d5cc00b1dac78cf26a1/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Cummings, Susanne Master and Amanda Cook at Hengitsbury Head, Dorset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Night-swimmers (l-r) Keith Cummings, Susanne Master and Amanda Cook at Hengitsbury Head, Dorset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/Observer New Review</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After night has fallen, in a secluded spot along the Bournemouth coastline, Susanne Masters and her friends swim with the sea fairies. This is their name for bioluminescence \u2013 light emitted by microscopic sea creatures so faint it disappears at even the glimmer of an electric lamp.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like sparkles that come off your body as you move through the water,\u201d says Masters, who has been night-swimming there for around five years. \u201cOccasionally we\u2019ve found floating clumps of it. You can scoop your hand in the water and pull out a glowing thing the size of a 50p coin.\u201d</p> <p>The 38-year-old botanist and three close friends she met through a local outdoor swimming group often take sleeping bags to stay on the beach after their night-time dips. They fit these escapades around their everyday routines, she says, instead of living life \u201cin increments of annual leave and weekends\u201d.</p> <p>Around the country, swimming under the stars has been quietly developing from an eccentric nocturnal trend into a legitimate evening pastime. Late-night swim sessions are springing up at lidos and open waters from Berkshire to northern Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not normally open at night, but we put glowsticks in the pool and have some mulled cider afterwards,\u201d says James Totterdell, manager at <a href=\"http://www.portisheadopenairpool.org.uk/\">Portishead Open Air Pool</a> in Bristol, which held the first in its series of sold-out full-moon swims earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s like an alternative night out, where you can be outside and active.\u201d</p> <p>But some, like Masters, prefer to organise their own impromptu night-swims. Colin Tallowin, a member of the <a href=\"http://www.eastbourneswimmingclub.org/open-water-swimming/about-open-water-swimming.html\">Eastbourne Sea Swimmers</a>, has kept a diary of every full moon outing the group has done since they had the idea two years ago. \u201cThe sea was inky silk, and the huge orange moon appeared low in the sky through the black clouds,\u201d says one entry. Another describes how \u201cseven lunatics\u201d braved the choppy November currents to the disbelief of staff at a nearby fish and chip shop.</p> <p>This new wave of night-swimmers is partly down to the rise in popularity of open-air swimming in recent years, says Kate Rew, founder of the <a href=\"http://outdoorswimmingsociety.com/\">Outdoor Swimming Society</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOnce people become more confident in the day, they start looking at different types of swims,\u201d she says. \u201cAt night, what you hear and smell while swimming changes \u2013 as if you dim one sense, sight, the others are heightened.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s important to know a place well in the daytime before taking the plunge at night, says Rew. She often swims in the Thames near Oxford, where it\u2019s so quiet after dark you can hear twigs breaking under the water and night birds crashing into the trees.</p> <p>\u201cYou can swim naked, with a swimming costume, or a wetsuit,\u201d she says. \u201cIt depends on the time of year and how acclimatised you are.\u201d</p> <p>But while swimming at night could be associated with romantic skinny dips, an ice-cold bathe quickly stymies racy thoughts, says Masters.</p> <p>\u201cSwimming in cold English water is not very sexy. You go funny colours, and guys will come out looking like lobsters and then talk about how their manhood has disappeared,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBut there\u2019s definitely a joie de vivre, and a bit of love and acceptance for your body and what it can do. The next day, it feels like you\u2019ve been on an adventure.\u201d <strong>Katie Forster</strong></p> <h2>Bingo: \u2018You can have everybody dancing on the tables\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adbca83d9ba107c45bf277280c396e7c920507b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbca83d9ba107c45bf277280c396e7c920507b5/0_341_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As well as its Albert Hall, Manchester night (pictured), Bongo\u2019s Bingo has nights in Liverpool, Leeds and Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As well as its Albert Hall, Manchester night (pictured), Bongo\u2019s Bingo has nights in Liverpool, Leeds and Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/Observer New Review</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around 650 people \u2013 mostly in their 20s \u2013 have gathered in Manchester\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.alberthallmanchester.com/\">Albert Hall</a>, one of the city\u2019s most prestigious live music venues.

Likewise, at the nearby Natural History Museum\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/dino-snores-for-grown-ups.html\">Dino Snores for Grown-Ups</a> events (next one on 21 October) you\u2019re free to roam around the prehistoric giants after midnight as if you\u2019re inside a real-life version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr1fFMp0MqU\"><em>Night at the Museum</em></a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Manchester last year, the Royal Exchange threw its first ever <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/a-night-at-the-theatre-a-sleepover\">A Night at the Theatre</a> event \u2013 a programme of candlelit bedtime stories, backstage tours and a newly composed lullaby to send attendees off to sleep.</p> <p>Earlier this year I slipped into my jimjams for <a href=\"http://www.thesleepover.co.uk/\">The Sleepover</a>, an occasional, grown-up take on a girly slumber party, with talks, comedy, pampering, goody bags, endless glasses of fizz and \u2013 yes \u2013 late-night sex chat. Astrologist Shelley von Strunckel, dressed appropriately in a silky kimono, delivered a speech on magical femininity, and because it took place in the royal suite of the <a href=\"http://stpancras.com/hotel\">St Pancras Renaissance hotel</a> in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, we seized the opportunity for a photo shoot on the sweeping staircase used in the Spice Girls\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJLIiF15wjQ\">Wannabe video</a> (although I\u2019m not sure Posh would have approved of my ratty pyjama bottoms).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-coughlin\">Writer/artist Deborah Coughlin</a>, who puts on the event with BBC radio presenter Gemma Cairney, describes it as a place where \u201cdrinking meets thinking \u2013 it\u2019s like walking into the pages of your favourite magazine\u201d. Indeed, it feels rather novel to be handed a personalised star chart by von Strunckel before bedtime, instead of reading my horoscope in a paper on my own. By the time blow-up mattresses are being lined up in the main room, I\u2019m swapping secrets with someone I\u2019ve never met before as I snuggle down in my sleeping bag.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes guts to go to a sleepover with strangers,\u201d Coughlin says, but nonetheless they attract a diverse mix. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people celebrating their fortieths, others their twentysomething birthdays, groups of women and people coming on their own. They all want to try something new.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of adventure is shared by Dino Snores, which starts with workshops and shows and continues through the night with live music until 3am and a movie marathon till sunrise. \u201cIt\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.secretcinema.org/\">Secret Cinema</a> ethos,\u201d says Lucy Woodbridge, head of visitor events, referring to the successful film-screening initiative that has fuelled the appetite for immersive experiences. And that\u2019s clearly what happens when they take part in Dino Snores activities such as, say, \u201cfreaky feasts\u201d (insect eating).</p> <p>It might all sound like child\u2019s play, but these events can offer something far more rewarding than just reliving your younger years. \u201cIt\u2019s not about regression, it\u2019s about knowing when you need a different kind of space and a different kind of socialising,\u201d says Coughlin. \u201cPeople want new ways to meet people and new ways to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>So there you have it: a whole new meaning to the hashtag \u201cstraight through crew\u201d. Just don\u2019t forget your toothbrush.<strong> Kate Hutchinson</strong></p> <h2>Midnight running: \u2018People want high-quality images of themselves\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f713bfa715e4b398bb147ec675511aa10814ef02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f713bfa715e4b398bb147ec675511aa10814ef02/219_19_1364_818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London\u2019s Midnight Runners in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London\u2019s Midnight Runners in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tanya Raab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eighteen months ago, Christian D\u00f6rffer and Greg Drach were two friends who enjoyed running late at night along the river Thames. Now they pound the same route joined by up to 400 strangers. When they recently organised a midnight, pop-up run in Barcelona, the turnout was around 4,000 people. Many ended up in a club afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cThe story of <a href=\"http://www.midnightrunners.co/#intro\">Midnight Runners</a> is the story of people bringing their friends to something they think is fun,\u201d says Drach, who is 27. \u201cAnd [a story of] social media,\u201d adds D\u00f6rffer, 45. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that the people who run with us love to be photographed. This is part of their DNA on Facebook or Instagram. They want the right kind of images of themselves and we produce really high-quality images of people doing cool stuff, like running at sunset, or in the dark in front of the Shard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey put it as their profile picture,\u201d Drach smiles, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cLike, \u2018This is who I am. I\u2019m a Midnight Runner\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Night-running clubs are growing in popularity across the UK, but the Midnight Runners believe they are the country\u2019s biggest group, with meet-ups coordinated on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/londonmidnightrunners/\">Facebook</a>. Their events are free of charge \u2013 for now; a membership fee of around \u00a310 a month will soon apply \u2013 and the group typically meets twice a week: for a six-mile bootcamp run on Tuesday nights and a longer run on Sundays. Then, once a month on a Friday, they have a themed, dress-up run \u2013 007, carnival, pirates. All of these are usually in London, although over the summer they are doing some trail runs further afield. The only qualification for joining is that you should comfortably be able to run six miles.</p> <p>According to Facebook stats, the majority of Midnight Runners are aged between 26 and 34, and around two-thirds are female. The first members were typically foreigners working in the capital, but there is now a strong showing of Brits, too.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the proportion of single people is \u2013 I assume it\u2019s significant,\u201d says D\u00f6rffer, a Dane who works for an investment fund. Drach, who is Polish and creates fitness mobile apps, nods: \u201cThere have been a few relationships, which is great to see. London is a huge city and it can be quite lonely, and from our perspective it\u2019s like, wow, these people would never have met \u2013 probably \u2013 if not for one of our events.\u201d</p> <p>Music is an essential part of the Midnight Runners experience. D\u00f6rffer makes a new playlist every month and a handful of crew captains carry portable Ultimate Ears speakers. After each run there is a social gathering, and these can become especially raucous after the monthly Friday-night event. The July meet-up saw a couple of hundred sweaty runners descend on a bar in Hackney Wick; when that closed at 3am, they went outside, turned on the portable speakers and stayed for another hour.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the drink, it\u2019s that it\u2019s hard to speak while you are running,\u201d says Drach. \u201cA lot of people just have water, but the social part is central, so we probably do tap in to this trend of people finding alternative ways to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>D\u00f6rffer agrees: \u201cI maybe know the names of 3% of our group, but we high-five each other, we hug each other. I have no idea where they are from or what they do, but everybody treats each other with respect, so that\u2019s the special thing.\u201d <strong>Tim Lewis</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last year, Ethan Hawke and director Andrew Niccol thoughtfully took on drone warfare in <a href=\"http://\"><em>Good Kill</em></a> and audiences shrugged. Similar in scope and sentiment, Gavid Hood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZeVSdKtQVY\"><strong>Eye in the Sky</strong></a><strong> </strong>(eOne, 15) was a grown-up hit this spring. It\u2019s not appreciably a better film, but call it the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/26/helen-mirren-interview-sally-hughes\">Helen Mirren</a> effect: her brisk gravitas is a brand in itself and she\u2019s on familiarly formidable form here as a British colonel commanding a missile attack on a Nairobi terrorist safehouse. Mirren\u2019s character is merely one cog, however, in the heaving, not wholly effective international machine of modern remote warfare. From the American drone pilot (Aaron Paul) in Nevada to the Kenyan field agent (Barkhad Abdi) on the scene to a distracted British foreign secretary (Iain Glen) in Singapore, authority and accountability are dispersed in a manner that the film ethically debates with smart sobriety. Hood, the Oscar-winning South African director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tsotsi\"><em>Tsotsi</em></a>, has made his best film here; if his style is marked by dispassionate efficiency, he\u2019s landed on an ideal subject for it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1l_J9QuVk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4I1l_J9QuVk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1l_J9QuVk\">Watch the trailer for Louder Than Bombs.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A film that could use a little less caution is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1l_J9QuVk\"><strong>Louder Than Bombs</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Soda, 15), a formally refined, emotionally intelligent, yet somehow disappointing foray into English-language film-making for Norwegian <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1258686/?ref_=tt_ov_dr\">Joachim Trier</a>, whose <em>Reprise</em> and <em>Oslo, August 31st</em> throbbed with complex, unresolved feeling. In this stricken family melodrama, pivoting on a characteristically excellent, flashback-present Isabelle Huppert as a deceased mother and war photographer, the conflicts are a little too tidy. As her weary widower (Gabriel Byrne) and respectively neurotic and withdrawn sons (Jesse Eisenberg and Devin Druid) negotiate her absence via a host of masculine insecurities, the film is certainly affecting, yet everybody hurts and heals in the precise places you\u2019d expect.</p> <p>A more manic Scandinavian-directed game of unhappy families is on offer in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYVlN5hTP0M\"><strong>Men &amp; Chicken</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Arrow, 15). Anders Thomas Jensen\u2019s kooky, black-hearted comedy follows two brothers (David Dencik and a drastically de-suaved Mads Mikkelsen) as they belatedly trace their biological roots to a grotesquely dysfunctional all-male clan on the Danish island of Ork; it\u2019s amiably horrible, if such a thing is possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b37ffcbe16a4ff4dcd27fdc70d75d532002e735\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b37ffcbe16a4ff4dcd27fdc70d75d532002e735/0_13_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron in The Hunstman: Winter\u2019s War\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron in The Hunstman: Winter\u2019s War.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Female sibling rivalry provides a fleeting frisson of camp to the otherwise mechanically fantastical stodge of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W65ndip7MM\"><strong>The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Universal, 12). As Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt\u2019s duelling sister queens wage a brief battle of fire, feathers and ice toward the climax of this bafflingly Snow White-free prequel-cum-sequel to <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em>, it\u2019s gaudily exciting enough to make you wonder why we\u2019ve spent most of its running time in the company of Chris Hemsworth\u2019s mirthless title character. Otherwise, this flaccid fairytale exemplifies the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-new-problem-sequels-moviegoers-899765\">sequel-for-sequel\u2019s-sake</a> mentality of current Hollywood franchise-building; Kristen Stewart is well off out of it.</p> <p>On the rerelease front, the Criterion Collection continues its UK run with a handsome reissue of 1979\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/28707-the-in-laws\"><strong>The In-Laws</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Sony, E), a chipper screwball runaround elevated by the inspired comic pairing of Peter Falk and Alan Arkin as polar-opposite paters of a soon-to-wed young couple. There are those who regard this as a classic; funny as it is, I\u2019m not sure Arthur Hiller\u2019s film rewards quite such lacquered preservation, though its influence on an ensuing decade or so of action-laced bristling-buddy comedies is plain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pASs3rerRCY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pASs3rerRCY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pASs3rerRCY\">Watch a trailer for Wendy and Lucy.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A less surprising candidate for discerning Blu-ray resurrection is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059527/\"><strong>The Shop on the High Street</strong></a> (Second Run, 15), J\u00e1n K\u00e1dar and Elmar Klos\u2019s elegant, Oscar-winning Holocaust fable about the conflicted friendship between an elderly Jewish shopkeeper and the \u201cAryan controller\u201d she believes merely to be her hired assistant. A 1965 cornerstone of the Czech new wave, it tips the tragicomic balance to gradually wrenching effect. Also worth a revisit: Luchino Visconti\u2019s penultimate film, made in 1974, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiUp8ik2dQg\"><strong>Conversation Piece</strong></a> (Eureka, 18). Starring Burt Lancaster as an ageing professor opening his Rome apartment to hedonist invasion, it\u2019s an alternately stilted, seductive and (for the aristocratically reared Visconti) self-lacerating class satire, every inch the curiosity implied by its title.</p> <p>Finally, with her wonderful new film <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/certain-women-review-kristen-stewart-1201687531/\"><em>Certain Women</em></a> heading to cinemas later this year, American micro-master <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/21/-sp-kelly-reichardt-my-films-are-just-glimpses-of-people-passing-through\"><strong>Kelly Reichardt</strong></a><strong> </strong>is the subject of a deserved tribute from mubi.com, <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing\">streaming four of her finely grained features</a> \u2013 <em>Old Joy</em>, <em>Wendy and Lucy</em>, <em>Meek\u2019s Cutoff</em> and her newly restored 1994 debut <em>River of Grass</em> \u2013 until early September. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Reichardt\u2019s school of still-waters humanism, I\u2019d suggest beginning with the Michelle Williams-fronted <em>Wendy and Lucy</em>, a girl-and-her-dog story of rugged individualism in the American heartland that crushes your heart in the lowest of registers; tiny and yet vastly searching, it\u2019s among the greatest films of the new century.</p>",

Surfer Nancy (Blake Lively, impressive in a physically demanding role) decides to catch one last wave in an isolated cove in Mexico.

  "<p>\u2018I\u2019m really excited that at last we\u2019re going to have a night tube,\u201d says the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Until now, innumerable nights out in the capital have been brought to a premature end by \u201cthe last train\u201d: after midnight, normally quick journeys become impossible odysseys. Uber has provided a welcome (if costly) alternative, but the biggest change to Londoners\u2019 nightlife will be the <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/what-we-are-doing/night-tube\" title=\"\">advent of the 24-hour tube on Friday</a>. On Fridays and Saturdays, underground trains will run every 10 or 20 minutes on the Central and Victoria lines (Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly will follow in the autumn).</p> <p>Khan continues: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a win-win situation. London is the theatre capital of the world, we have fantastic concerts, we have some of the world\u2019s best restaurants and hotels, so it\u2019s about connecting those dots. Four out of five tourists come to London because of our cultural offer, and you can\u2019t have a situation where people are worried about how they get home.\u201d</p> <p>The night tube will provide a valuable boost to London\u2019s night-time economy, and later this year Khan will announce a \u201cnight tsar\u201d, who will champion the importance of the city\u2019s nightlife while balancing the needs of businesses, workers, residents and party-goers.</p> <p>Similar positions exist in Paris, Toulouse and Zurich, but perhaps the most established is former club promoter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/night-mayor-amsterdam-holland-mirik-milan-night-time-commission\" title=\"\">Mirik Milan</a>, who has been night mayor of Amsterdam since 2013. Milan believes a vibrant night-time economy benefits a city from social, cultural and economic perspectives: \u201cSocially, it\u2019s about people meeting: we\u2019re looking more at our screens than looking people in the eye, so it\u2019s really important. Culturally, look at the club scene in New York in the 1980s \u2013 it was a home to the LGBT community, where they could express themselves. And economically, if companies are thinking \u2018Where will I place my new headquarters\u2019, they\u2019re looking at schooling, housing, social structures, but also at what there is to do. Not everybody moves to London for the weather. If you want to be competitive, leisure and hospitality is much more important nowadays.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1e82888da2852f08c6649974df2023be90e1dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1e82888da2852f08c6649974df2023be90e1dc/0_13_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"No sweat: getting home from a night\u2019s clubbing in London will be easier.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No sweat: getting home from a night\u2019s clubbing in London will be easier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PYMCA/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Policy thinker and writer <a href=\"http://centreforlondon.org/person/ben-rogers/\" title=\"\">Ben Rogers</a>, director of think tank Centre for London, suggests that to maximise efficiency, London\u2019s infrastructure should be put to use throughout the night, for example with night-time deliveries to reduce levels of congestion, or by using space inventively. \u201cYou walk down Oxford Street, arguably the world\u2019s most famous retail street, at 9.30pm, and it\u2019s absolutely dead, there\u2019s no after-hours offer, you can\u2019t get a drink. Why isn\u2019t John Lewis turning its ground floor into a series of pop-up eateries? If we\u2019re going to get serious about this, there\u2019s huge potential to do things in a creative and interesting way.\u201d</p> <p>The night-time economy \u2013 made up of pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, music venues and so on \u2013 is the UK\u2019s fifth biggest industry: <a href=\"http://www.tbr.co.uk/pages/tbr-observatory/night-time-economy.php\" title=\"\">according to economic research consultancy TBR</a>, it accounts for 1.3m jobs, and has a yearly revenue of \u00a366bn (6% of the UK total). This week <a href=\"http://londonfirst.co.uk/londons-24-hour-economy-could-be-worth-nearly-30bn-annually-by-2030-2/\" title=\"\">a report</a> for independent body London First estimated that London\u2019s night-time economy could be worth nearly \u00a330bn annually by 2030. Khan says: \u201cBearing in mind the jobs it creates and the businesses it supports, a night-time economy is part and parcel of being one of the world\u2019s greatest cities, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we allow it to flourish and thrive rather than be at risk. If we\u2019re not careful, other cities \u2013 from Amsterdam to Paris to Berlin to New York to Tokyo \u2013 will overtake us, which will mean bad news for our economy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thousands of Londoners work through the night, and many of them take two or three night buses to get to work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In March this year the former London mayor, Boris Johnson, set up the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/night-time-commission-for-the-capital\" title=\"\">Night Time Commission</a>, an investigation into how to protect and manage London\u2019s night-time economy, which will report its findings in the autumn. Its members are diverse: local councillors, TfL staff, Home Office representatives, club owners and various creatives, including Undertones vocalist Feargal Sharkey. How does everyone get along? \u201cIt\u2019s taken a bit of time,\u201d says Alan Miller, NTC member and former owner of Vibe Bar in east London. \u201cEveryone had their concerns initially but they\u2019re starting to recognise that it\u2019s bigger than any one of us or our groups. Most of the police recognise that it\u2019s far better to have things lit up, with eyes and ears on the street.\u201d</p> <p>But negotiating something that works for everyone isn\u2019t easy: a balance needs to be found between revellers and residents, who tend to have conflicting needs. Jo Negrini, NTC member and chief executive of Croydon council, says: \u201cThe night tube is going to increase people\u2019s participation at night in London generally, which is a really good thing. But how do you balance that with the big issue of residential amenity? That will be the biggest challenge: wanting people to enjoy the city 24 hours a day but also being clear that it\u2019s a place where people do other things, live, work, enjoy outdoor spaces, use the city in a whole range of different ways.\u201d</p> <p>The NTC is also looking at diversifying nightlife: boutiques, yoga, gyms, cafes, bookshops, poetry nights. More varied activities would attract a range of ages at night, but it also means more people working late. Transport for London <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/tube-improvements/what-we-are-doing/night-tube?cid=nighttube\" title=\"\">estimates</a> the night tube will support 2,000 additional permanent jobs and boost the economy by \u00a3360m. It will also make commuting easier for Londoners who already work nights. Khan says: \u201cThere are thousands of Londoners who work through the night \u2013 nurses, doctors, bodyguards, porters \u2013 and many of them take two or three night buses to get to work.\u201d</p> <p>Negrini believes that, although it will have an impact for councils in terms of basic services such as street cleaning and waste disposal, the night tube will have positive effects on areas outside of London\u2019s Zone 1. \u201cIt\u2019s about decentralising everything: what you would want is an increase in opportunities for people in terms of employment and generating economies in places like Croydon and at the different ends of the tube lines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f5b063f74067fb1c5489aa402ae077f01984e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5b063f74067fb1c5489aa402ae077f01984e10/0_113_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands have to work at night, and London should be friendlier to them, say campaigners\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands have to work at night, and London should be friendlier to them, say campaigners</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, night work comes with its own problems: it has been associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/28/night-shift-three-million-workers-health-risks-obesity-cancer-diabetes\" title=\"\">health issues</a> including obesity, diabetes and breast cancer, and <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/shift-work-and-relationships/\" title=\"\">adverse effects</a> on home life and relationships. It is also a source of unhappiness for many who have it thrust upon them: after plans for the night tube were announced, tube drivers were involved in a number of controversial strikes. This, <a href=\"https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-confirms-new-strike-dates-in-night-tube-dispute/\" title=\"\">said RMT general secretary Mick Cash</a>, was \u201cto protect their work/life balance and not fall into a trap where they will be forced to wreck their home lives in order to [...] plug the staffing&#xa0;gaps&#xa0;in&#xa0;the&#xa0;night tube plans\u201d.</p> <p>Keeping all this in mind, Ben Rogers suggests increasing minimum wage and living wage rates for night work: \u201cI\u2019m all for night-time activity in London but I think it\u2019s important to attend to the welfare of night workers. A higher rate of pay would take into account some of the costs associated with shift work.\u201d</p> <p>Another central concern is safety: with the police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/theresa-may-police-years-budget-cuts-come\" title=\"\">increasingly stretched</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35773749\" title=\"\">predictions that sex offences will rise</a> on the night tube, keeping Londoners safe will be a challenge. In March, British Transport Police identified <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/revealed-the-tube-stations-where-crime-could-rise-when-night-tube-starts-a3199961.html\" title=\"\">12 \u201cred stations\u201d</a> at risk of increased crime and antisocial behaviour, which will receive extra patrols, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32896183\" title=\"\">announced</a> that 100 officers would be patrolling the 144 open stations, which will continue to be staffed. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people feel safe using the night tube,\u201d says Khan. \u201cWe\u2019ll be announcing additional officers in London when full services are under way, with at least as many officers out during the night as would be during the day.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is who we are, we go out, we eat, we drink and dance and socialise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mirik Milan acknowledges that nightlife has both an upside and a downside but feels that the problems need to be addressed pragmatically. One solution he implemented in Amsterdam was negotiating 24-hour licensing in 10 venues in and around the city: he argues that if you force everyone out of clubs at the same time, they\u2019ll still be full of energy, be annoyed and make noise, while unrestricted opening hours mean people leave gradually, quietly and in their own time. \u201cIt was an amazing, tangible step forward for Amsterdam, and a lot of venues have benefited from it.\u201d</p> <p>After a relaxation of UK licensing laws in 2005, it is theoretically possible to serve alcohol 24 hours a day in Britain, but venues need to follow the regulations set by their local council. As a result, many pubs still stop serving at 11pm. Negrini thinks that London\u2019s local licensing regulations \u201cwill absolutely need to be reviewed. All the local authorities need to be working together on that to make sure that there\u2019s a common approach across the city.\u201d</p> <p>Alan Miller is leading a campaign, <a href=\"http://nightlifematters.com\" title=\"\">#nightlifematters</a>, encouraging local residents who value nightlife to write to their MPs and councillors so that they don\u2019t just hear the complaints side. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting the voice of the silent majority to be heard,\u201d he says. Nightlife is also an important part of individual and national identity, adds Miller: \u201cQuite rightly, when the Bataclan happened, people in France said: \u2018This is who we are, we go out, we eat, we drink and dance and socialise.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The night tube arrives at a difficult time in Britain\u2019s after-hours scene, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/11/clubs-closing-nightlife-uk\" title=\"\">45% of UK nightclubs</a> shutting down in the past 10 years and London losing 35% of its grassroots music venues between 2007 and 2015. Khan is planning a policy that protects music venues and nightclubs based on the <a href=\"http://musicvenuetrust.com/2014/09/what-is-agent-of-change-and-why-is-it-important/\" title=\"\">\u201cagent of change\u201d principle</a>: if housing developers are planning to build homes nearby, the cost of the noise insulation will fall to them. He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re also going to make sure that planning law is such that if you want to change a music venue or a nightclub from what it\u2019s currently being used for to luxury flats, you need to have very good reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Expectations for the night tube are high, then, but London\u2019s night-time economy won\u2019t be transformed overnight. \u201cOften people hope that when something changes, it\u2019s like a magic wand,\u201d says Milan. \u201cBut it\u2019s always a slow process: you will only get behavioural change if people invest more in their communities, if they have more sense of belonging. But the night tube is a really good step forward, and I think London has the obligation to do it, to keep it liveable and attractive for young people.\u201d</p> <p>For thousands of Londoners, young and old, Friday will be momentous. Will Khan be there? \u201cYou betcha. The question is whether I\u2019ll be allowed to go in the driver\u2019s cabin or not.\u201d</p> <h2>Night-time economies around the world</h2> <h2>Berlin </h2> <p>As the techno capital of the world, Berlin is famed for its unregulated and never-ending nightlife. By banding together to form a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/03/berlin-clubs-royalties-closure-threat\" title=\"\">club commission</a>, more than 100 club owners have ensured that they speak with one voice and protect their cause. For example, new arrivals to an area cannot complain about noise that predated their move.</p> <h2><strong>Buenos Aires</strong></h2> <p>Evening meals starting at midnight, late-night ice -cream vendors, and 2am cinema screenings are just some of the things that are keeping residents, young and old, from heading home. But the city\u2019s night culture is increasingly under pressure: the Argentinian capital is one of the noisiest places on the planet, and the government is introducing fines for owners emitting noise in excess of&#xa0;90&#xa0;decibels.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong </strong><br></h2> <p>Finding bars and clubs open until 4am is not a problem in Hong Kong, one of the least regulated night-time economies on earth. But many licensed venues are struggling because of the competition they face from convenience stores selling cheap alcohol 24 hours a day. Venues are pushing the government to impose greater restrictions.</p> <h2><strong>Sydney </strong><br></h2> <p>Responding to problems with alcohol-fuelled violence, the New South Wales government imposed <a href=\"http://www.nsw.gov.au/newlaws\" title=\"\">a curfew on clubs and bars</a>: no more customers after 1.30am and no alcohol after 3am. The restrictions had mixed results: while street incidents were cut by 40%, footfall in the whole district plummeted by 82% last year, and 40 clubs have closed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e6e601cb665536290b64be5c8517d3f2d9b6ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e6e601cb665536290b64be5c8517d3f2d9b6ca/0_0_4640_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clubbing in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clubbing in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tokyo</strong><br></h2> <p>New regulations came into force in June this year, letting clubs apply for a licence to stay open until 5am, and overturning a 67-year-old law forbidding dancing in clubs after midnight.

From my very unscientific sample of half a dozen people, the most common answer was that tickets are too expensive for most locals. The cheapest Olympics tickets are 40Rs (a little under \u00a310) which are mostly for sports that are little known in Brazil such as hockey and rugby. </p> <p>That is a lot for people earning the minimum wage of 880Rs (about \u00a3200), especially when you add the cost of transport to the mostly distant venues. Other answers were that people were opposed to the Olympics on political grounds or that they were not interested in most of the sports.</p> <p>On the subject of ticket give-aways not happening, this may have something to do with a judge\u2019s ruling earlier this year that the Rio government must not hand out tickets in a municipal election year because it might influence votes. I have been trying to get confirmation from Rio2016 but no response yet.<br></p> <p>Finally, it is important to note that this is not just Brazil\u2019s fault. As my colleague Owen Gibson notes part of the problem is that authorised re-sellers (many of whom are based overseas) have not been able to shift tickets. In that case, the empty seats might be caused by the Zika epidemic, crime and other negative stories about Rio in the run-up to the Games.</p> <p>On a separate note, I\u2019m now watching the last two minutes of a cracking basketball game between regional rivals Brazil and Argentina. Just three points in it. The crowd are going crazy. Can\u2019t see an empty seat.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57af7091e4b0c23bfed89310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-13T19:13:52.572Z\">8.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadal is cooking in the third set, pushing Del Potro on his serve and geeing up the largely pro-Rafa crowd.

Due to illness, he was drafted into the GB 4x200 metre relay which they duly won.</em></p> <p><em>Perhaps the award for most multiple events would go to the German, Carl Schuhmann, who took part in the 1908 games. Not content with winning team golds in two events at the gymnastics and an individual gold in the vault, he entered and won the wrestling competition. He also too part in the weightlifting, triple-jump, long-jump, and shot putt during the same games.<br><br>The most unusual multi-eventer was probably Walter Winans, (US) who won silver for shooting and gold for sculpture at the 1912 Olympics.\u201d</em></p> <p>Shooting and sculpture: together at last.

You\u2019d probably start by pointing out he\u2019s now the oldest man to win a gold medal in Olympic swimming after his triumph in the 50m freestyle and end by pointing out that when he won his last, as a 19-year-old in the 2000 Sydney Games, he ended up hawking it on eBay to raise $17,000 for the UNICEF tsunami relief fund.

You can keep up with all the action as it unfolds on the Guardian live blog, which unlike most events at these Games, never stops.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p> Day seven will go down in history for a number of reasons, not least for the records that fell in the velodrome. In the men\u2019s team pursuit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/team-gb-bradley-wiggins-olympic-gold-mens-team-pursuit-australia\">Team GB triumphed in world record time</a> as <strong>Ed Clancy</strong>, <strong>Steven Burke</strong> and <strong>Owain Doull</strong> played no small part in Bradley Wiggins leaving the arena as Great Britain\u2019s most decorated Olympian. His eight medals \u2013 five of them gold \u2013 lift him above Chris Hoy as the G.O.A.T of Team GB and unless they reintroduce medals for poetry, like the one Pierre de Coubertin won in 1912, there\u2019s little left for the cycling great to achieve. That was bad luck for the Australians, who crossed the line 0.743 seconds slower for silver.</p> <p> Shots have been fired by Team USA\u2019s <strong>Hope Solo</strong>, and we\u2019re not talking about action at the gun range. After Solo and her world <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/usa-lose-womens-football-sweden-olympic-quarter-finals-penalty-kicks\">No1-ranked football team-mates were dumped from the Games</a> in a sensational penalty shoot-out, the US goalkeeper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">accused triumphant victors Sweden of being a bunch of cowards</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it far in the tournament,\u201d Solo said after the game. \u201cI think it was very cowardly. But they won, they moving on and we\u2019re going home.\u201d At least her final thought on the matter rang true: \u201cLosing sucks. I\u2019m really bad at it.\u201d</p> <p> The Games also shift a gear from here on in with action under way in the athletics arena, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/the-athletics-elite-turns-up-on-time-but-rio-seems-still-to-be-in-bed\">but as our own Barney Ronay tells us, there\u2019s just not many people on hand to watch it all</a>. As Olympians compete for gold medals \u2013 and while Ethiopia\u2019s <strong>Almaz Ayana</strong> destroyed the 10,000m world record \u2013 bad weather and what would appear to be local apathy have meant crowds more in line with the Goodwill Games, or perhaps a school sports day.</p> <p>Much happier was the sight of 21-year-old Singaporean <strong>Joseph Schooling</strong> being passed the baton, of sorts, when he usurped <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> for gold in the 100m butterfly, a final in which there was an incredible three-way dead heat for silver. Schooling is yet another in the long line of athletes at these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/michael-phelps-taught-a-lesson-for-once-by-singapores-joseph-schooling\">Games who had their photo taken with Phelps</a> as gawky young children. </p> <p><strong><strong>You should also know:</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/north-korean-weightlifter-says-olympic-gold-will-make-beloved-kim-jong-un-happy\"> North Korean athletes say gold would make Kim Jong-un happy, which seems an understatement.</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/mark-cavendish-british-cycling-row-denial\">British Cycling have been forced to deny a rift between Mark Cavendish and Team GB\u2019s coach</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/13/sir-bradley-wiggins-pulls-clear-from-roll-of-british-sporting-greats\">Owen Gibson has everything you\u2019ll need to know about Bradley Wiggins reaching the summit.</a> </li> </ul> <h2> Team GB roundup</h2> <p> Putting aside all the gold being won in the velodrome, Team GB has also triumphed in the rowing, where <strong>Helen Glover </strong>and<strong> Heather Stanning</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/helen-glover-heather-stanning-rio-2016-olympics-rowing\">retained their Olympic coxless pairs title</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve been so emotional this week and that\u2019s not me at all,\u201d said Stanning, the army major who followed her 2012 medal with a tour of Helmand Province. A real under-achiever, in other words. </p> <p> After that, <strong>Alex Gregory</strong>, <strong>Constantine Louloudis</strong>, <strong>George </strong><strong>Nash</strong> and <strong>Mo Sbihi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/great-britain-mens-four-olympic-gold\">rowed \u201cthe perfect race\u201d </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/12/great-britain-mens-four-olympic-gold\">to win gold in the men\u2019s four</a>.

Despite a strong finish from the Australians the defending champion Brits held firm to win by two-thirds of a boat length. They were happy though.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/liberal-leaders-slap-down-stephen-conroy-for-escalating-south-china-sea-tensions\">Labor senator Stephen Conroy</a> says he is \u201cabsolutely gobsmacked\u201d to hear Tony Abbott now wishes he had supported the former Gillard government\u2019s people-swap deal with Malaysia, rather than opposed it. </p> <p>Abbott admitted on Friday to wondering whether his decision to oppose the former Gillard government\u2019s so-called \u201cMalaysia solution\u201d in 2011 had contributed to the \u201chyper-partisanship\u201d that now poisons Australian politics.</p> <p>Conroy said on Sunday the current scandals inside the Nauru and Manus Island detention centres would have been avoided if the Gillard government\u2019s proposal to send 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia in exchange for 4000 processed refugees had been allowed to go through parliament when Abbott was the opposition leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/14/manus-island-photos-show-aftermath-of-violent-attack-afghan-refugees\">Manus island: photos show aftermath of violent attack on Afghan refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis would have avoided all of these problems,\u201d Conroy told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cThere were 600-odd deaths [at sea] after the \u2018Malaysia solution\u2019 was rejected and all of the problems that have now emerged at Nauru and Manus would not have happened.\u201d</p> <p>In late 2011 the high court ruled that the Gillard government\u2019s so-called \u201cMalaysia solution\u201d was invalid and Abbott refused to support the then government\u2019s bill to override the ruling. </p> <p>But on Friday Abbott said in a speech to the <a href=\"http://samuelgriffith.org.au/\">Samuel Griffith Society</a> that he now wonders about his behaviour then.</p> <p>\u201cThe 800 boat people that could have been sent to Malaysia was less than a month\u2019s intake, even then,\u201d <a href=\"http://tonyabbott.com.au/2016/08/transcript-of-the-hon-tony-abbott-mp-address-to-the-samuel-griffith-society-stamford-plaza-hotel-adelaide/\">Abbott said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it would have worked. Still, letting it stand would have been an acknowledgment of the government of the day\u2019s mandate to do the best it could, by its own lights, to meet our nation\u2019s challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been a step back from the hyper-partisanship that now poisons our public life.\u201d</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, seized on Abbott\u2019s comments on Sunday, saying the Turnbull government should now support a Senate inquiry into the detention of people in Nauru, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\">allegations of abuse and self-harm in incident reports leaked to Guardian Australia</a> last week.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very telling that Tony Abbott himself said that he wishes he\u2019d gone with Labor\u2019s Malaysia solution a few years ago and we could have perhaps avoided what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d Shorten said.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the government, in the spirit of bipartisanship, will accept our invitation and support a Senate inquiry.</p> <p>The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said on Sunday there ought to be a royal commission into the events inside Nauru\u2019s detention centre.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile these centres continue to be open we\u2019re going to the sort of abuses occurring on kids,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>The Labor senator Sam Dastyari told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program that the Turnbull government had a \u201csecrecy fetish\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWho are we as a nation, who are we as a people, if we\u2019re going to turn around and turn a blind eye to this type of human rights violations?\u201d Dastyari said.<br></p>"
