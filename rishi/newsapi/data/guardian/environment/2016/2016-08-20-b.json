  "<p>While the nation was enveloped in Olympics fever last week, celebrating the success of British athletes at the peak of physical perfection, the government published its long-awaited childhood obesity strategy. It was a disgrace, so thin on action it barely deserves to be labelled a strategy. It will condemn too many British children to a lifetime of health problems and a premature death.</p> <p>One in three children leaves primary school overweight or obese, putting them at significantly greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes later in life. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, has described obesity as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/31/obesity-new-smoking-nhs-england-chief-executive\">\u201cthe new smoking\u201d</a>; the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has labelled childhood obesity a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/07/childhood-obesity-national-emergency-jeremy-hunt-health-sugar-tax-jamie-oliver\">\u201cnational emergency\u201d</a>; and the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Sally Davies, has called on the government to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/10/obesity-endangers-health-women-babies-chief-medical-officer\">include obesity alongside terrorism in its national risk planning.</a> This is far from hyperbole: poor diet is the nation\u2019s biggest premature killer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/poor-diet-biggest-contributor-early-deaths-world-study\">ahead of smoking and drinking</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/13/doctors-tax-sugar-drinks-uk-obesity-bma-children\">costs the NHS around \u00a36bn a year</a>.</p> <p>Last year, the government promised a \u201cdraconian\u201d approach to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/18/former-ministers-attack-massive-damp-squib-childhood-obesity-plan\">tackling childhood obesity</a>. Yet there were really only two significant measures in the watered-down plan. First, a sugar levy on soft drinks, already announced under David Cameron, which would have been very difficult for Theresa May to renege upon. While a positive step, this is unlikely to achieve anything like the progress needed without being part of a broader package of measures to cut children\u2019s sugar and fat intakes. It is also likely to be tied up for years in the courts as it is subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/20/drinks-makers-consider-legal-action-against-sugar-tax-budget\">challenge by soft drinks manufacturers,</a> if it is ever implemented at all. Second, the strategy set out measures to promote physical exercise, which, while uncontroversial, cannot alone counteract the impact of unhealthy diets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The food industry is notorious for using friendly cartoon characters and online games to market directly at children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just as telling is what\u2019s missing. A year ago, Public Health England reviewed the evidence about what works in reducing obesity. It called for far-reaching measures: to reduce junk-food advertising directed at children, to limit the number of supermarket promotions on unhealthy foods, and to force manufacturers to gradually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/22/public-health-england-obesity-report-key-points\">reduce the sugar content of high-sugar foods</a>. None features in the government\u2019s strategy: it simply sets out a voluntary approach to asking manufacturers to reduce sugar levels over time. This is the same approach adopted by former health secretary Andrew Lansley in his 2011 \u201cresponsibility deal\u201d, which left it up to the food and drinks industry to voluntarily change its approach. Yet studies have shown it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/12/food-industry-responsibility-deal-little-effect-health-study\">failed to work</a>.</p> <p>This is hardly surprising. There is a race to the bottom at work in our food industry. Packing foods with addictively delicious \u2013 and cheap \u2013 fat, salt and sugar is one of the fastest ways to a healthy profit. Once the worst offenders go down this road, conditioning our palates to crave more of the unhealthy in a way that puts paid to the idea of free consumer choice, others follow. There\u2019s little point to one manufacturer taking action; consumers will simply switch away from their products. This is why enlightened members of the industry are pushing for a compulsory approach to reducing sugar and fat contents: they want to take action, but need a level playing field.</p> <p>The food industry is notorious for using friendly cartoon characters and online games to market directly at children, pushing them to pressure parents into buying fat- and sugar-laden foods. It is known for misleadingly passing off products, such as breakfast drinks that contain more sugar than a can of cola, as healthy. There are parallels with the 1950s tobacco industry, which offered guarantees its products were safe that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/457180.stm\">companies knew they could not make stand up.</a></p> <p>Except this is even worse \u2013 this time, the target is young children. And food manufacturers are winning; children consume, on average, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/04/children-aged-four-to-10-have-equivalent-of-5500-sugar-cubes-a-year\">three times the maximum recommended amount of sugar.</a> Tooth decay is the most common reason for children aged between five and nine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/13/teeth-problems-children-hospital-decay-extractions\">to be admitted to hospital.</a></p> <p>Obesity may be a national crisis, but it is a crisis we know how to address. The tragedy is that, prior to 2010, the UK was a world leader in nutrition policy. The previous Labour government devolved responsibility to the independent Food Standards Agency, insulating nutrition policy from heavy industry lobbying. The FSA led the way on the reformulation of food products, brokering industry-wide deals to get the industry to reduce salt contents. As a result, Britain was the first country in the world to successfully reduce salt intakes. It is an approach that has been copied around the world; countries such as South Africa, Chile and Argentina have applied it not just to salt, but sugar and fat, with great success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/19/theresa-may-climbdown-obesity-junk-food-industry-public-health\">Theresa May\u2019s climbdown on obesity is her first big mistake | Jackie Ashley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2010, the coalition government rubbished this approach. In response to industry lobbying, nutrition policy was restored to the Department of Health, with disastrous effect. Policy again became vulnerable to the powerful food and drinks lobby that, like the once-mighty tobacco industry formerly did, spends vast sums on influencing ministers and MPs. Companies that make billions from selling unhealthy food argue that if the government increases regulation of the industry, there will be a heavy price to pay in terms of job losses and economic output.</p> <p>These arguments are easily demolished. The global bank Credit Suisse, hardly a bastion of anti-business sentiment, published a report calling for a sugar tax in 2013 and argued that it would have <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/credit-suisse-on-sugar-2013-9?IR=T\">positive impacts on the economy in the long run.</a> The only companies that greater regulation hurts are those that seek to make their money from pushing sugar. But what kind of society puts their economic interests over and above the health of our children?</p> <p>When Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street last month, she pledged to the British public: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\">\u201cWhen we take the big calls, we\u2019ll think not of the powerful, but of you.\u201d</a> Yet her government\u2019s anti-obesity strategy echoes the costly vulnerability of governments around the world to big tobacco lobbying in the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>Damningly, it could not do more to promote the interests of the powerful at the expense of the health of our children. And it bodes terribly for other sectors of the economy in which regulation is needed to ensure decent businesses flourish and the cowboys don\u2019t win out. Just five weeks into May\u2019s premiership, capitalism has never looked less responsible.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners claim millions of shoppers are being led to believe the expensive shoes they buy in high-street stores are made in Germany and Italy \u2013 when many are actually made by workers on poverty wages in eastern European sweatshops.</p> <p>The scandal is exposed in a damning investigation into the European shoe industry, which details illegal wages and shocking working conditions in factories turning out footwear for the UK market.</p> <p>The investigation claims some big brands appear to be using a legal loophole, stamping their products with \u201cMade in Italy\u201d or \u201cMade in Germany\u201d to suggest they are high quality, when they have actually been made by poverty-stricken eastern European workers. The investigation found that footwear workers in Albania were earning as little as 49p an hour including overtime \u2013 which is an illegal rate even in such a poor country.</p> <p>Workers in Macedonia, where the hourly wage was as low as 64p, described being taken to hospital in wheelbarrows after fainting in freezing factories where they had to work with strong chemicals. \u201cIf the employer needs to complete, let\u2019s say, an order of 9,000 pairs of shoes, he will put 90 pairs on the belt and even if you want to die, you have to finish it,\u201d a worker told researchers compiling the report, entitled <a href=\"http://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-labour-on-a-shoe-string/\">Labour on a Shoestring</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/13/lidl-jeans-bangladesh-worker-pay-23p-an-hour\">How can Lidl sell jeans for \u00a35.99?

The legal minimum is \u20ac145 before overtime.</p> <p>Geox shoes are available in the UK through John Lewis and House of Fraser, among other retailers. Geox did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Manufacturers are able to take advantage of an obscure European loophole known as the outward processing trade (OPT) scheme. Under the rules, companies cut parts for the shoes in one country before exporting them to a low-wage economy where they are assembled and sewn. They are then imported back to the original country, duty free. The finished shoes can then be labelled as being made in the original country.</p> <p>The report, compiled by researchers from several European rights groups, is based on interviews with 179 workers in 12 factories. It condemns OPT as \u201ca dead-end scheme for workers, national economies and businesses\u201d and describes it as \u201can economic and social road to ruin\u201d.</p> <p>Researchers found that the factories produced shoes for brands including Zara, Lowa, Deichmann, Ara, Geox, Bata and Leder &amp; Schuh AG and subsidiaries of CCC Shoes &amp; Bags in Poland and Rieker and Gabor in Slovakia.</p> <p>Bata did not address the allegations directly but welcomed the report, which it said had provided \u201cinteresting insights in the generally under-reported working conditions in eastern Europe\u201d. The company said it expected its suppliers to comply with local laws.</p> <p>The report looked at production in six low-wage European countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. One in three of the Albanian workers questioned were paid less than the legal minimum wage of \u00a3121 a month, even with overtime and bonuses. The report indicated that women were generally worse off. Albanian workers reported having to work on up to 60 pairs of shoes a day.</p> <p>Female workers in Romania said their husbands had to find low-paid seasonal work in the west to be able to afford wood to burn for heating during the winter. One man said: \u201cBoth my wife and I work in this factory. We are glad we could find work, but cannot imagine raising children on two factory wages. Our parents and relatives cannot support us, so we depend on this miserable wage. We wanted to move from the village to the city for a better life, but cannot afford to pay city rent from our salaries.\u201d</p> <p>Another worker, Krisztina, said her family had to keep livestock to feed themselves. \u201cWe have a garden and some animals. If I had to buy meat, like chicken breast from the shop, I would not be able to afford it. So, we must also take care of our animals every day because they are some of the only food we can afford.\u201d</p> <p>About 24 billion pairs of shoes are produced worldwide every year, including about 729 million made in Europe. But prices for European shoes are higher: an average Italian pair exports for \u00a339, while an average Chinese pair exports for \u00a33.</p> <p>In a Macedonian factory supplying the Geox, Deichmann and Bata brands, workers said they were expected to use strong chemicals and complained of rheumatism, back pain, allergies and respiratory problems. They said their skin was often exposed to harmful chemicals because wearing gloves meant lower productivity and even lower wages.</p> <p>Deichmann said it was not aware of issues with the factory, but was conducting its own investigation and would take any action necessary.</p> <p>According to the report many workers complained of sweltering conditions in summer and freezing factories in winter. \u201cMy hands are freezing, I\u2019m shivering all over and the door to the hall is open all the time,\u201d one worker said. \u201cIf I get sick at work and if I have a car, somebody will take me to the hospital. But if I don\u2019t have a car, then I will be taken in a wheelbarrow,\u201d said another.</p> <p>\u201cIn the summer, the heat is unbearable so we have had the ambulance here six times this year because co-workers had heat stroke,\u201d said one Slovak worker.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I get sick at work and I don't have a car, somebody will take me to hospital in a wheelbarrow</p> <footer> <cite>East European worker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dorel Mituletum, deputy mayor of Calafat in Romania, was also interviewed for the report and said of the factory workers: \u201cThe poor things drop like flies.\u201d</p> <p>One Romanian worker said that when three women were overcome by the heat at their factory her Italian supervisor joked that \u201che would have to improvise a cemetery in the back yard if the women continued to faint\u201d.</p> <p>Anna McMullen, from <a href=\"http://labourbehindthelabel.org/\">Labour Behind the Label</a>, a UK-based workers\u2019 rights group involved in the report, said consumers needed to be told the truth about where their shoes come from. \u201cThe clever ruse of shipping shoe parts out to low-wage countries to the east of Europe for assembly and glueing, before returning shoes for labelling as \u2018made in Europe\u2019, is duping consumers into thinking their products are made with dignity,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, we now know that workers in Albania and Macedonia are being paid wages so low that they cannot feed their families \u2013 so much so that the gap between the minimum and living wage is greater than in China. These out-sourcing methods used by some brands are turning mass profits on the back of worker poverty.\u201d</p> <p>McMullen said consumers tended to associate sweatshops with Asia, but the reality was that they existed much closer to home. \u201cThe need for fast fashion is bringing shoe production closer to home, and with it comes wage competition with Asia that mirrors, if not tops, the exploitation that we see elsewhere in global supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers are earning less than a quarter of the wage that they need to live with dignity, despite toiling massively long hours to deliver stressful piece-rate targets. \u2018Made in Europe\u2019 no longer means \u2018made with dignity\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The groups behind the report want manufacturers to be more transparent about where they make shoes that are on sale on UK high streets \u2013 and about wages and working conditions.</p> <p>McMullen added: \u201cToday, we are calling out brands that hide exploitation behind labels that con consumers. Brands have a duty to make sure human rights are delivered for people who make their shoes. Being honest about where that is, is one of the first steps.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, one company not named in the report, Adidas, was invited by the researchers to comment on its findings and backed the campaigners\u2019 calls for improved working conditions. \u201cWe do agree \u2026 that working conditions in eastern Europe are generally under-reported and increased worker rights protection is called for. More should be done to improve wages and we know, first-hand, that engagement between local suppliers, unions, governments, and buyers can pay dividends and improve the overall lives of workers,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex, confirmed that it produced a small number of shoes in Romania and Albania. It said it operated a strict code of conduct to comply with the most stringent labour and human rights standards. It added: \u201cIn line with a key recommendation of the report, Inditex is working hard, worldwide, to drive living wages throughout its supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>Lowa stressed that it too set the highest ethical standards. In a statement, it said: \u201cLowa strongly condemns the deplorable conditions shown in these reports. The decision to manufacture 100% \u2018made in Europe\u2019 incorporates our assurance of fair and humane manufacturing conditions. We will be intensifying our oversights in this area in order to be absolutely certain that facilities producing for Lowa abide by such conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The other brands did not respond to the allegations in the report or to the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s request for comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ef358a948d736ba69e306d8bdb6c54454f2066b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef358a948d736ba69e306d8bdb6c54454f2066b/0_125_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some workers said they were expected to make up to 60 pairs of shoes aper day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some workers said they were expected to make up to 60 pairs of shoes aper day</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessia Pierdomenico/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Robert De Niro and his business partners, BD Hotels, are to open a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/robert-de-niro-gets-go-ahead-to-open-london-hotel\" title=\"\">\u201cluxury boutique\u201d </a>hotel in London\u2019s Covent Garden. Currently, the average price for a room in the capital is \u00a3135 and rising because today\u2019s hotel stay, with more than 80% occupancy, is, as the jargon goes, an experiential luxury. \u201cBD\u201d is Richard Born and Ira Drukier, formerly in engineering and medicine; they are now billionaires and the biggest owners of boutique hotels in New York. \u201cThe aesthetic nature of the hotel business has evolved slowly,\u201d Drukier said in an interview last year. \u201cThey have become stylised\u2026 hotels are more than just a bed and water.\u201d And then some. Possibly Drukier was referring to the swimming pool that De Niro \u201chelped to implement\u201d in the BD Greenwich Hotel framed with beams from a centuries-old Japanese farmhouse.</p> <p>One of the many follies of uber-affluence is that people will pay hugely to grope their way around the black-painted lobby of a dimly lit designer hotel, manned by undertaker-suited staff, sphinx-like, snooty and clothed to be indistinguishable from the decor. Inevitably, too, the lavatories are marked by obscure post-modern hieroglyphics and the cost of a glass of water is heading to the hourly rate of the London living wage (\u00a39.40 and in the dreams of many of the abysmally paid hotel staff who carry the cases, clean rooms, stock the bars, cook and work as below-stairs porters.)</p> <p>In the classic 1995 Martin Scorsese film <em>Casino</em>, Robert De Niro plays Sam \u201cAce\u201d Rothstein, a mafia associate, sent in to run a crooked Las Vegas gambling joint. At one point, he says: \u201cThere are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, at the Ludlow in New York, , a non-unionised BD hotel (where De Niro is not involved), the management showed the way it prefers to do it. It allegedly engaged in tactics to persuade its staff not to vote in favour of joining the strong New York union, the Hotel Trades Council (HTC). Hints were made that staff would be sacked if they defied management\u2019s wishes. Nevertheless, the staff voted 97% in favour.</p> <p>In New York, a large number of hotels are unionised. HTC has 32,000 members including those working in other BD hotels. Ludlow staff, pre-HTC, earned around $14 (\u00a311) an hour. In contrast, staff in HTC hotels can earn up to $27 an hour plus free family medical insurance, pensions, proper holiday pay and a guaranteed working week. In London, is that going to be the way? Possibly not. A report published on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hotelworkersunite\" title=\"\">Unethical London, drawn up by the Unite Hotel Workers branch</a>, rightly charges that, in London, global hotel chains harass, block and intimidate to stop collective union action, contrary to global employment agreements. In a predominantly non-unionised climate, tips \u2013 12% to 15% of bills \u2013 are \u201creallocated\u201d and pay is poor.</p> <p>Employees are pressured to work extra time without pay and complaints or any sign of union interest are too often dealt with by a cut in shifts on zero-hours contracts or by awarding the complainer with extra rooms to clean. Staff are, in many cases, disrespected and disregarded; ill, depressed and broke. All of which, the report says,&#xa0;makes, \u201cLondon one of the most unethical tourist destinations in the world\u201d \u2013 a highly profitable one.</p> <p>Hotel and tourism is the fourth largest employer in the country. By 2025, tourism is predicted to be a \u00a3257.4bn industry. It is shameful that collective action and the right to join a trade union are blocked, allowing exploitation and fear to flourish. Over the past several decades, what has happened in hospitality and tourism offers in miniature a picture of general developments in employment. In the 1940s, Conrad Hilton may have had his flaws but it was clear who was accountable. His name was on the business. Now, hedge funds and financiers are the obscure investors and, as the Unite report points out, hotel buildings are sold, brands are franchised and major hotels are atomised with different services outsourced, each new contract driving wages and conditions down further. A process, which, without collective action, kills the spirit of the hardest workers.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of UK hotel employees are immigrants. Post Brexit, if they go, who will replace them? The Unite report makes demands that are modest \u2013 a wage on which you can live; safe, secure work; guaranteed hours every week; training opportunities and a collective voice and union representation. That these rights are still denied demonstrates how successive governments, Labour included, have accepted that, in the words of social historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/selina-todd\" title=\"\">Selina Todd</a>, \u201cprofit making and the people\u2019s welfare [are] ultimately irreconcilable\u201d.</p> <p>In New York, in addition to trade unionism, collectivism has channelled into consumer clout. A kitemark operates so that you know that the hotel you choose has a fair policy on wages and conditions; not too difficult for TripAdvisor et al to add to its criteria? It works for fair trade, so why not for many of the millions labouring in hotel and tourism? Or don\u2019t we care enough?</p> <p>Today, perhaps, we are all travellers, nomads not just geographically but politically, too. In a recent column in the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks\" title=\"\"><em> New York Times</em>, David Brooks</a> suggested that young people, reared on individualism, privacy and the power of the dollar, preferred the community and class solidarity of the Bernie Sanders campaign to the \u201cboomer autonomy\u201d of Hillary Clinton. Brooks quotes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/26/tribe-homecoming-belonging-review-sebastian-junger-joanna-bourke\" title=\"\">Sebastian Junger\u2019s book, <em>Tribe</em></a>, in which he describes how 18th-century colonials, captured by Native Americans, when freed, often chose to return to the materially poorer life for a society of communal living. Junger writes: \u201cThey would have practised extremely close and involved childcare. They would have done almost everything in the company of others.\u201d</p> <p>Money talks, but what also has a powerful eloquence is empathy and the determination to look out for each other. Paradoxically, individual choice can add up to a collective message. And with a kitemark system in operation, this could inform your next choice of hotel.</p>",

The decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-strategy-wasted-opportunity-campaigners\" title=\"\">dismayed many in the public health sector</a>.</p> <p>The watered-down plan, nine months in the making, was seen as a major victory for the fast food and fizzy drinks industries which have lobbied vigorously against measures that would stop them advertising at key times. Originally due to be unveiled by David Cameron, the revised plan under Theresa May\u2019s new government has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/18/former-ministers-attack-massive-damp-squib-childhood-obesity-plan\" title=\"\">savaged by TV chef Jamie Oliver and health bodies</a> for not going nearly far enough.</p> <p>Public Health England had produced a large body of evidence that suggested tackling the way the food and drinks companies target children was vital if the plan was to have an impact. But the government\u2019s decision to ignore the evidence represents a huge missed opportunity, according to Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/supporting-health-across-all-ages/childhood-obesity/the-child-s-obesity-strategy-.html\" title=\"\">Royal Society for Public Health</a> (RSPH), which conducted interviews with children and their parents on what needed to be done.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody was advocating very hard for a ban on advertising junk food before the watershed and for family-based programmes like <em>The X Factor</em>,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a lot of research talking to young people who tell us that this \u2013 the stuff they see online, on bus tickets on posters near their school \u2013 makes an enormous difference. People are worried about the promotions, about the advertising. It\u2019s all about pester power \u2013 75% of parents we spoke to said their kids had seen an ad and they\u2019d give in after half an hour of pestering.\u201d</p> <p>Cramer described the government plan as a good one but with \u201csome big bits missing\u201d. Only if a range of relevant government departments were to commit to preventative measures could the mounting problem of childhood obesity be adequately tackled, she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at teen pregnancies, that was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/england-teenage-pregnancy-strategy-global-blueprint\" title=\"\">committed, longstanding strategy that went on for 10 years</a> and now we\u2019ve got the outcomes that are much better than predicted. If you really mean to do something about childhood obesity you can, but you need to get all these things working at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The failure to constrain the advertising power of the fast food industry would make the job of councils trying to fight obesity all the more difficult, Cramer said. \u201cFor a local authority trying to take action against child obesity it doesn\u2019t make their life easier. Junk food will still be advertised everywhere. It means the fight against childhood obesity will be much harder.\u201d</p> <p>She also echoed concerns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/childhood-obesity-retailers-urge-mandatory-cuts-to-food-sugar-levels\" title=\"\">expressed by some supermarket chains</a> that voluntary plans to reduce sugar amounts in food would fail. \u201cIf you make it mandatory then, in a competitive sense, everyone knows where they stand. If it\u2019s voluntary then the companies who do something will feel, \u2018well the other guys aren\u2019t doing it\u2019. It needs to be a level playing field. We\u2019ve got to do what we did with salt. The evidence is clear: most kids who are overweight or obese get their calories from sugar-sweetened beverages.\u201d</p> <p>Nearly 10% of all four- to five-year-olds and almost 20% of 10- to 11-year-olds are obese ,according to official figures. Obesity-related health issues now cost the NHS almost \u00a35bn a year. The RSPH reports that half of all adults are predicted to be obese by 2050, more than doubling NHS costs to \u00a310bn a year and with wider economic costs to the nation of almost \u00a350bn.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can reduce the number of children who are obese and therefore the number of adults who are obese we will not only be saving lives but saving the NHS money,\u201d Cramer said.</p>",
  "<p>My heart sank earlier this month at the news that Burundi\u2019s government had rejected a decision to deploy a UN police force in an effort to end more than a year of terrible violence since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/burundi-pierre-nkurunziza-police-protest-crack-down\">President Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019</a>s decision to seek a third term in office. </p> <p>More than 500 people have been killed in unrest since April last year and a vast amount of people have fled their homes.

In October 1993, two days after my Tutsi family were murdered by Hutus, I stood in front of a house of Hutus to stop a mob of Tutsis taking revenge. They took no notice, called me a traitor, tied me to a chair, and burnt down the house. As a punishment to me the Tutsis killed 72 people.</p> <p>Yet just two decades later, violence has returned to my homeland. Back then it was an ethnic conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis.

Half of those refugees are female and many experience sexual violence during their flight to safety. Those numbers will undoubtedly increase as the situation deteriorates. And yet, Burundi is one of the world\u2019s forgotten tragedies. It lingers far too low on the agenda of foreign agencies.</p> <p>The inevitable consequence of the worsening situation is that huge numbers of displaced people will seek sanctuary elsewhere. All of us need to look beyond the desperate plight of Syrian refugees and acknowledge other emergencies around the world.</p> <p>Global conflict and persecution are driving mass human displacement to staggering heights. One in 122 humans on the planet is currently displaced. That equals 60 million people \u2013 a population that, if it were a country, would be the 24th largest in the world.</p> <p>The plight of millions \u2013 be they from Syria or Burundi \u2013 is worsening and the need for action has never been so compelling. Yet, the countries most capable of caring for civilians \u2013 the US and the Europeans \u2013 are taking a paltry number. Perceptions of abdication, hand-wringing and half measures are giving the perception that the global community does not have the collective will to act. Scenes of unthinkable horror have, sadly, become the norm.</p> <p>Those countries that can must admit more refugees and provide significant more relief aid to those at risk. At a government level, new legislative frameworks, strategic partnerships between the public and private sectors and integration programmes will all be necessary in any long-term solution.

  "<p>In a few days, one of the world\u2019s largest cruise ships, the Crystal Serenity, will visit the tiny Inuit village of Ulukhaktok in northern Canada. Hundreds of passengers will be ferried to the little community, more than doubling its population of around 400. The Serenity will then raise anchor and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises\" title=\"\">head through the Northwest Passage</a> to visit several more Inuit settlements before sailing to Greenland and finally New York.</p> <p>It will be a massive undertaking, representing an almost tenfold increase in passenger numbers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard\" title=\"\"> taken through the Arctic on a single vessel </a>\u2013 and it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/my-arctic-journey-fragile-ecosystem-northwest-passage\" title=\"\">triggered considerable controversy</a> among Arctic experts. Inuit leaders fear that visits by giant cruise ships could overwhelm fragile communities, while others warn that the Arctic ecosystem, already suffering the effects of global warming, could be seriously damaged.</p> <p>\u201cThis is extinction tourism,\u201d said international law expert Professor Michael Byers, of the University of British Columbia. \u201cMaking this trip has only become possible because carbon emissions have so warmed the atmosphere that Arctic sea ice in summer is disappearing. The terrible irony is that this ship \u2013 which even has a helicopter for sightseeing and a huge staff-to-passenger ratio \u2013 has an enormous carbon footprint that is only going to make things even worse in the Arctic.\u201d</p> <p>The Serenity is by far the biggest cruise vessel to traverse the fabled Northwest Passage, whose exploration has claimed the lives of hundreds of seamen. The ship has a crew of 655 and carries 1,070 passengers, who have paid between \u00a319,000 and \u00a3120,000 for a voyage that Crystal Cruises says will take them on an \u201cintrepid adventure\u201d from Anchorage in Alaska to New York over 32 days.</p> <p>For its part, Crystal insists its clients will have to follow a strict code of conduct during shore visits, while the ship\u2019s air, water and rubbish discharges will be tightly controlled. Only low-sulphur fuel will be burned in the Serenity\u2019s engines, said a spokesman. The Serenity will be accompanied by the UK icebreaker the RSS Ernest Shackleton, he added.</p> <p>However, it is not the voyage that directly poses danger, Byers said. \u201cThis is a well-supported, carefully worked-out trip. I acknowledge that. The trouble is that it is going to open the door to mass tourism in the high Arctic and many other operators \u2013 who could easily turn out to be far less scrupulous or painstaking \u2013 will be eyeing it up for major operations. That could end in disaster. \u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams\">Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This point was backed by Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. \u201cFar too many people will be descending suddenly into these communities and bringing far too much garbage with them,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThese places lack the infrastructure and the training to deal with the incredible numbers of people that will start arriving on these boats.\u201d Apart from Ulukhaktok, the Serenity is also scheduled to visit the Inuit communities of Pond Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Sisimiut.</p> <p>Eegeesiak added that the Inuit were already experiencing problems thanks to global warming. As sea ice disappears, this removes a highway on which locals can ride their snowmobiles and dog sleds to hunt and visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of communities and limits the ability of people to hunt, a problem that is only likely to worsen as the region\u2019s shrinking ice-cap opens it up to mining, oil drilling, tourism and more shipping.</p> <p>In addition, there is the question of food. The Inuit have no farms and rely on what they can catch from the ice and water around them for sustenance. But this food chain is under threat. Algae grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals and finally polar bears. However, if the bottom rung of this food chain disappears because sea ice is melting, then all sorts of unintended consequences could soon be realised, marine biologists have warned. Mass tourism is only going to make this worse, they add.</p> <p>This point was stressed by Eegeesiak. \u201cIt is not just the communities we need to worry about when these great boats arrive but all the wildlife of the region,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Earlier this month Crystal announced that it was already taking bookings for a similar 32-day cruise through the Northwest Passage for 2017. In addition, it revealed it has ordered construction of \u201cthe world\u2019s first purpose-built polar class megayacht, the Crystal Endeavour\u201d. The ship \u2013 which will cruise exclusively in the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 will carry underwater scooters to allow passengers to experience their own subsea exploration and will be fitted with some of the largest bedroom suites ever put in a cruise ship. \u201cThis megayacht will change the game entirely \u2013 the possibilities for expedition travellers will be virtually limitless,\u201d said Crystal president Edie Rodriguez.</p> <p>But such an opening up of the Arctic to tourism dismays Byers. \u201cOne big ship is perhaps manageable but five or six is tempting disaster. Glaciers are crumbling more and more up there and we are getting more and more icebergs in the water.</p> <p>\u201cIf a ship carrying 3,000 passengers hits one of those you could be in real trouble. This is an incredibly remote region. It could take two days to get search-and-rescue helicopters up there. Yet an accident like that is almost inevitable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>No bottle of hair dye could possibly hold as much history as Clairol nice \u2019n easy, No 512, a shade of dark auburn launched in 1975. The extraordinary face on the side of its bottle belonged to Tracey Norman, one of the first African American models to make it big and the second black woman, after Beverly Johnson, to appear on the cover of&#xa0;<em>Vogue</em>.</p> <p>By the time her large eyes and sharp cheekbones became the face of No 512, Norman\u2019s career was booming and her shade became a bestseller soon after its launch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\" title=\"\">Laverne Cox, best known for her role in the TV series <em>Orange is the New Black</em></a>, remembers Norman\u2019s face on that bottle, as do many other millions of American women. As Cox told <em>New York</em> <em>Magazine</em> last year: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many hours I stared at that photo of her on that Clairol bottle and that caption, \u2018Born Beautiful\u2019. Yeah, we are born beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Norman, however, was keeping an extraordinary secret. As a trans woman she was making history, all the while hoping that no one else would ever know. Cox, a trans actor, and every other woman who bought a bottle of No 512, had no idea that the beautiful black woman on the side of the Clairol bottle had begun life as a biological boy. Norman was, in short, the first black transgender model.</p> <p>In recent years, rapid if overdue progress has been made in the realm of trans rights and trans visibility. Now trans models such as Andreja Peji\u0107, Carmen Carrera, Lea T and Hari Nef walk runways and secure campaigns for major fashion labels. Forty years ago, however, the word \u201ctrans\u201d barely existed and prejudice was such that the idea of a trans model being \u201cout\u201d was unthinkable, even horrifying, to a far less enlightened world. As such, Norman would say a prayer before each shoot: \u201cPlease don\u2019t let this be the&#xa0;day.\u201d</p> <p>She \u201cpassed\u201d as a cisgender female for years before that day came around in 1980. Norman was, as she understands it, outed on a shoot and with that, her career was in effect terminated. Now, however, Clairol has welcomed her back into the spotlight and in front of the camera. Last week the brand announced Norman, 63, as the face of its new \u201cColor As Real As You Are\u201d campaign. In the accompanying video, Norman reminds us: \u201cBack in the 70s it was a different world for transgender women \u2026 I had to hide my truth.\u201d The clip ends: \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back and it\u2019s really good to be me.\u201d</p> <p>Clairol\u2019s global associate brand director Heather Carruthers said: \u201cWe\u2019re honoured to bring back Tracey Norman as a woman who no longer has to hide her truth.\u201d</p> <p>In the words of Janet Mock, a transgender advocate and the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285683/\" title=\"\">the bestselling memoir <em>Redefining Realness</em></a>, Norman\u2019s reunion with Clairol is \u201cone of those full-circle narratives of affirmation and acceptance that further chips away at the persistent myth most trans people have done so much work to unlearn: that we are not enough \u2013 not good enough or \u2018real\u2019 enough.\u201d Mock also points out that Norman is not just African American and trans, but a woman in her 60s \u2013 an age, she says, \u201cwhen our society tells women to go away and hide\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdqbYjivr1o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DdqbYjivr1o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Tracey Norman reurns to Clairol</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mock adds: \u201cAs a black trans woman who has to grapple with a culture that tells me I am not beautiful because I am trans and I am not beautiful because I am black, seeing this living legend shine is a beacon of affirmation that, yes, we are beautiful, but more importantly we are whole, deserving and worthy.\u201d</p> <p>For Norman, who knew from a very young age that her body did not match her gender, such affirmation was hard to come by. Born in Newark, New Jersey, she was the first person in her family to graduate from high school. On the same day in 1969 that she received her diploma, she summoned the courage to tell her mother the truth. Her mother, in turn, told her she had always known.</p> <p>Within two years, Norman had begun taking hormones, thanks to a doctor working under the table for the transgender community, and was not just \u201cpassing\u201d as female, but turning heads for her beauty. She became interested, albeit tentatively, in the idea of modelling.</p> <p>One day in 1975 she spotted a group of well-known black models on the street and followed them into the Pierre hotel in New York, assuming they were heading to a fashion show. In fact they were heading to a casting. Norman, who hung back so as to be last in line, found herself facing a panel of three people. She had no idea that they were an <em>Italian Vogu</em>e editor, the fashion designer Luciano Soprani and the photographer Irving Penn. To her astonishment, she received a phone call the next day telling her she was booked for a two-day photoshoot that paid $3,000 \u2013 more money than Norman had seen in her life. By little more than chance and chutzpah, a black girl from New Jersey in 1970s America had just gone from virtually nothing to the pages of <em>Vogue</em>. Only Norman knew that the whole truth was even more extraordinary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\">Laverne Cox: 'Now I have the money to feminise my face I don\u2019t want to.

All was going well until a hair assistant, a man who had always asked Norman probing questions about her past, entered the shoot and spoke to the magazine\u2019s editor, Susan Taylor. Norman recalled that, soon after, the shoot was shut down and, with it, her career. She believes the hair assistant had discovered her secret. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/12/tracey-africa-transgender-model-c-v-r.html\" title=\"\">Taylor has since told <em>New York Magazine</em></a> that she has no recollection of this: \u201cNo one could have outed her to me. I always suspected she was genetically male. I accepted her as she presented herself, as an exquisitely beautiful black&#xa0;woman.\u201d</p> <p>None the less, Norman maintains this is the day her career ended. As she told <em>New York Magazine</em>: \u201cBeauty and fashion is all about illusion. So when the doors were opened for me, I walked right through. And then the doors slammed \u2026 Once the doors closed, I was no longer a woman and I no longer got the respect of a woman.\u201d</p> <p>About 18 months after that shoot, Norman bought a ticket to Paris where she got by for two years working in mostly low-profile jobs. Then, she returned to New York and signed with a small agency. When she was hired for an Ultra Sheen cosmetics ad, her third beauty contract, it seemed like a comeback. And yet word had spread so fast in New York that when the ad ran, everyone knew her foremost as \u201cthe girl who\u2019d been a&#xa0;boy\u201d.</p> <p>After that she was unable to get work and she gave up her apartment and moved back in with her mother. In the intervening years, Norman has earned a living at Show Center, a burlesque peep show featuring trans women in Times Square. She has also become an \u201cicon\u201d and \u201clegend\u201d (these terms have specific status) in the ballroom community, in which different houses, which operate like surrogate families for LGBTQ youth of colour, compete against each other in drag balls. She rose to the rank of \u201cmother\u201d in the House of Africa, hence her full name, Tracey Africa Norman, and in 2001, she was inducted into the ballroom house of fame.</p> <p>The success of her <em>Vogue</em> days, however, seemed distant and irretrievable. Then, last December, <em>New York Magazine</em> ran a cover story and, once again, her life changed. Norman, who has spent decades training herself in invisibility as a mode of survival, needed convincing to agree to such high-profile press. Yet, \u201cI was reminded,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I made history and I deserve to have it&#xa0;printed.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the profile, Norman\u2019s career has been reborn. That is most evident in the Clairol contract \u2013 a personal triumph and homecoming for a woman shunned by her profession for decades. More important, though, it is a triumph for trans visibility.</p> <p>As she told the Huffington Post: \u201cI\u2019m hoping people will take away from this that I am human and I was presented with this great opportunity to better my life. Unfortunately, because of people\u2019s prejudices I was not able to do it.\u201d Unlike so many, however, she was afforded a second chance.</p>",
  "<p>Nursing glasses of champagne and grazing on canap\u00e9s, around 1,000 guests gathered one evening last month at London\u2019s Science Museum for a lavish reception costing \u00a3105 a head.</p> <p>As they swapped business cards and exchanged small talk, the multicultural crowd was oblivious to the small group of protesters chanting and waving placards outside. Instead they were intent on laying the groundwork for their industry\u2019s premier international trade fair, which was starting the next day.</p> <p>The Farnborough International Airshow is a hugely popular event with the public. Featuring drones, celebrity guests, simulators and flypasts, it is considered a great day out for families. But behind the scenes Farnborough doubles as a giant trade show for the world\u2019s arms manufacturers.</p> <p>About 100,000 people working in the defence sector attend the event which is run by UKTI DSO, the government\u2019s arms exports promotional division, and which this year attracted 80 military delegations and was formally opened by David Cameron, then still prime minister.</p> <p>Among those sponsoring the fair was the US defence contractor Raytheon, which claims to be \u201cthe world\u2019s premier missile maker\u201d.</p> <p>Raytheon\u2019s factories in Essex and Scotland produce the Paveway IV guided bomb which, according to its manufacturer, has been \u201cput to the test in every major conflict\u201d and proved itself \u201ctime and again, as the weapon of choice by the end users\u201d.</p> <p>One enthusiastic end user is Saudi Arabia, now the UK defence sector\u2019s biggest customer, having agreed orders for \u00a33.5bn of military hardware since the start of 2015. Saudi Arabia\u2019s buying spree has been prompted, at least partially, by its intervention in neighbouring Yemen, where a coalition led by Riyadh is battling Houthi Shia rebels, backed by Iran, who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/21/yemens-western-backed-president-flees-house-arrest-in-sanaa\">forced the country\u2019s president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee</a>. For months, evidence has been emerging from the rubble of Yemen that UK-manufactured weapons \u2013 including Paveway bombs \u2013 have been used in the campaign.</p> <p>At the start of this year investigators from<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/10/bombing-businesses/saudi-coalition-airstrikes-yemens-civilian-economic-structures\"> Human Rights Watch attended the sites of two bombing targets</a> and found evidence that UK-manufactured weaponry \u2013 in one case a bomb, in the other a laser guidance kit \u2013 had been deployed. The nature of the targets \u2013 a chamber of commerce and a warehouse \u2013 appear to corroborate claims that the Saudis are targeting civilian infrastructure, a breach of international human rights law.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Saudis have used these weapons in Yemen: Human Rights Watch has determined that they have been used unlawfully and that the weapons used in the strikes were UK-produced,\u201d said Kristine Beckerle of Human Rights Watch. The organisation has become so frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge how UK weapons are being deployed in Yemen that it is releasing a video highlighting the impact they are having on a conflict in which at least 6,000 people have died.</p> <p>However, in statements to parliament the Foreign Office has insisted that \u201cthe MOD assessment is that the Saudi-led coalition is not targeting civilians\u201d, and that \u201cthere has not been a breach of IHL [international humanitarian law] by the coalition\u201d. Saudi Arabia, too, denies claims that its military coalition is targeting civilian sites. But the denials from both camps are unravelling.</p> <p>On the final day of the last parliamentary session, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Lords/2016-07-21/HLWS120/\">Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood was forced to issue no fewer than six corrections to statements and answers given about the conflict.</a> The Foreign Office, Ellwood conceded, had been \u201cunable to assess that there has been breach of IHL by the Saudi-led coalition\u201d.</p> <p>Having corrected its statements to parliament, the government is now under pressure to acknowledge that it has also misled the high court in relation to a case being brought against it by the pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade, which accuses it of failing to ensure that arms exports to Saudi Arabia are not in breach of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>\u201cThe corrections are staggering,\u201d said Andrew Smith of the campaign. \u201cAt best the government has been extremely negligent and careless, and at worst it has acted to mislead parliament and the court. Either way it has serious questions to answer and must make clear what it will do to ensure this never happens again. The stakes could not be higher: UK fighter jets are flying over Yemen and people are dying from UK bombs.\u201d</p> <p>The Saudis, too, now admit mistakes. A commission set up by the kingdom has concluded that the coalition was guilty of \u201cmistakenly\u201d hitting a residential compound in the Red Sea port city of Mokha \u2013 an incident in which at least 65 civilians died. It also acknowledged that the coalition was responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/saudi-led-air-strike-yemen-hospital-kills-at-least-seven\">airstrikes on a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders</a>, which it claims was being used as a rebel hideout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9358fd01b07cd65f284fa712c495b80e192f6f50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9358fd01b07cd65f284fa712c495b80e192f6f50/0_223_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smoke rises from a food factory in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke rises from a food factory in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, reportedly targeted by jets from Saudi-led coalition forces earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, said the UK needed to rethink its policy on Saudi arms exports. \u201cThere is such an overwhelming body of evidence that the Saudis have committed breaches of international humanitarian law in Yemen that the UK government can no longer rely on their rather weak reassurances, and should instead initiate their own review to confirm, in my view, that there have been breaches which would require them to stop arms sales to Saudi.\u201d</p> <p>But this would be a disaster for the British defence sector, where business is booming. Newly published official figures reveal that the UK won defence orders worth \u00a37.7bn last year. It now has about 12% of the global defence export market and, over the last decade, has shored up its position as the second largest arms exporter in the world.</p> <p>There is still much to play for. The government\u2019s own figures suggest that the global defence export market in 2015 was worth a fraction under $100bn, a 17% increase on 2014.</p> <p>As the market has expanded, successive governments have gone to extraordinary lengths to promote the sector. Tony Blair intervened to prevent an investigation into arms exports to Riyadh; Cameron assiduously courted Saudi royalty; earlier this year the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, led a UK delegation to Qatar to promote sales of the Eurofighter jet.</p> <p>The Middle East is considered by the government to be a priority market. Two-thirds of all arms exports go to the region. In the last two years the UK has agreed arms deals worth \u00a3388m with the United Arab Emirates, \u00a3170m with Qatar, \u00a3120m with Oman and \u00a324m with Bahrain.</p> <p>Other countries with questionable human rights records have also become major customers. In the last three years the UK has sold \u00a3450m of arms to Turkey, despite its increasing authoritarianism and political instability, and \u00a3116m of weaponry to Egypt, despite its recent coup and worsening human rights situation. It has also signed major contracts to supply missiles to Malaysia and Thailand.</p> <p>Brake suggested that the government\u2019s failure to monitor the impact UK weapons were having in Yemen undermined any assurances it could give that they were not being used elsewhere in breach of international human rights laws. \u201cIf similar breaches of IHL involving the use of UK arms in another theatre of conflict occurred, there is no reason to believe that the UK government would adopt a more proactive stance in relation to those breaches.\u201d</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman defended Britain\u2019s position. She said the UK had \u201cone of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world\u201d and could revoke licences quickly if circumstances changed, as had happened in the cases of Libya and Yemen.</p> <p>\u201cThe key test for our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia in relation to international humanitarian law is whether there is a clear risk that those weapons might be used in a serious violation of IHL,\u201d she said. \u201cThe situation is kept under careful and continual review.\u201d</p> <p>But Smith questioned the government\u2019s assurances. \u201cThe arms trade could not function without the active support and participation of the UK government,\u201d he said. \u201cTime and again it has shown that it will stretch to any length, and sink to any low, in order to promote arms sales to some of the most repressive regimes in the world.\u201d</p> <h2>KEY CLIENTS FOR UK ARMS</h2> <p><strong>Israel</strong><br>The UK licensed \u00a382m of arms to Israel while David Cameron was in office. The government acknowledged UK arms had \u201calmost certainly\u201d been used in bombarding Gaza in 2009, in a conflict that saw both sides accused of war crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1a9ae1f84641b57f8e22a8279646f03e51db60d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1a9ae1f84641b57f8e22a8279646f03e51db60d/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron presided over \u00a382m of arms sales to Israel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Turkey</strong><br>In the last three years the UK has licensed to Ankara almost \u00a3450m of arms, including components for military aircraft, helicopters and targeting equipment. In the past year the Turkish military has been engaged in a ferocious conflict with the country\u2019s Kurdish minority.</p> <p><strong>Egypt</strong><br>Since the military coup in July 2013, the UK has licensed more than \u00a3115m of arms, including machine guns and assault rifles, as well as a \u00a340m licence for combat vehicles. In 2011, Cairo used UK-provided teargas against protesters.</p> <p><strong>Bahrain</strong><br>Since the Arab spring, the UK has licensed \u00a350m of arms, including hundreds of machine guns and thousands of assault rifles. Last February, Bahraini security forces were accused of quashing pro-democracy demonstrations using teargas and water cannon.</p> <p><em>Source: CAAT</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2016 to change a reference to Tel Aviv to a reference to Israel.<br></em></p>",

  "<p>It captured the hearts of the French some time ago, but now English sparkling wine is preparing for its next major breakthrough \u2013 America.</p> <p>This week the first full container of English wine will be shipped to the US \u2013 5,000 bottles from four different producers, including some of the best-known names in English wine.</p> <p>The wines, from Digby Fine English, Hush Heath Estate, Bolney Wine Estate and Camel Valley, are produced in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and Cornwall. All are award-winning sparkling wines made in the traditional method, and are destined for nine states including New York, Pennsylvania, Montana and Massachusetts, as well as the capital, Washington DC.</p> <p>For the past five years English wine has been on an unstoppable upward curve. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/13/how-to-create-a-perfect-vineyard\" title=\"\">Investment in equipment and expertise</a>, together with a gradual increase in global temperatures, means Britain\u2019s sparkling wines \u2013 90% of which are made with chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, the three grapes used to make champagne \u2013 rival the world\u2019s best fizz.</p> <p>Such is the suitability of the chalky soils of southern England that two champagne houses, Taittinger and Vranken-Pommery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/champagne-taittinger-to-produce-english-sparkling-wine-in-kent\" title=\"\">have invested millions in setting up operations here</a>. One owner of a major vineyard said he had turned down an offer from another champagne house of \u201cmore than \u20ac6m\u201d for his business. America has been slower to catch on, but word is spreading beyond New York, where any sommelier who reckons to have their finger on the pulse will know about English wine. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a novelty. It\u2019s now known there are great sparkling wines coming out of England,\u201d said Liz Willette of New York importer Grand Cru Selections. In Washington DC another importer, Siema, is busily taking orders for cases of Ridgeview, one of the best-known English wines. \u201cInterest is overwhelming,\u201d said the company\u2019s Andrew Stover.</p> <p>The latest batch of exporters are concentrating on the smartest retailers and restaurants. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge deal for us. This is a world-class product and it deserves its place on all the great wine lists,\u201d said Trevor Clough, head blender at Digby Fine English. Digby\u2019s 2010 Vintage Reserve Brut sells for \u00a339.99 in Selfridges and Harvey Nichols and will cost around $75 in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not expensive,\u201d said Clough.</p> <p>\u201cThis wine stands up to any competition thrown at it. Our wines are as good as champagnes costing twice as much. American connoisseurs understand that.\u201d The British Bottle Company, which is making the shipment, has navigated the near-impenetrable regulations of the US market to get the bottles shipped out. In March the government announced its pledge to achieve a tenfold increase in English wine exports by 2020. \u201cThe US is a clear priority market for exports and this deal is a significant milestone,\u201d said Julia Trustram Eve of English Wine Producers, the marketing arm of the UK wine industry.</p>",

After a combination of ropey shot selection and dire running got them in a tangle at 15 for three, Ben Duckett, in cahoots with his skipper Alex Wakely, dug them out of a deep hole with a brilliant stand of 123. After a flurry of late wickets, the bowlers - helped by some brilliantly catching - did magnificently to defend 161. <br></p> <p>Duckett, though, swiped and swatted his way to a class of his own. Many of his boundaries - some fortuitous, some just from brazen skill - came through fine leg, with an assortment of paddles and ramps, while he also cover drove and switch hit with disdain as he skipped his way to 84 off 47. He was particularly brutal on Samit Patel, who was thumped for 33 off 14 balls, but eventually Duckett was bowled try to sweep Jake Ball. Wackily nudged and nurdled his way to the final over, as wickets fell around him. <br></p> <p>When defending a low total, a wicket in each of the first three overs help; Michael Lumb miscued to third man, Alex Hales was bowled through the gate and Dan Christian was cramped on the pull, and Northants were flying. Riki Wessels and Samit started a rebuild, before Andre Russell briefly went nuts, maiming three magnificent sixes to cow.<br></p> <p>One swipe too many, though, saw Russell caught by a running, diving Rob Keogh on the midwicket fence, and Notts required a miracle from their lower order, especially when Samit drilled the ball straight back to Steven Crook. Chris Read briefly gave Notts hope, but picked out long-on and that, as they say, was that. <br></p> <p>This was Northants\u2019 first ever win over Notts in 2010, and their third final in four years.

  "<p>Ten days ago my phone pinged. It was my plastic surgeon colleague from M1 Hospital in Aleppo asking my advice about a patient with a deep defect in his pelvis. He told me that around 20 patients were being admitted following a suspected chemical weapon attack with chlorine. His emergency department was full. He had not enough masks or oxygen cylinders available to treat the majority. He was not able to ventilate any of the seriously ill patients because of lack of equipment. Two patients subsequently died from the chlorine, which turned into hydrochloric acid and dissolved their lungs. He was devastated.</p> <p>We continued the dialogue the following day when he told me that, from 8 o\u2019clock in the morning until midnight, there was a constant barrage of bombs dropped by the Russian and Syrian air forces and there was a constant flood of dead and dying patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f035d5c2976ce37bf41f89caeeb45a567bdf7c86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f035d5c2976ce37bf41f89caeeb45a567bdf7c86/1223_181_611_764/400.jpg\" alt=\"British surgeon David Nott, who has worked in Aleppo since 2013.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cEach day would be a mass casualty event,\u201d says British surgeon David Nott, who has worked in Aleppo since 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MSF/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A week later another colleague from M10 hospital rang me and told me he had treated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/shocked-by-the-image-of-the-syrian-boy-in-the-rubble-heres-how-to-help\">Omran, the young boy whose picture had gone viral</a> on social media. To be honest, I had not seen the picture. He simply wanted to tell me that the boy had survived and he had treated his deep scalp wound and he was going to be discharged home.</p> <p>I asked him whether he wanted to go on television and contacted the BBC and Channel 4. He was willing to do this but not to show his face, as he would surely have been targeted by the regime. To see him talking on my television brought a lump to my throat. He is the kindest and nicest human being I\u2019ve ever worked with. He has been there from the start of the war and his only words on the television were: \u201cPlease help us.\u201d</p> <p>I know exactly where he was and really wished I could be there with him. He has not done anything wrong: he is only there to help people, as are all my other colleagues and friends who are working round the clock. They are all exhausted and stressed. They will not leave because they have so much work to do.</p> <p>The picture of this little boy must be a turning point in this war. It must not be looked at and forgotten within 24 hours. I have pictures on my phone and in my computer of all the cases that I dealt with when I was in Aleppo. These images are far worse than the image of Omran. They are of dead and dying children. I have given lectures showing these pictures and have had people in the audience crying. Why has the world become heartless?</p> <p>When President Obama talked about crossing the red line after 400 children were killed by chemical weapons outside Damascus in 2013, he was awaiting the outcome of a vote on action in the British parliament. In the end it was close, with 285-272 voting against military action against the Syrian regime. If the west had shown strong leadership, I have no doubt that the Syrian military hierarchy would have collapsed. George Osborne said prophetically: \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t become a moment when we turn our back on all the world\u2019s problems.\u201d It\u2019s not often that a politician gets it right, but he did then.</p> <p>I packed my gas mask and spent six weeks in Aleppo just after that statement in 2013. Aleppo was a very moderate city. The rebel side was controlled by the Free Syrian Army. It was promised help by the west and was expecting humanitarian aid and equipment to overthrow the Assad regime. Most of my time was spent teaching the surgeons how to perform very difficult trauma surgery following gunshot wounds and fragmentation wounds from Syrian jet airstrikes. On average we would treat about 12 to 14 gunshot wounds a day, and we had excellent backup support on the intensive care unit from intensive physicians in Washington manning the ventilators by Skype.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/refugees-greek-camps-targeted-mafia-gangs\">Refugees in Greek camps targeted by mafia gangs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was protected by the Aleppo city medical council, who looked after me like a parent looks after a child. I was the only westerner in Aleppo then, as Isis had control of the north and made it very difficult to cross checkpoints. There were no reporters in Aleppo, so I came home and talked of the horrors I had seen as snipers from the Syrian regime played games with women and children\u2019s lives.</p> <p>When I returned to Aleppo in September 2014, Syrian jets were still flying low level around the city shooting at anybody using rockets, but worse were the Syrian helicopters dropping barrel bombs containing around 500kg of TNT indiscriminately on densely populated areas. Ambulances would bring in hordes of patients and each day would be a mass casualty event.</p> <p>All people living in non-regime areas were classified as terrorists. I, as a humanitarian just going to operate and save lives, would have also been looked on as a terrorist and would have been jailed and tortured and most likely killed \u2013 as was Abbas Khan, my British orthopaedic colleague who volunteered in the same hospital as I did. October 2014 was a particularly awful period, not just for the residents of Aleppo but also for the western hostages, including journalists and humanitarians, who were facing being beheaded by Isis.</p> <p>At the time I was probably about 30 miles away from where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Henning\">Alan Henning</a>, who was delivering an ambulance to Aleppo, had the most terrible fate inflicted on him. It was just too dangerous for journalists to go in, and thus the horror was kept off the world\u2019s radar. This allowed the Syrian regime to perpetuate the worst atrocities unhindered.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/russia-launches-first-airstrikes-against-targets-in-syria-says-us\">The intervention by Russia in September 2015</a> was made at the request of a beleaguered Assad regime. Assad\u2019s forces have been falling apart ever since the conflict began and havehad to be propped up by militias from Iran and Hezbollah. It suited Russia to be involved. By standing up to the west he has become a global player and is challenging the monopoly of the influence in the Middle East which had been held by the US for decades.</p> <p>The Syrian and Russian regimes did not appreciate the effect it would have on galvanising the opposition fighters. This has led to a significant increase in heavy Russian and Syrian airstrikes. This is always cyclical; the more the opposition gains, the heavier the response, and this is what we are seeing now. The picture of Omran epitomises the horror that can be broadcast on our television screens. It is significantly better than many of the pictures of children coming out from Aleppo but should still shame world leaders. Hopefully this will galvanise the west to finally stop sitting back and being passive observers. This war is different because it is our war. The refugees that have poured into Europe are there because we have not done anything to stop the suffering. If we wait for another five years, there will be one million people killed and 20 million refugees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/20/turkey-announces-more-active-role-in-syria-conflict\">Turkey announces more active role in Syria conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sticking point is whether Assad stays or goes.

Ali is the reality: that no story in Syria has a happy ending.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing frustration in rebel-held Aleppo that grief at the plight of Omran has not been accompanied by rage at those who dropped the bomb.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/20/paramedic-who-saved-boy-in-aleppo-speaks-up-for-airstrikes-victims-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5vtyq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2670920\"            data-video-name=\"Paramedic who saved boy in Aleppo speaks up for airstrikes victims - video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57b87622e4b047b85f601fc5\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/20/160820SyriaParamedic2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/20/160820SyriaParamedic2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/20/160820SyriaParamedic2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/aug/20/paramedic-who-saved-boy-in-aleppo-speaks-up-for-airstrikes-victims-video\">Paramedic who saved boy in Aleppo speaks up for airstrikes victims</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The image brought renewed global focus to the suffering of civilians in the eastern part of Syria\u2019s largest city, living under near-siege conditions and a constant bombardment of barrel bombs dropped from government aircraft and more targeted Russian airstrikes.</p> <p>But those who live every day with the fear that their homes will be the next target, that their children will be the next ones carried into an ambulance, say tears are not enough, and the world must push harder to end the war.</p> <p>\u201cAll Syrians, and me, thank the world for their feelings of sorrow, but why don\u2019t you help us to find peace?\u201d said Aisha, a mother of two who fled the city after barrel bombings intensified but who still lives in the countryside near Aleppo. \u201cThe cause of this is Bashar al-Assad.\u201d</p> <p>They want an end to an aerial bombing campaign that has taken a disproportionate toll on civilians and point out that only one party to the conflict has aircraft. The rebels launch rockets into government-held areas, but their reach is far more limited than aircraft.</p> <p>Russian and Syrian air force planes have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/russian-airstrikes-in-syria-killed-2000-civilians-in-six-months\">track record of hitting civilian targets,</a> from schools to hospitals and markets, although both governments deny running a campaign of terror. Syrians have long been frustrated that western horror at atrocities by Isis has diverted attention from a far higher, but less publicised, civilian death toll at the hands of government forces and their allies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d88771b43607d3372769ae759e953a141ecae76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d88771b43607d3372769ae759e953a141ecae76/0_0_1476_1094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omran Daqneesh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omran Daqneesh sits in the back of an ambulance following the airstrike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Civilian casualties from Russian bombings have overtaken civilian deaths at the hands of Isis for the first time, the activist group, the <a href=\"http://sn4hr.org/blog/2016/08/18/25798/\">Syrian Network for Human Rights, said</a> last week.</p> <p>By ignoring the political and military context of Omran\u2019s plight, they are cheapening his suffering and that of all the people who have chosen to stay on in opposition-held areas of Aleppo, or have not had an opportunity to leave.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want the world to know we are dying as civilians here, that is not enough. We want the world to know who is killing us, who is targeting us,\u201d said an English-language professor at the university, whose six-month-old daughter was born in one of the city\u2019s few remaining hospitals. \u201cIf people in Britain and United States know that Russia and Assad are doing this, they will help us, they will do something with their government to help us. But if they don\u2019t know, what kind of help can we get?\u201d</p> <p>There was anger about a video that went viral of CNN anchor Kate Bolduan struggling to hold back tears as she presented a segment on Omran, because she said it was not clear who had bombed his family\u2019s apartment. \u201cTheir home is inside Aleppo, Syria. It was hit by a bomb, an airstrike. Who\u2019s behind it, we do not know,\u201d she said. That emotion was hailed by viewers outside Syria as an understandable human response to terrible tragedy.</p> <p>For some closer to the violence, crying at Omran\u2019s injuries without naming those responsible seemed more of a betrayal than a tribute. \u201cWhile tears were pouring down her face, she talked about the child and his lost family, without mentioning who was behind it,\u201d wrote one angry Facebook commentator, Abu Khled, frustrated that the coverage focused more on those bombed than the bombers.</p> <p>\u201cCNN is trying to deceive [viewers],\u201d said Mohammad, a teacher in Aleppo who was trying to organise exams this month as the bombing continued. \u201cWe are all going to die if Assad remains president of Syria.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Niall McGinn and Miles Storey scored <strong>Aberdeen\u2019s</strong> first league goals of the season as Derek McInnes\u2019s men overcame <strong>Partick Thistle</strong> 2-1 at Pittodrie.</p> <p>McGinn powered a 25-yard free-kick high into the net to open the scoring before a Liam Lindsay defensive mistake allowed Storey to double the lead. Sean Welsh was sent off for the Jags, for whom Chris Erskine netted a late consolation with a stunning strike.</p> <p>After the match, the Aberdeen manager, McInnes, emphasised the positives of a solid display. \u201cI thought we were very good, with some moments of quality play, and we were the better team. The last 10 minutes were a wee reminder there is work still to be done, but I would like to concentrate on the first 80 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Don Cowie, the <strong>Hearts</strong> captain, inspired his side to their first league victory of the season after scoring twice and setting up two more goals in a 5-1 demolition of&#xa0;<strong>Inverness</strong>.</p> <p>The former Caley midfielder scored either side of a Conor Sammon header before Sam Nicholson\u2019s two well-executed late goals, the first of which was set up with a cute back-heel by new signing Bjorn Johnsen on his debut.</p> <p>Caley got on the scoresheet three minutes from time through Ross Draper, despite Callum Paterson\u2019s best efforts to keep the ball from going in the net. Cowie, the man of the match, left the pitch to a rapturous round of applause from the home fans when he was replaced by Robbie Muirhead. It was a return to winning ways for Robbie Neilson\u2019s side against a Caley team that are still searching for their first point of the campaign.</p> <p>Liam Boyce\u2019s double set <strong>Ross County</strong> on course to a deserved 2-0 victory against <strong>Kilmarnock</strong> in a disjointed game at the Global Energy Stadium.</p> <p>County broke the deadlock in the 29th minute, when Boyce scored after he had played Michael Gardyne into space inside the area and his cut-back fell kindly for the Irishman, who converted his shot into the net from eight yards out.</p> <p>The home side controlled the tempo of the match and they deservedly doubled their advantage in the 74th minute when substitute Alex Schalk ran on to a through ball from Woods and his cross was pushed into the net at the second attempt by Boyce.</p> <p>In the Championship, two first\u2011half goals from Jason Cummings earned <strong>Hibs</strong> a 2-0 win at <strong>St Mirren</strong>. The 21-year-old converted a David Gray assist to break the deadlock and then Cummings pounced to take advantage of miscommunication in the Buddies defence to finish from a tight angle.</p> <p>The league leaders, <strong>Raith Rovers</strong>, beat <strong>Dunfermline</strong> 2-0 in their derby to retain&#xa0;top position in the division, ahead of Hibs.</p>",

  "<p>Should Theresa May take the axe to the troubled Hinkley Point nuclear project, it will propel wind and solar power further into the limelight. And for renewable technologies to become really effective, Britain and the rest of the world need breakthroughs in electricity storage to allow intermittent power to be on tap 24/7, on a large scale and for the right price.</p> <p>Cheap, light and long-life batteries are the holy grail, and achieving this requires the expertise of people like <a href=\"http://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/cpg27\" title=\"\">Cambridge professor Clare Grey</a>. The award winning Royal Society fellow is working on the basic science behind lithium-air batteries, which can store five times the energy in the same space as the current rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are widely used today.</p> <p>She is also focusing on sodium-ion and <a href=\"http://energystorage.org/energy-storage/technologies/redox-flow-batteries\" title=\"\">redox flow batteries</a>; the latter store power in a liquid form, contained in vats or tanks that in theory can easily be scaled up to power-grid sizes.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been an amazing transformation in this field. There is an explosion of interest and I am extremely lucky to have decided early on to concentrate on this area,\u201d she says, although she is keen to play down the idea that a eureka moment is just around the corner.</p> <p>She is also thankful for Hinkley \u2013 if only because of the government\u2019s long-term funding deal with EDF Energy that it gave rise to. \u201cIt has put a price on [future] electricity in the market which is high, and this has potentially opened up further commercial space for new technologies such as batteries.

If we accelerate renewables in the UK, we can get to 100% renewable power well before 2050,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe message is getting through on the feasibility of this too. One thousand cities around the world are committed to 100% renewable supply, some as soon as 2030.

In fact, due to inevitable delays and cost overruns, Hinkley will block scarce resources going to necessary UK renewables, grid upgrades, and energy efficiency. Don\u2019t believe the hype: it\u2019s not \u2018nuclear and renewables\u2019 \u2013 because of the sheer cost of nuclear, it\u2019s \u2018nuclear <em>or</em> renewables\u2019,\u201d he argues.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cornwallenergy.com\" title=\"\">Cornwall Energy</a>, an energy industry consultancy, recently released a chart showing increasing numbers of periods when there are negative wholesale prices for power, which effectively means electricity on the UK grid is free. Tom Edwards, a consultant at Cornwall, says: \u201cAs the UK adds more low-marginal-cost generators to the network, especially wind and solar, we would expect to see more and longer-duration negative pricing events.\u201d</p> <p>The <em>Economist,</em> traditionally a cheerleader for low-cost market solutions to everything, including energy, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21703367-britain-should-cancel-its-nuclear-white-elephant-and-spend-billions-making-renewables\" title=\"\">has also lost faith in Hinkley, which it describes as a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cTo keep the lights on in the short run it would make more sense to use gas-powered plants. These can be built quickly, run cheaply and turned on or off as required. Meanwhile, the sums earmarked for Hinkley could be put to use in better ways,\u201d it said in an editorial headlined \u201cHinkley Pointless\u201d.</p> <p>The <em>Economist </em>believes improved electricity storage is a key answer to the frequently repeated criticism of wind and solar that it is intermittent, and points out that battery technology is fast improving.</p> <p>The magazine also champions interconnectors, which can link energy-hungry Britain with northern Europe, where there is a wind-energy surplus, or with a country such as Iceland \u2013 a centre of geothermal power due to its volcanoes.</p> <p>The <em>Economist </em>concludes: \u201cAll of these options would be cheaper than Hinkley, which would take 10 years to get going and represent a huge, continuing cost to bill payers, if it ever worked at all. Such a strategy would also buy time to see what new technologies emerge.\u201d</p> <p>The atomic lobby is desperate to see Hinkley go ahead as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not be pitting technologies against each other. The scale and scope of the challenge means we need all technologies available to meet our energy needs, as 65% of capacity will close between 2010 and 2030,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.niauk.org/\" title=\"\">Tom Greatrex</a>, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association and a former Labour MP. \u201cThis needs to be replaced with low-carbon generation, including both nuclear and renewables. Hinkley Point C will provide 3.2GW of power \u2013 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs \u2013 with further nuclear projects taking this to 16GW by the mid-2020s.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.gre.ac.uk/business/study/ibe/staff/steve-thomas\" title=\"\">Steve Thomas</a>, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, says the UK should bide its time and not be panicked into making ill-considered decisions such as giving the green light to Hinkley.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to do anything in double-quick time. The coal plant does not need to close before 2025. As long as its utilisation is low, it won\u2019t cause large emissions.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of our eight nuclear plants will probably close in 2023, the rest will go on till 2028 and beyond. If no more delays happen, Hinkley will be online in 2026; the other nukes are a few years behind, whatever the developers say. So nuclear is the slowest, riskiest possible way to meet any gap.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Cancelling the planned new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point will be a huge victory for the offshore wind industry. The word from inside No 10 is not clear yet, but there are so many Tories, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\" title=\"\">including the prime minister</a>, unsettled by the prospect of the Chinese building a plant in Britain to an untested French design that the prospects of it going ahead appear slim.</p> <p>As if to emphasise the continuing success of Britain\u2019s elegant turbines in the sea, the government cleared the way for a new array off the Yorkshire coast earlier this week.</p> <p>The multibillion-pound<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/hornsea-project-two-windfarm-second-phase-grimsby\" title=\"\"> Hornsea Project Two</a> would see 300 turbines \u2013 each taller than the Gherkin \u2013 span more than 480 sq km of the North Sea.</p> <p>This comes after Dong Energy, the biggest operator of offshore windfarms in Britain, said it was planning to spend a further \u00a36bn in the UK by 2020, convinced that the government is serious about supporting wind power.</p> <p>Offshore wind has proved expensive, but is working hard to get its price per megawatt hour below Hinkley\u2019s \u00a392.50. Some schemes claim to generate electricity at \u00a385.</p> <p>The question now, Hinkley or no Hinkley, must be whether May can overcome the neoliberal free-market tendencies of some cabinet colleagues and push through an industrial strategy worth the name \u2013 one that embraces renewable energy and extracts business and employment for the UK from the dominant overseas firms that currently make the majority of the renewables kit.</p> <p>It is not so long ago that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/02/uk-windfarm-little-british-involvement\" title=\"\">the <em>Guardian</em> revealed the scandalous lack of UK involvement</a> in the London Array wind farm off the north Kent coast. Norwegian, German and Gulf companies dominated.</p> <p>Some will say it\u2019s too late to challenge the big players like Denmark\u2019s Dong or Siemens, which has brought at least some manufacturing to the UK with a \u00a3310m <a href=\"http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1435902/analysis-siemens-and-davey-fear-brexit-fall-out-for-uk-offshore-wind\" title=\"\">hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people</a>.</p> <p>But that misses the point. There are plenty of roles left in suppliers and service businesses that will ramp up investment if the commitment from the government to the industry is solid.</p> <p>As Dustin Benton of the Green Alliance says, Britain is in a good position to build a sophisticated renewables industry that supports the generation of green energy and does the clever stuff to connect up all the various parts of the network.</p> <p>The green lobby group has argued that the UK could replace Hinkley by encouraging initiatives to reduce consumption \u2013 not in terms of switching off heating and lighting, but rewarding users on the basis of the electricity consumption they avoid. \u201cOur report on reducing electricity demand \u2026 shows how the UK could get two Hinkleys\u2019 worth of demand reduction by 2030 and certainly a Hinkley\u2019s worth by 2025,\u201d he says.</p> <p>May has much to overcome. The previous administration\u2019s withdrawal of financial support for the solar industry after a few years of lauding it as the next big thing has made many people in the renewables sector wary. Admittedly, the state cash on offer for building solar farms was extraordinarily generous and needed to be cut, but the sudden and deep reductions wiped out much of the industry, forcing many firms to wind themselves up.</p> <p>It means that outside the offshore wind sector, where government support appears to be strong, firms will remain cautious.</p> <p>As an answer to the problem, there\u2019s no need to adopt a North Korean approach, pumping state cash into key sectors and picking winners. An industrial strategy just needs to be more coherent, offer subsidies to achieve longer-term goals and stick with the plan while modifying it along the way.</p>",

And that\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d</p> <p>For politicians back in Washington, the trick will be to convince voters that deals can be in their interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that over the years the interest of American corporations and the interests of Americans have diverged,\u201d Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \u201cOne of the mistakes is that corporate American has just said: \u2018If it\u2019s good for us, it\u2019s good for America,\u2019 and the approach needs to be more sophisticated than that. They need to show how it will help workers, too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the mid-1980s, oil company Chevron commissioned a series of expensive television and print ads to convince the public of its environmental bonafides.

The combination of limited public access to information and seemingly unlimited advertising enabled companies to present themselves as caring environmental stewards, even as they were engaging in environmentally unsustainable practices.</p> <p>But greenwashing dates back even earlier. American electrical behemoth Westinghouse\u2019s nuclear power division was a greenwashing pioneer. Threatened by the 1960\u2019s anti-nuclear movement, which raised questions about its safety and environmental impact, it fought back with a series of ads proclaiming the cleanliness and safety of nuclear power plants. One, featuring a photograph of a <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/162185351/1969-westinghouse-building-nuclear-power\">nuclear plant nestled by a pristine lake</a>, proclaimed that \u201cWe\u2019re building nuclear power plants to give you more electricity,\u201d and went on to say that nuclear plants were \u201codorless [...] neat, clean, and safe\u201d.</p> <p>Some of these claims were true: in 1969, Westinghouse nuclear plants were producing large amounts of cheap electricity with far less air pollution than competing coal plants. However, given that the ads appeared after nuclear meltdowns had already occurred in <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/29/u-s-nuclear-plant-had-partial-meltdown-years-before-three-mile-island/\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/benchmarks-january-3-1961-three-men-die-nuclear-reactor-meltdown\">Idaho</a>, the word \u201csafe\u201d was arguable. Westinghouse\u2019s ads also ignored concerns about the <a href=\"http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm\">environmental impact of nuclear waste</a>, which has <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/read/9674/chapter/2#2\">continued to be a problem</a>.<br></p> <h2>The mysterious case of the stolen towels</h2> <p>In 1983, when Jay Westerveld first got the idea for the term greenwashing, he wasn\u2019t thinking about nuclear power \u2013 he was thinking about towels. An undergraduate student on a research trip to Samoa, he stopped off in Fiji to surf. At the sprawling <a href=\"http://www.beachcomberfiji.com/\">Beachcomber Resort</a>, he saw a note asking customers to pick up their towels. \u201cIt basically said that the oceans and reefs are an important resource, and that reusing the towels would reduce ecological damage,\u201d Westerveld recalls. \u201cThey finished by saying something like, \u2018Help us to help our environment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Westerveld wasn\u2019t actually staying at the resort \u2013 he was lodging at a \u201cgrubby\u201d guesthouse nearby, and had just snuck in to steal some clean towels. Even so, he was struck by the note\u2019s irony: while it claimed to be protecting the island\u2019s ecosystem, he says, the Beachcomber \u2013 which, today, describes itself as \u201cthe most <a href=\"http://www.beachcomberfiji.com/\">sought-after destination in the South Pacific</a>\u201d \u2013 was expanding. \u201cI don\u2019t think they really cared all that much about the coral reefs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were in the middle of expanding at the time, and were building more bungalows.\u201d</p> <p>Three years later, in 1986, when he was writing a term paper on multiculturalism, Westerveld remembered the note. \u201cI finally wrote something like, \u2018It all comes out in the greenwash.\u2019 A guy in the class with me worked for a literary magazine and had me write an essay about it.\u201d And, as the magazine had a large readership in nearby New York City, it wasn\u2019t long before the term caught on in the wider media.</p> <p>Westerveld\u2019s essay came out a year after the launch of Chevron\u2019s People Do campaign. As <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/10/the-failure-of-chevrons-new-we-agree-ad-campaign/64951/\">critics later pointed out</a>, many of the environmental programs that Chevron promoted in its campaign were mandated by law. They were also relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of Chevron\u2019s ad budget: environmental activist <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2CHLmPx2PJ0C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Chevron+%22People+do%22+campaign+criticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Re5kl9yUqZ&amp;sig=MBqepaSKX5BV_nZm0mGhdmDWVls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS4Mz2h5nOAhWDNx4KHSrxCokQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Chevron%20%22People%20do%22%20campaign%20criticism&amp;f=false\">Joshua Karliner estimated</a> that Chevron\u2019s butterfly preserve cost it $5,000 per year to run, while the ads promoting it cost millions of dollars to produce and broadcast.</p> <p>The People Do campaign also ignored Chevron\u2019s spotty environmental record: while it was running the ads, it <a href=\"http://www.corp-research.org/chevron\">was also violating</a> the clean air act, the clean water act and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42437_1_chevron-ads\">spilling oil into wildlife refuges</a>. But Chevron was far from the only company digging deep into the greenwashing cesspool. In 1989, chemical company DuPont announced its new double-hulled oil tankers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJZFfeLRCJs\">with ads featuring marine animals clapping their flippers and wings in chorus to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy</a>. However, as environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth pointed out in its report Hold the Applause, the company was <a href=\"http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1991/10/doyle.html\">the single largest corporate polluter in the US</a>.</p> <p>Other corporate claims were equally outrageous: forestry giant <a href=\"http://fair.org/extra/tv-lets-corporations-pull-green-wool-over-viewers-eyes/\">Weyerhaeuser</a> ran ads claiming that it was \u201cserious\u201d about caring for fish \u2013 even as it was <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/logging-and-landslides-what-went-wrong/\">cutting down trees in some of its forests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0730/01091.html\">destabilizing salmon habitats</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bReBO55XzZc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bReBO55XzZc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Muddying the waters</h2> <p>By the early 1990s, consumers were wising up to sustainability concerns: polls showed that companies\u2019 <a href=\"http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11303/volumes/ap01/AP-01\">environmental records</a> <a href=\"http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=243#3\">influenced the majority of consumer purchases</a>. This interest in the environment brought an increased awareness of the greenwashing; by the end of the decade, the word had officially entered the English language with its inclusion in the <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/greenwash\">Oxford English Dictionary</a>. Since then, the trend has only increased: a 2015 Nielsen poll showed that 66% of global consumers are willing to <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2015/the-sustainability-imperative.html\">pay more for environmentally sustainable products</a>. Among <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/green-generation-millennials-say-sustainability-is-a-shopping-priority.html\">millennials</a>, that number jumps to 72%.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are getting more aware of the rarity of the Earth and the ways that our actions impact it,\u201d says Jason Ballard, CEO of sustainable home improvement retailer<a href=\"https://treehouse.co/\"> TreeHouse</a>. At the same time, he notes, greenwashing has become more complex. \u201cIt\u2019s the dark side of a very positive development,\u201d he says.</p> <p>One shift has been outreach. Many companies are now working to engage customers in their sustainability efforts, even as their core business model remains environmentally unsustainable. <a href=\"http://www.ecooptions.homedepot.com/healthy-home/recycling/\">The Home Depot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lowes.com/cd_Helping+the+Environment+With+Recycling+Centers_368967519_\">Lowes</a>, for example, both encourage customers to do their part by offering onsite recycling for several products, including compact fluorescent lights and plastic bags. Meanwhile, they continue to sell <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/102714/home-depots-profitability-unvarnished-truth.asp\">billions of dollars</a> per year worth of environmentally damaging products, such as paints that are loaded with toxic ingredients and <a href=\"http://www.hercenter.org/facilitiesandgrounds/paints.cfm\">which release noxious fumes</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s misdirection, and it\u2019s intended to shift the customer\u2019s focus from a company\u2019s appalling behaviors to something that\u2019s peripheral,\u201d Ballard says. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJZFfeLRCJs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zJZFfeLRCJs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>The bottled water conundrum</strong></h2> <p>Another trend, says Jonah Sachs, CEO of branding agency<a href=\"https://freerange.com/\"> Free Range Studios</a>, is linking sustainability claims to other issues, such as personal health. \u201cThere\u2019s this perception that personal health and environmental sustainability are two sides of the same coin,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes this is true, but many times it isn\u2019t. Bottled water is a great example: in terms of health, it\u2019s much better than soda or other drinks, but in terms of the environment and sustainability, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>The water industry <a href=\"http://www.springtothetap.org/2013/04/earth-week-greenwashing-in-bottled.html\">trades heavily on images of rugged mountains and pristine lakes to sell its products</a>. And many companies \u2013 Nestle, in particular \u2013 spend millions of dollars trying to convince the public that their bottled water isn\u2019t only good to drink, but is also good for the planet. Over the past few years, the bottled water giant has claimed that its <a href=\"http://thegreenwashingblog.com/2009/03/27/greenwashing-nestle-plastic-water-bottle/\">Eco-Shape</a> bottle is more efficient, that its <a href=\"http://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/07/07/nestle-launches-recycled-plastic-water-bottle/\">Resource</a> recycled plastic bottle is more environmentally responsible and that its use of <a href=\"http://www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/plant-based-plastics\">plant-based plastics</a> is less damaging to the planet.</p> <p>In 2008, Nestle Waters Canada even ran an ad claiming: \u201cBottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.\u201d <a href=\"https://this.org/2009/05/15/environment-water-bottle/\">Several Canadian groups</a> quickly filed a complaint against the company. Five years later, during Earth Day 2013, the <a href=\"http://www.bottledwater.org/bottled-water-%E2%80%98face-positive-change%E2%80%99-earth-day-2013\">International Bottled Water Association</a> doubled down on the sustainability claims, announcing that bottled water was \u201cthe face of positive change\u201d because the industry was using less plastic in its bottles and relying more on recycled plastic.</p> <p>Sustainability promises aside, only about <a href=\"http://www.ecowatch.com/americas-deadly-love-affair-with-bottled-water-has-to-end-1882099598.html\">31% of plastic bottles end up getting recycled</a>, which means that \u201cthe face of positive change\u201d creates <a href=\"http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/34198-big-water-vs-the-national-parks-the-fight-against-bottled-water-goes-federal\">millions of tons of garbage</a> every year, much of which ends up in landfills or the ocean.</p> <p>And the water that goes in the bottles is often equally unsustainable. Nestle\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.arrowheadwater.com/\">Arrowhead water</a> claims that \u201cMother Nature is our muse\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.arrowheadwater.com/sustainability/commitment/\">boasts that it</a> \u201chas a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources\u201d to ensure responsible water stewardship. This sounds promising until one considers that those springs are in <a href=\"https://www.arrowheadwater.com/sustainability/commitment/\">California</a>, which has been in a state of drought for <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3044538/world-changing-ideas/5-things-california-can-do-to-survive-a-megadrought\">five years</a>. The company also bottles water in <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-29/nestl-discovers-water-in-the-arizona-desert-and-bottles-it\">Arizona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/17/nestle-bottled-water-oregon-measure-14-55\">Oregon</a>, both of which are also experiencing droughts.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbx7BIYz1KY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lbx7BIYz1KY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>A golden oldie</h2> <p>Some of the classic greenwashers are also taking cues from the new greenwashing playbook. In 2013, amid worries about unemployment and continued concerns about energy sustainability, Westinghouse put a fresh face on its old claims with a brand new commercial. \u201cDid you know that nuclear energy is the largest source of clean air energy in the world?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbx7BIYz1KY\">the ad asked viewers right before claiming that its nuclear power plants</a> \u201cprovide cleaner air, create jobs, and help sustain the communities where they operate\u201d.<br></p> <p>What the commercial failed to mention was that, two years earlier, Westinghouse was cited by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for concealing <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/business/energy-environment/21nuke.html?_r=0\">flaws in its reactor designs</a> and submitting false information to regulators. And, in February 2016, another plant that uses Westinghouse reactors, New York\u2019s Indian Point, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/new-york-city-groundwater-radioactivity-investigation-indian-point-nuclear-power\">leaked radioactive material</a> into the surrounding area\u2019s groundwater.<br></p> <p>Greenwashing may have taken on a new shape in the last decade, but it\u2019s still as murky as ever. <br></p>",
  "<p>Women\u2019s cricket closes the first chapter in the story of a new generation in Chelmsford on Sunday, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/headingley-womens-t20-super-league-yorkshire-diamonds-loughborough-lightining\" title=\"\">inaugural Kia Super League</a> (KSL) finals.</p> <p>Fifteen games played by six teams have produced an aggregate of 15,465 through gates at grounds both big and small, to watch a meeting of minds: the world\u2019s finest players sharing wisdom with England\u2019s top youngsters.</p> <p>To appreciate how seismic this is \u2013 the crowds, scenario and the stadia used \u2013 it is important to understand the low base women\u2019s cricket is starting from.

Despite cautionary tones from Cricket Australia, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/03/womens-big-bash-league-cricket-now-an-australian-television-ratings-hit\" title=\"\">exceeded all expectations</a>.</p> <p>Likewise the noises from the top brass heading into the KSL were guarded; this, it seemed, was a dry run. A TV broadcast was not actively pursued but the BBC did not allow various barriers (including the absence of ISDN lines at some grounds) to prevent the broadcasting of seven group games and finals day. Not all crowds have been as impressive as the 2,250 seen at the Ageas Bowl and the Kia Oval \u2013 the lowest, 372, was is mitigated by the fact it took place on a weekday in Loughborough \u2013 but the demographic has been notably youthful and female. The sight of women cricketers who have never played on TV or before crowds of more than 50 signing autographs for children wearing their team\u2019s colours is both striking and heartening.</p> <p>The tournament\u2019s aims \u2013 making the game appealing to young girls while bridging the vast gap between the international and domestic game \u2013 are being realised, even at this embryonic stage, according to Heather Knight, England\u2019s and Western Storm\u2019s captain.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s exceeded expectations, in terms of public interest and crowds, definitely,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThe cricket has felt close to international level in terms of standard and pressure, and for some younger players to play to that standard with 1,500-2,000 there is brilliant and quite a shock. Some of our girls have said it\u2019s so exciting but also massively daunting \u2026 it\u2019s priceless experience.\u201d</p> <p>The only absent global stars are Sarah Taylor (through illness), Meg Lanning (injury) and India\u2019s best players, who are expected to be involved next season. Another Taylor, Stafanie, the West Indies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/west-indies-stun-australia-in-womens-world-twenty20-final\" title=\"\">World T20-winning captain</a>, has topped the run-scoring charts and has eight wickets for Western Storm, joint-top with five others, including England\u2019s Alex Hartley and Anya Shrubsole.</p> <p>Such quality has made the competition \u201ca nightmare to captain\u201d, says Knight. \u201cYou take wickets and internationals keep coming off the conveyor belt.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the most heartening performances have come from English youngsters, such as the 18-year-old Lancashire Thunder opener Emma Lamb and the Southern Vipers spinner Linsey Smith, 21, another with eight wickets. The narrowing gap between domestic and international cricket will only accelerate such players\u2019 ascension to England caps.</p> <p>Having bid farewell first to the Yorkshire Diamonds, then Thunder and Surrey Stars, finals day is full of intrigue. Not only does it take place at a venue England\u2019s players call \u201cFortress Chelmsford\u201d (\u201csome of us are actually going to have to lose there,\u201d quips Knight) but the matches are beautifully poised. Western Storm meet Loughborough Lightning \u2013 the only team to beat them \u2013 for a place in the afternoon\u2019s final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/charlott-edwards-womens-cricket-super-league-final-southern-vipers-western-storm-loughborough\" title=\"\">against Southern Vipers</a>. Neatly the only team to topple Vipers so far are Western Storm.</p> <p>There have been scheduling imperfections and a broadcast deal, perhaps for online streaming, is vital. But the path forward, says Knight, has been made clear: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a 50-over competition next summer before the World Cup, with the same teams and then the T20 later on, and that could grow too. There\u2019s just so much scope to expand.\u201d</p>",
  "<p></p> <p> </p> <p>Dr Jill Stein called for a national state of emergency to be declared over the rapidly worsening effects of global warming, during a campaign swing through New York. </p> <p>Promoting her party\u2019s Green New Deal \u2013 an agenda designed to address the interconnected problems of climate change and the economy \u2013 Stein said the still uncontained Blue Cut fire in California and the record flooding in Louisiana were ample evidence of the worsening effects of climate change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/05/green-party-convention-jill-stein-bernie-or-bust-clinton\">'The only other option': Bernie Sanders backers turn to Green party's Jill Stein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe need to acknowledge the true state of emergency we are in,\u201d Stein said. \u201cThe fires in California and floods in Louisiana are going to become day-by-day occurrences, and, within our lifetimes, there is going to be potentially catastrophic sea-level rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to ensure that these disasters do not become a daily way of life for all Americans and people all over the world,\u201d she said, \u201cand this is why we need to declare a climate state of emergency so that we can respond in real time in the ways that we need to.\u201d</p> <p>In poll after poll, Stein added, the American people say they want substantial action on climate change that meets the severity of the crisis. She called for empowering Americans to instruct their elected officials \u2013 namely Congress \u2013 to act in their interests, not in the interests of lobbyists. </p> <p>Stein remarked that she was astonished to be witnessing a Republican party that appeared to be \u201cunravelling at the seams\u201d. But she also warned that Democrats were moving to the right.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice to appoint former Colorado senator and interior secretary Ken Salazar to be her transition director \u201crepresents the real Hillary Clinton\u201d, Stein said.</p> <p>Salazar, she said, is widely considered a reliable friend to the oil, gas, ranching and mining industries. As interior secretary, he opened the Arctic Ocean for oil drilling, and oversaw the response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Since returning to the private sector, she said, Salazar had become \u201cthe lobbyist\u2019s lobbyist \u2013 a man who strongly supports fracking, is in favor of the [Keystone XL] pipeline and likely to ensure such projects are approved in the future, and supports the Trans-Pacific partnership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo when people say: \u2018Hasn\u2019t the Democratic party moved to the left?\u2019 \u2013 well, talk is cheap. His appointment unveils the real Hillary Clinton who would take office. We\u2019re seeing how much faith people should put into the new vision of the Democratic party. It\u2019s a case of buyer beware. \u201d</p> <p>The Green party nominee, currently polling as high as 6% but well below the 15% threshold required for a podium position in the coming presidential TV debates, said declaring a state of emergency would address two related crises in the climate and the economy. </p> <p>Part of the solution would be the Green New Deal, a plan that would rapidly create 20m new jobs, lead to a sustainable economy and transition the US to 100% clean energy by 2030.</p> <p>The New Deal, Stein said, would help revive the economy, turn the tide on climate change and make wars for oil obsolete. \u201cWhen you have 100% renewable energy, you do not need and you cannot justify a military budget that distributes soldiers and weapons all around the world.\u201d</p> <p>The plan includes \u201crestoring critical infrastructure, including the ecosystem, cleaning up rivers and waterways, restoring our wetlands and forests and ensuring that we have water systems for our communities that are not toxic\u201d.</p> <p>Part of the program, she added, would be to call for a complete ban on new fossil fuel and nuclear infrastructure. Communities dependent on coal or fracking would be assured that jobs would be replaced before they were laid off. </p> <p>Stein estimates the costs of the transition would be completely offset by the money saved by not using fossil fuels. The savings, she suggested, would include billions of dollars related to healthcare costs from asthma, emphysema, heart attacks, strokes and cancers related to exposure to fossil fuels. </p> <p><span tabindex=\"-1\">The party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, Ajamu Baraka, also appeared at the event. A longtime human rights activist, he told the gathering that participatory job creation and planning was paramount in the development of a Green New Deal economy. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the people are direct participants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principle that this party and this campaign stands for.\u201d</span></p> <p>But getting the Greens\u2019 message out remains problematic. The party\u2019s message on climate has been repeatedly overshadowed by Stein\u2019s controversial comments on the government\u2019s regulatory oversight of vaccines, drawing accusations that she has associated herself with the discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/30/jill-stein-green-party-vaccinations-anti-vaxxers\">\u201canti-vaxxer\u201d movement. </a></p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, has both cited the proven importance of vaccines, noting that they save lives and have eliminated devastating diseases, and suggested that Americans cannot trust the people who recommend widespread vaccination. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/18/jill-stein-anti-vaccination-green-party-ridiculous\">Jill Stein dismisses perception she is anti-vaccines as 'ridiculous'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Responding to criticisms last month, she said her concerns were about the influence of corporations on government, but they also seemed to echo the concerns of anti-vaccination campaigners that compromised or influenced regulators could open the door for dangerous medicine. </p> <p>\u201cAs a medical doctor, of course I support vaccinations,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI have a problem with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] being controlled by drug companies.\u201d <br></p> <p>But on the campaign trail, Stein largely limited her remarks to concerns over climate change. She proposed introducing a carbon tax of $60 a ton that would yield around $360bn annually and increasing the estate tax to its level during the Reagan administration. Her proposals, she argued, were now a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cEach month now, we\u2019re seeing records set for climate change and global warming. Science is telling us that the day of reckoning is coming closer. This is not something that can wait another four years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in an existential moment where we have to decide if we want a future or not,\u201d she said. </p> <p></p>",

At Armando\u2019s call the pigs came trotting through the trees.

The high oil content of the acorns gives the ham its flavour. Montefrio produces just 200 hams a year; those that make it to the UK sell at around \u00a3400. We tried the ham at lunch. Sliced translucently thin, it dissolved on the palate, deep in salt, fat and flavour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95592d97d1a9bd718ee0d6875f5829b87b805c32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95592d97d1a9bd718ee0d6875f5829b87b805c32/0_82_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"spain-andalucia-aracena-hills-bathing-pigs-at-jamones-eiriz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pigs bathing in the Sierra de Aracena</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pura Aventura</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lots of parts of Spain would claim that their hams are the best. Fewer could claim that for their tuna. Bluefin tuna was until recently a byword for overfishing, and animal rights protestors would sit crossly outside Nobu. But the catching of fish below a certain size has now been banned. As a result the <em>rojo</em> tuna, as it\u2019s called here, is back in business. Down on the south coast in places such as Barbate, south of Cadiz, it has been caught in the same way for thousands of years, using a a system called the <em>almadraba</em>. In May and June the fish swim into a series of nets in the bay before being hauled in as part of a great communal effort. Their flesh is then processed in factories like Herpac, where commercial director Jose Vazquez Varo showed me aground. Again, a trip round a tuna processing plant might not be on everyone\u2019s dream holiday list, but I found it fascinating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f9c302092396b2ce1504389d6f37e09ce8a8aeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f9c302092396b2ce1504389d6f37e09ce8a8aeb/0_13_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuna ed cumming\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuna await processing at the Herpac plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Cumming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cutting of the tuna is called the <em>ronqueo</em>, from the Spanish word for \u201csnore\u201d, on account of the sound the knife makes on bone.

  "<p><em>Swallows and Amazons. By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/arthur-ransome\">Arthur Ransome</a>. London: Jonathan Cape. Pp.350. 7s. 6d. net.</em></p> <p>Children\u2019s books are probably the most difficult of all to write; they are certainly the most difficult to review. For children alone can properly judge their worth, and children, very wisely, never review. An adult has to refer back to his own childhood and ask himself: Would I have enjoyed such a book then? The answer, in the case of \u201cSwallow and Amazons,\u201d is very definitely, Yes. Moreover, the book is entirely charming quite apart from its qualities as child literature. This is rare; for, generally speaking, nothing makes drearier reading than the conscious juvenility of adults. There is something elephantine and clumsy about it, like Gladstone capering on all fours or a bishop playing Santa Claus. </p> <p>Mr. Ransome has the same magical power that Lewis Carroll had of being the child in terms of himself. He never talks down; never finds it necessary to be patronising or sentimental. And sentimentality is the most terrible pitfall that besets those who venture into the world of play. For just as Mr. Galsworthy delights Europe through the medium of Tauchnitz by showing it English ladies and gentlemen that exactly correspond with Europe\u2019s idea of English ladies and gentlemen, so your writer of children\u2019s books delights Montessori teachers and other moulders of the very young by showing them precisely their idea of children - an idea that bears about the same relation to real children as window-boxes do to gardens. For instance, Christopher Robin. Captain John and Mate Susan, and Able-seaman Titty, and Ship\u2019s Boy Roger are not at all like Christopher Robin. they are children.

The orphanage moved below ground when relentless bombardment became too much for normal life to continue, and it now provides a subterranean haven.</p> <p>The children range in age from two to 14. Their parents have been killed or become mentally ill, or have been snatched away in some other cruel fashion by a conflict now moving towards its sixth year. </p> <p>\u201cThey have adjusted in an extraordinary way to this terrible life,\u201d Halabi said. \u201cFor instance, they used to feel scared when they heard the sound of planes, but nowadays they want to go out the building and stare at the sky to see the jets or helicopter when they hear them overhead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5ea408e7ce4a67cc23dfeb4579fcea6f5709035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5ea408e7ce4a67cc23dfeb4579fcea6f5709035/0_120_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asmar Halabi, the orphanage\u2019s director\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asmar Halabi, the orphanage\u2019s director.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Dr Zaher Sahloul</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many had been made homeless, like siblings Omar, 12, and Mufedah, 13, found sleeping in rags on the stairs of their uncle\u2019s apartment building.

Although their relative had barred them from his apartment, his doorway still seemed safer to the children than the streets.</p> <p>The orphanage opened last year after activists raised concerns about the growing number of destitute young people scraping a living alone.

Though his sisters dream of resettlement elsewhere, he is content. \u201cUganda is one of the best places to stay for refugees,\u201d he says.</p> <p>By 2015, Uganda had become the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, after Ethiopia and Kenya, with more than half a million refugees. That number is rising rapidly. Alongside ongoing crises in Burundi and DRC, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/57988f594.html\">violence in South Sudan</a> has driven more refugees to Uganda during three weeks in July than in the first six months of 2016. The <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/drc-steps-emergency-response-south-sudanese-refugees-uganda\">Danish Refugee Council warned last month</a> the situation in northern Uganda could become \u201ccatastrophic\u201d if they don\u2019t receive more support for assisting the influx of refugees from South Sudan. </p> <p>But these recent arrivals are among the lucky ones: Uganda is <a href=\"http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/5129\">one of the most favourable environments in the world</a> for refugees, according to the UNHCR. While many countries keep refugees in camps away from citizens, Uganda allows them to set up businesses, work for others, and move freely around the country. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa6a31d1afe63d8f2817492a2b3768c6072fcbca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa6a31d1afe63d8f2817492a2b3768c6072fcbca/0_75_4954_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two tailors from Rwanda and Burundi work at Kityaza market in Nakivale refugee camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two tailors from Rwanda and Burundi work at Kityaza market in Nakivale refugee camp, where refugees have lived since 1958,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Patton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of refugees live in Uganda\u2019s rural settlements, where they are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home, as well as food aid and access to basic health and education services. But they are also free to build a life in Kampala \u2013 where 74,896 <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/refugees\">refugees</a> and asylum seekers were registered as of May 2016 \u2013 as Patrick,* who arrived from Rwanda in 2009 did. Today, he owns a shop and three motorcycle taxis, and employs workers on his land.</p> <p>Refugees in Uganda\u2019s rural settlements are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home \u2013 so that investment in infrastructure benefits locals too; they also receive food aid and access to primary schools and health services. </p> <p>However, some other nationals in Uganda feel restricted by their refugee status. Although the authorities say people are free to come and go, Michael*, a Congolese artist who arrived in Nakivale settlement in 2010, says: \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t agree with you they can just stop you [from doing what you want].\u201d </p> <p>Sometimes the problem is unclear communication. Hakiza remembers brandishing a copy of the Refugee Act when he first went to register his organisation with the local authorities; they had had told him he wasn\u2019t allowed.</p> <p>Mimy Abeja, a Congolese single mother of 10, says Nakivale is \u201cnot a place to raise children\u201d. She is relieved not to be paying rent, but struggles to keep her tailoring business afloat, adding that all of the family have been in and out of hospital since they arrived. </p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/publications/humanitarian-assistance-and-politics-of-self-reliance-ugandas-nakivale-refugee-settleme\"> study from the Centre for International Governance Innovation</a> in 2015 found that, rather than being genuinely self-sufficient, most in Nakivale were \u201cengaged in daily survival tactics\u201d. Countrywide, <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/blog/?p=879\">most refugees live at subsistence level</a>, says David Kigozi, a senior programme officer at the Kampala-based <a href=\"http://www.refugee-rights.org/\">International Refugee Rights Initiative</a>, pointing out that over 70% depend on the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/uganda\">World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we wake up fighting because of our stomachs,\u201d says 29-year-old Alex Bucunga, a filmmaker who arrived from DRC nine years ago, explaining that food rations are reduced significantly for those here longer than five years. Casual work helps fill the gaps: Bucunga has taught English, while others dig farmland, make bricks or work as translators. That\u2019s rarely sufficient to start or grow a business \u2014 but <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/uk/partners/ngodirectory/4ea918e924/nsamizi-training-institute-social-development.html\">Nsamizi</a>, a training institute and responsible for livelihoods support in Nakivale, says a revolving credit fund for refugees will be operational later this year.</p> <p>The fund will likely also be open to Ugandans: government guidelines state that around 30% of refugee assistance should help host communities. Under a new UN strategy, acknowledging the longevity of displacement, livelihoods programmes will target refugees and Ugandans together, and some basic services will be merged. Water services in Nakivale will be handed to the district authority, eventually requiring refugees to pay for water just as locals do. Similarly, the UNHCR will hand over responsibility of the only secondary school in the area to the government. And there\u2019s even a suggestion of recruiting refugees into public service jobs, currently only open to Ugandans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e06c3f08eb66d09f0070a441ec16e3c9cc07c82/0_4_4757_2853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees from Burundi have been given tree seedlings to plant in Rubondo village, in Nakivale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Patton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, more refugees may travel to Uganda, especially if neighbouring Kenya keeps its <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/global-development/2016/may/25/kenya-william-ruto-tells-uk-to-resettle-somali-refugees-living-in-dadaab\">promise to close its camps</a>.

But, while the size of plots given to refugees has already been halved, the government has not indicated that it will limit its open door policy, and a newly-opened settlement area with room for up to 100,000 people is already welcoming refugees. \u201cWhere else in the region would they go?\u201d asks Douglas Asiimwe, assistant commissioner for refugees. Many citizens \u2014 some of whom have been refugees themselves \u2014 share this view, providing some of the land allocated to newcomers.</p> <p>Even if the welcome continues, rising numbers of newcomers, severe funding shortages and further integration of assistance within national structures may encourage more realistic expectations among refugees. Jimmy Maguru, a project manager at Nsamizi, says Nakivale residents are taking more responsibility for their future than ever before \u2014 partly thanks to livelihoods projects, but also because \u201cpeople are hearing that plot sizes are likely to get smaller\u201d.</p> <p>Expectations of resettlement, though, may need to be addressed. Many hope for a future in North America or Europe \u2014 yet the UNHCR\u2019s resettlement target for Nakivale, home to more than 110,000 refugees, is only around 700 this year. </p> <p>\u201cPeople think the only one solution is resettlement [and that you\u2019re a] failure if you don\u2019t to go\u201d says Michael, who is planning new community projects in Nakivale. \u201cI want them to know they can start their life here.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Names have been changed</em></p> <p><em>The reporter\u2019s travel costs were covered by a <a href=\"http://www.oneworldmedia.org.uk/\">One World Media</a> grant</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

  "<p>The visceral and poetic power of Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock\u2019s prose hits you from the opening lines of her extraordinary debut novel, which has been longlisted for this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/jul/08/guardian-childrens-fiction-prize-2016-longlist\">Guardian children\u2019s fiction prize</a>. Sixteen-year-old Ruth Lawrence recalls a scene from her early childhood in Alaska: a deer has been hung in the garage to cure, its hooves \u201cpointy like a ballerina\u2019s toes\u201d. Watching her father butcher it, young Ruth was allowed to touch the still warm heart, which she put to her lips to \u201ckiss its smooth, pink flesh, hoping to feel it beating, but it was all beat out\u201d.</p> <p><em>The Smell of Other People\u2019s Houses</em> tells the interconnected stories of four teenagers \u2013 Ruth, Dora, Alyce and Hank \u2013 who pass the baton of the story between them as they come of age against the epic backdrop of Alaska. Hitchcock uses rhythm and refrain to enrich her storytelling, and divides the novel into four sections following the rhythm of the year \u2013 spring, summer, autumn and winter.</p> <p>Ruth\u2019s voice is given prominence, and it is her narration that powerfully bookends the novel. She and a younger sister are brought up by a stern Catholic grandmother in the small town of Fairbanks. They are poor, but involvement with a rich kid (\u201ccedar is the smell of swim team parties at [Ray\u2019s house] \u2026 cedar is the smell of Republicans\u201d) brings consequences that involve Ruth coming to terms with new and old wounds.</p> <p>Dora has an abusive father and a hopeless mother who is happiest drinking in the local bar. Dora comes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2011/dec/14/oil-drilling-inupiat-arctic-in-pictures\">Inupiat ancestry</a> while best friend Dumpling is Athabascan \u2013 though whether Inuit or Indian, \u201cmost people in Fairbanks lump all natives together\u201d.</p> <p>Alyce\u2019s parents are divorced. She longs to be a ballerina, but rather than spending the holidays practising she helps her dad on his fishing boat. The sole male voice belongs to Hank, who is the eldest of three brothers. When their mother remarries, life with the stepdad is awful enough to make running away the only option.</p> <p>The novel has a loose structure that allows individual stories to emerge while strongly evoking the spirit of place. Much play is made of the fragile and mysterious strands that can tie individuals together across a challenging physical and emotional landscape. A red ribbon is cut in two and tied around another\u2019s wrist because \u201csometimes you have to hold on to whatever you can\u201d.</p> <p>There is an unflinching honesty in Hitchcock\u2019s portraits of the adults in these teens\u2019 orbits. Shaped by harsh life experiences themselves, the grownups are more likely to put obstacles in the path of the next generation than ease their way. Noteworthy among some memorable secondary characters is Ruth\u2019s grandmother, whose house \u201csmells like it\u2019s judging you the minute you walk inside\u201d. She is capable of breathtaking cruelty (there\u2019s a haircutting episode to make you flinch), but her steeliness conceals a sound heart.</p> <p>The beginning of the story, which is raw and fierce, contrasts with its upbeat and somewhat neat conclusion. It is no small feat in this short, tightly edited novel to resolve four separate stories and deliver an ending of emotional heft. This is a captivating debut by an exciting new author whose native Alaska permeates every page. Its scale counterpoints the human stories. Here is a land where a road journey can take two weeks, where a tsunami can swallow whole fishing fleets, and where orcas work in packs to steal cod from fishing boats so that only the black lips remain hooked to the lines.</p> <p>\u2022 Linda Buckley-Archer\u2019s <em>The Many Lives of John Stone</em> is published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

  "<p>Of all the various indignities laden upon Bridget Jones \u2013 the unfaithful fuckwit boyfriends, the nosy Smug Marrieds, the blue soup \u2013 none has been as frustrating to witness as the trajectory of her reputation. Leaving aside the film franchise, each proving the rule of diminishing returns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/helenfielding\">Helen Fielding\u2019s</a> perfect novel, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this week, has, in its afterlife, suffered a double-pronged attack more demeaning than Bridget being harangued about her lovelife over a turkey curry buffet.</p> <p>It is as true as it is a truism to say that books written by women about women are generally seen as niche fluff while those written by men about men are big manly literature. So <a href=\"http://www.jaymcinerney.com/\">Jay McInerney</a>, say, can write about obnoxious Manhattan people and his books will be celebrated as literary events. But Fielding, at least McInerney\u2019s equal as a social satirist, writes a book about an English woman and it is treated by critics as an indulgence for the ladies, one they can\u2019t ignore due to its enormous success, but not something that needs to be taken seriously. This isn\u2019t limited to books, of course. As <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women\">Emily Nussbaum wrote</a> on Bridget\u2019s contemporary, Sex And The City, \u201cwhile The Sopranos has ascended to TV\u2019s Mt Olympus, the reputation of Sex And The City has shrunk and faded... The assumption that anything stylised (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\u201d Emphasis on the feminine, I\u2019d argue.</p> <p>But critical disdain is no surprise. Far more disheartening for me is to hear young women dismiss the book. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bridget-jones-s-diary.html\">Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary</a> is probably my favourite book, equalled only by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heartburn-VMC-Nora-Ephron/dp/1844085171\">Nora Ephron\u2019s novel</a> about divorce, Heartburn, which has been similarly dismissed over the years as semi-autobiographical froth (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview33\">Ephron wrote in 2004</a>, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that over the years the words \u2018thinly disguised\u2019 are applied mostly to books written by women... I managed to convert an event that seemed to me hideously tragic at the time to a comedy \u2013 and if that\u2019s not fiction I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d) Yet when I recommend it to women in their teens and 20s the response is generally a look that says, \u201cYeah, alright, grandma, welcome to the 21st century.\u201d The reason why has been articulated in thousands of blogs and columns by young female writers, expressing bewilderment at Bridget\u2019s repeated desire for marriage and her calorie counting. \u201cI don\u2019t think like this and therefore I don\u2019t like this,\u201d is the general conclusion.</p> <p>It is true that Bridget and her neuroses are out of step with today. No one would accuse her of being woke. But the idea that you have to think like the heroine in order to enjoy the novel is a tad limiting. Most women today don\u2019t think like Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, but I\u2019d still recommend giving that book a spin. It feels faintly akin to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall\">Rhodes Must Fall</a> hoo-ha from last year and other similar protests which argue, essentially, that if an artist or piece of art does not accord with modern values it has no value at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/13/hillary-clinton-parks-and-recreation-hadley-freeman\">Don't like Hillary Clinton? You need to watch Parks And Recreation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If young women feel they need to be like Bridget to get the book, it is most likely because older women have told them precisely that. \u201cI literally was Bridget!\u201d, they cry, just as they once were literally <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0018417/\">Carrie Bradshaw</a>, or Lizzy Bennet, or whatever self-infantilising humblebrag of a literary comparison they find. Sure, it\u2019s nice to feel you have a literary alter ego. But the idea that you need to find one in order to enjoy a piece of art is one I only ever hear in relation to women. After all, not a man on this earth has ever said, \u201cGod, I am sooooo not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Wooster\">Bertie Wooster</a>. He presents a really terrible view of men. Bog off, Wodehouse!\u201d</p> <p>People always rebel against the generation immediately before, which is why Bridget Jones is considered embarrassingly retro but Jane Austen is apparently totally relatable. When I bought the book when I was 18 I didn\u2019t relate to Bridget at all. But I immediately loved it because it took me out of the anxious, virginal, generally terrified of everything teenager I was and made me laugh. It took me out of myself, in other words, and it still does. Because when I read a novel, I want a story, not a mirror. To paraphrase Ephron, if that isn\u2019t proof of a good book, I don\u2019t know what is.</p>",

He too, had been a brilliant young director, but after a few hours in Rio he never quite got his life back together again. Life outstrips the mind: especially when the life is female and takes its clothes off. Rio reminds you of that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/13/clive-james-granddaughter-look-after-charlie-gerbil\">Clive James: \u2018my granddaughter has left me to look after Charlie, her pet gerbil\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The opening ceremony of the Games was run on a tight budget but I liked it best when the budget ran out completely, leaving nothing but people. Gisele B\u00fcndchen, still in great shape after all these years, did a long catwalk walk without even a catwalk. There were supposed to be hugely expensive effects to accompany her progress \u2013 giraffes falling from the sky, etc \u2013 but the money ran out, leaving just her.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t have been more pleased and neither, apparently, could she. For the rest of the night she was up there dancing herself to bits. Her beautiful disintegration did something to compensate for the slick tableaux about the threat of climate change, which were adequately financed but, in the Rio context, utterly fantastic. The idea that Rio might need the assistance of the global climate to turn itself into a cesspool is sheer hubris. It is, however, a beautiful cesspool.</p> <p>I watched everything, far into the night. I watched long-distance cycle races that not even the camera cars could see, because the roads ran through the forest. In Rio the roads can do that in the middle of town, a fact which lends enchantment if you don\u2019t mind finding centipedes in the bathroom. Sometimes when the bikes crashed you couldn\u2019t even see the carnage because there were too many trees. People just went missing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c328f097f4165d275bc6c18ca70a79d597c3c400\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c328f097f4165d275bc6c18ca70a79d597c3c400/0_361_2864_1718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olga Korbut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olga Korbut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/PLP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But nothing could beat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/09/olympics-womens-gymnastics-usa-team-final-live\">the women\u2019s gymnastics</a>.

  "<p>Many people listen to music while they\u2019re carrying out a task, whether they\u2019re studying for an exam, driving a vehicle or even reading a book. Many of these people argue that background music helps them focus. </p> <p>Why, though? When you think about it, that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Why would having two things to concentrate on make you more focused, not less? Some people even go so far as to say that not having music on is more distracting. So what\u2019s going on there?</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear why the brain likes music so much in the first place, although it clearly does. Interestingly, there\u2019s a specific spectrum of musical properties that the brain prefers. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094446\">Experiments by Maria Witek and colleagues</a> reveal that there needs to be a medium level of syncopation in music to elicit a pleasure response and associated body movement in individuals. What this means in plain English is: music needs to be funky, but not too funky, for people to like it enough to make them want to dance. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/20/is-speed-reading-a-waste-of-time\">Is speed reading a waste of time?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Your own experience will probably back this up. Simple, monotonous beats, like listening to a metronome, aren\u2019t really entertaining. They have low levels of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation\">syncopation</a> and certainly don\u2019t make you want to dance. In contrast, chaotic and unpredictable music, like free jazz, has high levels of syncopation, can be extremely off-putting and rarely, if ever, entices people to dance. </p> <p>The middle ground (<a href=\"https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/news/why-does-funk-music-make-us-want-to-dance\">funk music like James Brown is what the experimenters reference most</a>) hits the sweet spot between predictable and chaotic, for which the brain has a strong preference. Most modern pop falls somewhere within this range, no doubt. <br></p> <p></p> <h2>Paying attention</h2> <p>Why would music help us concentrate, though? One argument is to do with attention. </p> <p>For all its amazing abilities, the brain hasn\u2019t really evolved to take in abstract information or spend prolonged periods thinking about one thing. <a href=\"http://nro.sagepub.com/content/20/2/150.full\">We seem to have two attention systems</a>: a conscious one that enables us to direct our focus towards things we know we want to concentrate on and an unconscious one that shifts attention towards anything our senses pick up that might be significant. The unconscious one is simpler, more fundamental, and linked to emotional processing rather than higher reasoning. It also operates faster. So when you hear a noise when you\u2019re alone at home, you\u2019re paying attention to it long before you\u2019re able to work out what it might have been. You can\u2019t help it.</p> <p>The trouble is, while our conscious attention is focused on the task in hand, the unconscious attention system doesn\u2019t shut down; it\u2019s still very much online, scanning for anything important in your peripheral senses. And if what we\u2019re doing is unpleasant or dull \u2013 so you\u2019re already having to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12507690\">force your attention to stay fixed on it</a> \u2013 the unconscious attention system is even more potent. This means that a distraction doesn\u2019t need to be as stimulating to divert your attention on to something else. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some \u200bpeople argue that one of the best music genres for concentration is the video game soundtrack</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Have you ever worked in an open-plan office and been working on a very important task, only to be driven slowly mad by a co-worker constantly sniffing, or sipping their coffee, or clipping their nails? Something quite innocuous suddenly becomes much more infuriating when you\u2019re trying to work on something your brain doesn\u2019t necessarily enjoy.</p> <p>Music is a very useful tool in such situations. It provides non-invasive noise and pleasurable feelings, to effectively neutralise the unconscious attention system\u2019s ability to distract us. It\u2019s much like giving small children a new toy to play with while you\u2019re trying to get some work done without them disturbing you. </p> <h2>Type of music</h2> <p>However, it\u2019s not just a matter of providing any old background noise to keep distractions at bay. A lot of companies have tried using <a href=\"http://cambridgesound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Color-of-Noise.pdf\">pink noise</a> (pdf) \u2013 a less invasive version of white noise \u2013 broadcasting it around the workplace to reduce distractions and boost productivity. But views on the effectiveness of this approach are mixed at best. </p> <p>It seems clear that the type of noise, or music, is important. This may seem obvious: someone listening to classical music while they work wouldn\u2019t seem at all unusual, but if they were listening to thrash metal it would be thought very strange indeed. </p> <p>While the nature and style of the music can cause specific responses in the brain (funky music compels you to dance, sad music <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/i-second-that-emotion-the-emotive-power-of-music-in-advertising.html\">makes you melancholy</a>, motivational music <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-workout-music/\">makes you want to keep fit</a>), some studies suggest that it <a href=\"http://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor01141\">really is down to personal preference</a>. Music you like increases focus, while music you don\u2019t impedes it. Given the extreme variation in musical preferences from person to person, exposing your workforce or classroom to a single type of music would obviously end up with mixed results.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/18/how-physical-exercise-makes-your-brain-work-better\">How physical exercise makes your brain work better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Music also has a big impact on mood \u2013 truly bleak music could sap your enthusiasm for your task. Something else to look out for is music with catchy lyrics. Musical pieces without wordsmight be better working companions, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect\">human speech and vocalisation is something our brains pay particular attention to</a>. <br></p> <h2>Video game soundtracks</h2> <p>Some people argue that one of the best music genres for concentration is the <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3030502/agendas/the-new-playlist-for-more-productive-work-video-game-soundtracks\">video game soundtrack</a>. This makes sense, when you consider the purpose of the video game music: to help create an immersive environment and to facilitate but not distract from a task that requires constant attention and focus. </p> <p>Limitations in the technology used for early games consoles meant the music also tended to be fairly simplistic in its melodies \u2013 think Tetris or Mario. In a somewhat Darwinian way, the music in video games has been refined over decades to be pleasant, entertaining, but not distracting. The composers have (probably unintentionally) been manipulating the attention systems in the brains of players for years now.</p> <p>There are signs that, as technology progresses, this type of theme music is being abandoned, with games producers opting for anything from big orchestral pieces to hip-hop. The challenge will be to maintain the delicate balance of stimulation without distraction. To achieve this, games composers will need to stay focused. Which is ironic. </p> <p><em>Dean Burnett\u2019s first book, The Idiot Brain, all about the weird and confusing properties of the brain, is available now in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461961162&amp;sr=1-1\">UK</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Idiot-Brain-What-Your-Really/dp/0393253783/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469736302&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=dean+burnett\">US.</a></em></p>",

  "<p>With some of the largest remaining tracts of true wilderness in Europe, Scandinavia and Iceland offer a multitude of adventure opportunities and, if you head off the beaten track, they can work out a lot cheaper than you might expect. The centuries-old tradition of <em>allemansr\u00e4tten</em> (every man\u2019s right) means people can roam and wild camp just about anywhere so long as they do not disturb or destroy the environment. Foraging is also permitted, and provides a seasonal abundance of delicious berries, mushrooms and fish. Travelling by train, bike or on foot takes you into these magnificent landscapes.</p> <h2><strong>Sweden</strong>: t<strong>he Inlandsbanan slow train</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6d998542a3979c855e5066f642a65f76ec957a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d998542a3979c855e5066f642a65f76ec957a6/0_1513_8776_5266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweden's Inlandsbanan railway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Inlandsbanan railway heads north to the Arctic Circle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai-Uwe Och/handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Completed in 1937, the Inlandsbanan railway snakes for 800 miles up through the rugged and forested heartland of Sweden from the southern county of Dalarna to Swedish Lapland, inside the Arctic Circle. The line is divided into two sections \u2013 north and south of \u00d6stersund \u2013 and just one train travels in each direction along each section each day. This means that although the journey can be done in two days, you can also easily make it last a week or more. Built to transport timber, the line fell into disuse as roads improved and is now operated as a summer passenger service (mid-June to the end of August, so worth planning a trip for next summer). The landscape changes from forest and lakes in the south to tundra and huge wild rivers in the north. The timetable varies each year, and the train stops frequently at trackside restaurants and platform food stalls for delicacies such as smoked trout from the Vojm\u00e5n river, or warm cinnamon buns. The driver will often stop for interesting wildlife, too \u2013 moose, reindeer, and maybe even a bear or lynx. Those who want to learn more about the wildlife can arrange a trip with guide Marcus Eldh, founder of <a href=\"http://www.wildsweden.com/\">Wild Sweden</a>. The banks of the Ljusnan river in R\u00f6jan are the place to look for the protected black vanilla-orchid \u2013 the provincial flower of J\u00e4mtland. On a hot day the train might stop so everyone can swim in a remote, crystal clear lake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f89bd533ec34d356cb6ed90b03e7ab9f9e2deb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f89bd533ec34d356cb6ed90b03e7ab9f9e2deb9/0_217_6012_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lake in the southern Swedish county of Dalarna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lake in the southern Swedish county of Dalarna, where the journey begins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the stops are big, old wooden station buildings, while others are simply a sign and some steps in the middle of the forest. With over 65 stops, it\u2019s easy to hop on and off and wild camp, or stay at one of the many small hotels and guesthouses along the route (see <a href=\"http://inlandsbanan.se/en/travel/eat-do-stay#.V7LgOTYrKrM\">inlandsbanan.se</a> for details). My favourite stops for wild camping are by the lake at Kvarnsj\u00f6 and at the top of the small mountain at K\u00e5bdalis with its far-reaching views. <br>\u2022 <em>An </em><a href=\"http://inlandsbanan.se/en/travel/inlandsbanan-card#.V7LhTDYrKrM\"><em>Inlandsbanan card</em></a><em>, costing SEK 1,995 (\u00a3183, seat reservation \u00a35 per journey) allows unlimited travel for 14 days.

For an island of just 588 sq km the variety of landscapes are breathtaking. At the northern tip of the island, known as the Hammer, the remains of a medieval castle sit above sheer granite cliffs. The most southerly point, Dueodde, has a beautiful beach with white sand so fine it was once used for hourglasses. As it\u2019s an island, nowhere is very far from the sea for a cooling dip on a hot day.</p> <p>In the wooded D\u00f8ndalen valley in the north of the island, Denmark\u2019s longest waterfall tumbles 20 metres into the valley. To the south, 12km-long Ekkodalen was originally called Kodalen (cow valley) but at some point, <em>ek</em> was added and it became Echo Valley. It\u2019s fun trying to find the best spot to send an echo (more information at <a href=\"http://www.ekkodalshuset.dk/\">ekkodalshuset.dk</a>). This is also dinosaur country.

The summer midnight sun, combined with the Gulf Stream and the shelter offered by the mountains results in a relatively mild climate for such a northerly location - and help make this a fantastic area for exploring.</p> <p>The weather is often still good into mid-September, when the autumn colours appear to bring the mountains to life and the northern lights start to light up the clear night skies. Stay in Narvik and explore the coast and up into the mountains, or maybe do the opposite and venture into town only for supplies.</p> <p>Beautiful Skjomenfjord runs south off Ofotfjorden and is framed by steep mountains and peaks. The clear water is perfect for a bracing swim. On its western side, in the shadow of Reintind there are over 80 rock carvings, believed to date from around 5000BC. Although there is no obvious path, the carvings are worth searching out and are remarkably distinct.

Look out for white-tailed fish-eagles and otters and the impressive wreck of the German destroyer Georg Thiele, which was scuttled in the fjord in 1940.</p> <p>For something more technical, Stetind, 80km south-east, is Norway\u2019s national mountain, a steep, smooth granite peak 1,400 metres high. Reaching the summit requires specialist equipment and a guide, but it\u2019s possible to hike as far as the approach (see <a href=\"http://visitstetind.com/en/\">visitstetind.com</a> for routes and local guides). The starting point for the hike is about an hour\u2019s drive along the fjord from Narvik.</p> <p>Long before mines and railways arrived, the nomadic Sami people would spend the summer in settlements along this coast in this area before heading back to Sweden for the winter. Some Sami families now welcome guests for a day tending reindeer or learning birch bark weaving (from \u00a362pp), or a stay in a traditional <em>k\u00e5ta</em> tent (<a href=\"http://njalasoukaadventures.no/\">njalasoukaadventures.no</a>). <a href=\"http://www.visitnarvik.com/no/nyheter\">Visit Narvik</a> (as above) is great for finding budget accommodation ranging from eco-hotels, such as turf-roofed <a href=\"http://www.fjellkysten.com/\">Fjellkysten eco-lodge</a> (doubles from \u00a394 room only, ), to traditional Sami camps such as<a href=\"http://pippirasiida.blogspot.co.uk/\"> Pippira Siida</a> (cabin for two from \u00a333, ).

  "<p>I learned to surf in South Devon when I was 14 years old; I\u2019d catch the train from Exeter down to Exmouth or Dawlish. Since then I\u2019ve built my life around surfing. I now live in <a href=\"http://www.croydesurfclub.com\">Croyde</a>, a five-minute walk from the beach, and I can see the sea from my house. The first thing I do when I get up is check the conditions. I surf every day.</p> <p>The feeling when you step off the land into the sea, into an untamed and wild environment, is beautiful. The speed, the power and the G-force as you do huge sweeping and swooping turns off the top of the wave is about as close as you can get to flying. It\u2019s addictive. And the inside of a barrel, looking out at the world framed by water, is a special place to be.</p> <p>Every wave is different, and there are countless waves out there, all over the world, that I want to ride. I\u2019ve travelled a fair bit to expand my experiences, but the quality of the conditions and the waves in Britain is on a par with countries like Australia or Portugal. Some would argue it takes a special type of person to surf in Britain all year round, but it really isn\u2019t that bad. Wetsuit technology has moved on massively. And I\u2019m really lucky: I can be in the sea in winter, and within five minutes I\u2019m in a hot shower.</p> <p>Every surfer the world over has that broad-shouldered physique, and I\u2019ve been told I have it, too. I spent my formative years paddling on the board, so it means I developed a powerful upper body. Everything I do is geared up to prolong my surfing: I don\u2019t drink, I run every other day and I try to eat healthily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/30/my-workout-coasteering-gary-chilton\">My workout: Gareth Chilton, 25, coasteerer \u2013 \u2018I get a buzz doing scary stuff\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both my sons surf. My eldest (now 15) started surfing at three years old. My youngest is following in his footsteps and surfs more or less every day. I\u2019m 55 and I will still run all the way down to the beach from my house, totally excited about what\u2019s in store. If you look after yourself, age is not an issue.</p> <h2>My weekend workout</h2> <p><strong>Hours surfed a day?</strong> Between one and three<br><strong>Favourite surf spot?</strong> Croyde at low tide<br><strong>Biggest wave?</strong> 15ft, in <a href=\"https://www.simonseeks.com/travel-guides/south-west-france-surfers__113271\">Gu\u00e9thary</a>, south of Biarritz<br><strong>Pre-surf snack?</strong> A banana on my way to the beach<br><strong>Sharks?</strong> Never seen a shark while I\u2019ve been surfing<br></p> <h2>Five ways to get started: surfing<br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> You can start surfing at any age. It\u2019s thought to be a young person\u2019s sport, but that is not true. There\u2019s nothing stopping anyone of any age giving surfing a go.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Using the wrong equipment can be very frustrating. While a small board is manoeuvrable, as a learner you should always start on a longer board, because it is more stable.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> To catch a wave, position yourself behind the white water. Start paddling as the wave approaches and, just before it breaks, pop up to your feet.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Getting from a prone paddling position, lying on your belly, to standing on the board in one smooth motion takes good core strength. But it\u2019s easier in the sea than on dry land, as you can use the momentum of the water to your advantage.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Pretty much every beach in the country has a <a href=\"http://surfinggb.com/\">Surfing GB</a>-recognised surf school. It\u2019s worth signing up for lessons \u2013 you\u2019ll pick up the basics faster, and learning in a group does a lot for your confidence.</p> <h2>Essential kit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa925bc944aa6ad46c472796906562c509efb75b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa925bc944aa6ad46c472796906562c509efb75b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Quiksilver AG47 zipperless wetsuit, \u00a3180, quiksilver.co.uk; Fourth Surfboards Mad Fresh board, \u00a3450, store.magicseaweed.com; Dryrobe advance long-sleeve changing robe, \u00a3130, dryrobe.com\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Quiksilver AG47 zipperless wetsuit, \u00a3180, <a href=\"http://www.quiksilver.co.uk/\">quiksilver.co.uk</a>; Fourth Surfboards Mad Fresh board, \u00a3450, <a href=\"https://store.magicseaweed.com/\">store.magicseaweed.com</a>; Dryrobe advance long-sleeve changing robe, \u00a3130, <a href=\"http://dryrobe.com/\">dryrobe.com</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Do you have a passion for exercise?

A thrilling final in the Caricoa 3 arena saw 25-year-old Muhammad lose to the African champion, Cheick Sallah Junior Cisse of the Ivory Coast, in the final agonising second. He was ahead until Cisse took the last kick of the match, picking up four points to win 6-8. Had that kick not made contact with Muhammad\u2019s head, he\u2019d have won 6-4. He looks absolutely gutted \u2013 as you might expect.</p> <p>It was the Londoner\u2019s second Olympic medal, following the bronze he picked up in London. His performance is vindication for GB Taekwondo, who picked him over his rival, Aaron Cook, four years ago. Cook took the huff and ended up accepting Moldovan citizenship in return for a place on their Olympic squad, only to crash out in the first round on Friday.</p> <p>In the women\u2019s -67kg final the Korean Hyeri Oh won a very close battle with Haby Niare of France, 13-12.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T01:56:09.391Z\">at 2.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b7b782e4b047b85f601d19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T01:52:49.946Z\">2.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Jamaican team \u2013 Powell, Blake, Ashmeade and you-know-who</strong> \u2013 are celebrating on the track.

And you\u2019ll have competition from companies around the world that often buy the goods for resale. On Wednesday, for example, with one day left in the three-day auction period, there were 14 bids-with $5,136 the highest shown-for a lot of 4,000 of those chairs valued at $76,000. (That top bid would mean $1.28 per chair.) </p> <p>Rio is the sixth Olympic Games for which RGS Events, a family-owned company in Melbourne, Australia, has provided and disposed of fixtures, furniture, and equipment, starting with Sydney in 2000. This year it\u2019s partnering with U.S. online liquidator B-Stock Solutions to get rid of some of the goods. </p> <p>The majority of buyers who\u2019ve bid on the site to \u201cBuy a Piece of the Rio 2016 Olympics\u201d have been from the U.S., but sales have also been made to buyers in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, said Howard Rosenberg, B-Stock\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>Many products used for those 17 highly televised days eventually go to party-rental companies, furniture resellers, schools, janitorial companies, and event-planning outfits-plus \u201cscrappy entrepreneurial types\u201d who go out and make a market for the items, said Rosenberg. He said \u201chundreds of 40-foot containers of stuff\u201d have been sold. </p> <p>Paul Ramler, chief executive of RGS Events, said more than 90 percent of the 1.3 million or so items from Rio have been spoken for. Some of the products wind up at other major sporting events. Many from the 2012 London Olympics, for instance, spent 16 months stored in 400 40-foot containers at the port in Grangemouth, Scotland, before being used in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, said Ramler. </p> <p>After Glasgow, some of those products took part in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England. Then, RGS donated more than 2 million British pounds worth of well-traveled sofas, wardrobes, bean bags, and more to needy families in Glasgow. Some of the Rio furniture could be used for other sports events in South America, Ramler said; the company is in talks with the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics. </p> <p>Some products will go to a large Brazilian office furniture retailer, Shopping Matriz. Ideally, some of that inventory would have been used in another event RGS is working on, the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia, but storage for two years cost too much to make that feasible, Ramler added.

The Londoner continued pushing after his opponent in the second, enjoying more success, but still leaving himself worryingly open to accurate counters. </p> <p>As the round progressed, he began to land much cleaner and heavier blows, and Dychko, blowing heavily, began to appear increasingly vulnerable. The judges agreed, making the last round effectively a decider, and Joyce pushed forward hurling big right uppercuts as the Kazakh attempted vainly to cling on. </p> <p>Joyce\u2019s fitness was really beginning to tell, bouncing in to deliver further punishment in sharp contrast to Dychko, whose work was increasingly laboured. A left hand swatted the Kazakh\u2019s chin as Joyce finished things off in dominant style to earn the verdict on all three cards. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b752efe4b0b7e64900138f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:42:11.226Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s Owen Gibson\u2019s story on the Paralympics\u2019 downsizing:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/rio-paralympics-downsized-disappointing-ticket-sales\">Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b751fce4b047b85f601baa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T18:38:52.694Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Joyce is through to the gold medal bout, the judges decide unanimously.

There is plenty of Dr Wu within its 104 pages, including at least 25 photos of the great man, and this undertaking: \u201cAt AIBA, we have taken great steps to ensure that this year\u2019s Olympic boxing competition is as fair, entertaining and inspiring as it possibly can be.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s been entertaining, all right, but not probably as Dr Wu intended.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b7462be4b047b85f601b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-19T17:47:32.468Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There will be three minutes of stoppage time at the end of the women\u2019s football bronze medal match.

Grrrr! Speaking of whom, I am one of three journalists in the press box. </p> <p>Following yesterday\u2019s ranking round, the competitors are having quite an interesting eliminator: last yesterday takes on second last and it\u2019s winner stays on until they get to the yesterday\u2019s top swordswoman. It allows those who did badly yesterday to try to get a few more points. All the events \u2013 the swimming, the fencing, the showjumping (on horses the competitors don\u2019t know) \u2013 lead up the final discipline: running and shooting. Those higher ranked on the leaderboard after the horse-riding gets a head start before embarking on the final test and whoever crosses the finish line first wins.

  "<p>It was a beautiful day for a wedding. After much heartache, the decision had been made that Oliver and I would have a blessing ceremony for our nuptials in France. Altogether, 180 family members and friends had travelled over to celebrate with us. We had asked a family friend, Humphrey \u2013 a retired Anglican bishop \u2013 to officiate. He had created a special service for us. There was no mention of religion; instead, love, happiness and the&#xa0;future.</p> <p>Just before the ceremony was due to start, I was having a quiet moment. I was dressed, makeup done, ready to go. The sun shone through the windows and my best friend and I were having a laugh about something. An usher came in.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s ready,\u201d he said. I got up to go but the look on his face told me something was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s fine. But the groom\u2019s family aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p> <p>I sat back down and waited. An hour passed and there was still no sign of them. I thought about the angst we had all been through to get here. The tears, frustration and arguments. The fact that Oliver was Jewish and I wasn\u2019t had derailed our relationship more than once. But by now, his family had accepted me. Or so I thought.</p> <p>As the sun sank beneath the windows, I thought back to how&#xa0;Oliver and I had got to this&#xa0;point.</p> <p>We met in Sydney, Australia. I knew instantly he was the one. He mentioned he was Jewish. He told me about his mother\u2019s chicken soup and how it was healing. And he told me how every week, his family would gather together for Friday night dinners, but that was it. I didn\u2019t think about it again. And then real life hit. We went back home to London, where we were both on a mission to find jobs. To grow up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He looked at me and said: 'I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s too difficult'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first hint of trouble came a few months later. Oliver had told me that his brother was getting married.</p> <p>\u201cPlease come and be my date,\u201d he said. I was thrilled. We had taken the next step in our relationship. I thought about what to wear and I wondered what his parents would make of me.</p> <p>Then there was no more mention of it. Oliver seemed like he was hiding something from me. He was edgy, reluctant to talk. I put it down to starting a new job. Two weeks until the big day and I wondered whether I should at least book a ticket to Glasgow, where the marriage was taking place. I asked Oliver. He looked&#xa0;at me and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s too difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In hindsight, I should have known he was trying to tell me something on a deeper level and that I should have pushed. But in typical me fashion, I didn\u2019t ask again. I just assumed the worst and waited for the inevitable \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d conversation. But that didn\u2019t happen. The wedding came and went and we grew closer than ever. So close, in fact, that I was forced to ask Oliver outright why I hadn\u2019t yet met his family. After all, he\u2019d spent a lot of time with mine. He looked at me and said three words that would nearly break us both: \u201cYou\u2019re not Jewish.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t reply for a while. A few days, in fact. I was unable to rationalise it and wished that the channels of communication had opened earlier so that it wasn\u2019t such a shock and I could have put it all in context. As it was, although his family hadn\u2019t met me, I took it personally. I felt isolated, hurt, angry and indignant. And it got worse. Much worse.</p> <p>I was eventually to meet his family, not by their choice. Oliver\u2019s nephew was getting circumcised. A brit milah. I had been invited by his brother and sister-in-law, who accepted me with open arms off the bat. Every other member of his close family would also be attending.</p> <p>I arrived at where the circumcision was taking place. I was shocked to find the ladies were separated from the men. Everyone chatted around tea and cake, waiting for the scream that would let us all know that the cutting of the foreskin had taken place. For that hour or so, not a soul spoke to me in that room, asides from Oliver\u2019s sister-in-law, who welcomed me, despite having other things on her mind. With everyone else, I tried. Having foolishly thought I could win everyone over with grace and charm, I made an effort to introduce myself to all the women. It didn\u2019t work. More than one person turned their back on me that day with a look that said: \u201cDon\u2019t try and talk to us again.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver explained their fears to me: \u201cIf they accept you,\u201d he told me, \u201cit\u2019s giving the go-ahead for their children to marry out.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oliver told me his parents were being pressurised not to accept me by other members of his family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year or so later, I met Oliver\u2019s parents for supper. The atmosphere was chilly. But when they realised I wasn\u2019t going anywhere, it led to a Friday night dinner invite. I went. It was a truly lovely evening. Olly\u2019s mother and father both warmed to me and I to them. They explained their traditions. Oliver\u2019s mother blessed the Friday night challah and the candles, moving her hands around the candles. She didn\u2019t seem to notice I thought she was trying to snuff them out, blowing at them frantically in a bid to help. They gave me warming, sweet-tasting chicken soup, roast chicken, freshly baked bread and a delicious pudding.</p> <p>Oliver told me his parents were being pressurised not to accept me by other members of his family, but very slowly, they welcomed me into their home. I thought that was courageous, given their previous stance, and that of&#xa0;their relatives.</p> <p>Soon after, I got a job as a writer in Jordan. It was 2005 and three hotels had just been bombed in Amman, killing nearly 60 people and injuring more than 100. Olly\u2019s parents forbade him to come and visit me, thinking it was too dangerous for him as a Jew, but he booked his ticket. \u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he told his parents. Nobody could stop&#xa0;him.</p> <p>When I came home from Jordan, the huge and painful divide between his family\u2019s feelings towards me continued. Olly\u2019s grandfather pulled me aside on one occasion: \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he hugged me. \u201cThis religious stuff. It\u2019s all a load of crap.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed but then when Oliver proposed, things didn\u2019t seem so funny. I was never the type of person who had dreamed of her wedding. But when it came to organising the big day, no one could agree on how to do it. My father wanted a traditional Christian wedding in a chapel. Olly\u2019s parents were against this idea. There was talk of me converting. I said an outright no. What was meant to be a special day turned into something fraught. There was screaming, hurtful accusations and tears. In the middle of it all were escalating rows between me and Oliver.</p> <p>Eventually, my father made a lovely suggestion \u2013 to have both a priest and a rabbi to conduct the service. He wrote to the chief rabbi to ask him how to deal with this. He got a reply soon after from the his office. It went along the lines of, \u201cYou should understand how very disappointed Oliver\u2019s parents would be.\u201d</p> <p>Although the reply didn\u2019t help us, I knew the rabbi\u2019s office had to uphold their religious ideals. But this was when things really kicked off. Oliver and I reluctantly decided to call off the wedding. It wasn\u2019t going to work. After some time apart, Oliver appeared at my&#xa0;front door.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the same side,\u201d he told me. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd33e782a9d6adad0dec3d4d45c0b6dc53f94f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd33e782a9d6adad0dec3d4d45c0b6dc53f94f1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oli and Rebecca on their wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver and Rebecca on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We discussed everything, alone. He reassured me that none of it mattered, and with or without his family\u2019s blessing, we would grow old together.</p> <p>We finally agreed to remove the stress of the wedding ceremony out of our home town and all its associations, and marry in France.</p> <p>So there I was, a year later, in a beautiful wedding dress, wondering if the groom\u2019s family would turn up. I looked out of the window and saw Oliver. He was walking up and down the front courtyard, looking upset. I sat and wondered how I was going to tell everyone the celebrations were off.</p> <p>Then I saw a large car, driving through the gates. They had arrived. Oliver was stabbing at his watch and holding up his hands towards his parents. I could see someone gesture towards the bus. As far as I could gather, it hadn\u2019t arrived to collect them from their hotel.</p> <p>A couple of hours later than planned, Oliver and I were married. Now my in-laws are the best I could ask for: supportive and kind. They have risen above their fear and accepted me for who I am. Despite a residual awareness that I\u2019m not Jewish, the two constants have been love and loyalty. The rest of Oliver\u2019s family have also, I believe, accepted me and are wonderfully welcoming.</p> <p>My mother-in-law told me recently how much pressure she was under, given how her family was brought up \u2013 as traditional Jews. \u201cBut life has changed,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century now. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p> <p>Olly and I have two sons. If they ever&#xa0;marry, I shall tell them this: people talk about marrying in, marrying out. Don\u2019t listen to them, please. Just this \u2013 marry forward.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rebecca Thornton is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/exclusives.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>The Exclusives</em></a><em>, published by Twenty7, \u00a37.99</em></p>",
  "<p></p> <p>The walking group stop as they see me peering into a net. \u201cCan we ask what you\u2019re doing?\u201d I explain that I\u2019ve heard there were shells in this pond and have come to find out what they are. As we talk, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/11/country-diary-petersfield-stares-dragonflies-mate-pond-territory-chaser\">blue-bodied dragonfly</a> circles over the water.

  "<p>Wesley So is ranked only No3 in the United States but the 22-year-old is poised to triumph in the global four-event $150,000 Grand Tour. So\u2019s first prize in the Sinquefield Cup at St Louis this week has given him the overall Tour lead with only the final event, the London Classic in December, still to come.</p> <p>So was a national hero in his former homeland of the Philippines when he accepted an offer to transfer to the US federation. Transfers are a development of the last few years, recognised by the global body Fide, but only a handful have occurred as they rarely make economic sense given the limited returns from pro chess.</p> <p>The billionaire Rex Sinquefield, the richest man in Missouri, has a mission to make the US the No1 chess nation, as it was in the 1930s before the old Soviet Union overpowered the Americans. Sinquefield supports the St Louis chess club, open daily, fronted by the <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/the-world-s-largest-chess-piece-is-unveiled-in-st/article_4e369334-984c-11e1-b123-0019bb30f31a.html\" title=\"\">world\u2019s largest king piece</a> and containing the national chess Hall of Fame. The Sinquefield Cup, held annually since 2013, offers $75,000 to the winner. As a mark of its exceptional strength, it is one of a handful of top events which Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, has failed to win in two attempts.</p> <p>Next month the US team will be favourites to win the 180-nation Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan, after Sinquefield provided generous transfer fees to persuade Fabiano Caruana to switch from Italy and So to leave the Philippines. Caruana already had dual citizenship and spent his early chess years in the US but So\u2019s change of allegiance was more controversial back in Manila, although he was then a student at Webster University in St Louis.</p> <p>Grand Tour rules are that a player\u2019s three best events count. So had already performed well at the rapid/blitz tournaments in Paris and Brussels, and could still win the overall Tour even if he fails in London. The situation could yet become complicated because Carlsen had announced that he would not play St Louis or London this year because of his world title defence against Russia\u2019s Sergey Karjakin in New York in November. However, he did play in Paris and Brussels as a Tour wildcard and had the best result from the two events combined.</p> <p>Just suppose that Carlsen crushes Karjakin, then decides he would like to play the London Classic after all as a kind of victory lap. The organisers have yet to announce their wildcard, but might have to choose between rejecting either the world champion or Michael Adams, the England No1 who has just won the British Championship at Bournemouth with a record score.</p> <p>So\u2019s winning total at St Louis was 5.5/9, two wins and seven draws in an evenly matched contest where all the games in three of the rounds were halved. Hikaru Nakamura, the US No2, won the brilliancy of the event with a knight sacrifice at d5 which blew open Ding Liren\u2019s king defences.</p> <p>Nakamura began with the Anti-Moscow Gambit, a popular plan to combat the solid Slav Defence and avoid the routine exchange 6 Bxf6. For a pawn, White gets swift development with chances for a fast central break. All is theory until 14 b3, a sideline pioneered by the US woman multi-champion Irina Krush which opens up the game further.</p> <p>Nakamura was ready, and his 16 Qc1!? instead of 16 0-0 prepared the thematic central break 18 d5! This unsettled Ding Liren and provoked the error 18...Qxh4? instead of the more solid Rc8, Nakamura launched his decisive attack by 20 dxc6! when Qxc1? 21 dxc7! wins at least a piece, followed by 22 Nd5!! and Black is lost. Even the better defence 22...f6 23 Rxa6 exd5 24 exd5 Kf7 25 Re6! Qxd5 26 Qc7+ will not stop White\u2019s b7 pawn, which as the game ends costs Black at least a rook.</p> <p><strong>Hikaru Nakamura v Ding Liren</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> d4 d5 <strong>2</strong> c4 c6 <strong>3</strong> Nf3 Nf6 <strong>4</strong> Nc3 e6 <strong>5</strong> Bg5 h6 <strong>6</strong> Bh4!? dxc4 <strong>7</strong> e4 g5 <strong>8</strong> Bg3 b5 <strong>9</strong> Be2 Bb7 <strong>10</strong> h4 g4 <strong>11</strong> Ne5 Nbd7 <strong>12</strong> Nxd7 Qxd7 <strong>13</strong> Be5 Qe7 <strong>14</strong> b3! cxb3 <strong>15</strong> axb3 a6 <strong>16</strong> Qc1!
