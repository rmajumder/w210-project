  "<p>On the banks of Loch Lomond, a battle for cultural supremacy has been joined as intense as the Jacobite skirmishes that sanctified this soil 300 years ago. The largest inland expanse of water in Great Britain has been at the heart of Scottish culture and commerce for thousands of years. At its most northerly it announces the Scottish Highlands, while the most southerly point is barely half an hour\u2019s drive from Glasgow.</p> <p>Now, a southerly stretch of its bonnie banks is in ferment once more. A corridor of parkland bounded by trees near the village of <a href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/balloch-p235111\">Balloch</a> is at the centre of a planning row which has evoked deep feelings about Loch Lomond sparked by a million childhood memories.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.flamingoland.co.uk\">Flamingo Land</a>, a leisure company that owns a theme park in Yorkshire, has been given preferred bidder status to develop 44 acres into a holiday complex. The announcement sparked a furious online response from all over the world. It seemed unthinkable that a portion of Scotland\u2019s history could be given to a firm whose name evokes something from a 1980s George Michael pop video.</p> <p>The company\u2019s prospectus mentions the ubiquitous hotel, lodges and \u201cglamping pods\u201d as well as retail opportunities and adventure activity. They stress that, though they operate a theme park with adventure rides, their plans for Loch Lomond will bear no comparison. \u201cIt will not be a theme park,\u201d a company spokesman said.</p> <p>To date, more than <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/say-no-to-the-proposed-changes-to-our-national-parks\">30,000 signatures have been gathered</a> by 38 Degrees, the petitions website. A cursory glance at the reasons for objection offers an indication of what many people instinctively felt when the development was announced.</p> <p>Curiously though, the <a href=\"http://www.scnp.org.uk\">Scottish Campaign for National Parks</a> which seeks to protect some of Scotland\u2019s wild and open spaces by having national park status conferred upon them is relaxed about the development \u2013 for the moment.</p> <p>James Fraser is a director of the SCNP and is also chair of the influential <a href=\"http://www.lochlomondtrossachs.org.uk\">Friends of Loch Lomond</a>. Few other people know this area as well as he does. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are unfortunate connotations with the name Flamingo Land. If they had been called something like \u2018Forest Trail\u2019 this wouldn\u2019t have elicited anything like the heat. \u201cI completely understand why so many people have been alarmed at what\u2019s being proposed. But I think that many people have reacted without being aware of the history of this site. It comprises three parcels of land which had previously been in industrial use and which had only itself been re-generated recently to create a small park and trees beside the water.\u201d</p> <p>Scottish Enterprise, Scotland\u2019s national economic development agency, which named Flamingo Land as the preferred bidders, has been painted as the villain. Yet it only stepped in to buy the land after a local campaign had prevented it becoming a building site for new houses. The land was always designated for economic development so long as it was in keeping with the surrounding environment.</p> <p>The local community has also been broadly supportive. Residents and retailers in Balloch recently held a meeting to discuss ways of rejuvenating a beautiful but economically fading neighbourhood. The village stands at the end of a corridor of water that links it to the larger loch. The village wants to gain better access to the loch and, if the Flamingo Land plans are approved, it could provide the jobs and attractions that will attract visitors who want to stay in the area for more than just a day.</p> <p>Michael Wright, of Scottish Enterprise, is not duly concerned about what is being proposed and feels that it will provide an economic opportunity in an area that had been neglected. \u201cThis land was always going to be redeveloped. The first stage was the development of <a href=\"http://www.lochlomondshores.com/\">Loch Lomond Shores</a> which had formerly been used as a gravel pit. This is the second stage and, though it will involve the felling of some trees, some of these were felt to have obscured desirable views of the greater loch.\u201d</p> <p>Loch Lomond\u2019s global status does not rest simply on its beauty and the grandeur of the peaks that surround it. When Glasgow was at the height of its industrial powers, factory workers would arrive here by their trainloads to camp, swim and fish. The loch occupies a special place in the affections of urban, working-class families who grew up beguiled by sights and smells never encountered in their normal lives.</p> <p>Fraser is adamant that he and the Friends of Loch Lomond would \u201cstrenuously oppose\u201d any development that was not faithful to the beauty of Loch Lomond or to the memories of generations of Lowland Scottish families. \u201cThis part of Dunbartonshire is an unemployment blackspot and, so long as the development is carried out properly and sensitively, there\u2019s no reason why the local community shouldn\u2019t want to derive some economic benefits from it.\u201d</p> <p>There are others, though, who oppose the idea of any development in an area of such unspoilt beauty. In recent years, popular feeling prevented a windfarm development at Loch Ness and every step of a major housing development in Aviemore is currently being disputed</p> <p>On Thursday morning through driving rain and leaden skies it was still possible once more to behold the unique splendour of this place. The site of the proposed development is several hundred yards back from the loch itself, the views of which are obscured by trees.</p> <p>In the final analysis, Loch Lomond\u2019s worldwide appeal will probably ensure that the development, when it happens, is as pristine, sustainable and sympathetic to the surrounding environment as anything containing \u201cglamping pods\u201d ever could be.</p> <p>A free consultation would tell them that the name Flamingo Land must not be seen in the vicinity of this place.</p> <h2>DEFENDING THE LAND</h2> <p>A controversial windfarm development above Loch Ness by energy company E.ON was scrapped in June, delighting locals at Fort Augustus as well as protesters, who claimed the scheme threatened the area\u2019s fragile ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>In 2015 the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park authority was accused of a \u201ccover-up\u201d over the resignation of one of its leading members for failing to declare shares in a gold mining company. Protesters say the goldmine, near Tyndrum, poses a danger to the surrounding flora and fauna.</strong></p> <p>Plans for quarrying near the New Lanark Unesco world heritage site 30 miles south of Glasgow at the famous Falls of Clyde caused an uproar in 2013. The proposal was ditched by the Scottish government after a petition signed by 10,000 people.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 5 October 2016. The first paragraph originally said Loch Lomond was the largest inland expanse of water in the United Kingdom. It is the largest in Great Britain: Loch Neagh in Northern Ireland is the largest waterway in the UK.</li> </ul>",
  "<p>One of the few advantages of Brexit is that the unfolding debacle may be the trigger for the deep economic, political and constitutional reform that Britain so badly needs. It will only be by living through the searing events ahead that people will become convinced that the indulgent Eurosceptic untruths they have been fed are not only economically disastrous but open the way to forms of racism that most Britons, Leave voters included, instinctively find repellent. Brexit will force home some brutal realities.</p> <p>Leave voters in Sunderland \u2013 61% in favour \u2013 will have woken up on Friday to the news that Renault Nissan, the largest car plant in Europe and a crucial pillar of the local economy, employing 7,000 people, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/jaguar-land-rover-brexit-ralf-speth-eu-british-cars\" title=\"\">deferred all new investment</a> until the details of Brexit are clear. The chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, explained that it was not because the company did not value its Sunderland plant, its most efficient. Rather, as a major exporter to the EU, its profitability depends on the prevailing tariff regime, which promises to change sharply for the worse. \u201cImportant investment decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cwould not be made in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to fault Ghosn\u2019s reasoning. Gaining control of EU immigration is both a matter of personal conviction and a political necessity for Theresa May. But how can that be squared with ongoing membership of the customs union that defines the single market and which requires acceptance of free movement? Concessions can only be minimal without wrecking the EU\u2019s core structures. Moreover, the Tory hard Brexiters, wedded to the notion of a clean break from an EU they detest, are in the political ascendancy.</p> <p>One senior official tells me that a hard Brexit is inevitable: the best that can be hoped for is perhaps some agreement on the movement of skilled people, but beyond that the future is trading on the terms organised by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>If so, Renault Nissan will face up to 10% tariffs on the cars it ships to the EU. Unless the UK government is prepared to compensate it, a bill that could top \u00a3350m a year, it cannot make new investments. The Sunderland economy will be devastated. The same is true for the entire UK car industry. Last Wednesday, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-paris-jaguarlandrover-idUKKCN1201FK\" title=\"\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> made similar remarks: if the position had been more explicit and fairly reported rather than airily dismissed as Project Fear, the wafer-thin 3,800 majority for Leave in Birmingham might have switched their vote.</p> <p>Every part of our economy involved in selling into Europe will be affected both by the rise in tariffs and by the new necessity to guarantee that our products and services meet EU regulatory standards, the so-called passport. This doesn\u2019t only apply to the City where 5,500 UK registered firms turn out to hold the invaluable passport, but to tens of thousand of companies across the economy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain is now one of the most unequal countries in Europe, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Brexiters insist the losses will be more than compensated for by the wave of trade deals now open to be signed, but trade deals take many years to negotiate. More crucially, there is no free-trade world out there; rather, there is a series of painstakingly constructed, reciprocal entries to markets, the biggest of which we are now abandoning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\" title=\"\">Liam Fox is delusional</a>, as former business minister, Anna Soubry, declares, to pretend otherwise.</p> <p>Nor do hard Brexiters confront the fact that alongside China and the US, Britain has accumulated a stunning $1tn-plus stock of foreign direct investment. Nearly 500 multinationals have regional or global headquarters here, more than twice the rest of Europe combined. They are here to take advantage of our ultra pro-business environment \u2013 so much for the Eurosceptic babble about being stifled by Brussels \u2013 and trade freely with the EU. Britain was becoming a combination of New York and California, with a whole continental hinterland in which to trade. Hard Brexit kills all that stone dead and puts phantoms in its place.</p> <p>The years ahead will be ones of economic dislocation and stagnation. But the impact goes well beyond the economic. Hard Brexit legitimises anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant sentiment. When Britain\u2019s flag outside the EU institutions is brought down and Messrs Farage, Davis, Johnson, Redwood, Fox et al delightedly hail the sovereignty and supremacy of Britishness, it could signal a new round of street-baiting of anybody who does not look and sound British: expect more attacks on Poles and Czechs from Essex to Yorkshire.</p> <p>Politicians of right and left are fighting shy of delivering the condemnation this deserves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-rules-out-pledge-cut-immigration\" title=\"\">Rachel Reeves</a>\u2019s remarks at the Labour fringe, warning of a social explosion if immigration were not immediately curbed, show how far the permissible discourse on immigration and race has changed. Britain has moved over the past 50 years from being one of the most equal countries in Europe to the most unequal. The result is rising social tension, with immigration the tinder for enmity and hate. The hard-working immigrants who add so much vitality and energy to our society are blamed for ills that have deeper roots. Brexit has made this harder to say.</p> <p>This conjunction of the economically and socially noxious horrifies not only me but also many Tories. Scotland\u2019s Ruth Davidson, a bevy of ex-ministers, some in the cabinet and a large number of backbenchers are keenly aware of the slippery racist, culturally regressive and economically calamitous course their Brexiter colleagues are set on and are ready to fight for the soul of their party. George Osborne is positioning himself as their leader. It is an impending civil war, mirroring parallel feelings in the country at large.</p> <p>Beyond that, the referendum raised profound constitutional questions. In other democracies, treaty and constitutional changes require at least 60% majorities in either the legislature or in a referendum. Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution offers no such rules: a parliamentary majority confers monarchial power so a referendum can be called without any such framing. Article 50 is to be invoked without a parliamentary vote: a change of government in effect without a general election.</p> <p>In good times, the constitution interests only obsessives. Suddenly, Britain\u2019s constitutional vacuity is part of a deep national crisis. The economic and political structures, along with the biased media, that delivered this are rotten. The question is whether the will \u2013 and political coalitions \u2013 can be built to reform them. If not, Britain is sliding towards nasty, sectarian decline.</p>",
  "<p>He struggled through the frozen wastes of North America in his Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant</em>. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a different role \u2013 taking his powerful new eco-documentary to the White House, in the hope it can help restart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/sep/03/obama-us-china-have-joined-paris-climate-pact-g20-video\" title=\"\">President Obama\u2019s battle against global warming</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s an issue of importance to both men.

Last month he created the world\u2019s largest ecologically protected area when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/hawaii-marine-ocean-conservation-papahanaumokuakea\" title=\"\">expanded Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea</a>, a marine reserve in his native Hawaii, to encompass more than half a million square miles. He also gave \u201cmarine national monument\u201d status to 4,913 sq miles off the New England coast.</p> <p>Two years ago, DiCaprio \u2013 who has raised money for protecting tigers, orangutans and elephants \u2013 was designated a UN messenger of peace, with a special focus on climate change.</p> <p>The White House screening of <em>Before the Flood</em>, which follows DiCaprio as he travels to parts of the world including Greenland, the Pacific islands, Sumatra and industrial regions of China, precedes a global release via National Geographic later this month. DiCaprio and the film\u2019s director, Fisher Stevens, hope to use it in the run-up to next month\u2019s US presidential and Senate elections. They plan to show the film on college campuses and across swing states, including Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/marco-rubio-re-election-florida-senate-seat\" title=\"\">Senator Marco Rubio is up for re-election</a>.</p> <p>\u201cRubio is a climate change denier, and we want to get these deniers out of Congress, to make them understand the Paris [climate] accords are important and that we need to do more,\u201d Stevens said. The film-makers claim 38 US senators accept money from the energy industry, in effect blocking the passage of environmental legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThese people are not necessarily climate deniers. They\u2019re just in the pockets of the energy industry, even though that\u2019s at the expense of all of us,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cAnd [Republican presidential candidate] Donald Trump has said he\u2019s going to try to kill the Paris accords if elected.\u201d</p> <p>Last month DiCaprio told the audience after the film\u2019s world premiere at the Toronto international film festival: \u201cWe cannot afford, at this critical moment in time, to have leaders in office that do not believe in the modern science of climate change.\u201d</p> <p><em>Before the Flood</em>\u2019s release comes as statistics relating to the health of the planet worsen.

It\u2019s a simplistic message but it really is.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the intransigence of US legislators, Obama is using his last months in office to establish his legacy as the most environmentally effective president since Theodore Roosevelt created national parks. In Obama\u2019s reading of the issue, climate change is as much a national security issue as an environmental one.</p> <p>He tells the film-makers: \u201cIn addition to the sadness I\u2019d feel if my kids can never see a glacier the way I did in Alaska, even if you were unsentimental about that, you\u2019ve got to be worried about national security and the capacity of the world order to survive the kinds of strains climate scientists are predicting.\u201d</p> <p>Sixty-one countries, including China and the US, representing about 48% of global emissions, have adopted the Paris accords. Countries representing at least 55% of emissions have to adopt the accords for them to be ratified.</p> <p>The film-makers visit Pope Francis in the Vatican, Obama in Washington, political leaders in the Pacific islands of Vanuatu and Kiribati, climate scientists in Greenland and the Indian conservationist Sunita Narain, who explains to DiCaprio that access to energy is as much an issue as climate change for 300 million Indians.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this to you, as an American, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet,\u201d Narain tells DiCaprio. \u201cWe need to put the issue of lifestyle and consumption at the centre of climate negotiations. \u201d</p> <p>DiCaprio responds that it\u2019s difficult to present to Americans the argument that they need to change their lifestyle. \u201cI would also argue that it\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d he says. If the climate crisis is to be solved, it will be because \u201crenewables will become cheaper the more we invest into them, and that will solve the problem\u201d. But Narain shakes her head.</p> <p>The film-makers have enlisteded Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the pair behind the <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, for the soundtrack. They use Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s triptych <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> \u2013 which made a strong impression on the young DiCaprio \u2013 to frame the progress of humankind\u2019s impact on the planet, from innocence to Bosch\u2019s final panel of darkness and ruin.</p> <p>How far off are we now, they wonder? \u201cWhat haunts me is the last panel, with the planet in ruins, charred and blackened skies,\u201d DiCaprio muses. \u201cIf this was a movie we could write our way out of this mess, but real life isn\u2019t a movie and we can\u2019t pretend we know how this is going to end.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cWhat we can do is control what we do next, how we live our lives, what we consume \u2013 and how we vote, to let our leaders know that we know the truth.\u201d</p> <p>One passage of the documentary takes place during the filming of <em>The Revenant,</em> when director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was forced to move production 9,000 miles from a snow-free Canadian location to Argentina in search of a snowy landscape.</p>",
  "<p>Some years ago, at the beginning of my political career, I campaigned for an end to female genital mutilation and for tougher penalties for those responsible for carrying it out. Little did I ever imagine that I would be in the position, as home secretary, where it would be my job to drive on the government\u2019s efforts to get rid of this brutal practice. It is one of my absolute priorities \u2013 working with the police and other agencies \u2013 to see this government is the one under which there is the first successful prosecution and punishment of a perpetrator of this horrible crime.</p> <p>And let\u2019s be clear about that: it is a crime. The law in this country is not there to be compromised or to be blinkered. FGM, \u201chonour-based violence\u201d, and forced marriage are illegal. They are pernicious forms of abuse of women and we will not shy away from tackling them because of cultural sensitivities.</p> <p>We have made progress. We have introduced measures to protect women and girls. We now have laws such as a new offence of domestic abuse that covers controlling and coercive behaviour. Prosecutions have begun for stalking offences, forced marriage is criminalised and the \u201crevenge pornography\u201d law that came into effect last year should start to bring an end to the humiliation and pain caused when ex-partners share intimate images online.</p> <p>These are some, but by no means all, of the powerful means we have at our disposal to tackle violence against women and girls. From <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/vawg_report_2016/\" title=\"\">Crown Prosecution Service figures</a> last month, it is clear the volume of prosecutions and convictions is at its highest ever level, meaning more victims are seeing justice than ever before. But the reality is that you can\u2019t legislate your way out of everything. Much of the challenge is about stopping vulnerable people becoming victims in the first place. Giving people the voice they need to seek help and supporting them as the scars \u2013 both the ones you can see and the ones you can\u2019t \u2013 begin to heal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We still have much, much more to do to reveal the true scale of hidden vulnerability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We also have to be honest with ourselves and confront some brutal truths about the society we live in and we have to be prepared to have some difficult conversations about some distressing subjects. There are still far, far too many women \u2013 and men \u2013 who are the victims of domestic abuse, who are beaten, who live in fear in their own homes, who are stripped of their sense of self, isolated from friends and family by coercive partners. It is a terrifying and disturbing pattern with which those who have been listening to Helen Titchener\u2019s harrowing storyline in <em>The Archers</em> will be familiar.</p> <p>The toxic wake of scandals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\" title=\"\">Savile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/06/rotherham-child-sexual-abuse-few-victims-identified-nca\" title=\"\">Rotherham</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/ben-emmerson-counsel-child-sexual-abuse-inquiry-sacked-concerns-over-leadership\" title=\"\">independent inquiry into child sexual abuse</a>, has exploded into the public consciousness an awareness of child exploitation and abuse the like of that simply did not exist before. The only way to ever neutralise that toxicity, and give victims and survivors the justice they deserve, is to be utterly unsparing about the failings that led us here and what lessons must be learned.</p> <p>Transparency and public discourse are crucial. We can\u2019t treat issues as taboo because we find them unpleasant. We must lift the shroud of silence and light up the dark corners that allow the perpetrators to operate. That public discourse must also make clear which behaviours are acceptable and which are not. It matters what those in the public eye say. This is something I would urge the shadow chancellor to reflect upon, long and hard. Remarks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/07/john-mcdonnell-assassinate-thatcher-joke\" title=\"\">lynching or assassinating female politicians </a>\u2013 any politicians \u2013 are not jokes. And they are not funny, whoever they are made about.</p> <p>The reality is that there is still too much that goes on behind closed doors and we still have much, much more to do to reveal the true scale of hidden vulnerability. Protecting children at risk of exploitation will always be a priority and at the other end, safeguarding an ageing population brings its own challenges. The nature of drug and alcohol dependency is continually evolving; what remains constant is the need to stop those individuals with some of the most challenging and complex needs slipping through the cracks.</p> <p>We have begun to address the canker of modern slavery, where victims are forced into degrading sex work or backbreaking domestic servitude, and we will continue to lead the global fight to eradicate it, working with our partners abroad.

She stood in Downing Street a few months ago and promised a Britain that works for everyone. She wanted the country to know that this government would tackle the injustices of poverty, race and class. She wanted you to know it is our priority to deliver a fairer, and a safer society for all of its citizens.</p> <p>Our conference, which starts today, is an opportunity for me and my cabinet colleagues to set out how we will do that. For my part, let me be clear: protecting those in society most at risk of harm, those crushed at the bottom of the heap, those who have been abused by the very people who should have looked after them, is, as home secretary, my job, but I also see it is as my moral duty.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</p>",
  "<p>Amid the waves of moral outrage that followed the professional demise of Sam Allardyce, there was very little appreciation of the real reason why he had to be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-leaves-england-manager-role-fa\"> removed from his post as manager of the English national football team</a>. Allardyce may have displayed an unseemly enthusiasm for the financial blandishments of the people purporting to be a football agency firm but greed was not the crucial factor here.</p> <p>A curious reaction to Allardyce\u2019s sacking has been apparent since the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> \u201cstung\u201d him. Those who daily dispense street wisdom on these sorts of things all shook their heads ruefully and shouted \u201cgreed\u201d in a way that made you think they had never been guilty of this, the most commonly practised of the seven deadly sins. Many of them follow clubs that have spent inordinate amounts on unremarkable footballers whose stated goal in life is to make as much money as possible out of the short and brutally unforgiving stretch of their playing careers.</p> <p>Yet it would be wrong also to accuse these mendicant, latterday Merlins of being avaricious in their dealings with the game that has made them rich. Football is still largely a game supported by working-class men and women and it is still largely from these communities that the overwhelming majority of professional footballers will emerge. The young men who have been blessed with the ability to play this game with an extraordinarily high level of skill quickly realise that they have been given one of life\u2019s golden tickets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/celtic-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Celtic end Manchester City\u2019s winning run with thrilling Champions League draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within a short period of being discovered, they will understand that an assortment of sharp-suited Fagins and corporate money-changers has hitched their wagons to \u201cthe People\u2019s Game\u201d for the singular purpose of making money from it. From time to time, global sponsors will appoint brand ambassadors and chirrup some nonsense about supporting football in the community but whatever scraps they throw to the urchins are swamped by the eye-watering profits they extract from their association with the game.</p> <p>They will hear dressing-room tales, handed down through each succeeding generation of footballers, of how good, honest professionals were preyed upon and then cheated out of their money by businessmen who stuck in at school while their victims were getting stuck in at endless youth coaching sessions. Most of them will also know that football clubs seem beholden to nothing that resembles employment law and have all the social responsibility of Victorian mill-owners.</p> <p>Footballers exist to be trained to the point of exhaustion; to be exploited for the few brief years when they shine and thence to be discarded as abruptly as a lame horse. I can\u2019t think of any workers more entitled to grab as much as they can while they are still considered sufficiently fit to do so.</p> <p>Managers are footballers who either survived the system or had the fortitude to recognise early in their careers that, though they might not be good enough to make life-changing quantums of money, they could make a decent living beyond their playing days in coaching. They too know that their job security is on a parallel with that of a diversity consultant in Texas. They will never be more than a few months away from being sacked by the puce-faced scion of the local butcher\u2019s firm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The loyalty of fans to their chosen club eclipses almost all other fealties in the course of our lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, let\u2019s not get all puritanical and censorious about what might have motivated Big Sam to maximise his earnings during what would inevitably have been a short and chaotic stewardship of the world\u2019s favourite underperforming national football team.</p> <p>Yet Allardyce had to go. By expressing his contempt for FA rules on third-party ownership, he was breaking perhaps the last innocent contract that exists between football supporters and the game that we love. The loyalty of fans to their chosen club eclipses almost all other fealties in the course of our lives. As such, we are eternally vulnerable to the predations of big business and the chisellers who follow in their wake. Our lot as fans is to be festooned with overpriced merchandise, swollen ticket prices and huckster airlines that hike air fares whenever a British team is drawn to play in Europe.</p> <p>The supporters, though, accept all this and understand that it will always be a part of the game. We all choose to look the other way in exchange for two things: that the players give everything of themselves on the pitch and that they all belong wholly to the club that purchased them on our behalf and with our money. We have a not unreasonable expectation that wee Alfredo Sivori is not also part-owned by a dodgy consortium concerned in the supply of rocket-launchers to the Assad regime.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/celtic-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Celtic Park last Wednesday night, </a>I watched something extraordinary unfold that was more important than seeing my team go toe to toe with the most expensively assembled squad in the history of British football and emerge unbowed. I observed a communion between supporters and team that helped their exhausted players reach the finishing line and stumble over it. And I saw Manchester City players forget about the millions in their bank accounts, roll up their sleeves in the driving Glasgow rain and respond by playing with the passion and desire of their childhoods.</p> <p>The supporters were rewarded with a game that did not feature any bookings and in which the players of each side did not try to con the referee or induce him to dismiss opponents by feigning injury.</p> <p>Later that same evening, I was invited to discuss the Sam Allardyce affair on STV with Nick Hilton, the <em>Spectator</em> writer. Hilton, at one point, seemed to be suggesting that football fans are largely ignorant of the sophisticated financial arrangements that govern Big Football. He was wrong, for we know full well that wherever money chooses to reside corruption and larceny will follow it.</p> <p>But every once in a while, an encounter like Celtic v Manchester City comes along and we remember again why we love this game.</p>",
  "<p>This was meant to be <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s year. The British version of the magazine turned 100, resulting in, among other celebratory goings-on, an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery, <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/vogue/exhibition.php\">Vogue 100: A Century of Style</a>, telling the story of one of the world\u2019s most influential magazines. But a turn of events, and the social media reaction, threw a stiletto at the brand\u2019s well-manicured public appearance and demonstrated very publicly an insurgency that is under way next to the catwalk.</p> <p>During a round-table discussion about Milan fashion week, editors on <em>Vogue</em>\u2019s American edition gave their views on style bloggers, and it was damning. Questioning the street-style business model of wearing paid-for brand placements, they used descriptors like \u201cdesperate\u201d and said it \u201cherald(ed) the death of style\u201d. In response, style blogger Susie Bubble tweeted: \u201cThe fashion establishment don\u2019t want their circles enlarged and for the ivory tower to remain just that. Towering and impenetrable.\u201d</p> <p>The incident highlighted how the ground beneath the establishment\u2019s feet has shifted this season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/24/burberry-reinvent-retail-from-catwalk-to-checkout-see-now-buy-now\">See-now-buy-now</a> and genderless catwalks have reflected economic and social shifts towards a younger mindset, while Bubble\u2019s point about enlarging circles could equally read as a comment on what\u2019s been happening on the front row (the \u201cFrow\u201d) in this summer\u2019s global fashion shows.</p> <p>Traditionally the place where old Hollywood glamour mixed with fashion journalism, the Frow has shifted its allegiances, actively courting a younger and more social media-savvy crowd. Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s Milan fashion week show was an extreme example of this. It saw the fashion house fly in a range of millennial celebrities, such as Cameron Dallas, Lily-Rose Depp, Lucky Blue Smith and Rafferty Law, to sit in pride of place. The Frow resembled a particularly large group selfie, where mainstream media journalists were relegated to the second row.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the kitschy, high-energy presentation featured street dancers, model Hailey Baldwin and a pre-show soundtrack of Justin Bieber, pointed attempts to capture not just hearts and minds but the smartphone\u2019s lens too. As the show came to a close, exiting fashionistas, such as Anna Wintour, were met by swarms of pre-pubescent girls screaming not for her but for the heart-throbs they follow on Vine or Instagram. It was Beatlemania for Generation Z.</p> <p>Backstage before the show, Stefano Gabbana admitted that the label was trying to appeal to a younger market. \u201cWe looked at the millennials [for inspiration],\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to be young.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal to fashion labels is clear: a Frow full of social media-savvy celebs creates publicity and generates sales. \u201cVloggers, Viners and Instagram celebs almost exist for endorsements,\u201d says Malcolm Mackenzie, editor of <em>We Love Pop</em> magazine. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a day job, like shooting a movie, to get in the way of self-promotion, because self-promotion <em>is</em> their day job.\u201d</p> <p>But arranging the seating plan of the Frow can be a tricky jigsaw to solve. \u201cMy feeling is that it\u2019s always a balance \u2013 you want heavy-hitter celebrities, but the editors are just as vital with huge followings, too,\u201d says Mandi Lennard, fashion PR and consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance, as you don\u2019t want to make an editor feel neglected.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps editors just need to adapt to the times: 2016 has seen the fashion industry focus on young celebrities who fit the Hailey Baldwin template: heritage names with large social media followings. \u201cStars like Dallas have a direct line to millions of fans who avidly watch everything they do, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for business to want in on the action,\u201d says Mackenzie.

Today, standards are much improved. The supermarket, the invention of the 1960s, provides huge choice at relatively cheap prices for consumers who are increasingly pushed for time and money.</p> <p>Now, four companies \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 dominate 75% of the market, although the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering far fewer products, competitive prices and stripped-down shops, are rising fast. While the price at the checkout is attractive, it fails to factor in the hidden cost to our health, the environment, to animal welfare, farming and the countryside. Furthermore, certain aspects of government policy, such as the intensive production of wheat, are exhausting the soil.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children need to know more about what honest food is, and why it matters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The four have enormous power.

  "<p>The singer Katy Perry, a Hillary Clinton supporter, has produced a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSd-3Yc1N3s\" title=\"\">\u201cVoting naked\u201d video</a>, urging people to vote in the US election. Madonna responded with her own \u201cVoting naked\u201d photo on Instagram, showing her bare shoulders, also urging people to back Clinton, saying that women need to support each other. \u201cWomen Run The World now \u2013 they have to get out and start supporting one another. No more misogynist feminists! No more misogony [sic]. Get out and vote,\u201d wrote Madonna, with good intentions, albeit bad spelling.</p> <p>The image was later deleted, along with the one where Madonna had photoshopped Clinton between her legs. (Stay classy, Ms Ciccone!) Both singers\u2019 efforts did the job by causing a media flurry. Were their actions successful in a deeper feminist way? In my view, quite the opposite.</p> <p>It\u2019s obvious what they were trying to do; in fact, Perry says that her whole aim was to be click-bait. In fairness, Perry\u2019s video is ditsy-humorous rather than sexualised. Her breasts and genitals are blanked out with dark, modesty-style strips; her hair is styled as a rat\u2019s nest with lollipops sticking out of it. While it was still up, Madonna\u2019s image merely gave the impression of nudity.</p> <p>They\u2019re not the first to use nudity to raise awareness. (Famously, there was the Peta campaign \u201c<a href=\"http://www.peta.org/videos/id-rather-go-naked-than-wear-fur/\" title=\"\">I\u2019d rather go naked than wear fur</a>\u201d, featuring various supermodels, one of whom, Naomi Campbell, went on to rather let the side down, by, you guessed it, wearing fur.) Moreover, they were doing it for a \u201cgood cause\u201d, not out of a sense of the now-routine monetised, sexualised exhibitionism. (I don\u2019t know about you lot, but, as a heterosexual woman, I\u2019m officially bored with Kim Kardashian\u2019s constant updates on the state of her tits and arse.) Compared with that, it\u2019s pretty cool that Madonna supported Perry supporting Clinton.</p> <p>However, there\u2019s something worrying, something distinctly non-feminist about these \u201cnaked voting\u201d efforts. In that, with the semi-exception of the actor Mark Ruffalo, a fellow Clinton supporter (who\u2019d previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/22/robert-downey-jnr-offers-up-a-naked-mark-ruffalo-to-enocurage-americans-to-vote-video\" title=\"\">jokingly promised to go naked</a> in his next film), there were no prominent males opting for the nudity-equals-attention option.</p> <p>There were no equivalent men running around butt-naked with modesty strips and lollipops stuck in their hair or provocatively leaning their bare shoulders into the camera lens. So why did these incredibly famous, successful women do it?</p> <p>To an extent, where\u2019s the harm? This is an era where revenge porn verges on an epidemic and there have been wretched attempts to shame celebrities with their own stolen explicit images. It\u2019s arguable that by exploiting their own nudity, Madonna and Perry are subverting the global sexualisation of women.</p> <p>The logic here is that there\u2019s a constant scrabble to look at famous women naked, to reduce them and all other women to body parts. Well, these famous women can play this game on their own terms and you\u2019ll listen to their message too.</p> <p>At which point, the argument frays and disintegrates. If a woman feels that the only way she can command attention is by taking her clothes off, then her \u201cmessage\u201d is a scream lost in a&#xa0;hurricane.</p> <p>However good the cause, it doesn\u2019t make up for the core rationale that the quickest, easiest way for a woman to get attention is to disrobe. Men simply don\u2019t feel that they have to behave this way \u2013 they think the quickest, easiest way to get attention is to open their mouths.</p> <p>The fact that both these successful women performed their well-intentioned \u201cethical\u201d striptease on behalf of a female candidate just makes it seem even more skewed and desperate.</p> <p>If, among other things, Clinton is fighting for respect for women beyond their worth (or lack of it) as sexual/post-sexual objects, then I\u2019d wager that the very last thing she needs is for even her supporters to peddle sex.</p> <h2>Foxhunting?

The poll was commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports, which could hardly claim no bias, but the findings are clear enough. There was also huge opposition to hare coursing (91%) and deer hunting (88%).</p> <p>So by a huge majority, the British public would prefer that the hunting ban stay in place. Who\u2019d have thought it? Well, actually, most people would. Common sense dictates that the only people who oppose the hunting ban are the relatively small number who hunt. Normal people are unlikely to say: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t hunt myself, but I still feel very strongly that they should repeal the law banning the practice of live animals being chased and ripped to pieces by hounds, pursued by horse riders in fancy dress costume.\u201d</p> <p>However much the pro-hunt lobby tries to frame this as an issue of personal freedom, most people are quite rightly repulsed by the idea of animals being made to suffer and die for what is&#xa0;effectively just a niche sporting pursuit. In 2016, the vermin control argument is also becoming silly. There are quite a few urban foxes these days. Should we start insisting that competitive cyclists chase them around the streets, followed by packs of braying hounds? Perhaps skateboarders could join in?</p> <p>Polls such as this make a mockery of environment secretary Andrea Leadsom saying that she intends to take a \u201cfresh look\u201d at the foxhunting ban. Here\u2019s your fresh look, Ms Leadsom \u2013 84% against, and not likely to go down much in the near future.</p> <h2>Sooty and Soo: greatest glove story ever told?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ea8d90bb3d8df94cbd4fb5bc5bdef330e68660/248_730_3891_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Corbett with Sooty, Sweep and Soo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FremantleMedia Ltd / Rex Feature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Readers of a delicate disposition, please look away now \u2013 there is news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/13/sooty-bbc-television-harry-corbett\" title=\"\">Sooty</a>-themed sex scandal.

  "<p>Four strawberries, picked an hour earlier, sit on a saucer on the dining-room table of Lindsey Lodge Farm, a 40-acre farm growing fruit and vegetables in Suffolk. It is June and these strawberries are the first of the English season. Andrew Sturgeon, a farmer for 30 years, smiles, certain of the quality. The aroma is heady, the taste is of strawberries as they ought to be, naturally sweet. </p> <p>Sturgeon delivers to 45 stores belonging to the East of England Co-operative, owned by its members. It is independent from the Co-operative Group chain and has more than 200 shops in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Ninety per cent of Sturgeon\u2019s fruit is delivered straight to stores within 36 hours of being picked. They sell at \u00a32.25 a punnet, compared with under \u00a32 elsewhere. \u201cCustomers know what they are buying when they ask for our strawberries,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.eastofengland.coop/food/sourced-locally\">recent YouGov poll</a>, 71% of UK shoppers say that buying local produce is important, yet it makes up only a fraction of the retail efforts of the four major supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s, which <a href=\"http://www.retailthinktank.co.uk/whitepaper/the-future-of-the-grocery-sector-in-the-uk/\">dominate 75% of the market,</a> providing ever cheaper food to more than 25 million households. </p> <p>In Felixstowe, in a supermarket converted from a Victorian railway station, Roger Grosvenor, the East of England Co-op\u2019s joint chief executive, explains how the locally sourced drive began nine years ago. \u201cI was driving past fields of asparagus on a visit to a farmer near Aldeburgh when it hit me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are we importing asparagus from Peru, when it\u2019s all here?\u201d Sourced Locally was born. </p> <p>It still makes up only 6% of sales, but \u00a345m has been ploughed back into the local economy, creating more than 400 jobs. Labels on products show images of real farmers and producers; provenance is detailed. The food is \u201chonest\u201d. Thousands of locally sourced products come from<strong> </strong>more than 100 suppliers, including exotic items: Suffolk chorizo and chilli sauce from Colchester.</p> <p>Sales have risen 15% in the last financial year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have contracts, everything is on a handshake,\u201d Sourced Locally manager Kevin Warden says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Kevin first came to see me,\u201d Sturgeon recalls, \u201che said, \u2018What price do you want for your strawberries?\u2019 Nobody had asked me that in 20 years supplying fruit. Other retailers say, \u201cThis is the price we are prepared to pay and then they announce they want double on a promotion at the end of a season when little is left.\u201d</p> <p>Locally sourced food, like Fair Trade or organic produce, is a small but fast growing market. Its popularity flags up that some consumers want to know more about what they buy and the terms on which those goods are delivered to the shelves of their supermarket \u2013store or farm shop including distance travelled, freshness, animal welfare and pricing. It\u2019s a simple story, but increasingly hard to unearth.</p> <p>The major supermarkets serve 25 million households (and are chafing because their profits have faltered recently as discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive). We customers expect cheap food. But cheap food is often heavily processed, full of sugar and fat that plays its part in the obesity crisis we face; it requires animals permanently indoors, \u201cno grazing\u201d eating grain that produces nutritionally poorer meat; and it means the major chains source their produce from around the world, branding products to keep the memory of the British countryside alive, no matter how many air miles are involved. Cheap food also results in British farmers, bruised by the full force of a competitive global market, being increasingly squeezed by the demands of major suppliers for the perfect product and ever lower prices.</p> <p>At the same time, more and more intensive methods are being devised to extract crops from exhausted soil. These are not the ingredients that ensure sustainable, honest food.</p> <p>\u201cCheaper food is obviously welcome but there has to be a balance,\u201d says Matthew Rymer, who comes from seven generations of Gloucestershire farmers. \u201cWhat\u2019s not currently calculated is the hidden cost of what\u2019s on our plates. Too often, major retailers create the price storms that drown the smaller farmers and leave the others floating on subsidies.

Stinking Bishop cheese and Rutland bitter are among many examples of British food at its best, but they are on offer alongside intensively reared chicken that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-343593/The-chickens-fat-protein.html\">is three times higher in fat, and a third lower in protein</a> and valuable omega-3 fatty acids, than in the 1970s.</p> <p>Brexit adds urgency to finding solutions that work not just for the supermarkets but for our health, the public purse (it costs the NHS \u00a316bn a year to treat obesity-induced diabetes), the environment, consumers, farmers and the countryside. As BFF founder Alexia Robinson says: \u201cThis is a watershed moment for British food. Subsidised and regulated for 40 years by Europe, our farmers will now be competing in a global market place \u2026 we need \u2026 a robust supply of quality domestic food.\u201d So what\u2019s to be done?</p> <p>The \u201cagri-food\u201d sector in the UK was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/526395/foodpocketbook-2015update-26may16.pdf\">worth \u00a3109bn in 2014, employing one in eight of the national workforce</a>. \u201cAgri-food\u201d includes manufacturing, wholesaling, retailing and catering: only 10% comes from farming.</p> <p>In three years, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36764592\">1,000 dairy farms have gone</a>, beaten by cheap milk. The income of pig farmers fell by 46% last year and the income of cereal farmers has declined 24%. British farmers receive 60% of their income from EU Common Agricultural Policy payments given, for instance, for improvements to the environment. The government has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu\">pledged to continue to pay \u00a33bn a year provided under CAP until 2020,</a> but what then?</p> <p>Until the early 1960s the farmer dictated what was on offer, according to the seasons. Now, while some relationships between retailers and suppliers are long and mutually beneficial, more negative examples are not hard to find.</p> <p>One apple farmer says he was encouraged to grow more and more apples, \u201cthen the supermarkets refused to pay what we needed to survive People rightly talk about food waste but we had to destroy apple trees that were five and six years old with plenty of life.\u201d. Another says he supplied green beans to a high-end retailer which were sent more than 100 miles away for packing, ignoring the environmental cost,while a third of the crop would be rejected in the name of perfection, supposedly demanded by the customer but in practice demanded by supermarket buyers.</p> <p>Last year the National Farmers\u2019 Union set up a <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/assets/6105\">Fruit and Veg Pledge</a> to encourage supermarkets to treat growers and packers across the UK equally and fairly. The increasingly powerful discounter <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/staff-blogs/blog-how-we-broke-aldis-fruit-and-veg-pledge/\">Aldi was the first to sign</a>, followed by Lidl and this month <a href=\"http://www.coop.co.uk/corporate/press/press-releases/Food/Co-op-announces-support-of-NFUs-fruit-and-veg-pledge-at-inaugural-farming-conference/\">the Co-op</a> \u2013 and so far that\u2019s it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/20/lidl-makes-fruit-and-veg-pledge-to-back-british-farmers\">Lidl makes 'fruit and veg pledge' to back British farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A survey last year of 1,141 suppliers revealed that 70% had at least one problem under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice with the supermarket chains. <a href=\"https://www.bitterwallet.com/high-street-news/suppliers-too-scared-to-complain-about-supermarkets-86147\">These included such issues as charging for shelf space, short-term contracts and delaying payments</a>. At the same time, the power of the supermarkets, as well as food processors and big agri-business (companies producing grain, chemicals and hi-tech equipment to try to correct the wrongs imposed by intensive farming), is changing the shape of farming.</p> <p>For instance, \u201cbed and breakfast farms\u201d are growing in number \u2013 where a farmer owns the buildings and provides water, straw, machinery etc, and the major producer provides the rest, including livestock, feed and veterinary services. A fee is paid to the farmer for looking after the pig or \u201cfinishing\u201d the cow in its last few weeks.</p> <p>Again, the supermarkets are centralising processing and slaughtering systems on an industrial scale. In recent years 75% of abattoirs have closed, replaced, for instance, by Waitrose\u2019s use of a central slaughterhouse at Dovecote Park, Yorkshire. These are changes that are bound to entail a big increase in animals transported long distances at an environmental cost. The RSPCA believes all animals should be slaughtered close to the point of production to minimise stress (which also affects the quality of meat).</p> <p>All the big supermarkets insisted they had good relations with suppliers and strongly supported British produce. \u201cOur aim is to offer customers great quality and value \u2026 and we are continuing to do this by working well with our partners,\u201d a Sainsbury\u2019s spokesman said. A spokesperson for Aldi said: \u201cUnlike other retailers, once we have agreed terms with suppliers we do not change them midway through the agreement or ask for additional monies to support better positioning of goods or increased shelf space \u2026 Aldi is a privately owned company and therefore not beholden to City shareholders\u2026 We do not need to generate the same gross margin as others in the sector to deliver strong and stable profits.\u201d</p> <p>Supermarket clout is one issue: what is being done to our animals to get fatter livestock, ever quicker, is another. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/grahamharvey\">Graham Harvey</a>, an agricultural adviser to <em>The Archers</em>, and author of <em>Grass-Fed Nation: Getting Back the Food We Deserve</em>, is an advocate of the grass-fed movement. Animals, many of them ruminant, spend their lives \u201cnon-grazing\u201d indoors, fed on grain that would be better used in human diets. Harvey argues that if ruminants returned to grass, instead of grain there would be more than enough food for a global population predicted to reach 8.5 billion by 2030.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"985b174a325cbecf7e4038b13d503159e93b64d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985b174a325cbecf7e4038b13d503159e93b64d8/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outdoor pigs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Only 1.5% of pigs in the UK live outdoors for their entire lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says \u201cpoor science\u201d, \u201ccorporate ruthlessness\u201d and our own lack of interest means that more than half of EU cereals that could provide food for growing populations are fed to animals producing less nutritional meat. This requires intensive crop production, GM crops and chemicals, insecticides, pesticides, plant growth hormones and \u201cagri-tech\u201d to coax exhausted land to produce, all of which leads to water pollution, soil degradation and biodiversity loss. In 2013 the government announced a <a href=\"http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/our-science/2020-wheat\">programme</a> in collaboration with one of the three major global agri-chemical companies, Syngenta, to lift average wheat yield from the current 8 tonnes a hectare to 20 tonnes in two decades. Harvey says: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have such a distorted economy, and agri-business had to pay for the soil degradation and pollution it causes, good food would be cheaper. Supermarkets are not going to change until consumers insist on change. In the meantime, government should be tackling the shareholder power invested in keeping the system that we have.\u201d</p> <p>In June, a respected international thinktank, the <a href=\"http://www.ipes-food.org/\">International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food)</a>, said in a major report that two billion people suffer micronutrient deficiencies because food systems produce an abundance of energy-rich but nutrient-poor crops. Olivier de Schutter, co-chair said, \u201cMany of the problems in food systems are linked specifically to the uniformity at the heart of industrial agriculture and its reliance on chemical fertilisers and pesticides.\u201d</p> <p>In the same month, international researchers from Food Research Collaboration, a body connecting academics to civil society, called on EU states to review its food system. Professor Tim Lang, a senior adviser to FRC, said: <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/expert-flags-opportunity-shape-food-legislation-following-brexit/edibles/article/1402731\">\u201cPolicymakers are either too hesitant or too dazzled by a belief that technology will resolve future food problems. They cannot. Food culture also needs to change.\u201d</a></p> <p>There is no easy way to make that happen. One tool would be to increase transparency in the food chain by making labels count for more \u2013 but that would need customers to read the small print, make choices and pay a little extra. While some logos such as the <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association</a> and <a href=\"http://industry.freedomfood.co.uk/\">RSPCA\u2019s Freedom Foods</a> have higher standards, the largest food assurance scheme in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.redtractor.org.uk/choose-site\">Red Tractor (RT)</a>, is staffed and funded by the industry. The label tells you where the food is farmed, processed and packed \u2013 but is that enough?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/national-farmers-union-nfu-supermarket-sourcing-guide\">NFU shoppers sourcing guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2012 Sainsbury\u2019s dropped the RT label. Asked why, then chief executive Justin King said: \u201cRed Tractor does not tell the customer anything special about the product \u2026 it doesn\u2019t add any value.\u201d Sturgeon in Suffolk disagrees. \u201cRed Tractor has been very effective in raising the standards of both food production and food safety,\u201d he says.</p> <p>RT employs 450 independent inspectors to regulate 50,000 farms. Chief executive David Clarke says very few fail to comply with standards. Asked if consumers should have more precise information on labels, he said: \u201cThat may be true of a small subset of shoppers, but generally [customers] are content to know the country of origin.\u201d</p> <p>If \u201cBritish\u201d is on the label, the implication is that it signals quality and high animal welfare \u2013 but is that always the case? Several months ago <a href=\"http://www.viva.org.uk/\">Viva!, a vegan animal welfare organisation</a>, published a gruelling report into pig farming, the <a href=\"http://www.viva.org.uk/new-big-pig-report\"><em>New Big Pig Report</em></a>. Three pigs are slaughtered every second in the UK. Only 1.5% are organic and live outdoors for their entire lives; 80% of pigs, which are highly intelligent animals, have their tails docked without anaesthetic, the report says. A high percentage of piglets have their teeth clipped so they don\u2019t bite the nipple; 60% of breeding sows give birth in crates in which they cannot turn around, and remain in the crates until the piglets are weaned. All of this is legal.</p> <p>Ninety per cent of British pigs are reared on farms that take part in the RT scheme. In 2015 there were only 35 prosecutions over \u201cwelfare on farms\u201d; the vast majority of the convictions involved animals reared outdoors and visible to the public, according to Viva!.</p> <p>Assurance schemes obviously require decent standards of welfare, clear information, rigour in policing and independence. When standards are poor, the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for investigating complaints on farms and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) looks at food fraud and mislabelling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/defra-hit-by-largest-budget-cuts-of-any-uk-government-department-analysis-shows\">Both are much depleted</a>, another cause for concern about what we are swallowing. Defra is said to be suffering cuts of almost 60% and the FSA is finding \u00a322m in savings.</p> <p>In February, checks on hundreds of samples in West Yorkshire revealed more than a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/fake-food-scandal-revealed-tests-products-mislabelled\">third were not what they claimed to be</a> \u2013 beef mince adulterated with pork, \u201cham\u201d made from poultry. West Yorkshire\u2019s public health analyst said at the time: \u201cWe are routinely finding problems with more than a third of samples, which is disturbing at a time when the budget \u2026 is being cut.\u201d If the odds are increasing that you can\u2019t always believe what you read on the label, how else can credibility be restored to promises of \u201clocal\u201d, \u201cfarm fresh\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d?</p> <p>Matthew Rymer and his business partner, Clifford Freeman, have launched a campaign, <a href=\"http://happerley.com\">#NametheFarm,</a> to encourage consumers to exercise their power and challenge restaurants, butchers and retailers to be transparent about what\u2019s on offer. (Supermarkets have begun using fictional British farm names to brand produce flown in from all over the world.)</p> <p>Rymer and Freeman breed pedigree Gloucester beef, \u201cgrass fed, taken in our transport to a local abattoir all within sight of Gloucester cathedral\u201d. Their new campaign is part of their scheme called <a href=\"http://happerley.com/\">Happerley Passports</a> (the name taken from Apperley, their nearest village) designed to establish traceability across the food chain. \u201cProvenance should not be the preserve of the rich,\u201d Rymer says. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a \u00a33.99 battery chicken, why shouldn\u2019t the customer know its story?\u201d The passport is free to farmers and a small levy is charged to restaurants and retailers. By way of a mobile phone or the Happerley website, it gives the life story of a product \u2013 in beef, for instance, the breed, age when slaughtered, distance travelled to abattoir, farm of origin, and so on.</p> <p>But do consumers really want such granular detail about the ingredient in their casseroles? \u201cBy linking the food on our plates and in packaging back to the farmer we could create the most connected and transparent food industry with huge export potential,\u201d Rymer says. \u201cBrexit gives an opportunity to rewrite the rules. More information for consumers, whether they access it or not, has to mean better scrutiny and improved animal welfare.\u201d It reduces the room for fraud. It also has the potential to put pressure on supermarkets to change some of their methods.</p> <p>The idea of transparency in the food chain to encourage a change in the culture is gaining ground. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.pastureforlife.org/\">Pasture Fed Livestock Association</a>, five years old, has 250 members, mostly farmers, who sell either direct or via butchers and farm shops. Its livestock is reared only on grass in summer and silage in winter, offering meat that \u2013 according to research \u2013 is higher in vitamins E and B and beta-carotene. A shopper scans the QR code on the meat\u2019s label or enters the label\u2019s number on the PFLA website to receive detailed information(Defra, however, defines \u201cpasture fed\u201d as 51% fed on grass, which further confuses consumers.)</p> <p>\u201cWe are not organic,\u201d says Dr John Medley, chair of the PFLA, \u201cBut like the organic sector we raise questions in the minds of consumers about the provenance of their food.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the British Veterinary Association <a href=\"https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/newsroom/news-releases/vets-call-for-clear-animal-welfare-labels-for-uk-consumers/\">called for mandatory animal welfare labels on meat</a> in an attempt to stamp out cruel practices. <a href=\"http://www.labellingmatters.org/\">Labelling Matters</a>, a campaign set up by Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA among others, is calling for labels that discard euphemisms in favour, for instance, of \u201cintensive indoor\u201d for pork from pigs that never go outside and \u201cpermanently housed\u201d for dairy cows that never graze in fields.</p> <p>The Co-op is funding a 12-week pilot with a social enterprise, <a href=\"https://www.provenance.org/\">Provenance</a>, to see how it can increase transparency on labelling \u201cto provide a digital history so every product tells a story\u201d. Catherine Higgs of the Co-op says labelling has clout: \u201cWe are proud to have been the first to label eggs intensively produced, a technically illegal step but which directly led to the law changing to allow eggs to be labelled \u2018From caged hens\u2019.\u201d (Tesco plans to end the sale of eggs from caged hens \u2013 1.4bn eggs a year \u2013 by 2025.)</p> <p>So where do we go from here? In 2001, following the foot-and-mouth disaster, the government commissioned <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100807034701/http:/archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/farming/pdf/PC%20Report2.pdf\">a report on the future of farming</a>. It concluded: \u201cEngland\u2019s farming and food industry is unsustainable in every sense of that term. It is serving nobody well. Farming has become detached from the rest of the economy and the environment \u2026 the key objective from public policy should be to reconnect farming with its market and the rest of the food chain; to reconnect the food chain with the countryside; and reconnect consumers with what they eat and how it is produced.\u201d It\u2019s food for thought that, 15 years on, none of those reconnections have been realised.</p> <p>How we create a more honest food chain is complicated and contradictory. Food is cheap, but still people in this country go hungry. While \u201cethical\u201d food including organic and Fair Trade has steadily increased in popularity, in 2015 it made up only 8.5% of the market. Locally sourced produce and pasture-fed livestock widen consumer choice and offer healthier alternatives, but can\u2019t yet meet the scale of supply supermarket chains demand. So, greater education about what constitutes a healthy diet, the learning beginning at school-age plus good information conveyed on labelling, monitored by bodies independent from industry, are vital \u2013 as is willingness to exercise our consumer muscle.</p> <p>Three men, Andronicos Sideras, Ulrik Nielsen from Denmark and Alex Ostler-Beech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/27/three-men-face-fraud-trial-horsemeat-scandal\">appeared in court</a> in late September accused of arranging beef and horsemeat to be combined and sold as beef in the UK in 2012 in supermarkets including Tesco and Aldi. It shouldn\u2019t take another horsemeat scandal or outbreak of foot-and-mouth \u2013 or report of yet more damage to the environment \u2013 to encourage us to restrain the accelerating power of the major supermarkets and put a proper value on provenance.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 4 October 2016 to remove a reference to Iceland supermarkets.</em><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When David Cameron delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/06/david-cameron-speech-tory-conference\">his first party conference speech as prime minister in October 2010</a>, he mentioned the \u201cbig society\u201d 10 times and Europe hardly at all. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition was still young and he was full of praise for Nick Clegg. The word Brexit was not even in the lexicon, never mind the speech. A compassionate, pragmatic Conservatism was his central theme.</p> <p>Theresa May will open her first Conservative conference as PM in the same Birmingham arena but in a political world transformed. She will lead a session entitled Global Britain: Making a Success of Brexit. She will also announce plans for a great repeal bill that will remove the 1972 European Communities Act from the statute book on the day the UK leaves. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/06/david-davis-single-market-stance-not-government-policy\">David Davis</a>, secretary of state for exiting the European Union, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\">who led the Leave campaign over the summer,</a> will also speak, along with international development secretary Priti Patel, another hardline Brexiter. One MP who campaigned to leave the EU predicted that the two-hour debate would be a \u201cBrexit fest\u201d with much \u201cwhooping and cheering\u201d from the Tory grassroots. Cameron and George Osborne, who fought tooth and nail to stay in the EU, are not expected to show their faces in Birmingham for the entire four days.</p> <p>The stage is therefore clear for May to make her mark, amid competing demands from rival wings of her party for more detail about how she plans to make Britain succeed outside the EU. Will the UK turn its back on the single market completely? Or will it negotiate a halfway house with some access for UK firms, and participation in some form in its rules on free movement of people? Whatever path she chooses, it will be strewn with Brexit mines.</p> <p>In what now seems like political prehistory, Cameron failed completely to shut down Tory arguments over the EU by imploring his MPs to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d. In the end he was pushed by his party and Ukip into pledging an in/out referendum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-downfall-european-tragedy\">that led the UK out of the EU and ended his premiership</a>. Now \u2013 after Brexit \u2013 May is also discovering that prime-ministerial words on Europe often fall on deaf Tory ears. Her attempt to reassure doubters by insisting that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, her vow not to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on negotiations and now her pledge of a great repeal bill to do the inevitable and scrap European Communities Act will not silence the warring party. The vote to leave on 23 June has not ended the Conservative party\u2019s interminable division over Europe, just opened a new, more intense phase of combat between those on the right who want Brexit to be hard, fast and total, others on the pro-EU left who want something soft that keeps involvement in the single market, and middle-way pragmatists who want a solution somewhere in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5265cd52f0b224d55d6fb2cc00bc1cf36f25fd76/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith is among Tory MPs demanding a hard Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before they set off for the Midlands, all sides in the Tory Brexit conflict were calling for more detail from May, as they tugged at her opposing sides.

Senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">article 50</a> of the Lisbon treaty, under which formal divorce talks will take place, is a potential trap. \u201cWe need to be aware that article 50, as intended, could tie us up in knots. Nobody can guarantee that there will be an acceptable agreement at the end of the process anyway. So we must be prepared to leave without any formal agreement if necessary, or the commission has us over a barrel. Leaving without a formal withdrawal agreement would be messy, but a messy Brexit is what many have suggested the commission and much of the EU would like.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister should clarify soonest when she is serving Article 50</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Tice, Leave Means Leave</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These hardline anti-EU Tories have, over the years, become so weary of Brussels extending its powers, and cynical about the UK government\u2019s desire and ability to stop it, that they fear the spoils of referendum victory may still be denied them at the death.

Jonathan Isaby, editor of a new website, <a href=\"http://brexitcentral.com\">Brexit Central</a>, set up by Matthew Elliott, the former chief executive of Vote Leave, said anything less than hard Brexit would be seen by the public as a betrayal. \u201cThe signals from the government are getting ever clearer that we will see a clean Brexit: restoring full sovereignty to Westminster, taking back control of our borders, and giving elected British politicians the power to negotiate our own trade deals around the globe. This clean Brexit is what the British public voted for in such large numbers at the referendum. Any deal that involved membership of the single market \u2013 which is being promoted by some Remain campaigners unwilling to accept the verdict of the British people \u2013 would be akin to a phoney Brexit and totally unacceptable.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Disaster\u2019</h2> <p>But the pro-EU Tory left, backed by serious and powerful pro-European business leaders and groups, will have none of it. They will be in Birmingham making precisely the opposite arguments. They accept that Brexit will happen, but say the UK will face serious economic harm unless it retains maximum access to the single market, even if this means accepting some freedom of movement. Some Tories, such as ex-minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/30/anna-soubry-brands-liam-foxs-free-trade-speech-delusional\">Anna Soubry</a>, say an end to EU free movement would be a disaster for many UK firms, who will no longer be able to staff their operations.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/former-tory-ministers-demand-clear-brexit-plan-theresa-may\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan</a>, who was sacked by May in July, will take up a new role as chair of the pro-European Tory Mainstream group, and warn that a hard Brexit would not only be an act of economic self-harm, but also risk unleashing and legitimising bigotry. In a hard-hitting speech just hours after May\u2019s, Morgan will say: \u201cThere are already those for whom the referendum result is not enough \u2013 they want us to have a hard Brexit which cuts us off from the EU, turns our back on the single market and allows people to say things about their fellow citizens that promote intolerance and bigotry. We should, and we will, ask questions about Brexit. There will be complex negotiations, and it would be wrong to throw away, without question, access to the single market simply because free movement is likely to be part of those negotiations too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28e4ab46c01ad0d8ff8d7734f6507317c4735d39/0_0_4320_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former education secretary Nicky Morgan is calling for flexibility on Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheering her on will be former chancellor Kenneth Clarke and ex-minister Nick Herbert, as well as representatives from UK industry.

Ghosn said his firm would need \u201ccompensation\u201d for tax barriers that might result from Britain leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers, has now added his voice to those asking for a Brexit plan for business to use when looking to the future. \u201cThe current uncertainty is not conducive to attracting manufacturing investment to the UK. The government must do all it can to maintain the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector, which has been hugely successful in boosting exports, creating jobs and generating economic growth in recent years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Look at what happened to the moderate Republicans in America \u2013 they ended up with Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Nicky Morgan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morgan, who has already criticised May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">plans for extending grammar schools</a>, sees a wider danger for the party from Brexit, fearing that it could instil a rightwing intolerant mentality and a desire to vacate the centre ground, which would have disastrous and ugly consequences. \u201cLook at what happened to the moderate mainstream Republicans in America who didn\u2019t defend their views against a Tea Party-led lurch to the right \u2013 eventually they ended up with Donald Trump as candidate,\u201d she will argue.</p> <p>May is working hard to show that her government, rather than being rightwing, hard-edged and Brexit-obsessed, is overall a sensitive and moderate one. On entering Downing Street she made clear that she wanted to govern for all and not just the \u201cprivileged few\u201d. She quickly ditched much of the Cameron and Obsorne agenda, and signalled an end to austerity, angering many of the Cameroons in the process. On Saturday the announcement by work and pension secretary Damian Green that tens of thousands of people claiming the main benefit for long-term sickness will no longer face repeated medical assessments to keep their payments, showed, Green said, that the government was \u201chard-headed not hard-hearted\u201d.</p> <p>At conference, some predict further measures for the less well-off, including a shift toward helping those in the rental sector who the Tories are often accused of ignoring. But hard as May tries to build her own programme, her first conference and her first term as prime minister will inevitably be dominated by the Brexit debate and Brexit divisions.</p> <p>So deep is the Tory divide on the issue, and so small is May\u2019s majority in parliament (17), that many MPs \u2013 across all main parties \u2013 believe she could still, despite her denials so far, call a general election in spring or autumn next year. With Labour on the floor, they argue, she could then win her own mandate for the kind of Brexit she wants and increase the Tory majority to much nearer 100. An Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll on Sunday has put the Tories (on 38%), seven points ahead of Labour (31%). Ukip is on 16% and the Lib Dems and SNP on 5% each.</p> <p>But even more encouragingly for those Tories who would like her to go to the country, more than twice as many members of the public (44%) think May would be the best prime minister than believe the same of Jeremy Corbyn (just 17%). While Brexit divisions will take centre stage in Birmingham, the issue of whether to call a snap election that could give her the power to govern despite them will probably be exercising May more than she will publicly admit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f876f311134f0ab9f5096e3c82905d10ffe4def/1312_755_2999_3085/972.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Clarke\" width=\"972\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay/for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The three groups \u2013 and their aims<br></h2> <p><strong>The hard Brexiters</strong> (Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis, Andrea Leadsom<em>) </em>Leave the single market and give up on a deal under which the EU accepts that British regulations have equal weight. This could lead to extra paperwork for businesses exporting to the EU, but it would see the UK government having free rein to curb free movement and establish trade deals with a host of other countries on its own terms.</p> <p><strong>The soft Brexiters</strong> (Anna Soubry, Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Michael Heseltine<em>) </em>Some see a reluctance within this group to even leave the EU, and it looks like they want another vote on the terms of Brexit once negotiated. If the UK is to leave, however, membership of the single market is seen as key - even if that leads to few restrictions on freedom of movement.</p> <p><strong>In the middle </strong>(Damian Green, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond<em>) </em>Access to the single market, rather than membership, is vital. The UK would not accept EU jurisdiction over standards of goods, but both parties would be willing to recognise as equally valid each other\u2019s regulations on the safety of widgets, for example. It is said that the UK could follow the model of Liechtenstein: access to the market for goods, but with some control of inward migration.</p>",

  "<p>Finding appropriate context or comparison for the behaviour of spectators at a Ryder Cup is not particularly easy.</p> <p>Golf has no team equivalent of similar profile. Chanting or cat-calling does not even approach the territory of football matches. If the sense of tribal atmosphere was removed from the galleries completely, the definition of the Ryder Cup would be damaged. What we have witnessed over two fiercely competitive days at Hazeltine has not reflected the routinely nasty scenario of Brookline in 1999.</p> <p>Nonetheless, so much of what has occurred outside the ropes at this event and therefore been broadcast to a watching world has not proven particularly tasteful. Empty heads and full cans of lager are not a particularly useful combination. PJ Willett\u2019s crazily&#xa0;over-the-top and vitriolic sentiments pre-tournament hardly helped the mood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/oct/01/ryder-cup-2016-usa-lead-5-3-going-into-day-two-foursomes-live\">Ryder Cup 2016: USA lead Europe 6\u00bd-5\u00bd, day two fourballs \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A minority of US golf fans may not be remotely offensive but they are permanently unfunny. Example A: \u201cHey Danny [Willett], I\u2019ve got your brother in a headlock.\u201d Rory McIlroy was subjected to a rendition of \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d when addressing a putt on the 9th green on Friday afternoon. This was a reference to his former fiancee, rather than Northern Ireland\u2019s march to Euro 2016.</p> <p>Golf should not be ashamed of the standards it prides itself on, historical prejudice and common snootiness aside. Any discipline that teaches common decency, sportsmanship and manners has value beyond athleticism. So here lies the Hazeltine issue: the shouting for a ball to enter water hazard or the huge scale of cheering when it does. \u201cGet in the woods\u201d became a Saturday morning favourite.</p> <p>Likewise, the moronic screams for a player to miss a putt before he has hit it should not be deemed acceptable even in a partisan sporting environment. At amateur level, spectators or team members behaving like that would run the risk of either causing players to walk off the course or resorting to physical violence involving a five-iron. Backing one team is fine, openly wishing ill on another not so.</p> <p>This is not a scene reserved for the Ryder Cup. The treatment of Sergio Garc\u00eda at the 2015 Players Championship made headlines when the reality is this player is commonly subjected to abuse that he chooses to keep quiet about.</p> <p>Colin Montgomerie, who suffered more than most on this side of the pond, was critical of the Hazeltine atmosphere on Saturday. Players have had to spend far too much time telling spectators to be quiet. McIlroy, who had earlier pointed to a \u201chostile\u201d environment, even had security remove one after unacceptable abuse on the approach to the 8th tee. One gets the impression Europe would cherish success even more than normal on account of that backdrop.</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday, the House of Representatives standing committee on economics will hold its first hearing on the performance of the big four banks and it is a fair bet that the pay of the executives who appear before the committee will be a topic of discussion.</p> <p>In March, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank was revealed in a joint sitting to have conducted unethical practices so bad that it gave impetus to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-08/comminsure-scandal-cause-for-royal-commission-labor-says/7228136\">the ALP\u2019s call for a royal commission </a>into the banks.

CEO and executive pay is pretty byzantine in its combination of base cash pay and cash and equity awards. If we look at the total accrual pay, Narev only had a 5.4% pay rise \u2013 up $450,000 from $8.31m to $8.77m.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting his pay raise alone would place him in the top 1% of wage earners in Australia.</p> <p>The total base pay rise for all CBA executives was 13.9% \u2013 nearly seven times more than the average Australian worker.</p> <p>And while this might just be dismissed as envy, it highlights \u2013 as <a href=\"https://acsi.org.au/publications-1/research-reports.html\">the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors</a> has found \u2013 that while the base cash pay of CEOs is not rising markedly, they are instead getting large \u201cbonuses,\u201d which are close to automatic.</p> <p>Their report on the CEO pay of the ASX100 companies found that the average and median base pay for CEOs had actually fallen since the global financial crisis. But that was not due to some hairshirt pay cuts. The head of the ACSI, Louise Davidson, instead notes that it is due to \u201cboards taking the opportunity to pay the replacements of departing CEOs less\u201d.</p> <p>She also noted that 2015 had the highest level of bonuses for CEOs in the ASX100 since 2008, concluding that \u201cit\u2019s clear that bonuses are the new normal\u201d.</p> <p>But just what gets a CEO a bonus is less clear. Most would assume it is the share price or profit. But increasingly, \u201cnon-financial\u201d objectives are becoming the determinant.</p> <p>Some of these objectives are measurable \u2013 such as customer satisfaction \u2013 but others are pretty softly defined and weakly measured. Worse, most come under what people would consider to be the CEO\u2019s actual job description.</p> <p>For example, among the short-term incentives for CBA executives are categories such as \u201ctalent and leadership\u201d, \u201csafety\u201d, \u201cdiversity\u201d, \u201cengagement\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d.</p> <p>The CBA annual report noted one measure against these criteria was that the executive group had \u201csuccessfully implemented a global human resource management system across offshore locations\u201d.</p> <p>Well one would hope so, given that would surely be the job of the human resource executives ...</p> <p>Underlying this however is that CEO pay, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/australia-should-compare-ceo-and-average-worker-pay-as-the-us-and-uk-do\">Julie Walker noted this week</a>, has risen so greatly over the past two decades that it now bears no relation to the pay of the average worker.</p> <p>In 2015, the average ASX100 CEO pay of $4.99m was 83 times the average annual earnings of $59,628. The difference is so disparate that comparison has almost become ludicrous \u2013 but it remains worthwhile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/australia-should-compare-ceo-and-average-worker-pay-as-the-us-and-uk-do\">Australia should compare CEO and average worker pay as the US and UK do | Julie Walker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Were public companies required to publish a ratio of their CEO pay to the median pay of workers in their companies, it would provide strong information on growth of executive pay over time.</p> <p>Who knows, it might shame company boards into withholding bonuses \u2013 though perhaps only if shame were included as a non-financial objective.</p> <p>The concern that CEO bonuses would encourage risky behaviour remains an issue.</p> <p>The new governor of the RBA, Dr Philip Lowe, told the House economics committee <a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/committees/commrep/1a89abbb-5826-4eaa-8c4d-a0cc4a3fd1fd/toc_pdf/Standing%20Committee%20on%20Economics_2016_09_22_4447.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22committees/commrep/1a89abbb-5826-4eaa-8c4d-a0cc4a3fd\">last week</a> that he would focus on ensuring \u201cthe remuneration structures within financial institutions promote behaviour that benefits not just the institution but its client\u201d.</p> <p>But the reliance on non-financial objectives highlights that while workers have seen their pay rises diminish because of low inflation and slack economic growth, CEOs have found a way around such financial matters that affect the rest of us. </p>",
  "<p>A group of retired police officers has offered to give damning evidence to any inquiry into the tactics deployed at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/10/orgreave-miners-strike-planned-police-attack-evidence-inquiry\" title=\"\">1984 Orgreave confrontation</a> with striking miners.</p> <p>Henrietta Hill QC, legal counsel for the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC), said that the number of officers who had so far come forward was \u201cin single figures\u201d, but she expected more to follow once the terms of any inquiry were announced. \u201cA range of police officers have come forward through various routes, including to the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission],\u201d she said, \u201cand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-families-27-year-struggle-for-truth-vindicated\" title=\"\">Hillsborough inquiry</a> heard from many, many senior and junior police officers when it was established.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing clamour for the government to offer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/orgreave-inquiry-calls-grow-after-damning-hillsborough-verdict-for-south-yorkshire-police\" title=\"\">establish an open inquiry</a> into the events at Orgreave. On 18 June 1984, about 6,000 police officers \u2013 many wearing riot gear, on horseback or with dogs \u2013 are alleged to have used excessive force in a violent confrontation with pickets at the coking plant in South Yorkshire. It was the start of the Thatcher government\u2019s battle with striking miners \u2013 95 were arrested and prosecuted, but the legal cases collapsed due to a lack of evidence.</p> <p>The IPCC recommended in 2015 that claims of a political conspiracy behind the police measures at Orgreave could only be dealt with by \u201cpublic inquiry or an exercise like the Hillsborough Independent Panel\u201d. It found that there had been manipulation and concealment of evidence in both the criminal trial of arrested miners and subsequent civil litigation.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands, however, that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has now ruled out both a public inquiry and a major independent panel inquiry. It has been reported that Rudd is instead minded to appoint a lawyer this month to carry out a formal review of material, although it is unclear how this process would offer justice to the aggrieved.</p> <p>A delegation from the OTJC met Rudd last month to press for an inquiry. Campaign organiser Barbara Jackson \u2013 who in a show of support went on strike from her job at the National Coal Board for the whole year of the dispute \u2013 said: \u201cWe know we are swimming with sharks. But if the political class wants to disgrace itself again and give us nothing, then there will be a huge uproar.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners claim that cabinet documents only recently made public suggest that a politically motivated operation involving ministers, the police and courts was at the heart of events in 1984.</p> <p>In 1991, \u00a3425,000 was paid in compensation to 39 miners who sued for assault, wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution. But the force admitted no wrongdoing and no officer was ever disciplined.</p> <p>Mike Freeman, a former officer who was at Orgreave, last month claimed that arresting officers at the confrontation were told at the time that they would not write their own statements that day, but instead sign pre-written testimonies.</p> <p>Freeman, who was later a detective superintendent in Manchester\u2019s police standards department, said that he refused to arrest anyone because he realised that it was inappropriate, if not illegal. \u201cAnd no one has come back since I spoke out about this to contradict me,\u201d the retired officer said.</p> <p>Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the decision on Orgreave was a test of the prime minister\u2019s conviction in a government acting for all its citizens. He said: \u201cTheresa May came into office promising to heal divides in our society and, if she is to be true to those words, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/25/mps-write-to-theresa-may-to-demand-inquiry-into-battle-of-orgreave\" title=\"\">must order an inquiry into Orgreave</a> without any further delay.</p> <p>\u201cThis is further new evidence that makes the case for an inquiry overwhelming. It has direct echoes of the Hillsborough cover-up and reinforces the case that there can be no truth about Hillsborough until there is truth about Orgreave.</p> <p>\u201cThere now needs to be urgent progress on this issue and people will be looking to Theresa May\u2019s conference speech this week.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the same police force, using the same tactics just five years before, including falsifying evidence and the statements of officers.\u201d</p>",

The world athletics championships is being held at the London Stadium next year; the NBA have rudimentary plans to increase their output from the now annual game at the O2 in north Greenwich, where the ATP World Tour Finals have made their home since 2009; and the hockey world championships and Euro 2020 finals are coming a little further down the line.</p> <p>Sport held a prominent place when Sadiq Khan launched his riposte to the EU referendum result in July, the heavily marketed London is Open campaign. City Hall\u2019s determination to lure the world\u2019s biggest events to the capital is obvious and the crucial elements are all in situ \u2013 some of the world\u2019s best stadiums and arenas are ready for use, along with suitable transport facilities \u2013 but that is also the case in other European cities.</p> <p>So what else makes London stand out for the world\u2019s biggest sporting organisations?</p> <p>Alistair Kirkwood, the managing director of NFL UK, says they had three main reasons: the sport\u2019s relative success in Britain in the 1980s meant there was already a foundation support; the cultural similarities of America and Britain; and, most notably, the \u201cUK is the second largest sports rights market in the world, so there was a sense that to do well in this market we did not need to be No1 or No2 but the next level below that\u201d.</p> <p>Money is the endgame. Financial experts predict this year\u2019s three NFL fixtures will be worth close to \u00a350m to the local economy, not including the revenue generated by the three \u201chome\u201d franchises, Jacksonville, the LA Rams and Cincinnati.</p> <p>Little wonder Khan says he is committed to bringing an NFL team to London, even if hefty logistical hurdles remain. Aside from convincing one of the 32 franchises to relocate, Kirkwood says visa, immigration and taxation issues would need to be ironed out.</p> <p>If it does come to fruition, the smart money is on the Jaguars making the move. They are run by Shahid Khan, the owner of Championship side Fulham, and in 2012 made a 10-year commitment to playing here once a season, referring to it as a \u201cpart-time residency\u201d.</p> <p>Deloitte estimates full-time occupation in London would be worth more than \u00a3100m to the local economy and previous visits have equated to 15% of Jacksonville\u2019s annual revenue. For a franchise that has eight home games a year, it is a major commitment but the NFL is ready to move on to the next phase. \u201cThe first few years were about testing,\u201d Kirkwood says. \u201cThe next piece is about accelerating and working out what it can become.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor reopened discussions with Major League Baseball during a trip to New York last month about bringing a series involving the New York Mets to the London Stadium in 2018. It seems a case of when rather than if baseball\u2019s biggest league, who have played series in Sydney, enter the British market, so perhaps a more pertinent question would be why they have not already experimented when two of the other big three sports in the US have enjoyed such success.</p> <p>London is alluring beyond the US, too, illustrated by Argentina\u2019s decision to move a home fixture here. Sanzar\u2019s Andy Marinos, who was capped eight times by Wales in 2002-03, says: \u201cIt\u2019s coming off the back of a hugely successful World Cup for southern hemisphere nations,\u201d where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/argentina-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Wallabies defeated Argentina</a> in the semi-final at Twickenham. \u201cI think 2015 made rugby union a truly global sport.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/26/mlb-very-interested-in-playing-regular-season-game-in-london-in-2017\">MLB 'very interested' in playing regular-season game in London in 2017</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are also big expat communities from all the southern hemisphere countries living in the UK. To take a Rugby Championship match is obviously of huge value and significance, especially for Argentina as they continue to grow their brand outside South America.\u201d</p> <p>That sentiment is echoed by the head of the Union Argentina de Rugby, Greg Peters, who says that if the game is a success they \u201cwould certainly look at this again in the future\u201d. Other locations were considered by the UAR but Twickenham was the standout option.</p> <p>Tickets are fairly priced, starting at \u00a320, and more than 50,000 are expected to turn out. That would make it the second-best attended fixture of this year\u2019s tournament, after Australia\u2019s hosting of New Zealand in August drew 65,328 to Sydney. Argentina\u2019s other home game, against South Africa in Salta, was watched by 19,000.</p> <p>There is a novelty factor about a southern hemisphere Test being played above the equator, but rugby is indigenous to Britain, a notable contrast to the US sports entering the market. In theory, that should make the imported games a harder sell but the opposite is true \u2013 especially when it comes to the NBA\u2019s visit to the O2.</p> <p>From Paul McCartney to half the Premier League, courtside becomes an A to Z of celebrity, more about the social event than the game, especially when several have been blowouts. Tickets for January\u2019s meeting between Indiana and Denver will go on sale this month. Prices have not been confirmed but such has been the popularity of recent matches prime tickets were trading on resale sites for more than \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Some members of the British Basketball League are privately miffed by the NBA\u2019s ability to charge exorbitant prices when selling out 18,000 seats at the 0<sub>2</sub> at a time when the average attendance in the domestic professional league is low three figures and government funding totals only \u00a310m.</p> <p>The chagrin is understandable considering a 2014 UK Sport survey indicated it was the second-best participated sport among teenagers, though the NBA have invested in school programmes here.</p> <p>While American football is somewhat different, not least because there is no professional setup in Britain, it is worth noting how Kirkwood describes the relationship between the NFL and domestic amateur teams. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-distant,\u201d he says, taking his time to choose the correct phrase. \u201cI think our role in that should stay narrow. We\u2019re not a governing body, so our role is to make the sport as desirable and exciting as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Yet if their plans to establish a franchise in Britain permanently comes to fruition, a structure to promote home-grown players would be required. Participation has grown 15% in the past year, close to 100 universities have teams and it can now be played in schools. \u201cThe credit for that would be for the volunteers,\u201d Kirkwood says, adding that their influence was indirect by \u201cputting the game in the shop window\u201d.</p> <p>Producing local talent for a London NFL team is a long way off, but in the meantime the city remains, as the mayor has repeated countless times, open for business. \u201cLondon has an outstanding track record in delivering major international sporting events with our world-class sporting venues and thousands of enthusiastic fans,\u201d Khan says, though it would be injudicious to suggest the endgame for now is anything more than money.</p>",
  "<p>Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, says the world has reached a \u201cturning point\u201d over Syria. The Russians, who refuse to halt their relentless bombing of Aleppo, say the <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/361020-us-politics-reality-show/\">Obama administration is \u201chysterical\u201d </a>and blaming Moscow for its own failures. The UN, lost for words, believes Syria has become a \u201cslaughterhouse\u201d. Stephen O\u2019Brien, a senior official, warns despairingly that Aleppo is \u201cdescending into the pitiless and merciless abyss of a humanitarian catastrophe\u201d. So what is to be done?</p> <p>The short answer is that nobody seems to know \u2013 or, at least, how to do it. This crisis has been unfolding for five long years. Repeated attempts to set a viable peace process in train have failed. Ceasefires have come and gone, always temporary, always broken by one party or another within days or even hours. The latest truce collapsed last week amid a welter of mutual recriminations.</p> <p>The US now says it is examining \u201cnon-diplomatic\u201d options, possibly new sanctions against the Russian and Syrian governments and individuals deemed responsible for using bunker-buster and incendiary bombs in Aleppo. There are dark mutterings about US airstrikes on Syrian military targets. The latter course could bring US and Russian forces into direct confrontation. It would be the sort of serious escalation that Barack Obama has studiously avoided until now, even when his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/06/president-obama-and-the-red-line-on-syrias-chemical-weapons/\">\u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons was crossed in 2013</a>.</p> <p>Yet this crisis is now about far more than the people of Aleppo, or Syria or even US-Russian relations. The war has destabilised neighbouring countries such as Turkey. It has sparked an unprecedented movement of refugees and economic migrants across Europe\u2019s borders. It has fuelled the rise of jihadi terrorism. It has distracted attention and resources from troublespots such as Yemen. Most significantly, perhaps, in terms of long-term damage, it has dramatically exposed the inherent weakness of the UN system and the growing disrespect shown by states for international law.</p> <p>Russia is the worst offender. It has been warned repeatedly, most recently by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, that its airstrikes in and around Aleppo and elsewhere against civilian targets, hospitals and schools, may constitute war crimes. The charge sheet includes the destruction of a UN-organised aid convoy in northern Aleppo last month that killed about 20 people. Russian and Syrian <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/suspends-syria-aid-convoy-bombed-160920080213025.html\">denials of responsibility</a> are widely disbelieved.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was another egregious breach of international law, the sort of blatant land grab that most people believed belonged to the bad old days of 1930s Europe. Russia\u2019s complicity, also implausibly denied, in the shooting down of a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/malaysia-air-flight-mh17-russia-ukraine-missile.html\">Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine two years ago</a>, killing nearly 300 people, was an unforgivable outrage against international rules, not to mention common decency. Russia\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare, notably the recent hacking of the Democratic party and online electoral systems in the US, is another aspect of its serial disregard for international norms. Russia appears only too willing to manipulate the UN security council, despite its responsibilities as a permanent member. This risks a fundamental erosion of the UN Charter, which set as an objective the \u201cestablishment [of] conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained\u201d. Yet such cynicism is not limited to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.</p> <p>Earlier this year, China, another permanent member of the security council, flatly rejected the ruling of the UN-backed permanent court of arbitration in The Hague that its island building and wider maritime claims in the South China Sea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/philippines-wins-south-china-sea-case-against-china\">have no legal basis</a>. Beijing said simply that the decision did not apply, for no better reason than it did not fit its strategic objectives. China has also made clear, following North Korea\u2019s recent, illegal nuclear test, that it reserves the right to block attempts at the UN to impose further sanctions if it does not like them, thereby further undermining attempts to rein in the rogue regime in Pyongyang. Recent joint naval exercises in the South China Sea suggest Russia and China are grimly intent on backing up each other\u2019s bad behaviour.</p> <p>Disrespect for the UN and its institutions is a spreading problem, as seen by the apparent impunity enjoyed by those who attack or hinder its peacekeepers, aid workers and organisations. The too frequent inability of the UN to defend itself and those under its care was exemplified last July in Juba in South Sudan, when aid workers were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/15/south-sudan-aid-worker-rape-attack-united-nations-un\"> brutally assaulted by army troops</a>. In countries such as Sudan, the failing reach of international law is seen in President Omar al-Bashir\u2019s continuing defiance of warrants for his arrest on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>The International Criminal Court, which issued the warrants, is not a UN agency. But it is a key legal arm of the international system whose authority is regularly flouted by states that, even though they ratified the founding 2002 Treaty of Rome, do not respect its obligations. This tendency towards impunity is further encouraged by the US and other major countries that are not parties to the treaty even though they support ICC actions. This is the same double standard that allows Washington to complain about the flouting of international law in Syria and Ukraine while ignoring the damaging precedent set in 2003 when the Bush administration invaded Iraq without explicit UN legal authority.</p> <p>The suffering in Aleppo is dreadful. As we have said many times, the combatants must pull back and cease fire, as a prelude to resumed diplomatic efforts. But we must also be clear that, increasingly, long-term structural damage is not confined to Syria. Lawless behaviour by powerful state actors is corroding the crucial institutions created in 1945 to prevent another global conflagration. By allowing international law to be repeatedly flouted, we risk an even greater catastrophe.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today. This article was amended on 2 October 2016. In an earlier version, we said Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons was crossed in 2103. We of course meant 2013.</p>",

  "<p>For chancellors of the exchequer, annual International Monetary Fund meetings have not always been the happiest of occasions. Heading there in early October 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/08/economy.gordonbrown\" title=\"\">Alistair Darling knew that the solvency of the UK banking system was hanging by a thread</a>. In 1992, Norman Lamont went to Washington with his economic strategy in tatters after Britain\u2019s departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. In 1976, on his way to Manila, Denis Healey only managed to get as far as London\u2019s Heathrow airport, such was the intensity of the sterling crisis. On that occasion, the chancellor did not need to go to the IMF: the IMF came to him.</p> <p>Compared with some of his predecessors, Philip Hammond has got off lightly.

These fears have so far proved unfounded. The UK appears unlikely to plunge into the immediate recession confidently predicted by the IMF. House prices are not collapsing and there has been no stock-market crash. The impact on the rest of the global economy has so far been minimal.</p> <p>Yet it is safe to say that finance ministers and central bank governors are unlikely to be in celebratory mood when they jet in to Washington later this week.

Hammond is keen to talk up the prospects for the UK economy and will expect Lagarde to be less pessimistic than she was during the referendum campaign. The IMF can be expected to focus on other worries \u2013 and it has plenty of choice.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s global financial stability report is likely to highlight the problems of European banks hobbled by hundreds of billions of euros\u2019 worth of non-performing loans.

The new normal has become what Lagarde describes as the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d \u2013 in which growth remains stuck at barely more than 3% a year, thanks largely to the persistently poor performance of the developed nations: the US, Europe and Japan.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today, especially for advanced economies,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2016/09/27/am16-sp09282016-boosting-growth-adjusting-to-change\" title=\"\">she said in a speech last week</a>. \u201cAnd while there are some good signs, the overall growth outlook still remains subdued.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s concerns about Brexit stem, in part, from the knowledge that it would not take much for mediocre growth and low levels of inflation to turn into recession and deflation.</p> <h2><strong>Central banks are out of ammo</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Yellen federal reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global growth has been weak despite the best efforts of central banks.

But other central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013are moving in the opposite direction and providing additional stimulus.</p> <p>Lagarde has maintained a neutral position on a rise in US interest rates, but is known to fear the volatility a rate rise could bring \u2013 as money held in developing world banks, and even in London and Frankfurt, flows to the US in search of a safe return at a higher rate. She also thinks central banks are being asked to do too much, and that achieving higher levels of growth will require a three-pronged approach: monetary stimulus, tax cuts or spending increases from finance ministries, and structural reform.</p> <p>The IMF has urged countries which have the financial headroom to do so to spend money on growth-boosting public investment. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/09/27/AM16-SP09282016-Boosting-Growth-Adjusting-to-Change\" title=\"\">In a recent speech</a>, Lagarde singled out Canada, Germany and South Korea as ones with plenty of spare cash.

The concern of both organisations is not just that there has been a gradual rise over the past four years in the number of protectionist measures introduced, but that there is a risk of an anti-trade narrative taking root, which says all the gains from openness are being captured by a tiny global elite.</p> <p>Lagarde says this mood is encouraged by growing inequality, and that tackling the divide between rich and poor would make it easier to negotiate trade deals and for governments to push for other structural reforms.</p> <h2><strong>A new debt crisis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1/0_120_2420_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in Luanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angola is one of the countries that has asked the IMF and World Bank for help as growth and commodity prices fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past decade, the activities of the IMF have overshadowed those of its sister organisation, the World Bank, which also holds its annual meeting this week.

  "<p>The day before steelworker Sam Thomas was due to sign the mortgage on his new house last year, Tata Steel announced that it wanted to offload its Scunthorpe steelworks amid mounting losses. \u201cI nearly pulled out of buying the house,\u201d he says. \u201cBut luckily it has paid off.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas, 29, now runs one of the four blast furnaces at the Scunthorpe steelworks. The site was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/01/tata-steel-sale-to-greybull-saving-jobs-and-bringing-back-british-steel\">saved by a rescue deal in June led by Greybull, the family investment firm</a>. It is now known as British Steel after the brand was bought from Tata Steel as part of the deal for Scunthorpe.</p> <p>Thomas\u2019s story highlights the devastating personal effect the closure of the steelworks would have had. Employing more than 4,000 people, making it the largest private employer in the area, the site looms large in the Lincolnshire town, and its scale takes the breath away. The perimeter of the steelworks measures more than 15 miles and the site covers 2,000 acres \u2013 a similar size to Scunthorpe itself. Inside there are more than 100 miles of railway line and 40 miles of road, but the site is dominated by the four blast furnaces and two cooling towers.</p> <p>The blast furnaces are named after British queens: Elizabeth I \u2013 or Bess as the workers call it \u2013 Anne, Victoria and Mary. In a sign of the pressure still on the industry, only Anne and Victoria are operational at present, but it is clear the steelworkers take great pride in what they do.</p> <p>\u201cI love it. It\u2019s a fantastic place. No two days are the same,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI am proud to say I work at the steelworks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"895a4418667cf0fb705cf15911ae706ed37d86f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/895a4418667cf0fb705cf15911ae706ed37d86f3/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molten steel pours from one of the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molten steel pours from one of the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas, who has been on the staff here since he was 18, wants the Scunthorpe plant to become a beacon for the global industry in terms of quality and efficiency. \u201cI want us to be the benchmark,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is my personal drive, where I would like to get to.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/29/revived-british-steel-back-in-profit-100-days-after-tata-sale-says-boss\">British Steel revealed last week that the steelworks is back in profit</a> just 100 days after it was bought from Tata. Roland Junck, the executive chairman, said the former owners had \u201clost interest\u201d in the plan. The new company has focused on cutting costs \u2013 workers took a 3% pay cut; rebuilding its relationship with customers, which include Network Rail, Toyota, and Transport for London; and trying to become more specialised in the type of steel it produces.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been some dark times,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIt does grind you down and you start to worry about your job and what the future might hold. It was pretty obvious that we were not part of its [Tata Steel\u2019s] model going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas said returning to the British Steel name was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d. The name disappeared in 1999 when British Steel merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. Corus was bought by Tata in 2007 for \u00a36.2bn.</p> <p>Workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales will look longingly at the new optimism evident in Scunthorpe. Port Talbot is the only other steelworks in Britain with a blast furnace \u2013 which means it can make steel from raw materials \u2013 and the site dominates the small Welsh town even more than its Lincolnshire counterpart does. However, its future remains shrouded in uncertainty as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/tata-steel-uk-rescue-deal-pension-protection-fund\">Tata Steel considers whether to keep it, close it, or sell it off</a> .</p> <p>Paul McBean, chair of the Scunthorpe steelworks trade unions, said workers in Lincolnshire had gone through \u201c14 months of sheer hell\u201d until the rescue deal with Greybull was agreed. \u201cWhen I go into town I get patted on the back for the work I put in, which is nice,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>However, British Steel still has a lot of work to do to deliver sustainable profits. The company wants the government to offer financial support by lowering business rates, controlling energy costs, stopping the dumping of cheap steel imports from China and offering contracts to British Steel on public projects.</p> <p>McBean says politicians visit the steelworks then go back to London and forget about it: \u201cSomeone, someday is eventually going to have to give in and deliver.\u201d</p> <p>There are also concerns about Greybull after other businesses it controls running into trouble. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/21/my-local-convenience-store-chain-verge-collapse\">My Local, the convenience store business, collapsed this summer</a> while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/monarch-airlines-denies-rumours-of-financial-trouble\">future of Monarch, the low-cost airline, is also in doubt.</a></p> <p>McBean says they have the support of workers in Scunthorpe. \u201cDo I still have faith in our investors? Yes I do.\u201d</p> <p>While there may be doubts about Greybull, at least the Scunthorpe steelworks can now look to the future.</p>",

They partnered with the transgender advocacy groups <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/pressure-builds-in-north-carolina-as-more-executives-from-major-companies-c?xid=nl_raceahead\">Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to sign a widely shared letter </a>stating that laws like HB2 \u201care bad for our employees and bad for business\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unusual for companies to take a stance on controversial social issues.

The same can\u2019t be said for other divisive issues such as the right to vote and abortion. Since when have so many companies been such vocal supporters of transgender rights? How did the private sector become so activist?</p> <p>Deena Fidas, director of the <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/workplace-project-internship\">workplace equality program at the Human Rights Campaign</a>, said the transgender issue is benefiting from a long held recognition by businesses that protecting their gay, lesbian and bisexual employees from discrimination directly affects their ability to attract talent and make money.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying it was both the right thing to do, and also it was the right thing for their businesses,\u201d said Fidas, who called 2011 \u201cthe tipping point\u201d in terms of companies getting vocal in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.</p> <p>But behind closed doors, the Fortune 500 actually has a track record of working with LGBT rights groups. During the 1990s and 2000s, before <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\">the tide of public opinion had fully turned in favor of same-sex marriage rights</a>, LGBT employees began forming working groups at their companies to seek same-sex partner benefits, diversity training programs and LGBT anti-discrimination policies at their offices. After a while, companies realized that if they wanted to attract and retain the best employees, they\u2019d better step up.</p> <p>\u201cFor businesses, matters of LGBT inclusion are very tied to their business goals,\u201d said Fidas. \u201cWe have been working with businesses going on two decades.\u201d</p> <p>Still, taking a public stand on LGBT rights didn\u2019t happen quickly. Less than five companies spoke out publicly in opposition of California\u2019s Proposition 8, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/prop-8-california-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down\">a 2008 ballot amendment that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman</a>, which was eventually overturned.</p> <p>But by 2011, when New York state was considering same-sex marriage, the leaders of more than two dozen major companies <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/gay-marriage-gets-backing-from-new-york-business-leaders.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, supported the state\u2019s proposed Marriage Equality Act</a>.</p> <p>North Carolina became ground zero for the transgender bathroom debate because it was the first state to pass the law in March of this year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-north-carolina-obama\">Other states </a>that have considered similar legislation within the last few years included Florida, Texas and Minnesota. North Carolina\u2019s law also bars local authorities from floating any anti-discrimination protections for LGBT residents, which US Attorney General Loretta Lynch denounced as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/10/us-justice-department-sues-north-carolina-over-transgender-law-video\">state-sponsored discrimination</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Fidas is director of HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (CEI), an annual survey of more than 1,200 major companies that launched back in 2002 in order to catalogue what kinds of employment benefits and workplace inclusion policies were available for LGBT workers. Not only do the majority of the companies polled by CEI now offer same-sex partner benefits to employees, but more than 500 companies now offer at least one health care plan that includes appropriate coverage for transgender employees, <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/hrc-releases-first-corporate-equality-index-to-rate-global-lgbt-workplace-i\">according to the 2016 CEI survey.</a> And 75% of Fortune 500 companies have anti-discrimination policies that include gender identity, up from just 3% in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/05/transgender-fear-workplace-business\">Transgender: is there still fear in the workplace?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you look at the advancement of the rights in Fortune 500 companies compared to [LGBT] rights in the states, Fortune 500 companies were way more progressive than the states or any of the governments were,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/king_brayden.aspx\">Brayden King, a management and organizations professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Business</a>.</p> <p>King, whose research focuses on the way activists influence corporate social responsibility and legislation, says that executives are increasingly taking stronger public stances on issues such as climate change and LGBT rights.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness leaders are standing up and recognizing that they have to fill the void that\u2019s being left in many places and many states by state policymakers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those companies and executives feel morally that it\u2019s bad for our culture to discriminate.

Rather, it\u2019s about reputation. \u201cCompanies care so much about reputation because it\u2019s really hard to put a dollar value on how people perceive you. We do know that if people perceive you badly, it can take years and years and years [to dispel that].\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, in the case of North Carolina and HB2, King says: \u201cPeople will remember North Carolina for years after this has settled down as the state that has been associated with this controversy. They could change tomorrow, but people will still associate it with this discriminatory action it decided to take.\u201d</p> <p>He added, \u201cThe boycott becomes a permanent part of that state\u2019s narrative history, and that is fundamental to the reputation that that state has.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/03/chick-fil-a-kiss-in\">same-sex couples and supporters staged \u201ckiss-ins\u201d outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country </a>in protest of the company\u2019s vocalized opposition to gay marriage, Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy expressed some regrets.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers want to do business with brands that they can interface with, that they can relate with,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cathy-seeks-to-put-gay-marriage-flap-behind-chick-/nfCHj/\">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2014</a>. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably very wise from our standpoint to make sure that we present our brand in a compelling way that the consumer can relate to.\u201d</p>",

It was supported by the American Indian Movement of Central Texas (AIMCTX), whose members have demonstrated against the Dakota pipeline outside the Dallas headquarters of Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind both schemes. </p> <p>The Standing Rock Sioux tribe fears that the Dakota pipeline could damage their water supply. \u201cThis has really opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes \u2013 pipelines everywhere \u2013 and has brought to life the number of pipelines that are bursting or leaking throughout the United States,\u201d said Blue Horse, of the AIMCTX.</p> <p>\u201cMy opinion is this \u2013 I think Kelcy Warren figures that my people, Native American people, are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to being a voice or being recognised at anything,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Warren is the billionaire CEO of Energy Transfer and he has amassed wealth and power as the mastermind of a vast pipeline network. According to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-12/billionaire-kelcy-warren-sees-mind-boggling-growth-in-texas\">Bloomberg</a>: \u201cLong considered a visionary in the energy infrastructure space, Warren made deals during the shale boom to piece together a 71,000-mile (114,239km) oil-and-gas superhighway that spans the country.\u201d</p> <p>His political networking is also impressive. The 60-year-old was a major donor to the election campaign of Texas governor Greg Abbott. Last year, Abbott appointed Warren to a seat on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, the board of a state department whose <a href=\"http://tpwd.texas.gov/about/mission-philosophy\">mission</a> is \u201cto manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas\u201d.</p> <p>For the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, which is expected to be finished next year, Energy Transfer linked up with a company controlled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/06/carlos-slim-biography-diego-enrique-osorno-interviews\">Carlos Slim</a>, Mexico\u2019s richest man.</p> <p>On paper, perhaps, it did not seem likely to cause a fuss: relatively small and going through a sparsely populated area known as the Big Bend. Its proponents argue that it brings jobs and will reduce Mexico\u2019s dependence on coal.</p> <p>But it slices through a region of natural beauty beloved by its residents precisely because it was untouched by the large-scale oil and gas developments that dominate much of a state with about <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/pipeline-safety/\">432,000 miles</a> of pipeline.</p> <p>And, critics charge, there is no real national benefit, since the gas is headed for Mexico, to take advantage of recent energy industry reforms there.</p> <p>As well as environmental and economic concerns, the fight against the Trans-Pecos pipeline also spotlighted Texas\u2019s oil and gas industry regulations \u2013 or rather, the lack of them. Until recently, companies were able to assert their pipelines were for the public good simply by checking a box on a one-page form filed with the relevant state agency, the railroad commission. In essence, the commission registers new pipelines without judging whether they are needed or whether the route is appropriate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/10/texas-big-bend-natural-gas-pipeline-residents\">Texas pipeline plans rouse protest and pride from residents of lush Big Bend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once they have \u201ccommon carrier\u201d status, the company can use the power of \u201ceminent domain\u201d to route through private property over the objections of landowners, who have to resort to court action if they cannot come to an agreement with the company.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sick of being pushed around,\u201d said Glover, one of the organisers of Friday\u2019s march. \u201cOur community rights, our individual rights, our property rights, our environmental rights, are all very important and we need to live in a country that values those things.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a map of the United States and all the pipelines, it\u2019s crazy. Pipelines cover our country and they\u2019re just making more and more and it\u2019s at a frantic pace. And I don\u2019t think that they can do that safely, to be in such a rush to get all the natural resources out and then do that in a way that guarantees the safety of the community and the environment. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p> <p>Putting the brakes on the energy industry is a tall order in a Republican-dominated state whose politicians are relentlessly supportive of oil and gas concerns. When Denton, near Dallas, outlawed fracking inside city limits, state lawmakers responded last year by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/17/texas-denton-fracking-ban-repeal\">banning the ban</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe deck was stacked against us from the start. We really didn\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d said Keller, a local archaeologist and member of the Big Bend Conservation Alliance. \u201cI think it\u2019s just capitalism gone wild; I\u2019m not a socialist at all.\u201d</p> <p>He lamented that rather than modifying the route by 50 or 100 metres, the diggers \u201cploughed right through\u201d what he described as a \u201cvery significant\u201d historical site that is between 5,000 and 12,000 years old and could contain notable Native American artefacts - Trap Spring, which he described as now looking like a home without a kitchen. </p> <p>An Energy Transfer spokeswoman denied the allegation and said: \u201cWe adjusted the route so that this site is not within the boundaries of our right-of-way for this project. There are no archeological sites within the pipeline right-of-way along the entire route.\u201d </p> <p>She added that the pipeline \u201cwill meet or exceed where possible all state and federal safety standards\u201d.</p> <p>Activists worry that the Trans-Pecos pipeline will be the first of many. \u201cIt\u2019s the camel\u2019s nose under the tent. It\u2019s basically the first of a much larger set of enabling infrastructure that will allow the industrialisation of this region,\u201d said another Alliance member, Coyne Gibson.</p> <p>Last year a company <a href=\"http://bigbendnow.com/2015/06/culberson-county-gets-tapped-for-nuke-waste-facility-near-kent/\">pitched the idea</a> of placing a nuclear waste storage facility in the region.</p> <p>There have long been plans to build a major highway through the Big Bend, connecting Mexico to the oil-patch cities of Midland and Odessa and beyond. In September, Apache Corporation excitedly <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/apache-has-high-hopes-for-new-oil-field-discovery-in-texas-1473245702\">announced</a> it has discovered a field in west Texas near the Davis Mountains that it dubbed Alpine High. It could potentially yield the equivalent of billions of barrels of oil.</p> <p>\u201cPipelines beget pipelines, infrastructure begets infrastructure,\u201d said Keller. \u201cPipelines, as one landowner out here put it, they\u2019re just bait for other pipelines, and the oil and gas industry and that is the last thing we need here. This is the beginning of the destruction, the beginning of the end of the Big Bend, as I see it. It\u2019s the most damaging thing that\u2019s probably ever happened in the history of the region.\u201d</p>",

Reporters darted into the crowd, where supporters said they hoped debate night had signalled a turning point with less than six weeks remaining until election day.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Two pieces of good news added to the sense of momentum. First was the news that the conservative editorial board of the Arizona Republic had endorsed Clinton, a groundbreaking moment for a local newspaper that had never chosen a Democrat for president over a Republican since its founding in 1890. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to carry the state, in 1996 \u2013 but polling shows a tight race between Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Moments later, John Warner, a retired Republican senator from Virginia, announced he was also backing Clinton over Trump. The second world war veteran\u2019s support could carry weight within the national security community and military veterans in the vital swing state.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Both endorsements fed into one of Clinton\u2019s core arguments \u2013 that her opponent, in addition to being a divisive figure, was simply unfit to serve as commander-in-chief. <br></p> <p>The following day, Clinton travelled north to another battleground state, arriving in New Hampshire on a blustery autumnal afternoon.<br></p> <p>In the snows of February, she lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, triggering an unexpectedly long and bitter Democratic primary. But the two stood side by side on Wednesday, as she drew upon his star power to galvanize young voters with the promise of a debt-free tuition plan.</p> <p>Her audience, a mixture of students and parents concerned with college affordability, responded with enthusiastic applause.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sanders, who endorsed Clinton in July at a rally also held in New Hampshire, implored those in attendance to understand that the election presented a stark choice.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/554ca\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2758870\"            data-video-name=\"Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ec31b7e4b07eb0f44b8316\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/28/160928sanders_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/28/160928sanders.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/28/160928sanders_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/28/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-new-hampshire-video\">Sanders makes case for Clinton in New Hampshire</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI am asking you here today not only to vote for Secretary Clinton, but to work hard to get your uncles and your aunts, to get your friends, to vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis election is enormously important for the future of our country.

Acknowledging there was work yet to do in order to bring young voters to Clinton, Palmieri pointed not only to Sanders, but also to Barack and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/29/michelle-obama-we-need-an-adult-in-the-white-house-video\">Michelle Obama</a> as powerful messengers.<br></p> <p>The first lady had already increased her visibility on the stump after a memorable speech at the Democratic national convention in July.

That\u2019s why I believe in her.\u201d<br></p> <p>The first lady\u2019s appeal could also carry weight with independent-minded and Republican women put off by Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward minorities and women. If in recent weeks Trump\u2019s campaign had sought to soften his image with scripted lines about outreach to African Americans and the rollout of a paid family leave policy, the aftermath of the debate cast a spotlight once more on Trump\u2019s troubled relationship with women.<br></p> <p>In one of the defining moments of the opening debate, Clinton successfully baited the former reality TV star by sharing the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/donald-trump-alicia-machado-clinton-twitter-unhinged\">Alicia Machado</a>, the winner of the 1996 Miss Universe pageant, whose physical appearance Trump later derided with nicknames such as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/angelacarter\">Angela Carter</a> died \u2013 aged just 51, on 16 February 1992 \u2013 her reputation changed from cultish to canonical. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1992/feb/17/fiction.angelacarter\">obituaries</a> in the British press received more space than any others that year except Francis Bacon, Willy Brandt and Marlene Dietrich. Their tone was rhapsodic. \u201cAngela Carter \u2026 was one of the most important writers at work in the English language.\u201d \u201cShe interpreted the times for us with unrivalled penetration.\u201d \u201cHer imagination was one of the most dazzling of this century.\u201d Three days after she died, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/virago\">Virago,</a> the publishing house with which her name was most closely associated, sold out of her books. Over the course of the next academic year, the British Academy received 40 proposals for doctoral research into her work \u2013 compared with three on the literature of the entire 18th century.</p> <p>Her friends and long-term admirers regarded this torrent of posthumous acclaim with a touch of exasperation. For more than 25 years Carter had been producing novels, short stories, drama and journalism that stood defiantly apart from the work of her contemporaries. At a time when English literature was dominated by sober social realists, she played with disreputable genres \u2013 gothic horror, science fiction, fairytale \u2013 and gave free rein to the fantastic and the surreal. Her work is funny, sexy, frightening and brutal, and is always shaped by a keen, subversive intelligence and a style of luxuriant beauty. She was concerned with unpicking the mythic roles and structures that underwrite our existences \u2013 in particular the various myths of gender identity \u2013 and by the end of her life she was starting to acquire a devoted following. But only once her voice had been silenced was she accorded the status of a great novelist and feminist icon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At a time when English literature was full of sober social realists, she gave free rein to the fantastic and the surreal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Carter\u2019s first biographer, a large part of my task has been trying to look beyond some of the certainties that have settled around her since her death \u2013 to see her once again as mutable, vulnerable, unfinished. \u201cI\u2019m in the demythologising business,\u201d she once wrote, and as I worked on my book, my purpose increasingly became to demythologise her: to recapture the fluidity of her identity and the unpredictability of her mind, and in doing so, to tell a story about how she came to write some of the liveliest and most original books of the last hundred years.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One of the central themes of Carter\u2019s writing is the contingency of personal identity. She believed that our selves are neither false nor true, but merely roles we either master or are mastered by. Her characters wear their personalities like fancy dress costumes. She was explicit about viewing femininity as a \u201csocial fiction\u201d, part of a culturally choreographed performance of selfhood. She wasn\u2019t the first to make this observation \u2013 but she may have been the first to greet it so warmly, as a licence for boundless self-invention.</p> <p>The story of her life is the story of how she invented herself, of how she progressed from a shy, introverted childhood, through a nervy, defiantly unconventional youth, to a happy, self-confident middle age. She consistently flouted expectations of women, creating instead, by sheer force of will, the lifestyle and circumstances that suited her. It wasn\u2019t a straightforward process. Born in 1940 \u2013 just before the Luftwaffe unleashed its first wave of bombs over Britain \u2013 she grew up in the shabbily respectable south London district of Balham, the second child of an eccentric journalist father and a neurotic housewife mother. As a young girl she was spoiled and zealously sheltered by her parents, and in particular by her mother, who placed a handkerchief behind Angela\u2019s head whenever she sat down in a public place, rubbed so much Zam-Buk ointment on her chest that her top was permanently stained green, and indulged her with so many edible treats that by the time she left primary school she was extremely overweight. (Not an easy thing to achieve in a decade when meat, sugar, chocolate, butter, cheese and cooking fat were all strictly rationed.)</p> <p>As she approached adolescence, her mother\u2019s obsessive cosseting only became more pronounced. Even when she was 10 or 11, Angela wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the lavatory on her own. She was made to wash with the bathroom door open well into her teens. Her mother was terrified that some catastrophe would befall her if she let her out of her sight: she would slip and injure herself, or drown in the tub.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe8b9d4790e7501ab709b5937c1f13b82629613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe8b9d4790e7501ab709b5937c1f13b82629613/0_0_4648_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Magic Toyshop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Bell as Uncle Philip in the film adaptation of <em>The Magic Toyshop </em>(1987).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When she was 17 decided that the time had come to put some emotional distance between herself and her mother. She sought a doctor\u2019s advice about losing weight and was put on a rigorous diet: at the start of 1958, she weighed something between 13 and 15 stone; by that summer, she was around 10 stone. She also took up swearing and smoking, both of which dismayed her socially conservative parents (as she had calculated that they would), and began choosing her own clothes, opting for close-fitting black garments that were \u201ca positive sign of depravity\u201d in the late 1950s (a typical outfit consisted of \u201cblack-mesh stockings, spike-heeled shoes, bum-hugging skirt, jacket with a black fox collar\u201d). It was the first of many times when, faced with adverse or repressive circumstances, she forcibly asserted her identity.</p> <p>But on that first occasion she may have exerted too much force: her weight loss seems to have accelerated into anorexia shortly after she left school. By then she was working as a journalist \u2013 an overwhelmingly male profession in the late 1950s \u2013 on a local south London paper, which, she wrote, \u201cfunctioned as a kind of benign day-clinic, where my patent insanity was taken in good part\u201d. One of her duties was writing the paper\u2019s music reviews: that was probably how she first encountered Paul Carter, an industrial chemist by profession, but also an amateur producer and recordist of folk records, whom she later remembered as being \u201ca simple, artsy Soho 50s beatnik\u201d. Through him, she became involved in the English folk revival (she wrote sleeve notes to several of the records he produced, performed with him at singarounds, and even briefly ran a folk club with him) and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He represented a clear escape route from her parents\u2019 home: shortly after her 19th birthday, she accepted his proposal of marriage.</p> <p>When Paul was offered a lectureship in chemistry at the newly formed Bristol Technical College in 1961, Carter quit her job and went with him. But the marriage soon faltered. Paul had a depressive streak, and had quickly begun to exhibit what Carter came to know as his \u201cindrawn moods\u201d, which could last for days at a time. These moods were extremely difficult for her, not least because she felt (or was made to feel) that she was responsible for them. And after she began publishing novels (her first, <em>Shadow Dance</em>, a gothic murder story set in a distinctly Bristol-like city, appeared in 1966), his silences lengthened: she told a friend that he didn\u2019t speak to her for three weeks after one of her books came out. \u201cI admit it,\u201d she wrote in her journal less than two years after their wedding. \u201cMarriage was one of my typical burn-all-bridges-but-one acts; flight from a closed room into another one.\u201d By her mid-20s, she was already plotting her second escape from an oppressive domestic situation.</p> <p>In 1969 she received the Somerset Maugham award for her third novel, <em>Several Perceptions</em>. The rules (laid down by Maugham himself) stipulated that the money had to be spent on foreign travel. Carter decided to visit Japan. Shortly after arriving in Tokyo (which she thought was \u201cthe most absolutely non-boring city in the world\u201d), she met a 24-year-old Japanese man who was hoping to become a novelist. After breaking up with Paul by letter, she lived with the man for the best part of a year. When the relationship ended she moved in with a 19-year-old Korean man, while working for a period in a hostess bar. The two years that she spent in Japan were among the most crucial periods of Carter\u2019s life, one of the great hinges on which her story turns: she wrote two of her most dazzling books, <em>The Infernal Desire Machines of Dr Hoffman</em> (1972) and <em>Fireworks</em> (1974) while living there. Her new sense of personal independence had given rise to a new artistic freedom.</p> <p>After returning to Britain in 1972, she lived in London (renting the spare room of the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/15/fleur-adcock-poetry-dragon-talk\">Fleur Adcock</a> for a while) and became increasingly interested in the emerging women\u2019s liberation movement. She always felt happier \u201csniping from the sidelines\u201d than toeing the party line, however. \u201cI suspect,\u201d she told an interviewer, \u201cthat when my sisters think of me, they see me as a bit of an Uncle Tom. I think it\u2019s all terrible. I think it\u2019s terrible for everyone, not just women.\u201d Carter\u2019s 1979 work of cultural history, <em>The Sadeian Woman</em> \u2013 in which she used the Marquis de Sade as her exemplar of a \u201cmoral\u201d pornographer \u2013 was dismissed by the radical critic<em> Andrea Dworkin</em> as \u201cpseudofeminist\u201d. (It was also stickered by the Federation of Alternative Bookshops for having an offensive cover: a painting by the surrealist artist Clovis Trouille featuring several half-naked women, some of whom are being whipped.) Even so, she found one of her closest friends and most ardent supporters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\">Carmen Callil</a>, the founder of the feminist publishing house Virago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the same time as writing for Spare Rib she was selling erotic short stories to men\u2019s soft porn magazines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this period, Carter had a series of disastrous love affairs, and at least one abortion, while living hand to mouth on the proceeds of journalism and the odd royalty cheque from her early novels. After one particularly tempestuous relationship ended she fled London for Bath, and her father loaned her the money to buy herself a small house in the city (her mother having died in 1969).</p> <p>She eventually found domestic happiness with her second husband, Mark Pearce. He was a builder, 15 years her junior; they met when he was constructing an extension for the house opposite hers in Bath. She ran across the street to ask for his help with a plumbing emergency. \u201cHe came in,\u201d she told her friends, \u201cand never left.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Carter was deliberately messy, awkward, even paradoxical in her behaviour: she never allowed herself to settle into any predictable guise or attitude for long. At the same time in the 1970s as she was writing for the feminist magazine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/spare-rib\">Spare Rib</a>, she was also contributing smutty articles and erotic short stories to the soft porn magazines Men Only and Club International. She voted Labour and loathed Margaret Thatcher, but when she attended a meeting of leftwing writers and intellectuals in 1988, she felt badly out of place, and barely said a word. She refused identification with any movement, and resisted attempts to absorb her work into any genre (she always denied that she was a magical realist, for example, arguing that the phrase was meaningless when used outside the specific context of Latin American literature). She believed that \u201cintegration means giving up one\u2019s freedom of being, in that one becomes mastered by one\u2019s role\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c764b28fdd0586c7b28093973731760d91cb0e5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c764b28fdd0586c7b28093973731760d91cb0e5d/0_77_2765_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Company of Wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micha Bergese and Sarah Patterson in the film adaptation of The Company of Wolves (1984).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But if we invent ourselves, we also invent one another \u2013 and writers\u2019 personalities can quickly solidify in the popular imagination, especially once they\u2019re no longer around to surprise us with new work. As Auden wrote of Yeats\u2019s death: \u201che became his admirers\u201d. Carter has become hers in ways that have often ignored her wish not to be defined by her roles. Her obituaries demonstrated an impulse towards myth-making and sanctification. They emphasised her gentleness, her wisdom and her \u201cmagical\u201d imagination, at the expense of her intellectual sharpness, her taste for violent and disturbing imagery, and her exuberant sensuality.</p> <p>\u201cShe had something of the faerie queene about her,\u201d wrote Marina Warner in the Independent, \u201cexcept that she was never wispy or fey.\u201d In the New York Times, Salman Rushdie identified her straightforwardly with \u201cthe fairy queen\u201d, adding that \u201cEnglish literature has lost its high sorceress, its benevolent white witch\u201d. Margaret Atwood, writing in the Observer, went even further: \u201cThe amazing thing about her, for me, was that someone who looked so much like the fairy godmother \u2026 should actually be so much like the fairy godmother. She seemed always on the verge of bestowing something \u2013 some talisman, some magic token you\u2019d need to get through the dark forest, some verbal formula useful for the opening of charmed doors.\u201d</p> <p>This mythic version of Carter soon became the prevailing one. But the otherworldly figure conjured by her obituarists doesn\u2019t do justice to her complexity. Her fundamental vigour, determination and courage all emerge powerfully from the story of her life; her wild, often gleefully crass sense of humour and her strong sexual energy are both conspicuous in her books; and her quick wit and personal charm are apparent in surviving TV footage. In her 40s, newly confident, Carter allowed her hair to turn grey, and grew it down to her shoulders. She became a mother just as she began to look like the cartoon image of a grandmother: her son, Alexander, was born in 1983. He brought her a great deal of joy, and the last decade of her life was also the happiest. She returned to live in south London, not far from where she had grown up, and between teaching stints in Australia and the US she produced some of her richest and most affecting work, including the screenplay for the Neil Jordan film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview12\"><em>The Company of Wolves</em></a> (1984), which was based on one of her short stories, and the novels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1984/sep/27/fiction.angelacarter\"><em>Nights at the Circus </em></a>(1984) and <em>Wise Children </em>(1991). As her friend Lorna Sage observed: \u201cby the end her life fitted her more or less like a glove. But that\u2019s because she put it together, by trial and error, bricolage, all in the (conventionally) wrong order.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u2022 Edmund Gordon\u2019s <em>The Invention of Angela Carter: A Biography</em> is published by Chatto &amp; Windus on 13 October.

  "<p>Splash! There\u2019s a ripple on the water and I grapple with my camera to focus on the river. An otter-sized ripple is radiating out across the current. But it turns out to be from a fluorescent stick that\u2019s been tossed into the river and is now being chased by a swimming dog. I lower my camera. Even at 7am, dog-walkers are a ubiquitous hazard for anyone wanting to capture British wildlife.</p> <p>In another life, perhaps I would have had a double-barrelled surname and swaggered across the savannah in khaki, paying off my mortgage with a single photograph of a lion mauling a wildebeest. It\u2019s never too late to pursue your dreams, though \u2013 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m hunched by a Suffolk riverbank with a malfunctioning camera, failing to photograph an otter and instead capturing a blurry image of a dog.</p> <p>I\u2019m getting tips from David Tipling, who is not a posh savannah-swaggering type, but an acclaimed photographer who has travelled the world in pursuit of rare birds. Tipling also offers one-to-one tuition, and close encounters with real wildlife. We meet at 7am by the River Little Ouse in Suffolk to look for otters. Tipling keeps it simple: with tiny binoculars around his neck and a Nikon with a 600mm telephoto zoom, he moves unusually quietly through the countryside. Fieldcraft, as well as technical know-how, is essential in wildlife photography \u2013 and few of us have it since we don\u2019t spend enough time outdoors. \u201cI call it the three Ps,\u201d says Tipling. \u201cYou need patience, perseverance and planning. If you\u2019re at the wrong time of day, or wrong time of year, you\u2019ll miss the wildlife.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fc9403cf2cc7a59efd3b960f50783de315f1d0/0_0_2592_3888/667.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict on Patrick\u2019s shot \u2026 \u2018This has nice light and the poses are good.

While there\u2019s only a 50/50 chance of finding one, once you do they are surprisingly easy to follow, providing you move quickly ahead the moment they dive underwater.</p> <p>The elusiveness of most creatures is one reason why many keen photographers go on a course with a professional. Tipling may have travelled the world taking shots to illustrate Birds &amp; People, Mark Cocker\u2019s majesterial book from 2013, but he also knows exactly where to find a barn owl in Norfolk, and he has a special trick (I could tell you, but then I\u2019d have to kill you) to get close to wild hares.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even Tipling fails to turn up any otters during two hours of lovely riverside walking. We do enjoy seeing five kingfishers darting across the water, however. But these are gone in a flash \u2013 even Tipling doesn\u2019t attempt to photograph them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3263a676efc7582f97116e5f6d39d31132047702/0_130_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David\u2019s verdict \u2026 \u2018A very good picture by Patrick: good composition against the water, with strong eye contact\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have you ever admired a lovely shot of a kingfisher perched on a bare branch, silver fish in beak? Well, it was almost certainly set up. To photograph a kingfisher, Tipling says, you need to prepare a riverside branch, removing other branches so there\u2019s no visual clutter, then build a shelter to conceal yourself. You may also need bait.</p> <p>In fact, many amazing wildlife shots are created with a surprising amount of human intervention. So for our next lesson, we head to a Norfolk wood where Tipling has built a hide with special one-way glass imported from Barcelona. With the help of a feeder cleverly concealed behind an old oak stump, he has photographed sparrowhawks, green and greater-spotted woodpeckers, rare woodcocks and dozens of forest birds, not to mention stoats, squirrels, badgers, buzzards and red kites.</p> <p>We sit, concealed, on comfortable chairs and talk technology. Keen amateurs are sometimes said to have \u201call the gear and no idea\u201d. I\u2019ve just got no idea. In the decade since I bought a basic Canon digital single-lens reflex (one of those \u201cproper\u201d cameras where you look through the lens to take a shot) I\u2019ve specialised in mediocre pictures on automatic settings. I don\u2019t know what half my camera buttons do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcd8546c6306510a4373a467d5c3336ac8b152fa/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The verdict \u2026 \u2018I like this, but a professional might have focused more on the water and less on the clouds, leaving something to the viewer\u2019s imagination.

Many keen amateurs purchase a basic telescopic zoom lens for \u00a31,000. But there is secondhand kit and it\u2019s possible to innovate cheaply: for his aerial work, instead of a drone Tipling attaches a \u00a3150 camera to a kite.</p> <p>The big revelation is to be shown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/photography-camera-tips\">features my own camera has</a> that I never knew existed. There\u2019s a \u201cdepth of field\u201d preview button so I can see what will be in focus before I take a shot. Tipling explains white balance (just keep it set to automatic), quiet shutter mode (a normal shutter click can spook a barn owl \u2013 Tipling recommends allowing a barn owl to fly as close as possible before taking that first photo) and the importance of technicalities such as Adobe RGB (the amount of colour information stored on a picture file). We also change my ISO setting from 100 to 800, which enables faster shutter speeds in lower light to better freeze movement.</p> <p>We examine a photo of a swan I took that morning.

The quicker the shutter speed, the more sharply a camera captures movement: 1/1,000th of a second should be enough for a moving bird wing, although big flappy birds such as herons can be photographed in flight at lower speeds. The aperture (f2.8 to f22 on most cameras) sets the depth of field, or how much is in focus (f22 gives the deepest focus but lets in least light). Because Britain is often gloomy, you usually need a low f-stop.</p> <p>This is no bad thing for wildlife photography, though, because a shallow depth of field blurs the background and isolates the subject \u2013 just what we want. Novices are often so focused on their quarry, they don\u2019t pay any attention to what\u2019s behind it. Avoiding placing background tree branches through the head of a bird in the foreground is harder than it sounds. And even if you blur out what\u2019s behind, patches of light can still distract the eye. \u201cI keep backgrounds as clean as possible,\u201d says Tipling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a55ca69629618f0680fc733c458e39a3df7b728b/0_0_2000_2320/862.jpg\" alt=\"David Tipling\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out in the field \u2026 David Tipling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, I snap away at blue tits and great tits, miss a shrew and get a blurry squirrel.

Check your background: lower your aperture/f-stop to reduce your depth of field and blur distracting backgrounds.</p> <p>5. Even professionals get wonky horizons on their landscapes \u2013 these can be retrospectively straightened with Photoshop or other computer software.</p> <p>6. Dare to go manual: If you want to capture action, go for a high shutter speed; if you desire texture and depth of field, set your aperture at f11 or higher.</p> <h2>The shot that almost sank a plane</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b36a547929a4d218fce02a68bf949bd61c802cf/0_0_3421_5286/647.jpg\" alt=\"Emperor penguins in Antarctica\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emperor penguins in Antarctica</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tipling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Tipling went to extreme lengths to capture his most popular photograph \u2013 an emperor penguin and its chick.

The result has been counterproductive because restricting supply in a time of increasing wealth in Asia has driven up prices, dramatically increasing incentives and rewards for poachers. Since 2008, large-scale elephant poaching has restarted, driven by high prices in Asia.</p> <p>The trade ban is part of a prohibitionist approach that focuses on enhancing law enforcement, while constricting supply by confiscating and destroying ivory.

Supply reduction, by burning ivory stockpiles and implementing sale moratoria when demand for ivory remains unchanged, can drive prices up and escalate elephant poaching. As the market is controlled by criminals and investors who have no interest in conservation and are influenced primarily by price, elephant poaching can be predicted to increase.</p> <p>Despite recent investment in demand reduction in Asia, it is unlikely demand will be driven to zero within the short time frame required to save the species from extinction in the wild. A more practical approach would be to combine demand reduction campaigns with a legal and regulated supply of ivory, which would keep the price of ivory from rising higher and reduce the incentives for gangs to kill elephants. </p> <p>If this doesn\u2019t happen then African countries might choose to withdraw their participation from Cites and decide for themselves what to do with their elephants and other species.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/23/wildlife-trade-summit-is-a-do-or-die-moment-for-endangered-animals\">Wildlife trade summit is a 'do or die' moment for endangered animals</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Legal trade backfired badly in 2008.

First, the conspicuous trade of legal ivory could draw new consumers. Individuals seeing ivory promotions on TV or their peers making purchases may become more interested in buying some themselves. But this growing demand might not be satisfied by the legal supply, incentivising more poaching. Second, with more legal ivory in circulation, it becomes tougher for authorities to distinguish legal from illegal ivory, reducing the risk of detection for illegal traders. This makes it possible for illegal traders to supply more illegal ivory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far as we can tell, the legal sale caused elephant poaching rates to rise and stay high.</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Nitin Sekar and Professor Solomon Hsiang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which of these economic theories is correct? In most black markets, this is a challenging question as they are almost impossible to observe. But thanks to Cites, we have data stretching back to 2003 that provides a window into the shadowy illegal ivory trade. At 79 large sites in 40 countries across Africa and Asia, Cites collects data on how many elephants are poached and how many died naturally. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/legal-ivory-sale-drove-dramatic-increase-in-elephant-poaching-study-shows\">recent analysis</a>, we used these data to see which economic model is right.</p> <p> Using the Cites global poaching data, we examined whether the \u201cone-time legal sale\u201d of ivory to China and Japan caused changes in global markets for poached ivory.</p> <p>What we found surprised us: the sale announcement corresponded with an abrupt, global and lasting 65% increase in poaching. These findings are further supported by reports on the ground. With the new influx of legal ivory, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/world/asia/an-illicit-trail-of-african-ivory-to-china.html\">the Chinese government promoted the product</a>, the Chinese media <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tv.cntv.cn/video/c10330/7e7b5d36d2ba4817a6994b80c5636153\">trumpeted the investment value of ivory</a>, and a Chinese periodical noted that the one-time sale \u201cstimulated new consumption instead of slowing down illegal ivory trades\u201d. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/10/ivory/christy-text\">secondary market for legal ivory permits has emerged</a> to help launder illegal ivory.</p> <p>We tested many alternatives to the \u201cdynamic\u201d theories, but none of them could explain the dramatic 2008 increase in poaching. For instance, there was no greater Chinese investment in valuable raw commodities (such as gold) due to the financial crisis.

Hmm, almost as underwhelming as the pre-game entertainment but good on him I suppose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AfterGrogBlog/status/782096059434536961\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Don&#39;t call me Surely. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLGF?src=hash\">#AFLGF</a></p>&mdash; Tony Tea (@AfterGrogBlog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AfterGrogBlog/status/782096059434536961\">October 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-01T05:56:50.478Z\">at 6.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ef4eb6e4b0ab0063086bd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-01T05:51:06.153Z\">6.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Understatement of the day</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sydneyswans/status/782095187753377793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This man is the number one ranked player on the ground at the moment.<br><br>He&#39;s been MASSIVE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProudlySydney?src=hash\">#ProudlySydney</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLGF?src=hash\">#AFLGF</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LslxQdJ8xF\">pic.twitter.com/LslxQdJ8xF</a></p>&mdash; Sydney Swans (@sydneyswans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sydneyswans/status/782095187753377793\">October 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ef4e6ee4b05962fdf49bef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-01T05:50:07.363Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Further evidence that this game has disappeared well off the charts</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ethan_meldrum/status/782094100279328768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">14 Q2 disposals for Tom Mitchell, 13 for Kennedy and 13 for Hannebery and the Dogs still managed five goals.

If you\u2019d tried to bet on this pairing of football sides at the start of the season, not only would the bookies have offered you long odds, they might have inquired as to the state of your wellbeing.</p> <p>But here we are: the glamorous and well-drilled harbourside superstars of the Swans against a Doggies side full of talent and spirit, but representing Melbourne\u2019s working class western suburbs and a group of fans who\u2019ve had to wait entire lifetime\u2019s for this day. Thirty years ago the club was on its knees. They haven\u2019t figured in a decider in 55 years and took their one and only premiership cup in 1954, when Robert Menzies was Prime Minister and Vance Joy was not a combination of words that had ever been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe98e7a25b3f8135da2b52354586472fb60ce20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fe98e7a25b3f8135da2b52354586472fb60ce20/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bulldogs and Swans fans arrive at the MCG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bulldogs and Swans fans arrive at the MCG for the 2016 AFL grand final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s some romance here but also, I fear, perhaps a dose of reality in the next few hours. Am I wrong in thinking that Sydney will hold their nerve and benefit from their previous grand final experience? We shall see, but a bit more on the phenomenon of grand final nerves in the article below, which you can check out before I\u2019m back with today\u2019s teams. In short, the Doggies\u2019 vaunted press meets Sydney\u2019s hard-nosed, hard-ball-winning midfield in a contest between leg-speed and muscle. I\u2019ll stick with the Swans as my tip, but certainly hope it\u2019s closer than my gut feel suggests.</p> <p>Will the weather be a factor today? No, thankfully. It\u2019s 17 degrees in Melbourne, partly cloudy with a light westerly heading towards the Punt Road end, but there\u2019s no rain predicted for the afternoon and the sun should be beating down on the glorious Melbourne Cricket Ground by the time today\u2019s game ends.

  "<p>How does a generation that has never truly grown up deal with turning 40? For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/luella-bartley\">Luella Bartley</a> and Katie Hillier, the answer was obvious: set up a fashion label. Last year, when they were 42 and 41 respectively, they founded <a href=\"http://hillierbartley.com\">Hillier Bartley</a>, making the clothes they felt no one else was making, for women who are fine with getting older (well, pretty much) but who most certainly do not consider themselves middle-aged. Fashion for the post-midlife crisis generation, let\u2019s call it. Velvet tailoring in petrol blue; a floor-length hostess gown in mustard silk. Party clothes for women who don\u2019t do party dresses. A little bit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung\">Alexa Chung</a>, a little bit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/florence-and-the-machine\">Florence Welch</a>. (Both are customers.)</p> <p>When Bartley founded the Luella label in 1999, aged 25, with Hillier as her right-hand woman, their lives revolved around Shoreditch parties, late nights in Soho members\u2019 clubs with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss\">Kate Moss</a>, that sort of thing. Today, she and I are sitting in the garden of the Hillier Bartley studio, and things have changed. Green juice for her, flat white for me. \u201cI got to 40 and thought I had to grow up,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was my answer to that. This is something no one else is doing. Because the thing is, women don\u2019t age in the same way any more. Our generation has women like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/patti-smith\">Patti Smith</a> to look up to. Getting older doesn\u2019t mean what it used to.\u201d</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://porteliotfestival.com/\">Port Eliot festival</a> in Cornwall this summer, Bartley went to a talk by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gloria-steinem\">Gloria Steinem</a>. \u201cShe is 82, and how she looks just hasn\u2019t changed. She still has the same style, the same mannerisms. I found that deeply inspiring, but it\u2019s actually not easy to figure out how to do that.

Hillier\u2019s career has been that of the ultimate fashion insider, putting her magic touch (but not her name) to It bags for Marc by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/marc-jacobs\">Marc Jacobs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\">Victoria Beckham</a> and <a href=\"http://www.asprey.com/\">Asprey</a>, to name just a few. One of this season\u2019s most striking trends is a motocross aesthetic (colourful motorcycle leathers) that was highly visible on the Paris catwalks; it\u2019s a look that began with a collection Hillier and Bartley designed for Marc by Marc Jacobs two years ago. They have a knack for knowing which way the wind is blowing, which makes their unconventional design philosophy all the more compelling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bd56afd5c6a18d868c2f7ec63ea462d93da37bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd56afd5c6a18d868c2f7ec63ea462d93da37bbe/553_81_963_2844/339.jpg\" alt=\"A Bartley and Hillier design for Marc by Marc Jacobs, at New York fashion week, February 2014.\" width=\"339\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bartley and Hillier for Marc by Marc Jacobs A/W 14.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Concordia/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Hillier Bartley story began one afternoon in 1999, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/14/magazine-editor-katie-grand-designer-luella-bartley-on-friendship\">the stylist Katie Grand</a> introduced them in a pub on Kings Road in London. Within a few hours they were friends; within a week, Hillier had come to work with Bartley. Luella won Bartley the <a href=\"http://www.fashionawards.com/Archive\">Designer of the Year</a> award in 2008, but being the hottest ticket in London ended \u2013 as being the hottest ticket in London often does \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/10/luella-bartley-ceases-trading-closure-fashion\">closure in 2009</a> [after Bartley\u2019s major Italian manufacturer went bust and the collection couldn\u2019t be produced]. When the pair were announced four years later in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/may/31/luella-bartley-katie-hillier-marc-jacobs\">new roles at Marc by Marc Jacobs</a>, with Hillier as creative director and Bartley as design director, a cheer went up around the fashion world. They seem somehow meant to be, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/friends-millennials-gentler-simpler-time\">Ross and Rachel</a>, to reference a pairing of similar vintage.</p> <p>But it\u2019s just me and Bartley today, soaking up the unseasonably glorious September sunshine, it having proved impossible to get the two in the same place at the same time: Bartley decamped from Bloomsbury to Cornwall for the summer, and by the time she was back in London, Hillier was in New York. Bartley\u2019s hair is salt-bleached from the beach and she emanates the intensely laid-back vibe you can get only by spending two months by the sea, 300 miles from the city. The author of a book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Luellas-Guide-English-Luella-Bartley/dp/0007285310\">Luella\u2019s Guide To English Style</a>, she began her career in fashion as a journalist, and her sentences are writerly, with thoughtful pauses. I spoke to Hillier on the phone in New York, for the same amount of time I spent with Bartley, but when I transcribed the call, it was twice as long, because Hillier talks and talks without drawing breath.</p> <p>The two friends now find themselves, at similar ages, living out very different scenarios. Bartley, who has three children (Kip, 13, Stevie, 11, and Ned, nine) with her partner, <a href=\"http://showstudio.com/contributor/david_sims\">the fashion photographer David Sims</a>, has recently moved back to London after a decade in Cornwall (\u201cMy wilderness years,\u201d she sort-of jokes). \u201cWhen we moved there, Luella was in full flow and the plan was that I\u2019d commute. I mean, people in fashion do it between London and Paris. But Kip and Stevie were really young, then I had Ned, and after a while it felt like all I was ever doing was putting out fires, at work or at home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebf2f29c1198fc3b7958daa89328fbfbcdd5f6b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebf2f29c1198fc3b7958daa89328fbfbcdd5f6b4/95_127_2219_2409/921.jpg\" alt=\"Designers Luella Bartley, Marc Jacobs and Katie Hillier at New York fashion week min September 2014\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Marc Jacobs.

To be at the point I am \u2013 42, with no children but not in a frame of mind where I definitely don\u2019t want them \u2013 that has its challenges. When I was younger, I very much put my career to the forefront. I didn\u2019t have children, and I never gave myself that breathing space from work. So even though doing our own label is a lot more work, weirdly it has allowed me to think about my own life, and what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFashion,\u201d Bartley says, \u201cis more interesting than you think. Gender, ageing \u2013 these are big issues in our society, and fashion does have a hand in shifting things.\u201d Their <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/shows/autumn-winter-2016-ready-to-wear/hillier-bartley/\">autumn 2016 collection</a> was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\">David Bowie</a> (you can\u2019t get through a conversation with either of these two without Bowie being mentioned), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brianeno\">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Francis Bacon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde\">Oscar Wilde</a>. The idea is to capture in womenswear, Bartley says, \u201ca rakish attitude that has before now seemed part of a rather male identity \u2013 louche, dashing, with a possibility of the disreputable\u201d. In the traditional iconography, the cool girls are always young. Women over 35 can be either ladies or power dressers, both of whom are rather severe and serious. Or they can be pink-haired, crazy-old-ladies. Hillier Bartley offers a new paradigm \u2013 a grownup, confident individuality that is chic and sophisticated, rather than laughably eccentric.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be45e4771d435d7815e3934bac6dd4675cfeae94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be45e4771d435d7815e3934bac6dd4675cfeae94/164_226_2156_3095/697.jpg\" alt=\"Clothes from Hillier Bartley\u2019s A/W 16 collection\" width=\"697\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s something about a woman in a trouser suit that is really sexy\u2019: Hillier Bartley A/W 16.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Swagger is a word that comes up a lot with these two. \u201cYou can have swagger in jeans and an old T-shirt and a pair of heels,\u201d Hillier says. \u201cBut as I get older, I am drawn to different things. I might wear the same thing now, but with a tux, you know?\u201d Bartley says the character she has in mind when she designs \u201cis someone very stylish but slightly dishevelled. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\">Lucian Freud</a> in a tuxedo scarf, but with paint all over him. That confidence and the slight suggestion of bad behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Bartley often makes these references to aristocratic style, but insists, \u201cIt\u2019s not about class, it\u2019s about confidence. That\u2019s the part I want to take from that. The thing is, lots of things in English culture do cross over with class, whether that\u2019s Savile Row or the football terraces. There are a lot of English traditions that are really seductive. Oh God, listen to me.

They are long, but ankle-length not gown-length, so you can wear them comfortably with flat shoes, and with pockets.\u201d Sometimes they go into battle over ideas. \u201cBut that\u2019s good,\u201d Bartley insists, \u201cbecause it means the things that you don\u2019t fight for drop out of the collection, and those things probably weren\u2019t strong enough to be there.\u201d</p> <p>Neither of them is afraid to speak her mind (when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> invited Bartley to 10 Downing Street, she wrote a letter telling him she couldn\u2019t drink champagne there when she fundamentally disagreed with his policy on admitting refugees), which makes the adoring way each talks about the other even sweeter. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice,\u201d Bartley says, \u201cis that I\u2019ve been the boss [at Luella], she\u2019s been the boss [at Marc by Marc], and now we\u2019re together, and it works whichever way round. If Katie can help you, she will. She\u2019s just the most lovely, loyal, supportive person.\u201d</p> <p>Hillier, meanwhile, says, \u201cLuella inspires me. If I have an idea for something, she\u2019s the person I really want to like that idea. Working with her gives me confidence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9ff0cd79a8e5a9811065ff191e6e6d8294ad37e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff0cd79a8e5a9811065ff191e6e6d8294ad37e2/335_198_1420_3129/454.jpg\" alt=\"Clothes from Hillier Bartley\u2019s A/W 16 collection\" width=\"454\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grownup individuality: Hillier Bartley A/W 16.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we meet, Bartley is wearing grey cords, battered brown leather loafers and a pale pink cotton shirt washed almost transparent.

She doesn\u2019t buy much, she says, but will invest in beautifully made pieces that last for ever. \u201cI\u2019ve had this shirt for, I don\u2019t know, 10 years, 15 maybe?

The next stage for the label is to bring investment into a business that until now has been self-funded. Not that Bartley wants to return to the bombastic catwalk shows of her Luella days: \u201cI loved our shows. I loved watching the character we had created come to life and walk down a catwalk, but that\u2019s not us any more. And, actually, I think I prefer the way we are now.\u201d</p>",

Growing up in a village, where the nearest shop was a 20-minute cycle away, she often had to make do with what was growing in the backyard.

The early stages of his administration were fraught with delay in <a href=\"http://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/why-we-delayed-appointment-of-ministers-buhari/\">appointing ministers</a>, stagnating public contracts and an inconsistent approach to the exchange rate that worsened the crisis, tipping the economy into recession.</p> <p>The Nigerian government has sought solutions, but the recession has been further compounded by <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/nigerias-inflation-rate-hits-17-6-august-nbs/\">rising inflation</a> that hit 17.6% in August. The inflationary spiral was triggered by the high cost of energy prices following the removal of state subsidies, combined with an alarmingly swift depreciation in local currency. Nigeria\u2019s currency has lost 114% of its value in a year and there are signs that this trend might continue, raising local prices in a nation dependent on imports.<br></p> <p>The government is considering <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/nigeria-raise-1-billion-eurobond-market/\">raising $1bn in the eurobond market</a>. However, the challenge lies in the cost of borrowing after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-16/s-p-downgrades-nigeria-further-into-junk-as-oil-crisis-worsens\">downgraded Nigeria\u2019s credit rating</a> from B+ to B, five steps below investment grade.<br></p> <p>Another possibility being mooted by the government, as it looks to shore up its<a href=\"https://www.cbn.gov.ng/intops/Reserve.asp\"> foreign reserves to $24.7bn</a> and boost foreign exchange liquidity to forestall the depreciation of the naira, is the sale of its national assets. The Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, recently <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/sell-off-nlng-invest-proceed-well-recession-dangote-tells-buhari/\">proffered this solution</a>, and the senate president, governors and central bank have all indicated agreement. The tone taken by the government is that state assets \u2013 including government shares in oil joint ventures, the Africa Finance Corporation, the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company and major airports \u2013 will be sold to shore up its foreign exchange base.</p> <p>Nigeria has benefited from the good fortune of NLNG, the largest tax-paying entity in west Africa, which has turned over <a href=\"http://www.nlng.com/NIGNLNG/News.aspx?ID=21\">$33bn to the government </a>in the past 16 years. However, the country has persistently underfunded its share in joint ventures with international oil companies.

While the sale of Nigeria\u2019s share in the joint ventures is a positive step, there has to be deeper interrogation of selling NLNG, which has been <a href=\"http://www.nlng.com/NIGNLNG/News.aspx?ID=21\">valued at $16bn</a> and is expected to return at least $8bn to the Nigerian government.<br></p> <p>There is the option of joining the International Monetary Fund programme, but the government \u2013 perhaps scarred by the memory of the punitive cuts to public efficiency that accompanied structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s \u2013 appears uninterested. </p> <p>While the country is mulling over the sale of national assets, it has still not resolved the problems that are hampering the private sector. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rate-setting committee <a href=\"http://www.nta.ng/news/investment/20160921-economy-cbn-maintains-14-interest-rate/\">maintained baseline interest rates at 14%</a>, triggering commercial lending rates of up to 28%. Subsequently, <a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/cbn-disagrees-adeosun-refuses-cut-interest-rate/\">the finance ministry supported a drop in interest rates</a> to catalyse economic activity, contradicting the CBN and highlighting a lack of harmony on monetary and fiscal policy that \u2013 at a time when <a href=\"http://www.signalng.com/nigerias-debt-rises-n4-17-trillion-one-year-buhari/\">national debt has risen by 4.71tn naira inside a year</a> \u2013 is likely to compound the uncertain nature of the government\u2019s policy response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afea802ddf9b2be816cc6ad7002944a937d2fd5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afea802ddf9b2be816cc6ad7002944a937d2fd5e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Motorcycles wait for fuel at the petrol station in the Nigerian capital Abuja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorcycles await fuel at a petrol station in Abuja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, Nigeria might have to put its assets up for sale, but analysts will remain concerned that it is a short-term fix for a country that needs new engines of growth for its exports.

The sale of power plants in Nigeria, which triggered <a href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/03/16/cbn-to-resume-payment-of-n213bn-power-intervention-fund-2/\">a round of bailout funds</a> by the central bank, is an obvious example of the potential pitfalls.<br></p> <p>Nigeria might seem to be on track with diversification, but the political risks posed by the 2019 election are obvious. Even if the reserves get a boost, good plans can be undone by a change of government. For Nigeria to continue selling public assets as a short-term fix to a structural problem seems deeply introspective. The bleeding might be delayed but, if the portfolio of national exports is not expanded beyond oil, it will be back to the drawing board. National assets should only be sold as part of a long-term plan that is strictly followed through.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Hari Kunzru</strong></h2> <p>Clearly, if writers were barred from creating characters with attributes that we do not \u201cown\u201d (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and so on), fiction would be impossible. Stories would be peopled by clones of the author. Since trespassing into otherness is a foundation of the novelist\u2019s work, should we restrict ourselves in some way, so as to avoid doing violence to those who identify with our characters? The injunction to refrain from \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d sounds like a call for censorship, or at best a warning to self-censor, an infringement of the creative liberty to which so many surprising people profess themselves attached.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0185f8d7b953a08d28a07213a33eecd8bbf88af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0185f8d7b953a08d28a07213a33eecd8bbf88af8/0_338_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hari Kunzru\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Attempting to think one\u2019s way into other subjectivities is an act of ethical urgency\u2019 \u2026 Hari Kunzru</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is true that the politics of offence are used to shut down dissident voices of all kinds, frequently in minority communities, and the understanding of culture as a type of property to which ownership can be definitively assigned is, at the very least, problematic. Should the artist go forth boldly, without fear? Of course, but he or she should also tread with humility. Note that I do not say, \u201cwith care\u201d. I don\u2019t believe any subject matter should a priori be off limits to anyone, or that harm necessarily flows from the kind of ventriloquism that all novelists perform. Quite the opposite. Attempting to think one\u2019s way into other subjectivities, other experiences, is an act of ethical urgency. For those who have never experienced the luxury of normativity, the warm and fuzzy feeling of being the world\u2019s default setting, humility in the face of otherness seems like a minimal demand. Yet it appears that for some, the call to listen before speaking, to refrain from asserting immediate authority, is so unfamiliar that it feels outrageous. I\u2019m being silenced! My freedom is being abridged! Norm is unaccustomed to humility because he has grown up as master of the house. All the hats are his to wear. For the deviant others, who came in by the kitchen door, it has always been expected, even demanded.</p> <p>Good writers transgress without transgressing, in part because they are humble about what they do not know. They treat their own experience of the world as provisional. They do not presume. They respect people, not by leaving them alone in the inviolability of their cultural authenticity, but by becoming involved with them. They research. They engage in reciprocal relationships. It does not seem like a particular infringement of liberty to pass through the world without being its owner, unless someone else is continually asserting property rights over the ground beneath your feet. The panicked tone of the accusations of censorship leads me to suspect that what is being asserted has little to do with artistic freedom per se, and everything to do with a bitter fight to retain normative status, and the privileges that flow from it. The solution is simple, my fearful friends. Give up. Accept that some things are not for you, and others are not about you. You will find you have lost nothing. It may even feel like a weight off your shoulders. Put down that burden and pull up a chair. You might hear something you haven\u2019t heard before. You will, at least, hear some new stories.</p> <h2><strong>Kamila Shamsie</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba46c709b275340200cd8eeed060756e7d7b1207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba46c709b275340200cd8eeed060756e7d7b1207/355_42_1178_707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamila Shamsie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To continually return to the same subset of humanity, and declare that there is no one else who imaginatively engages you or who you know how to imaginatively engage with, strikes me as one of the most dispiriting things a writer can say.Kamila Shamsie,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for DIAGEO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the novels I love is Peter Hobbs\u2019s <em>In the Orchard, the Swallows</em>. It\u2019s set entirely in the north of Pakistan \u2013 and is beautiful and true (a better word than \u201cauthentic\u201d). If anyone tried to dispute Hobbs\u2019s right to have written that book (and I should say, every Pakistani I know who has read it has expressed only admiration), I would be the first in line to defend him, and it. But the point about the book is that it\u2019s wonderfully and sensitively written; it has no interest in peddling stereotypes, or making great claims about the place in which it\u2019s located; there is no whiff of arrogance or entitlement. I don\u2019t know what went on in Hobbs\u2019s mind when he wrote it but I feel fairly confident it wasn\u2019t: \u201cHow dare anyone dispute my right to write this?\u201d</p> <p>In fact, if you do start with an attitude that fails to understand that there are very powerful reasons for people to dispute your right to tell a story \u2013 reasons that stem from historical, political or social imbalances, you\u2019ve already failed to understand the place and people who you purport to want to write about. That\u2019s a pretty lousy beginning, and I wouldn\u2019t want to read the fiction that comes out of it.

To suggest that a writer cannot depict characters unlike themself is patently absurd. Books would have to be peopled with characters exactly like the author. In my case, they would all be Scottish/Sierra Leonian women, who would be required to travel to each other\u2019s countries (presumably Scotland and Sierra Leone), fall in love with each other, betray each other, befriend each other and occasionally shoot each other.</p> <p>Lionel Shriver\u2019s speech was crass and unhelpful; she turned an important creative question into \u201cwhites versus chippy minorities\u201d. Yet writers from minority groups have spoken out at length about being expected <em>only</em> to address certain subjects. My last book was set in Croatia. In the year of publication I answered the question: \u201cWhy Croatia?\u201d so many times I began simply to answer: \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Franzen\u2019s remarks about not being able to write a black woman character because he has never been in love with a black woman made me squirm. He said he has to have experience of loving a category of person before he can write about them. That\u2019s hard to believe for all sorts of practical reasons, but beyond that, writing is about imagining how others think and feel and how that informs their behaviour; it is about offering a different way of seeing and in so doing it creates empathy. I tell my creative writing students: \u201cDon\u2019t write what you know, write what you want to understand.\u201d I write from a place of deep curiosity about the world.</p> <p>Every writer is free to write about who and what they want, but that does not mean the work cannot be critiqued. People who belong to minority groups have had to live with limiting, irritating and insulting portrayals all our lives, as well as always dying before the end of the movie. I have thrown aside many modern novels because a white writer\u2019s purpose in including a character of colour has been merely to make a point about race or reflect a white character\u2019s value system. It\u2019s bad writing, plain and simple. Shriver wants to be given points for trying. Well, I might do that for my undergraduates, but I won\u2019t do it for a published author.

I do write across boundaries, though. While actively soliciting people\u2019s right to reply (I\u2019ve published all responses, good and bad, on my website for the last decade), I do my best, when I write, to be everyone.</p> <p>In my novels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/fiction5\">I cross boundaries of gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexuality and class</a>. That\u2019s the best way I know to tell stories about our world, where those faultlines define our society. I show scenes from both sides, using one character to view another askance. Why? Because my characters\u2019 eyes can be sharper than mine, since my own identity has no lock on a unitary or objective way of seeing things.</p> <p>I do my research. Sometimes \u2013 as when interviewing refugees and torture survivors \u2013 I\u2019ve learned things I wish I could unlearn. The violence of the world\u2019s true stories can crack you open. You lose the shape you were moulded in. You take on other forms. How should one judge the healthiness of a writer like that, an empathist, a broken vessel? By the temperature of their work, I think. By its willingness to surrender heat to light.</p> <p>A good novelist is a good observer \u2013 everything else is just style. A writer must be alive to what goes said and unsaid in the world, making themself small until only the reader is reflected in the work. A well-crafted novel is a mirror, and as a reader I don\u2019t mind where the glass was made or how it got its silver. I require only that its reflection is fair.</p> <p>Readers are mostly ignored in this debate, but the worldly and widely read reader has a hinterland, is quick to spot an agenda and is willing to call out fakes. Readers are more heterogeneous than writers will ever be, and in their multiplicity a book finds its measure of truth.</p> <p>I do think there is such a thing as shared emotional truth and that its discovery is the purpose of the novel. That\u2019s why people of many different cultures will sometimes cry at the end of an honest book. Even after the characters\u2019 voices have faded, if those voices led me \u2013 the reader \u2013 to discover a truth for myself, then that experience will move me. It might even crack the mould I was made in.</p> <h2><strong>AL Kennedy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbfd25140a7613bb3acece625b886f7d64b80b04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbfd25140a7613bb3acece625b886f7d64b80b04/291_673_2330_1398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AL Kennedy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fiction proves that humanity can think of things that never were and then make them\u2019 \u2026 AL Kennedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiction doesn\u2019t appropriate, it creates. That\u2019s the wonder of it. Fiction proves that humanity can think of things that never were and then make them \u2013 in this case, not a new government, or a new way of designing cities, or a cure for cancer, but a narrative that can involve any reader in a further imaginative act. When the writer writes, or the reader reads, they\u2019re consenting to be someone other than themselves. The reader of properly crafted work can share emotional and psychological space with a character. This is a practice of empathy, which might not seem as big a deal as good government, or more civilised cities, or cancer cures, but functional fiction is part of the culture that helps create those things, too. Believing in the power of human imagination and experiencing empathy gives you reasons to act and invent on behalf of others.</p> <p>Currently, the Eng Lit business and our critical establishment prefers to define all writing as autobiographical, journalistic. It isn\u2019t. It never was, and reducing it in such a manner denies us our ability to imagine. Without regular exercise of that ability we abdicate our rights to conscious change.</p> <p>Inexperienced authors \u2013 and uncomprehending observers \u2013 can become bewildered when facing the question at the heart of fictional writing: \u201cHow do I write someone who isn\u2019t me? I\u2019m not old/young/Asian/anyone other than myself \u2013 how can I seem to be?\u201d Bewilderment is natural, but it\u2019s never enough. The appropriate response to character is awe. And then the appropriate response to the creation of any fictional character is a dedication to every possible effort that will let them live effectively for the reader. The human being the writer tries to represent and the human being who is the reader require the author to create accessible humanity. The character must be specific and individual enough to communicate universally.</p> <p>Every life has to be respected, may be racked by injustice, is deserving of sensitivity \u2013 so we write about every life. That\u2019s the only rule and our human duty. Backing away from that duty hands the world to the demagogues and bigots, those who would prefer us not to speak to each other, accurately represented as irreplaceably complex individuals who both reveal and transcend group identities. The passion in that helps create a culture that keeps us safe.</p> <h2><strong>Stella Duffy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1e168a2ecf9d725a75e23c3e081843db314b8a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e168a2ecf9d725a75e23c3e081843db314b8a5/226_1989_3502_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stella Duffy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want to write and read work that is as multifaceted as our society\u2019 \u2026 Stella Duffy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In my new novel, <em>London Lies Beneath</em>, as with the 13 other novels I have written, the characters are of different classes, different ethnicities, different genders, different sexualities, different abilities. Not in order to tick boxes, but because that\u2019s how the world is. I\u2019ve written characters that are BAME, white, female, male, disabled, able-bodied, LGBT (individually, not lumped together), from every social class and in several different time periods. I don\u2019t live in a world with only one group of people and I\u2019m not interested in writing about only one group of people.</p> <p>In <em>The Room of Lost Things</em>, the two protagonists are an older white working-class man and a younger British Asian man. Set in south London, where I live, the book has a large range of characters, especially in terms of race and ethnicity \u2013 and more than one reviewer commented that I was \u201cexposing readers\u2019 prejudices\u201d by not stating immediately if a character was black or mixed race or Asian. I really wasn\u2019t. I mentioned race or ethnicity \u2013 including that of white characters \u2013 when it was relevant to the story. However, if a reviewer assumes that a white writer will only write white characters then they certainly need to look at their preconceptions.</p> <p>\u201cWrite what you know\u201d is a tired maxim that most writers abandon eventually, \u201cwrite who you are\u201d is even more restrictive. I want to write and read work that is as multifaceted as our society. I think it\u2019s vital we write widely and inclusively to help shift publishing from the mostly middle class, mostly white place it is now. Men need to write women knowing that they are writing from a place of privilege \u2013 that they are likely to earn more than women and are more likely to be reviewed. White writers need to write BAME characters knowing there are many more white writers published. The same for straight people, and able-bodied people, middle-class people, and on.</p> <p>We can write who we are not and do it well if we write with passion, strength \u2013 and care. We\u2019re bound to get it wrong sometimes, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try. If we want our writing to reflect the truth, then our characters and their experiences must be as diverse as the world in which we live.</p> <h2><strong>Linda Grant </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5964c45208ee9c3a53728f5ba5aacb0a3c86f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5964c45208ee9c3a53728f5ba5aacb0a3c86f7/0_84_1794_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda grant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The whole point of fiction is that you make it up, but at the same time readers have become passionate for authenticity\u2019 \u2026 Linda Grant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The modern novelist is caught in a contradiction, not of our own making, involving demands from the reader that are almost impossible to resolve. Why are there no black characters in your fiction, why does this novel not reflect contemporary British society? But how dare you, a white writer, appropriate the lives and stories of black people you know nothing about? Faced with a no-win situation, most white novelists accept the lesser charge of staying in their safety zone rather than be accused of getting it badly wrong. There is a true and difficult complexity to this problem that neither side fully accepts. The whole point of fiction is that you make it up, but at the same time readers have become passionate for authenticity, for hearing the truth of other voices, other lives (and for treating them, at times, like autobiography or non-fiction, the novel as learning aid, in history and geography).</p> <p>It was theoretically possible for me to have had the chutzpah to travel to Jamaica and do months of research into the lives of the Windrush generation, but nothing I wrote would have the depth of reality of Andrea Levy\u2019s <em>Small Island</em>, the novel that told the story of the women I used to see in church-going hats and pristine white gloves standing at the bus stop in Brixton. I was asked whether I thought that any non-Jewish novelist had ever really nailed a Jewish character, which implied a universality of the Jewish condition that doesn\u2019t exist, a condition of Otherness. For the talky male American Jews of Philip Roth are not the same people as the timid female Marylebone introverts of Anita Brookner. One writes out of deep knowledge of one\u2019s interior world. The something that one has to say is the thing that one knows, but married to that is intense curiosity about the lives of others \u2013 about what the person sitting opposite you on the tube is thinking. The origin of fiction is telling a story, about yourself or others. In practical terms we are mostly appropriating, ruthlessly, the lives of our families and our friends, but that\u2019s not the same as cultural appropriation because it has no political freight.

I do my research, I work hard, and I accept that I\u2019ll get some things wrong\u2019 \u2026 Naomi Alderman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course fiction writers can write whatever they want, no matter their backgrounds. I\u2019ve written male characters, people older than me, people gayer than me, people who lived and died 2,000 years ago. My new novel <em>The Power</em> has a 21-year-old male Nigerian journalist as a viewpoint character as well as a New England politician in her 50s.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing: you have to try to do it well. You have to be familiar with whatever tropes might apply to your character: racist, sexist, homophobic, sizeist, ableist, antisemitic and anything else. It\u2019s not OK, for example, to make your Chinese character shifty and inscrutable or your fat character stupid and lazy: you need to have learned enough to understand where these false ideas come from and why it\u2019s so pernicious to replicate them. Do better. Treat your characters as human beings. Write them as people not ideas or stereotypes.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another thing \u2013 you need to accept that you\u2019ll fail at some level, and be humble when you do. I come from the Orthodox Jewish world: I could write you an essay on the precise messages communicated by the clothing of each individual person on the Golders Green Road. I can\u2019t do the same for people in Lagos. I do my research, I work hard, and I accept that I\u2019ll get some things wrong. I hope people will point out my mistakes to me, and then I\u2019ll apologise and try to do better next time. People criticising your writing is not a violation of your freedom of speech, it is a gift freely given and should be accepted with gratitude.</p> <p>And if a few people decide they only want to read books about minority groups written by members of that group, I think that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable preference. It\u2019s not one I share, but I can certainly understand why a person might feel a rule like that would broaden and deepen their reading for a time.</p> <p>No one has a right to be read. No one has a right to be above criticism. When you publish a book, you enter the ring and you\u2019re going to take some punches. The sting when they hit tells you that you\u2019re where you want to be.</p> <h2><strong>Philip Hensher</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90664124edde6a43788027aaea9ae8f9c33aaf8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90664124edde6a43788027aaea9ae8f9c33aaf8d/0_338_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hensher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An attempt to put a stop to good writing on extra-literary moral grounds is deplorable, because it might succeed\u2019 \u2026 Philip Hensher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only thing worth saying about the issue of cultural appropriation is that it has nothing to do with identity, and everything about quality. Good writing can do whatever it feels like doing. Bad writing can\u2019t do anything. A bad writer can\u2019t tell you anything about his or her own culture, let alone anyone else\u2019s. A really good writer can throw themself into worlds they may only have glimpsed, and light them up.</p> <p>There is no point in getting much exercised about very bad writing: it puts a stop to itself in time. But any attempt to put a stop to very good writing, on the grounds of prejudice, or of extra-literary moral grounds, is deplorable because it might succeed. Not everything that deserves a hearing gets that hearing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think we should dismiss these concerns being labelled as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d, however. There is something discreditable about a straight woman giving her obviously inadequate version of gay male relations, or a rich American arts graduate giving his researched version of the country of his great-grandfathers, or a middle-class Londoner explaining what it is like to be an impoverished Nigerian immigrant. There\u2019s no doubt that prize juries have elevated such productions above the superior but disadvantaged accounts by gay male authors, Gujarati novelists, or that Nigerian immigrant himself. Those accounts may be lost forever.</p> <p>Authors should try harder; the industry should try harder; and nobody should assume that any book has any kind of right to its own subject. It has to be earned, whether it is a matter of a straight white woman living in Devon writing about straight white women living in Devon, or a gay man living in Switzerland in 2012 writing about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/20/scenes-from-early-life-review\">Bengali family in Dhaka</a> in the 1970s. I see no reason why writers should assume that any territory is theirs by inheritance. The key point is that as few extra-literary concerns as possible should stand in the way of good writers \u2013 not the claim that no one should ever write about experience not their own, nor the sustenance of ancient privileges of race, education, sexuality and class.</p> <p>Anyone proposing to use \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d as a taboo for writers is taking action against <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/100-best-novels-kim-rudyard-kipling\">Kim</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gustaveflaubert\">Salammb\u00f4</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dorislessing\">The Grass Is Singing</a></em>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/08/100-best-novels-bend-in-the-river-vs-naipaul-review\"> <em>A Bend in the River</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/angelacarter\">The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman</a></em>.

We have the invaluable chance to make our versions of reality public, and when these versions seem false to other people who don\u2019t have the same chance, it\u2019s fair for us to take their point to heart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/10/as-lionel-shriver-made-light-of-identity-i-had-no-choice-but-to-walk-out-on-her\">As Lionel Shriver made light of identity, I had no choice but to walk out on her | Yassmin Abdel-Magied</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why do writers write novels? On one level to have fun and feel free; but on another, to explore, to discover. One of the things we most enjoy exploring is other people\u2019s inner worlds, and so we make characters. Every character is in a way an invention, so a \u201clie\u201d; in another way, every character contains part of ourselves, but they also lead us down the mysterious passage to another life we long to understand. We feel our way into our characters until, effectively, we are them as we write them. This is very like the definition of empathy, or its German origin word, <em>einf\u00fchlung</em>, \u201cfeeling our way into another\u201d. All of us in some way are trying to understand, trying to see what we hold in common. We want to avoid building a narrow fictional world peopled with characters who are vain mirror-images of ourselves, so we walk the mile of the novel in a variety of different characters\u2019 shoes. But living through a fictional character is never as good as knowing actual joy or love, and never as bad as suffering actual pain or discrimination. With the freedom to inhabit different others, therefore, comes a price. The price is humility about what we know, a willingness to show our characters to their models and hear the critical comments they make.</p> <p>Two of my novels, the political comedies <em>My Cleaner</em> and <em>My Driver</em>, had a Ugandan central character, Mary Tendo, often written in the first person. I started writing the pair of novels in Uganda and surrounded by Ugandans, but of course I was not Ugandan. When I finished, back in the UK, I showed them to writer friends I had made in Uganda, Hilda Twongyeirwe and Jackee Batanda. They critiqued my work at length, and I listened. I feel an ongoing commitment to the Ugandan Women Writers\u2019 Association they belong to, Femrite, of which I am one of two external members.</p> <p>I am just off to the Calpe conference on Gibraltar\u2019s Neanderthals. They are the heroes of my next novel. I have 3% Neanderthal DNA, which is quite high, but that\u2019s not the point. I believe Neanderthals are essentially like us, like me, but only by learning about how they lived, and who they were, can I make others believe that too.</p> <h2><strong>Nikesh Shukla </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca32c695fb15220e4595f8cf4cdd3613002d5dc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca32c695fb15220e4595f8cf4cdd3613002d5dc2/65_152_1380_828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikesh Shukla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have the right to tell stories that are different from our own backgrounds, heritages, races, if we do it responsibly\u2019 \u2026 Nikesh Shukla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aria Alagha</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here are some tips for writing \u201cthe other\u201d. Do your research. Do it properly. Make sure someone from the \u201cother\u201d community reads your work before it gets read by someone with publishing power. Especially if the person with publishing power isn\u2019t from that community. Don\u2019t get defensive if people tell you that you got it wrong. Don\u2019t think you can hide behind \u201cit\u2019s fiction and I can do what I want\u201d because that tends to err on the side of fetishisation. I think we have the right to tell stories that are different from our own backgrounds, heritages, races, if we do them responsibly. I don\u2019t know why this is a hard thing to understand. Also, ask yourself: why am I telling this story? Why are there no stories out there written by people from that community? Did I find it easier to write about this because I filtered it through a white gaze and thus made it palatable for a largely white publishing industry? And most of all, and this bears repeating, don\u2019t get defensive. Because you may be making a larger conversation about marginalised communities, and their ability to tell their own stories in their own voices, all about yourself.</p>",

The budget was incredibly tight which meant I had zero management time and taught all week; this was before the luxury of PPA (the time that\u2019s set aside for teachers to do planning, preparation and assessment work). I always had a foot out of the door and an ear cocked for trouble in the corridor \u2013 even more so when I spent a term as acting headteacher when the excellent head was in hospital.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s when my downward spiral started. I\u2019d taken on a class where I had to field chairs being thrown at me, coerce one pupil from the roof and fend off physically abusive parents. I would become frustrated and angry when things went badly (being punched by a parent, the local authority demanding that results improve) and completely elated when things went well (transforming 30% of pupils achieving level 4 into 70%, seeing special educational needs and disaffected year 6 students performing Richard III).</p> <p>Within three years, I hit a wall. I went back to my hometown, to teach in a successful primary in a leafy, middle-class area. I thought it would give me a chance to work in a less stressful environment. I was wrong. The pressure \u2013 in school, from the government and families \u2013 was different, but equally debilitating. <br></p> <p>It was an outstanding school and the local education authority (LEA) had expectations. \u201cYours is one of the better schools,\u201d we were told. \u201cFor us to reach our target, we need you to up your Sats results, because the other schools in the area are rubbish.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing, but the message was clear. I made an initial impact and was expected to carry the year 6 can. It wasn\u2019t the school or the staff\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just the way things were and still are. </p> <p>Each morning I would wake up feeling sick to my stomach. I spent my lunchtimes alone, sitting outside in the street, struggling to eat the lunch I\u2019d prepared. There was just so much to do.</p> <p>After a spell in hospital, I was diagnosed with severe depression. School wasn\u2019t the only factor, but it tipped the balance. I was given months off work, saw psychiatrists and other mental-health professionals and had to fight to get back into the classroom nine months later. I managed it (in large part thanks to my now-wife, who I met through this illness) but it was a pyrrhic victory.</p> <p>The next eight years had some highs \u2013 days when I really thought I was \u201cwinning\u201d and that I\u2019d taught well \u2013 but there were also more lows. There were times when I felt I was sinking; my to-do list was never-ending and parents irrationally expected their children to be level-pegging with their peers without understanding that people children learn at different rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/oct/24/secret-teacher-couldnt-cope-full-time-teaching-fatherhood\">Secret Teacher: I couldn't cope with  full-time teaching and fatherhood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When my son was born two years ago, I realised that family is more important to me than the increasingly demanding job that teaching has become.

It is possible that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">May</a> could use her opening speech to name the month she will trigger article 50, which will trigger the two-year countdown to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.</p> <p>Senior EU figures have been told in private the prime minister wants to trigger the formal start of talks early in the new year, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/27/brexit-weekly-briefing-theresa-may-3-three-brexiteers-0\">so far she has refused to confirm this in public</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/article-50-brexit-debate-britain-eu\">What is article 50 and why is it so central to the Brexit debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure not to name a date is intense due to the government\u2019s acknowledgement that the UK\u2019s negotiating position would have to be outlined in the formal letter issued to trigger article 50. By naming the date she plans to send a letter to Brussels, the prime minister would set herself on an irreversible course before the cabinet has agreed its negotiating objectives.</p> <p>There is worry among pro-remain Conservatives that May\u2019s relative silence on the details of Brexit is giving too much airtime to Fox, the trade secretary and arch-eurosceptic. Fox has hinted he favours a \u201chard Brexit\u201d that would see the UK give up the benefits of the single market but allow it to limit immigration from the EU.</p> <p>It is understood that Conservatives from the pro-remain wing of the party are planning to put pressure on the government over Brexit during the four-day conference by calling for a more concrete plans, especially to allay business worries.<br></p> <p>One senior Tory MP said: \u201cI think the PM will find that \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 is quickly losing its value, and needs to be replaced by some more concrete details \u2013 fast. It is beginning to look vacuous and like she is playing for time.\u201d</p> <p>Some Tory MPs, however, took a different view about pressure on May to set a firmer timetable for leaving the EU, including Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and remain campaigner. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the party conference is a place where the prime minister should feel pressured to set out her stall when she\u2019s got a great deal of work still to do on Brexit before article 50 is invoked,\u201d he told the Guardian. Grieve is among those warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is a very high risk strategy and put the UK\u2019s economy and jobs at risk.</p> <p>Fox\u2019s grasp of trade law also came under attack from Sir David Edward, a former judge in the European court of justice who is advising the Scottish government on Brexit. Edward challenged Fox\u2019s claim that the UK would keep the EU\u2019s existing tariff schedule when it leaves the bloc.</p> <p>\u201cNobody who understands trade law could have possibly have said what he said,\u201d he told an MLex Competition conference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/22/brexit-means-brexit-when-is-big-question\">Brexit means Brexit \u2026 but the big question is when?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd as an economist has said, there is no such thing in today\u2019s world as free trade or a free trade agreement, there is only managed trade or participation in a regulated market, and that is quite important. The notion that we can get back to some kind of Victorian liberal notion of totally free trade I think is totally misleading.\u201d <br></p> <p>Eurosceptics including Iain Duncan Smith and pro-Europeans such as Nicky Morgan have urged May to provide clarity on the start of negotiations, while European leaders ranging from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, have drawn a blank in private discussions with her on the shape of her UK exit plans.</p> <p>Most are content with article 50 being triggered in early 2017, as this gives time for the UK to leave before the next round of elections to the European parliament in 2019.</p> <p>The key trade-off remains whether access to the single market will include free movement for European migrant workers, some form of judicial oversight from EU courts, and contributions \u2013 voluntary or otherwise \u2013 to Brussels\u2019 budget.</p> <p>As ministers continued to insist they would not be giving a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on Brexit, Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, hinted that the government could be considering a work permit system for different sectors.</p> <p>In an interview with the FT, he said he could not predict \u201cwhat the future might look like in terms of work visas and foreign workers\u201d, but added that the construction sector would not face a skills shortage because of the exclusion of builders from EU countries.</p> <p>\u201cWherever we end up, the government is determined to get a good deal for Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s construction or any other sector, we don\u2019t want to make it any more difficult for those industries than it is.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Hammond confirmed that high-skilled workers will not be excluded from the country after Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThe message that I want to send to business is that whatever solution we end up, whatever control powers we have over immigration into the UK, we will use them responsibly,\u201d the chancellor said <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/30/philip-hammond-businesses-angering-consumers-by-not-listening-ov/\">in an interview with the Daily Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe will use them in a way that supports the UK economy and we will certainly not use them to shut out highly skilled people \u2013 whether they are bankers or software engineers or managers in global companies \u2013 from the UK when their presence is supporting inward investment and growth in our economy.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said he believed that the majority who had backed Brexit in the referendum had given the government a mandate to protect the economy as well as to reduce immigration.</p> <p>\u201cIt may not have been stated explicitly but it\u2019s implicit. And that is that they do not want to see the economy suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not want to see jobs lost, they do not want to see standards of living decline. So they will expect us to negotiate a solution which delivers the key elements of leaving the EU, regaining our sovereignty, getting control over our borders \u2013 but they will expect us to do all of that in a way that allows the UK economy to go on growing.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hammond is thought to be fighting the case within the cabinet for a deal that retains as much access to the single market as possible, against colleagues who would rather push for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d deal that distances the UK further from EU trade rules in order to achieve tougher controls on migration. </p>",
  "<p>Even before the first frost, <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/native-trees/ash/\">ash trees</a> along the<a href=\"http://www.teifiriverstrust.com/?page_id=387\"> Teifi gorge</a> are taking on the pale autumn tints that are prelude to their fall. The river here roils darkly down to salt-marshes round Cardigan, its depths brown and turbid with slurry run-off, tide-lines blanched by agrochemical pollutant along each bank, dippers and wagtails gone, birds silent in the woods, the life departed. Salmon, sewin (sea trout) and <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/brown-trout\">brown trout</a>, which once drew anglers and coracle-fishers to this place, raise scarcely a ripple now on the smooth and dying flow. </p> <p> I\u2019ve come to look for ash-keys, which vary so much from year to year.

  "<p>Rory McIlroy insisted the European team mood is \u201cbuoyant\u201d after an afternoon Ryder Cup recovery took Darren Clarke\u2019s men from a morning deficit of 4-0 to 5-3 by close of play on day one at Hazeltine. McIlroy, who celebrated in emphatic style after converting an eagle putt on the 16th green to seal a third point for Europe, admitted to being inspired in part by a \u201chostile\u201d home crowd.</p> <p>A clean sweep of the morning foursomes meant Europe needed something special in the second session and they duly delivered it. McIlroy and Thomas Pieters defeated Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Rafa Cabrera Bello saw off JB Holmes and Ryan Moore after Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson had atoned for an earlier defeat by Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed. It was McIlroy who seemed to capture reinvigorated European sentiment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/30/ryder-cup-europe-usa-5-3-rory-mcilroy\">Rory McIlroy brings Europe\u2019s stirring Ryder Cup comeback against USA to life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs you could probably imagine, the mood in the team room just there was quite buoyant and we definitely feel like there was a shift in momentum this afternoon,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cHopefully we can carry that into tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s celebration \u2013 he bowed to the notably partisan home crowd \u2013 was pre-meditated. \u201cI bowed to them, said, \u2018You\u2019re welcome for the show\u2019 and we move on,\u201d added the four-times major winner.</p> <p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s a hostile environment out there and I just want everyone that\u2019s watching out there to know how much this means to us, how much it means to me personally and obviously us as a team.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going down without a fight. It was four-zip after the morning. We\u2019ve pulled it back a good bit and we plan to pull it back even further going into tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hostile environment that the people out there don\u2019t want you to hole a putt. They don\u2019t want you to hit a good shot.
