The fate of British-born generations of painted ladies was a mystery until recently, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/19991550\">when radar finally documented</a> how they ascend to great heights before beginning their reverse migration.</p> <p>The painted lady is constantly on the move \u2013 and how far it moves <a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/home/-/asset_publisher/T2caeLMECPvW/content/id/5991398/maximized#.V-zapTYrKhc\">has only just been discovered by scientists</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/01/baffling-decline-small-tortoiseshell-butterfly-butterflywatch\">Baffling decline of the small tortoiseshell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its route between Europe and Morocco is well understood, but biologists <a href=\"http://www.gerardtalavera.com/\">Gerard Talavera</a> and <a href=\"http://biologiaevolutiva.org/rvila/Lab/Home.html\">Roger Vila</a> have now revealed the painted lady can cross the Sahara desert and breed in the tropical African savannah.</p> <p>Like the famous North American monarch, the painted lady undertakes its journeys in relays, one butterfly pausing and quickly reproducing \u2013 moving from egg to butterfly in eight weeks \u2013 before its offspring continues the migration. But Talavera and Vila, of <a href=\"https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/\">Barcelona\u2019s Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> and Harvard University, have calculated that an individual painted lady can travel 4,000km \u2013 further than a monarch.</p> <p>The (lucky) lepidopterists spent autumn travelling across Senegal, Benin, Chad and Ethiopia in search of painted ladies, observing more than 20,000 emerging from chrysalises on the shores of the Niger river in Benin.</p> <p>Such extreme migration looks like a difficult lifestyle choice for a butterfly, but the painted lady neatly solves the problem of too-cold European winters and too-dry African summers. To do so, it needs strength, but also supreme adaptability: its caterpillar\u2019s ability to feed on a wide variety of foodplants has made it the world\u2019s most cosmopolitan butterfly.</p>",

Arguably despite this deal, supply will continue to outstrip demand, while US production will likely fill the gap with increased output as price rises.

It is also worth noting that Saudi Arabia\u2019s output usually ebbs after the domestic peak in demand in the summer, so a production cut may have little impact on the country\u2019s exports.<br></li> <li><strong>A final risk for OPEC is that higher prices, if sustained, risk incentivising production outside OPEC, notably in the US</strong>.

This time is different.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia is betting that a small cut will pay for itself through higher oil prices and hence higher revenues,\u201d said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the pump-at-will policy hasn\u2019t had its moments. Saudi Arabia has achieved some of its objectives. Low prices tossed water on the U.S. oil boom, and energy companies have cut as much as $1 trillion in new projects, creating a possible supply hole in the next decade. The kingdom has also scared investors who are now more likely to think twice before plunging money into risky oil ventures. And from the U.S. to China, sales of gas-guzzling cars have soared, bolstering demand.</p> <p>For all the justifications, the last two years haven\u2019t panned out as Riyadh thought they would. At home, the kingdom has burned through more than $150 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, government contractors have gone unpaid, and this week the king announced unprecedented pay cuts for civil servants.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/in-u-turn-saudis-pick-cash-over-flirting-with-free-oil-markets\">In U-Turn, Saudis Choose Higher Prices Over Free Oil Markets</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ecd018e4b07eb0f44b8519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:30.987Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another interesting chart, from Morgan Stanley, showing how Opec can struggle to stick to its production targets (the blue line):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Opec?src=hash\">#Opec</a> Intervention Not As Good As It Sounds as there is a history of cheating. <a href=\"https://t.co/sLcudBR2Qf\">pic.twitter.com/sLcudBR2Qf</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:44.961Z\">at 9.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eccd1ce4b07eb0f44b8509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:18:06.871Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t terribly impressed with the Opec deal either, and aren\u2019t changing their oil price forecasts.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goldman </strong>analysts still expect US crude oil (or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ) to hover around $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017.</p> <p>They told clients that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>But there\u2019s also no guarantee that Opec members will stick to the script, as:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cCompliance to quotas is historically poor, especially when oil demand is not weak.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/28/goldman-sachs-opec-production-cut-deal-doesnt-change-oil-price-forecasts-through-2017.html\">CNBC has more details</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goldman Sachs: OPEC oil deal doesn&#39;t change our price outlook <a href=\"https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP\">https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP</a></p>&mdash; Carolin Roth (@CarolinCNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eccb2ae4b0c6325341f21a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:10:03.994Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f/0_0_3900_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The national flag of Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Just in...

  "<p>The problem with golf\u2019s time in the spotlight is the recent propensity for that focus to be negative. Never before has this sport, apparently in the midst of a scrap for relevance and identity, so needed a scintillating Ryder Cup. All that is good about golf, from the values it provides to the scope for such a wide range of society to partake in it, has been lost in an unfavourable swirl.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/tiger-woods-usa-tactician-ryder-cup-2016-hazeltine\">Tiger Woods tucks into his new role as the USA team\u2019s resident tactician</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tale of woe is a lengthy one. Global attention understandably diverted towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/muirfield-golf-club-votes-to-continue-excluding-women\">Muirfield\u2019s preposterous refusal to admit female members in May</a>. The dust had barely settled on that embarrassing farce when another one ensued, Dustin Johnson\u2019s winning of the US Open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jun/20/dustin-johnson-us-open-win-spoiled-usga-rules-farce\">overshadowed by a rules episode at Oakmont</a>. In both scenarios golf as a whole was turned into a laughing stock.</p> <p>The sport\u2019s troubles did not end there. Golf\u2019s Olympic return may, after a 112-year absence, have proved a pleasant surprise and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/14/justin-rose-olympic-games-golf-gold-medal-great-britain-rio-2016\">produced a stunning conclusion</a> but the level of reluctance that preceded Rio involvement was the key narrative. This is linked to a wider point: the game\u2019s desire to form part of the Olympic movement partly resonated in the need to retain or claim global prominence.</p> <p>Nike\u2019s position in the golf market had been defined by sponsorship of Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy before the sudden announcement that the manufacturing of clubs and balls would cease. One presumes Nike\u2019s senior figures know enough about the validity of different sports for their lack of interest in golf to cause alarm. Likewise the golf wing of Adidas, TaylorMade, has been on the market for a year without any buyer coming forward.</p> <p>If these offer prime areas for concern, they are not alone. Golf has become painfully slow at the elite level, to the extent where this negatively influences amateurs. Middle-aged men have migrated to cycling. There has been the desire for some time to provide a shortened form without anyone properly squaring that particular circle. The European Tour\u2019s announcement within the past fortnight of a modified tournament next February flirted far too closely with gimmick. That such radical alterations to competition are deemed necessary in the first place is hardly a positive.</p> <p>The impact weather had on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/31/jimmy-walker-jason-day-us-pga\">this year\u2019s US PGA Championship at Baltusrol</a> may be beyond administrators but the scheduling of that final major is not. The event lacks substance, partly because it is placed far too close to the Open Championship and partly because it seems too much like a standard PGA Tour stop. The option to move the US PGA to another country, as was mooted, should have been grasped rather than discarded.</p> <p>So there is no pressure on this Ryder Cup, then. Here we have an occasion that has grown into a ferocious commercial beast. It is more partisan, more akin to standard team sports by way of spectator engagement, than ever before. For all the platitudes and mutual backslapping, there is a deep-rooted hardness within the mind-set of McIlroy, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Danny Willett just as applies to Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/29/danny-willett-hopes-to-leave-behind-brothers-comments-on-us-fans-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/558gf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2761899\"            data-video-name=\"Danny Willett hopes to leave behind brother\u2019s comments on US fans \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ed73a2e4b07f65489d84fa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/29/160929dannywillets_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/29/160929dannywillets_V3.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/29/160929dannywillets.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/sep/29/danny-willett-hopes-to-leave-behind-brothers-comments-on-us-fans-video\">Danny Willett hopes to leave behind brother\u2019s comments on US fans</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The captains are intriguing characters. Darren Clarke\u2019s danger lies in the potential for overreaction to falling short of perfection. Davis Love III appears rather keen to keep everyone happy, to the extent where statesmanlike leading from the front has not been particularly evident. Love has plenty of voices telling him where to turn.</p> <p>\u201cThis team has never played together before,\u201d stressed Love in relation to poor recent results. \u201cIt\u2019s 12 strong guys and we\u2019re looking to the future. You\u2019ve heard it over and over again from us; we\u2019re really proud of this team. We\u2019re excited about it.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke has had to temper the continuation of a successful European template with what would be a natural desire to make his own mark. Clarke employed the Irish rugby legend Paul O\u2019Connell to speak to Europe\u2019s players this week, with a two-theme message delivered. That related to playing away from home and working collectively, the latter especially applicable to those who have an indifference towards players they call team-mates for one week of every two-year cycle.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a fulfilling role,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s one that I\u2019m really enjoying but there\u2019s a lot of preparation that goes into it. Whenever we actually get here, after a year and a half of planning, to see that come to fruition, it\u2019s wonderful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/29/rider-cup-2016-diary-phil-mickelson-justin-rose\">Ryder Cup 2016 Diary: Phil Mickelson deploys bizarre backtrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHas there been anything to change my mind?

Where else do opposing sides, let alone those featuring global superstars, share a hotel? By close of play both teams will be partying the night away in the same room while donning daft wigs.</p> <p>The serious aspect relates to the deep desire of the United States to win, at long last. They are rightfully favourites by virtue of, at base level, the stronger team and the superior collection of putters. It is on the greens \u2013 these ones are particularly glass-like \u2013 that so many Ryder Cups are won and lost.</p> <p>Still the bounce in Europe\u2019s step has been obvious, assisted partly by McIlroy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/rory-mcilroy-fedex-cup-tour-championship-ryder-cup\">memorable claiming of the FedEx Cup</a> on Sunday and comments emanating from the hosts that offer decent motivation. Clarke and his team have a quiet confidence that contrasts with the United States; there, motivation can bleed into desperation pretty easily.</p> <p>Hazeltine is not particularly pretty, nor would it feature on any bucket list of courses in the United States. They could, however, play the Ryder Cup in a car park for all the venue truly matters. The crowd and atmosphere are what set the Ryder Cup apart, not the nuances of par-fives and semi-rough.</p> <p>Predictions are a fool\u2019s errand. So here it is: the United States will have reclaimed the Ryder Cup when Sunday darkness falls. That outcome would do the event a favour. Special entertainment would offer likewise to this sport itself.</p>",
  "<p>What does Gary Johnson know?

In the most terrifying election of my lifetime, we must face head-on the system we\u2019ve created. It\u2019s one that rewards sloganeering, platitudes and retweets.

Any kind of hiring that opens up to biases is not working.\u201d </p> <p>Lerner said that using the anonymous interviewing tool helps neutralize those biases by allowing employers to \u201cfocus primarily and exclusively on whether that person can write code or not\u201d.</p> <p>She also pointed out that all candidates need to use the tool, not only the women. \u201cIn order for anonymity to be viable it has to be full anonymity.\u201d </p> <p>Greathouse\u2019s article makes the implicit argument that fixing gender bias is the responsibility of women, not men.

  "<p>There is a picture on Instagram that perfectly captures the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/09/vogue-blogger-takedown\" title=\"\">current row</a> about who decides what is fashion. The dispute is between Vogue magazine, fashion\u2019s ultimate arbiter for the last 100 years, and the fashion bloggers regarded by their millions of social media followers as the real deal. The picture, posted by the blogger <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carolinevreeland/\" title=\"\">Caroline Vreeland,</a> was taken during Milan\u2019s fashion week. <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/09/vogue-criticism-bryanboy-susie-bubble\" title=\"\">It shows</a> the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour, timelessly chic, being followed down the street by a much younger woman in <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/london-fashion-week-street-style-shop-the-look-2016\" title=\"\">a shiny vinyl coat</a>, black shorts and fishnets. She is pointing and laughing at Ms Wintour\u2019s unresponsive back. Street style challenges high fashion; digital unsettles analogue; democracy threatens elite.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/vogue-editors-declare-war-fashion-bloggers\">Vogue editors accused of hypocrisy after declaring war on fashion bloggers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one way this is a familiar story, an everyday tale of the brutal disruption of an old business model by a new one. Vogue\u2019s accountants will undoubtedly have a nasty headache from the financial success of a handful of bloggers such as Susie Bubble and Chiara Ferragni, young entrepreneurs who have monetised their personalities by turning their online presence into brands and their millions of followers into a market for their own lines of shoes or swimwear. The bloggers have brilliantly exploited the capacity of social media to be a global platform for free-spirited creativity: now Vogue accuses them of selling out to commerce.</p> <p>Some of Vogue\u2019s criticisms verge on the petulant; but the accusation that the bloggers are selling out goes to the heart of a real debate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/vogue-editors-declare-war-fashion-bloggers\" title=\"\">Posing for photographers in paid-to-wear fashion</a>, as some do, rather than taking selfies showing off their own style, says Vogue, \u201cheralds the death of style\u201d. The bloggers, laughing and pointing again, note that Vogue itself depends on close commercial relationships with the major fashion brands. Bloggers, in contrast, build their brand on being real people, wearing real clothes; they see themselves as self-created style celebrities and entrepreneurs. For them, Vogue\u2019s attack is motivated by envy of the way their authenticity has usurped traditional authority, directly challenging glossy magazines such as Vogue, whose historic genius is to put together fantastical, highly staged images that are as desirable as they are remote from reality.</p> <p>Vogue\u2019s real response to the challenge was to adapt the \u201creal\u201d appeal of the digital fashionistas for itself. The high-street fashion chain H&amp;M is at it too. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/28/hm-advert-diversity-ad-women\" title=\"\">latest commercial</a> features a diverse mix of models and bloggers (and an almost subliminal glimpse of a hairy armpit) set to a version of the Tom Jones song She\u2019s a Lady. Fashion houses now often tear up invitations to the fashion editors and put the bloggers on the front row, final proof that authenticity is the new authority.</p> <p>But if the bloggers are becoming enmeshed in the world of big business, they may have set the clock running on their claim to authenticity. Their success depended on their ability to sell themselves as unique personalities acting autonomously. They are not all conventionally good-looking, they claim to be Anyone, living in Anytown. Now they are becoming recognised celebrities, sought out by the industry, and they are changing from creative artists into commercial players. For a fleeting moment they democratised fashion. Now it looks very much as if they may be becoming another elite, new and young \u2013 but an elite just the same.</p>",
  "<p>You are correct to call on the government to pause its \u201cmisconceived higher education bill\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-universities-facing-a-double-whammy\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 23 September). The uncertainty over Brexit is reason enough, but we would argue your concerns over the arrival of a Trump university must be not be overlooked \u2013 especially with the bill so keen to allow the for-profit companies circling UK higher education greater access to our sector. The government\u2019s own adviser, Alison Wolf, has warned of an impending \u201cAmerican-style catastrophe\u201d should the bill go through, stating her concerns that the number of poor-quality colleges would increase, the reputation of higher education would be damaged and students would pile up considerable debt to obtain worthless degrees.</p> <p>The higher education bill sets out the government\u2019s argument that insufficient competition and lack of informed choice are the primary weaknesses of the higher education system in England, and that opening up the market to new providers will drive improvements in quality. In reality, competition increases the pressure on institutions to spend money on cosmetic improvements and gimmicks rather than front-line delivery. In the US, for example, competition between providers led to increased spend on marketing and recruitment, with for-profit institutions spending 22.7% of revenue on this area \u2013 5% more than is spent on teaching.</p> <p>Making it easier for new private providers to obtain degree-awarding powers is at odds with the primacy of academic quality and the protection of students\u2019 interests, since new institutions will not have to prove their quality and robustness through building up a track record. As you quite rightly point out, the government should pause. This is no time to upend one of our most successful exports.<br><strong>Sally Hunt</strong><br><em>General secretary, University and College Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 The higher education bill is still subject to scrutiny by MPs and has yet to be considered by the House of Lords. Your critique is therefore timely, if incomplete. Theresa May\u2019s assertion that all universities must sponsor a school in order to charge their students higher fees (made necessary as a result of the decisions by ministers to cut the direct funding of universities in England) adds to the concerns. A government that is avowedly free-market is about to impose a regulatory framework that will undermine the autonomy of universities, reduce the criteria for university title and split responsibility for sector oversight of teaching and research between two new organisations, the Office of Students and UK Research and Innovation.</p> <p>The principle of autonomy has been supported by all previous governments, including the last Conservative government. It has underpinned the capacity of UK universities to innovate, reach out to new markets, trade globally and provide a high-quality education to students of all ages for whom studying for a degree would have been but a distant dream a generation ago.</p> <p>Brexit only adds to the challenges but there is no reason to let the government off the hook and assume that EU students need to be classified as international students in the future. Trade with the EU in higher education services and research are worth billions to the UK economy and add to the cultural and social capital of students and staff. Temporary residency or citizenship for EU students are both possibilities that need to be explored.<br><strong>Pam Tatlow</strong><br><em>Chief executive, MillionPlus, The Association for Modern Universities</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is more important than ever to highlight the social, cultural and economic benefits people from Europe and the wider world bring to our universities and the rest of the UK. There is a risk that the result of the EU referendum has led some to question the value the UK places on global connectivity. UK universities are and will always be international, diverse and welcoming of people from all corners of the globe. Now, more than ever, the sector should be vocal in promoting this. More than 436,000 overseas students support a global, outward-looking culture on campuses which, in turn, benefits UK students. Overseas students and staff make our universities stronger, richer and more vibrant.

Nine countries do so, the commission said, including Britain which applies an upper limit in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where the funds generated are generally spent on rural development projects.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government chooses not to apply a ceiling in England,\u201d the commission said, adding that repeated proposals for more radical reform \u2013 including a compulsory ceiling on basic payments to large landowners \u2013 have \u201cconsistently been watered down by national ministers\u201d.</p> <p>Brussels sources said Britain played a leading part in a small group of EU members that opposed the measure. As a result, a major 2014 CAP reform package did not include a compulsory upper limit \u2013 but left open an optional ceiling that could be applied at national level. </p> <p>Beeswax Farming (Rainbow) Ltd, which Dyson owns, received almost \u00a31.5m, while Prince Khalid Abdullah Al Saud, the owner of champion racehorse Frankel, got nearly \u00a3407,000 for his Juddmonte Farms, owned through an offshore holding company in Guernsey.</p> <p>Sandringham Farms, the estate owned by the Queen, received \u00a3557,707, while Grosvenor Farms Ltd, which farms the Duke of Westminster\u2019s estate, raked in \u00a3437,434.

It\u2019s clear that there cannot be a business-as-usual approach to farm subsidies after we leave the EU. Some of the recipients of these subsidies are doing great work which benefits our environment \u2013 but others are not \u2013 and it makes no sense that the CAP\u2019s largest subsidy payments don\u2019t distinguish between the two.\u201d</p> <p>Greenpeace said the top 100 received \u00a387.9m in agricultural subsidies last year, of which \u00a361.2m came from the single payment scheme, where the size of the land owned largely determines the grant amount: more than the bottom 55,119 recipients in the single payment scheme received together. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThe secretary of state has underlined the need for continuity for farmers and together with her ministerial team is looking forward to working with industry, rural communities and the wider public to shape our plans for food, farming and the environment outside the EU.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The UK has signed its \u00a318bn contract with France and China to build the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, giving the final go-ahead for construction at the site in Somerset.</p> <p>The deal was finalised at a low-key ceremony in London, just two months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> alarmed her French and Chinese counterparts by putting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">entire project under review</a>. EDF, the French nuclear contractor, and its Chinese partners had to cancel their previous plans for a signing ceremony at the last minute when the review was announced in July.</p> <p>The project finally got approval this month, after Greg Clark, the business secretary, announced there would be some new restrictions on future investments in critical infrastructure if there were national security concerns.</p> <p>Clark attended the signing ceremony on behalf of the UK, alongside Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, the chairman of EDF, and He Yu, chair of China General Nuclear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/hinkley-point-c-developers-face-72bn-cleanup-bill-at-end-of-nuclear-plants-life\">Hinkley Point C developers face \u00a37.2bn cleanup bill at end of nuclear plant's life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The business secretary said it was a \u201ccrucial moment in the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station for a generation and follows new measures put in place by government to strengthen security and ownership\u201d. The event was also attended by Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, and Nur Bekri, a senior official at the National Energy Administration of China.</p> <p>He Yu said it signifies \u201cCGN\u2019s commitment to the UK as one of the world\u2019s leading developers and operators of nuclear power. This flagship programme is a triple win for China, Britain, and France and is a culmination of years of cooperation between the three countries. CGN looks forward to providing UK consumers with safe, reliable and sustainable energy and maximising opportunities for UK suppliers and the UK workforce.\u201d</p> <p>Unions welcomed the development, saying thousands of skilled jobs would now be created, benefiting firms across the UK. It is expected to produce 7GW of electricity when fully operational, enough to power 6m homes and provide 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity needs for 60 years.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/\">Greenpeace</a> said it was \u201cno wonder the UK government has opted for a \u2018champagne-free\u2019 signing ceremony away from public view\u201d. </p> <p>The environmental group said: \u201cWith a stroke of the pen ministers are signing away billions of pounds of billpayers\u2019 money to a project they know is plagued by legal, financial and technical problems. In the unlikely event Hinkley is working some time in the second half of the next decade, renewable energy will be much cheaper, yet British consumers will still be forced to pay over the odds for nuclear power. It\u2019ll be like being locked into an expensive fixed-rate mortgage as interest rates plummet.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new controls, EDF will not be able to sell on its stake in Hinkley without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a \u201cspecial share\u201d that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns.</p> <p>In a sign the new requirements do not appear to be overly stringent, both EDF and CGN said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed would let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK in future.</p> <p>The government published documents detailing the contractual obligations it has entered into, including a \u201cvalue for money assessment\u201d that allowed ministers to make the decision to proceed with the project. According to the documents, UK-based businesses would benefit from more than 60% of the cost of the project and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships would be created during construction and after its opening.</p> <p>Justin Bowden, the GMB union\u2019s national secretary for energy, said: \u201cWith collective sighs of relief all round, it is fantastic news that the Hinkley deal is finally signed and work can start on this vital piece of UK infrastructure. </p> <p>\u201cThe formal go-ahead for Hinkley is the first serious sign that UK plc is open for business post-Brexit and holding a secret ceremony did not do justice to such a historic event.

  "<p>Nicolas Jaar approaches our interview with the wariness of an artist who suspects those writing about him have not always been well informed. After walking into the Brooklyn coffee shop where we meet, he asks: \u201cHave you heard my record?\u201d Then, not long after: \u201cWhen did you get the record?\u201d And finally: \u201cWhat did you think of the record?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/29/nicolas-jaar-sirens-review\">Nicolas Jaar: Sirens review \u2013 electronic noodling hypnotises, frustrates, dazzles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I answer him directly. Sirens, the official follow-up to the 26-year-old\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/10/nicolas-jaar-space-only-noise-review\">2011 electronic breakout Space Is Only Noise</a>, is a focused and surprising album that builds on Jaar\u2019s talent for crafting spacious, occasionally danceable soundscapes. The appearance of political commentary and dark humour herald an advance in the Chilean/American DJ/producer/songwriter\u2019s sometimes insular aesthetic. The album\u2019s opening and closing tracks reference the ravages of political inequality: Killing Time introduces the record with the words: \u201cI think we\u2019re just out of time/Says the officer to the kids/Ahmed was almost 15 and handcuffed.\u201d Then there is a shift of scene, and perspective, and the addition of a bass-heavy percussive trudge to the gallows: \u201cBut comfort says we\u2019re fine/And Angela said to open the door/Money, it seems, needs its working class.\u201d</p> <p>The closing track, History Lesson, satirically surveys the low likelihood of accountability for various crimes against humanity. In between these uncommonly direct statements, Jaar delves into the more personal concerns that have animated his previous work. It is as if facing up to the grimness of certain global realities can\u2019t be done, each and every hour of the day.</p> <p>Jaar brightens when I say: \u201cYou [started] with what I feel like is the crux of the whole thing.\u201d He says the album is, in part, the result of becoming bored with his own self-obsession. \u201cI felt I cannot be talking about me, me, me \u2013 my feelings, my private thing. When I had finished Pomegranates and Nymphs \u2013 two records that I made in between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 my first thought was: these records are extremely personal to me. They\u2019re about my own experience as one human being.\u201d With Sirens, he \u201cwanted to really look out \u2013 but then weirdly, when I started looking out, I started looking even deeper in somehow. And that was a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Other surprises include the lack of sampling. Aside from a \u201csong from the Andes mountains\u201d (included on the track No) and a vintage audio recording of Jaar and his father talking, just before his parents\u2019 separation \u2013 a reference to an oft-reported source of his melancholy \u2013 every sound on the standard edition of Sirens is pure Jaar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A0tUJcqDuXHNkaPKLN0lQhT\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0tUJcqDuXHNkaPKLN0lQhT\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Though Sirens mixes languages and styles, it has a sonic throughline, thanks to Jaar\u2019s reliance on modular synths and selective approach to sampling. \u201cWith Space, if I wanted a snare, I would fucking go steal a snare,\u201d he says. \u201cI just like took a bunch of sounds from shit.\u201d For Sirens, he envisioned a \u201ca multiplicity of voices\u201d in the service of a coherent sound. \u201cIf you maybe just listen to it on a surface level, it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s the reggaeton song and then there\u2019s the punk song,\u2019\u201d Jaar says. \u201cI hope we can go a little deeper than that.\u201d</p> <p>He credits a stint teaching at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music in 2015 for helping him think about his approach. \u201cI took the job but I was like: I\u2019m going to hang out with these people. I don\u2019t know what I could ever teach to these people. Some of them were more advanced than me. It was really humbling and fun.\u201d But in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, says Jaar, \u201cThe only question I was excited about, for whatever reason, in the moment, was: Can \u2013 or should \u2013 electronic music be political? Can we protest through instrumental music, for example? And how would you do that?\u201d</p> <p>Jaar says one of his students \u201cwas seen as maybe a similar ethnicity\u201d to the perpetrators of the violence, and felt profiled in the community in its aftermath. \u201cThat\u2019s what he talked about. We were like how would you even \u2013 or why would we \u2013 put that into music? I have more questions about it now. I\u2019m excited to see what this record does out in the world. Are people gonna take it as: \u2018We don\u2019t need this in music\u2019? Or as: \u2018We already think this. So why are you talking?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"996afc055e2dd5b891518e2435f701c0df0e868b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/996afc055e2dd5b891518e2435f701c0df0e868b/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaar performing at the Barbican in London in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaar performing at the Barbican in London in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hex/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also says he will welcome negative responses to Sirens. Noting that he has navigated his way through several releases with a side-project feel \u2013 an ambient record (Pomegranates), a series of singles (Nymphs) and his Darkside band (a collaboration with guitarist Dave Harrington) \u2013 Jaar says he has tried to put elements from all those efforts to use on the new record. \u201cI\u2019m just not there yet. I failed at doing a combination of \u2018looking out,\u2019 still being as experimental, being as emotive as the Nymphs series is, potentially. It\u2019s just this path, this formula that I\u2019m trying to get.\u201d</p> <p>Failure is something he feels \u201con an emotional level, more than a theoretical\u201d one. \u201cWhen I was making Pomegranates, for example, I failed at doing the kind of ambient record I really wanted to do. But I have this [thought] in me: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to make the next one.\u2019 I already know the title of the next ambient record.\u201d</p> <p>He talks of his differing musical identities and the attempt to make them cohere, but says he has realised that coherence doesn\u2019t matter: \u201cHow do I reconcile these things? And now I\u2019m realising: fuck reconciling.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sirens is released tomorrow.</em></p>",
  "<h2>ON THE WAYNE</h2> <p>Big Vase strugglers Manchester United will attempt to put themselves back on the European map tonight by beating Zorya Luhansk. That sounds like an oxymoron and the Fiver would welcome a cheap laugh in return. But, as it happens, Zorya are are likely to be stronger opponents than you might, what with them representing Luhansk, a city that is a victim of Russian militants\u2019 attempts to redraw the aforementioned European map. That\u2019s got to increase the Ukrainian team\u2019s determination to make as good an impression at Old Trafford as they did when drawing 1-1 with Fenerbahce in their first group match, which was held in a temporary home. What is more, Zorya\u2019s players have reportedly not been paid for six months. All in all, then, their players have a wealth of motivation to excel on their visit to a country where people can allegedly earn anything from \u00a355,000 to \u00a3400,000 just to gallivant around the world chatting about football.</p> <p>It is important to retain a sense of perspective about these things, of course. Zorya\u2019s plight is thrown into sharp relief by the travails of United players such as Wayne Rooney, who has recently had to put up with people noticing his abysmal performances. He also had a bit of a sore back earlier in the week. Under the circumstances, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho thinks it may be cruel to ask the 30-year-old to play this evening. </p> <p>\u201cI am here to protect him, not to put him into difficult situations,\u201d sobbed Mourinho. \u201cWith the situation now created around him he really cannot afford to have a performance that is not really good. I have to analyse if the best thing for him is to start the game. If he is not totally ready for it and I will discuss it with the player and the medical staff, he might start on the bench.\u201d Surely we can all agree that that is the best place for him.</p> <p>The Special One, then, intends to deploy a powerful lineup, as he knows that it is not only Rooney who risks incurring more flak in the event of another inept performance like the ones that preceded last weekend\u2019s blip against Leicester City. \u201cI would say we have to win all of the next four matches, which is difficult,\u201d declared the Portuguese polemicist. \u201cFrom now on the approach will be different, I will be putting more of my key players on the pitch. It is very important that we win.\u201d And win they probably will. Otherwise the Special One can look forward to another wave of Einsteins\u2019 theories. </p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Jacob Steinberg for Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva 1-1 Southampton at 6pm BST and then check in with Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for white hot MBM coverage of Manchester United 2-0 Zorya Luhansk.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d94a1e57df309f02b9401a8aae59b55463088806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d94a1e57df309f02b9401a8aae59b55463088806/0_131_7003_4201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw Evans/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy answer would be a big fat no\u201d \u2013 Chris Coleman succinctly sums up the allure of the England job.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY (PART DEUX)</h2> <p>\u201cSo sorry for this story big sam!

The evidence ranges from outdoor play patterns established in childhood being directly linked with adult health to <a href=\"http://lhhl.illinois.edu/girls_self-discipline.htm\" title=\"\">a study</a> demonstrating that girls\u2019 self-discipline improves if they have views of trees and vegetation at home. Most adults can pin formative experiences in their youth to a playground, a woodland, even a single tree \u2013 places where young people can escape the adult world and develop a sense of independence and identity.</p> <p>The local park is the green space that matters most \u2013 and especially for today\u2019s young people, who are both less mobile and more territorial. Often these are less formal green spaces, sometimes just the leftover space between buildings on housing estates. They are less likely to have green flags or heritage features, attract public investment or be suitable for generating private revenue. And yet, when people are asked where money should go, playgrounds and neighbourhood parks come top of the list. A lack of investment in these spaces will only increase the social divide already apparent in how their benefits are distributed.</p> <p>Some will contend that young people are part of the problem, pointing to vandalism and anti-social behaviour. As in so many other walks of life, this is based on exaggerated stereotypes, and more symptomatic of the fact that young people\u2019s voices aren\u2019t listened to enough in the debate on how green spaces are designed and managed.</p> <p>It\u2019s telling that in a recent survey nearly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37505850\" title=\"\">70% of young people said they wanted to volunteer to help</a> create better green spaces in their community but only 7% said they currently do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/27/defend-public-spaces-national-local-parks\">Cherish our public spaces \u2013 among the glories of the democratic age | Rowan Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has a thriving network of grassroots groups campaigning and fundraising tirelessly to protect parks, but they need support to attract and inspire young members.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jul/15/awful-smelt-money-public-parks-councils\" title=\"\">crisis in parks funding</a> has prompted <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/public-parks-16-17/\" title=\"\">an inquiry</a> by the communities and local government select committee of the House of Commons.

It will probably be a group who have massively increased their worth without singing a note. Or their key member being alive. This year, Michael Jackson\u2019s estate looks set to make close to $1bn (\u00a3769m).</p> <p>The Jackson estate was already hugely lucrative \u2013 it generated $115m last year, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/dead-celebrities/#27838f416a51\">according to Forbes</a>. That made it far more profitable than the estates of other dead superstars with lasting musical legacies: the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/2-elvis-presley/#62d408744937\">Elvis Presley estate</a> made $55m in 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jmj/4-bob-marley/#3a7457ad67b6\">Bob Marley estate</a> recorded revenues of $21m. The reason for the Jackson estate\u2019s spectacular success was one amazing deal: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sony-michael-jackson-atv-music-publishing-750m\">sale of its remaining 50% stake</a> in Sony/ATV music publishing to Sony Corporation for $750m \u2013 so expensive because ATV had been the publisher for the vast majority of the Beatles\u2019 catalogue. And the profit was enormous: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/14/topstories3.arts\">Jackson had paid $47.5m for ATV in 1984</a>.</p> <p>As the great superstars of rock and pop pass on, estate management has become a huge business. And the claimants to that business are manifold. David Bowie, a man ahead of the curve in looking after his financial interests, might well have prepared thoroughly, but you only need to look at the ongoing court battles over who should benefit from the estate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a> \u2013 exacerbated by the fact that he left no will and had no known children \u2013 to see how a badly managed estate can cause chaos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a5e46faa2656fb7dd321a75b17ab6012b1a520e/0_0_1752_2432/720.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jackson.\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jackson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John Branca is, along with John McClain, co-executor of the Jackson estate. He was the singer\u2019s lawyer, on and off, for 26 years from 1980, during which time Jackson was the biggest pop star on the planet. Branca was reappointed eight days before Jackson died, having negotiated his return during rehearsals for what would have been Jackson\u2019s comeback shows. And Branca has steered the estate\u2019s business interests over the past seven years to make it the most commercially successful celebrity estate in the world. He and McClain, rather than Jackson\u2019s children, parents or siblings, make all the commercial decisions around the assets \u2013 which include Jackson\u2019s recordings, his songwriting, his share of Sony/ATV, his image rights and his name rights.</p> <p>Refusal is key. Immediately after Jackson\u2019s death, the estate had to address the debts he had run up in his lifetime, so there was a flurry of activity: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-jackson-s-this-is-it\">This Is It</a> documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/15/michael-jackson-the-immortal-world-tour-review\">Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Immortal tour</a> and two documentaries directed by Spike Lee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/bad-25-spike-lee-review\">Bad 25</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/michael-jackson-journey-from-motown-to-off-the-wall-review-sspike-lee-documentary\">Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey From Motown to Off the Wall</a> \u2013 all got the green light, and proved highly profitable. But, says Branca, \u201cWe say no to almost everything that is pitched to us. I just have a basic philosophy, as I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, where I only do things that I would want to watch or listen to. If we don\u2019t believe it is going to be of the highest artistic quality, we don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Here, the estate acts as if for an artist who was still alive, but they need to be realistic about their role. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 John [McClain] and I are not Michael Jackson,\u201d says Branca. \u201cThere is only one Michael Jackson, so we would never pretend that we could substitute our judgment for his.\u201d</p> <p>The key to making an artist posthumously successful lies in the preparations they made when they were alive. \u201cIt all starts with the will,\u201d says Gregor Pryor, a partner at legal firm <a href=\"https://www.reedsmith.com/\">Reed Smith</a>. \u201cSome artists make very good wills and do a really good job of planning for their death. And others don\u2019t.\u201d A music business insider, speaking anonymously, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/freddie-mercury\">Freddie Mercury</a>\u2019s will has become the standard by which other artist legacies are judged. Aware he was dying, Mercury appointed Queen\u2019s manager Jim Beach as executor of his will and his estate. \u201cOther estates, once they have got through the chaos, will want to work towards the steady state that Queen had from the day Freddie died,\u201d the insider says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e888db92b25c21e7b131ebbcc52e940df2fd30/0_0_3000_3258/921.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.\" width=\"921\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Horowitz in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Estate management is not only an issue for rock stars \u2013 classical musicians, too, need special attention, because the fundamentals are the same. Jeff Liebenson, of the New York music law firm <a href=\"http://www.liebensonlaw.com/\">Liebenson Law</a>, represents the estate of the classical pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/31/vladimir-horowitz-original-jacket-collection\">Vladimir Horowitz</a> and explains what happened when his widow, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, also passed away. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that when the estate goes to family members, these are often people who are not that familiar with the music business,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are understandably very emotional and have various issues among and between each other. That can make it very difficult for them to move forward together. In the Horowitz situation, there was no family to inherit it. There were designated beneficiaries, charities and academic institutes in the will.\u201d</p> <p>Allan Steckler has worked on the Horowitz estate for 12 years, as well as the Arturo Toscanini estate for 25 years, and previously worked in classical labels and Apple Records in the US. He has overseen the Horowitz estate in a way that would be familiar to those running the Johnny Cash estate, for example: finding previously unreleased recordings of artistic worth, and overseeing their release into a hungry market, the biggest project being the 42-disc collection of Horowitz\u2019s performances at Carnegie Hall between 1951 and 1978. \u201cThe challenge with dealing with a deceased artist is keeping them in the public view,\u201d says Steckler. \u201cOnce an artist passes, unless somebody does something to keep the name in front of the public, they will totally fade away.\u201d</p> <p>It is common to view record companies as ghoulishly exploiting the deaths of stars, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOkb58YbtQo\">as depicted in the Smiths\u2019 Paint a Vulgar Picture</a>, where Morrissey castigates greedy labels: \u201cReissue! Repackage! Repackage! Re-evaluate the need.\u201d And it is true that sometimes, with artists who have not left behind a wealth of high-quality unreleased material, but scraps and odds and ends \u2013 and whose estate is bequeathed to people in need of money \u2013 the material that emerges sullies their legacy. But it rarely plays out the way Morrissey suggests, and sometimes the labels can even be helpful.</p> <p>Steve Davis, who was director of catalogue at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/emi\">EMI</a> from 2000 to 2009, gives the example of what they did for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/30/kirsty-maccoll-birthday-album-reissue\">Kirsty MacColl</a>\u2019s family.

Cally Callomon is a former creative director at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/mar/23/island-records-fifty-simon-reynolds\">Island Records</a> who has been running the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/05/nick-drake-requiem-for-a-solitary-man\">Nick Drake</a> estate since the late 1990s. Both Drake\u2019s parents are dead, leaving only his sister, Gabrielle, involved. She approached Callomon to manage the estate because she was unable to dedicate the time that it needed.</p> <p>Callomon\u2019s approach was to manage the Drake estate as if he were a living artist. The licensing of Drake\u2019s song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/25/popandrock4\">Pink Moon</a> for a Volkswagen ad in 1999, and a Radio 2 documentary narrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a> in 2004, helped to make the singer considerably more successful posthumously than in his lifetime. \u201cGabrielle got it immediately. This idea of not celebrating or commemorating the death of an artist, but really starting from a complete rebirth of an artist.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Jackson estate, they understand that saying no is more important than saying yes. \u201cGabrielle is a very rare creature and she understands the power of saying no,\u201d Callomon says. \u201cIt\u2019s about waiting for that thing that, when you say yes to it, it makes sense.\u201d They regularly turn down biopic ideas. \u201cTo make a film, however lucrative that would be, I think it would kill something and that would be unforgivable in my book.\u201d Instead, Gabrielle will occasionally approve use of her brother\u2019s music in films or the theatre for free if she likes the script or director, as she is keen to encourage new talent.</p> <p>They have also restricted how much unreleased material has been put out beyond Drake\u2019s original three studio albums \u2013 limiting them to one compilation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/22/way-to-blue-review\">Way to Blue</a>), two compilations with unreleased tracks (Made to Love Magic and A Treasury) and his pre-Island home recordings (Family Tree). They have also repeatedly turned down offers to put all his material in a box set as they are concerned this will devalue his music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b23b0ee3c75951da57fdbb56c2fc07298839b95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b23b0ee3c75951da57fdbb56c2fc07298839b95/0_0_1862_2872/648.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Drake.\" width=\"648\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Drake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout free</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Callomon holds up the example of another beloved, guitar-playing singer who died young as the way not to manage a slender body of acclaimed work. \u201cI have [been] openly critical of the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jeff-buckley\">Jeff Buckley</a>\u2019s legacy has been handled,\u201d says Callomon. \u201cThe guy only made one album but there have been multiple variations of that one album, demos and live material released by Sony. I think Jeff Buckley\u2019s music deserves better than that.\u201d</p> <p>Music fans will now be waiting to see what happens with the cases of Bowie and Prince. Bowie\u2019s back catalogue was already subject to a carefully planned reissue programme before his death, beginning with the Five Years box last September, and followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/david-bowie-who-can-i-be-now-1974-1976-album-box-set-review\">the Who Can I Be Now? set last week</a>. At the rate of one box a year, his catalogue could be repromoted over several years. As for Prince, while those close to him try to resolve the disputes over who gets what, the burning question for fans will be what happens to arguably pop\u2019s greatest treasure trove of unreleased material, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/19/i-would-hide-4-u-whats-in-princes-secret-vault\">his legendary vault</a>.</p> <p>It seems as if Colonel Tom Parker\u2019s words, on the death of Elvis, his sole client, in 1977, ring true for all dead superstars: \u201cElvis didn\u2019t die \u2013 the body did,\u201d he said. \u201cThis changes nothing.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The UK will be hauled before the European court of justice for failing to provide safe habitats for harbour porpoises, the European commission said on Thursday. </p> <p>Harbour porpoises resemble bottlenose dolphins, with small rounded heads, flat foreheads and a black-lipped mouth that curves upwards, as if smiling.</p> <p>The mammals are endemic to the North Atlantic, but their numbers have been falling in the Baltic, Mediterranean and the east of the English Channel.</p> <p>Mortalities from fishing net accidents in areas such as the Celtic Sea, west of Cornwall, have <a href=\"http://seawatchfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Harbour_Porpoise.pdf\">cast doubt on the species\u2019 sustainability</a>, and the commission has awarded them an \u201cunfavourable\u201d conservation status.</p> <p>Under EU law, the UK should have drawn up a list of conservation areas for the porpoises, but has so far formally proposed just one small site in the Skerries and Causeway conservation area, in Northern Ireland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37466649\">A second \u201cspecial area of conservation\u201d was created</a> in the Inner Hebrides and Minches last weekend <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-35362640\">after warnings</a> from conservationists that Scotland was lagging in conservation efforts.</p> <p>Lyndsey Dodds, WWF\u2019s head of marine policy, said: \u201cThe UK has so far failed to designate enough protected areas for these charismatic, intelligent and highly social marine mammals, despite the requirement to do so under the EU habitats directive. </p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the recent proposal to designate the Hebrides and Minches protected area but more needs to be done to ensure there is a coherent network of sites and to ensure they are properly managed.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The commission noted the move in the Hebrides and Minches, but said: \u201cThe [UK\u2019s] continued failure to propose and designate sufficient sites leaves the areas where the species occurs in greatest densities without the protection required.\u201d</p> <p> Potential damage to porpoises from offshore windfarm construction, oil and gas exploration and fishing, has not been adequately assessed, the commission judged. </p> <p>At loud levels, underwater noise can injure or even kill porpoises, but it is more likely to lead them to abandon an area. </p> <p> A WWF report on Friday will say that an eight decibel reduction in noise from offshore windfarms \u2013 by means such as \u201cbubble curtains\u201d \u2013 could cut the chance of porpoise population declines by 96% .</p> <p> Earlier this year, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/blue-belt-extended-to-protect-8000-square-miles-of-uk-waters\">designated 23 new areas</a> as marine conservation zones, in an extension of a claimed \u201cblue belt\u201d across one-fifth of the UK\u2019s waters. </p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting our marine environment, which includes appropriate protection for harbour porpoise.That is why we already have two Special Areas of Conservation for this important species, and earlier this year consulted on another five possible sites.\u201d</p> <p> The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) argues that it is difficult to identify suitable habitats for the porpoises, but this is disputed by conservationists. </p> <p>Melissa Moore, the policy chief at the Marine Conservation Society said: \u201cThere are large areas where you have harbour porpoises feeding and breeding in which protected sites need to be established.

  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/24/bon-iver-justin-vernon-22-million-interview\">the Guardian printed an interview with Justin Vernon</a>. The man who is, to all intents and purposes, Bon Iver did not seem terribly happy with his lot in life. Not for the first time, he talked wistfully about giving up music altogether \u2013 his \u201cdream\u201d is apparently to open a cafe \u2013 or vanishing from public. Sometimes he sounded like someone engaged in the traditional American alt-rock star\u2019s pastime of laying it on a bit thick about the pressures of fame. He now declines to show his face unobscured in photographs, presumably in an attempt to alleviate the terrifying level of ubiquity images of Justin Vernon from Bon Iver have attained in the world\u2019s media: perhaps his pal Kanye West\u2019s wife has become upset at being continually bumped from magazine covers in favour of Vernon\u2019s beardy mush. There was talk of being pestered by fans: exemplifying this nerve-jangling state of affairs, the journalist witnessed a waitress tell him she loved his music while handing him his coffee. Then again, some people are just ill-equipped to cope with fame of any kind, and there was plenty of evidence of a man who has undergone some very real, heartrending distress since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/19/bon-iver-bon-iver-second-album-review\">Bon Iver\u2019s second album</a> topped the US charts and catapulted him into arenas: panic attacks, anxiety, \u201cmental stuff\u201d, writer\u2019s block, treatment for depression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/24/bon-iver-justin-vernon-22-million-interview\">Bon Iver: 'There are people who are into being famous. And I don\u2019t like that'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard to avoid the interpretation that this third album is a wilfully abstruse reaction to his experience of mainstream success. The sleeve and the credits look like something you might find attached to a disturbing bit of privately pressed outsider music: the former is covered in impenetrable symbols, the latter features namechecks for \u201ctom sellick waterfall sandwich\u201d \u201cMother Nourishment\u201d and \u201cSAD SAX OF SHIT\u201d. The song titles come thick with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet\">leet</a>, the symbol-based language beloved of internet gaming communities \u2013 and frequently used there to mock new arrivals \u2013 as if to defy anyone to actually say them out loud. Best of luck shouting for 00000 Million, 10 d E A T h b R E a s T \u2684 \u2684 or indeed 666 \u0287 next time Vernon arrives on a stage near you. \u201cIt\u2019s not for broader appeal,\u201d he sings, tellingly, on the latter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C5sB6AqJkM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6C5sB6AqJkM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Vernon\u2019s voice is frequently mangled with Auto-Tune and other electronic effects until it\u2019s unrecognisable, which seems telling as well, given that he\u2019s expressed a desire to play to audiences who\u2019ve \u201chopefully never heard of us\u201d. This often renders the words he is singing incomprehensible without the aid of a lyric sheet; then again, even that doesn\u2019t help much: \u201cWhat I got is seen you trying, or take it down the old lanes round, fuckified, darling don\u2019t make love, fight it, love, don\u2019t fight it,\u201d he sings on 10 d E A T h b R E a s T \u2684 \u2684. \u201cDarling don\u2019t a failure fright, time\u2019s the raker, and I\u2019ll rack it up, I\u2019m unorphaned in our northern light, dedicoding [sic] every demon.\u201d Whether this is some kind of stream-of-consciousness attempt to express indefinable emotions he felt during the \u201chorribleness\u201d that preceded the album\u2019s making, or just a concerted effort to try to stop people interpreting his lyrics is an interesting point, although you have to say that if it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s probably doomed to failure. You can almost hear messageboard discussions sparking into life, and indeed getting gradually nuttier as he sings.</p> <p>22, A Million is obviously not the first confounding, how-do-you-like-me-now gesture offered up in rock history. Traditionally, the danger with that kind of thing is that it can look like haughty obscurity for obscurity\u2019s sake, or, worse, wearyingly petulant. But for all its undoubted oddness, what\u2019s striking about the album is how straightforwardly enjoyable it is. There are certainly a couple of points where the listener might wonder if what they\u2019re party to isn\u2019t just the sound of someone faffing about \u2013 the combination of mannered vocals and synthesized saxophone on ____45_____ outstays its welcome \u2013 but they\u2019re vastly outweighted by moments of real beauty: the lovely, effortless melody and stunning harmonies on which the impenetrable lyrics of 29 #Strafford APTS hang; the unfettered loveliness of closer 00000 Million, a piano ballad lightly dusted with Auto-Tune and reverb until it sounds otherworldly; the point in 21 M\u2662\u2662N WATER when Vernon\u2019s voice pierces through the murky ambient drift that occupies its opening minute like a shaft of light.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNy7VtSsmu8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HNy7VtSsmu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>You\u2019re frequently struck not by the sense of a man smugly obfuscating with the aid of a laptop, but alive to the idea that, if you have the imagination, it\u2019s possible to make a singer-songwriter album that isn\u2019t in thrall to styles minted in the late 60s and 70s, but sounds entirely like a product of its time: fractured by technology, shifting and changing so restlessly, it\u2019s often hard to keep tabs on exactly what\u2019s happening, as open to the sonic innovations at the cutting edge of modern R&amp;B or dance music <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/22/david-bowie-who-can-i-be-now-1974-1976-album-box-set-review\">as David Bowie was</a> when he decamped to the US to avail himself of the Philadelphia International sound. It draws on the past not as something to slavishly imitate, but as source material to be warped and altered. Plenty of artists have made music in the image of mid-70s Fleetwood Mac over recent years, but on 10 d E A T h b R E a s T \u2684 \u2684, their influence takes on a very 21st-century form. The backing vocals come via a YouTube video of Stevie Nicks singing while being made up for a Rolling Stone photoshoot, twisted until they are barely recognisable, and marooned over the kind of ferociously distorted beats you might have found on Kanye West\u2019s Yeezus. Meanwhile, Vernon\u2019s vocal morphs, the effects shifting it from muted and warm to a frantic chorus of harmonies. It\u2019s fantastic.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that 22, A Million isn\u2019t quite the baffling non-sequitur it seems at first. For all the perception of Vernon as a doughty craftsman of earnest Americana, pouring his heart out in the backwoods, his music has always had what you might call its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/17/radioheads-kid-a-made-into-menu\">Kid A</a> side. His third album represents the point where the thinking behind something like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciuy2l2ILyE\">2009\u2019s Babys</a>, an abstract assemblage of keening harmonies, icy electronics and crashing cymbals, takes over his music completely. Still, there\u2019s no arguing that exactly what he\u2019s driving at here is often hard to divine. But one of the points 22, A Million may be trying to make is that you don\u2019t necessarily have to understand music to enjoy or be moved by it. If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s an unequivocal success.</p>",

Labour is in the midst of the same crisis as its sister social-democratic parties across Europe, with one twist: as evidenced by all those new members, it is also home to the kind of new, insurgent politics we\u2019ve seen with Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, the Bernie Sanders campaign in the US etc. Time spent this week at Momentum\u2019s A World Transformed event in Liverpool reminded me that a great deal of Labour and the left\u2019s future lies with some of the people involved (I\u2019ve written a column about this, out later today), but a watershed moment is probably going to be a long time coming. </p> <p>As things stand, most of what we know takes the form of negatives: that the politics of New Labour are dead, that Labour is dangerously estranged from its old working class base, that the party is pretty much finished in Scotland. What happens next is unclear: my own belief is that it will have involve Labour embracing changing the voting system, creating a politics beyond work and the worker, and understanding that amassing a critical mass of support will involve other forces and parties. All this will take time.</p> <p>For now, maybe think about it like this. Jeremy Corbyn is not going to be the next prime minister. In an alternate reality, the same would apply to Owen Smith, Angela Eagle, David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, or any one else who might be mentioned as some kind of fantasy contender.

Encouragingly, these issues do seem to be being discussed. The Momentum conference fringe event was buzzing with energy and many speakers were tackling difficult topics such as automation and the possibility of a citizens income. Many politicians are also keen to explore similar themes, Jonathan Reynolds MP immediately springs to mind.</p> <p>The question is: how can this sort of radical thinking be combined with in-depth understanding of voter preferences and electoral strategy to come up with a plausible program for government?</p> <p>I think there is hope. Corbyn\u2019s conference speech was an attempt to reach out to his critics within Labour and many some to have responded in kind.

And who is now out of his depth.</p> <p>The Corbyn camp continues to do its best to paint the situation as a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, but the truth is much more prosaic. How many widespread MP rebellions have there been on policy issues? Have there been any? Instead the disquiet comes from Corbyn's perceived lack of leadership skills \u2013 that he has no coherent media policy, that shadow cabinet meetings are a shambles, that communication within the party is poor, that he lacks drive, that no one is really clear what they're supposed to be doing, and, worst of all, that there is a lack of solid, well-thought-through policy. </p> <p>Corbyn is great at preaching to the converted, but the converted aren't enough to win a general election. The only way I can see it working is if he displays a bit of humility and accepts advice, help and direction from others in the party outside of his narrow circle, especially those with ministerial, leadership and media experience.

An electoral pact. The right win because they always vote together as one big monolith. Our turn. The scare of a small handful of Tories going over to UKIP was enough to panic Cameron into a Brexit referendum. I'm in a supposed Tory safe seat but the truth is that if you counted the Lib Dem and Labour vote together, we would comfortably win. That's repeated up and down the country. An electoral pact means not standing candidates against the most likely to win. It also means people can vote strategically yet maintain allegiance with the party of their conscience.<br />2.

  "<p>Liam Fox has hailed the opportunity for Britain to become a fully independent member of the World Trade Organisation after leaving the EU, indicating that he appears to favour a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.</p> <p>In a major speech, the trade secretary said Brexit was a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for the UK to trade with the rest of the world, particularly developing markets.</p> <p>His intervention comes amid a debate about whether the UK should push for a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d, in which it would retain as much access as possible to the single market but have to continue to allow the free movement of people, or go for a \u201charder\u201d option, leaving the single market and trading under WTO rules and tariffs, but able to curb free movement. </p> <p>A Bloomberg analysis of the responses of European countries suggests that the likelihood of Britain <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/-hard-brexit-looms-as-28-red-lines-turn-deeper-shade-of-scarlet\">facing a \u201chard Brexit\u201d is increasing</a>. Almost all the countries stressed the importance of the UK retaining free movement if it wanted to continue to enjoy the benefits of the single market.</p> <p>Theresa May has insisted a bespoke agreement for Britain is possible, claiming other EU leaders \u201cwill give us a deal\u201d.</p> <p>However, Fox appeared to be leaning more towards the option of trading on WTO terms, rather than having to comply with EU trade rules.</p> <p>Speaking in Manchester, Fox said the UK had played a large role in ensuring the single market remained open to trade and would continue to encourage this liberalisation. </p> <p>But, he added: \u201cThrough the WTO the UK has helped pushed through the trade facilitation agreement which, once implemented, could add over \u00a370bn to the global economy annually, of which \u00a31bn will come to the UK.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs a newly independent WTO member outside the EU, we will continue to fight for trade liberalisation as well as potentially helping developing markets trade their way out of poverty by giving them preferential access to our markets.\u201d</p> <p>While he only mentioned the single market once, the WTO was raised eight times.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is a full and founding member of the WTO, though we have chosen to be represented by the EU in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we establish our independent position post-Brexit, we will carry the standard of free and open trade as a badge of honour.\u201d</p> <p>His position was criticised as \u201cdelusional\u201d by Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat spokesman on the EU.</p> <p>\u201cUnbelievably, he claims to be \u2018taking an axe to red tape across borders\u2019,\u201d Clegg said. \u201cThe truth is that leaving the EU\u2019s customs union and single market will bring a deluge of new Brexit red tape down on the heads of British businesses who export to the continent.</p> <p>\u201cFox needs to come clean about the true impact this will have on our exporters.\u201d <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/brexit-royal-yacht-britannia-eu\">Who needs a coherent plan for Brexit when you have dreams and fantasies? | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Senior Tories have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/29/former-tory-ministers-demand-clear-brexit-plan-theresa-may\">urged the prime minister to set out a clearer plan for Brexit</a>.

It has agreed that something needs to be done, but has put off until another day the rather more difficult task of getting its fractious membership to decide what that should be.</p> <p>The realisation that much still needs to be done before Iran agrees to cap its output, which has been rising since global sanctions were lifted, meant the knee-jerk jump in prices that followed the Opec move was short-lived.</p> <p>This was not a game-changing move that will send prices shooting back up towards the $100 a barrel level. For that to happen there would have to be a much more stringent agreement to cut production and, crucially, stronger global demand.</p> <p>Neither looks likely, and as a result Opec\u2019s ambitions are relatively modest. Member states are desperate to put a floor under the price of crude because they depend on oil revenues to finance public spending. The lower the price goes, the more difficult it is for them to balance the books.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia is not immune from these fiscal pressures.

The strategy would be painful for Saudi Arabia as well, but Riyadh had deep pockets.</p> <p>Not deep enough, it transpires. Some US rigs have been mothballed, but the cost of producing US shale is coming down all the time. Saudi Arabia has had to accept that it is not going to deliver a knockout blow.</p> <p>The deal tentatively agreed in Algeria is an acceptance of that fact. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/30/opec-oil-market-prices-production-meeting\">Opec\u2019s glory days are long in the past and it is a much-diminished force.</a> Having decided to wage an ill-judged war, the cartel has now run up the white flag. </p> <p>Opec\u2019s agreement should underpin the oil price.

  "<p>Governments have launched a crackdown on the rampant billion-dollar trade in rosewood timber that is plundering forests across the planet to feed a booming luxury furniture market in China.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/\">Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) summit on Thursday placed all 300 species of rosewood under trade restrictions, meaning criminals can no longer pass off illegally logged species as legitimate. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2016/May/wildlife-crime-assessed-globally-for-the-first-time-in-new-unodc-report.html\">Rosewood is the world\u2019s most trafficked wild product</a>, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, accounting for a third of all seizures by value, more than elephant ivory, pangolins, rhino horn, lions and tigers put together.</p> <p>With a beautiful deep red glow, it is the traditional wood used for elite, classic-style \u201chongmu\u201d furniture in China: one huge carved bed was on sale recently for $1m. But due to explosive demand from China\u2019s fast-growing middle class, the rosewood trade has soared since 2005, multiplying 65 times in value and now worth $2.2bn a year. </p> <p>As a result, the forests of south-east Asia have been rapidly emptying, peaking in 2014. Traffickers are now targeting more than 80 other countries across the tropics where rosewoods grow, particularly in west Africa but also central America. China\u2019s rosewood imports from Africa soared sevenfold between 2010 and 2014, according to a <a href=\"http://forest-trends.org/releases/p/hongmu-consumption-boom\">report from Forest Trends</a>, with $216m of west African rosewood imported in the first half of 2016 alone. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5130c7586b9a81ae13cd886251ac1c3e0e79552e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5130c7586b9a81ae13cd886251ac1c3e0e79552e/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loading rosewood on to trucks at the port of Toamasina, Madagascar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loading rosewood on to trucks at the port of Toamasina, Madagascar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Illegal gangs move swiftly from country to country, felling all the trees they can find and creating devastating boom-and-bust cycles, said the report. \u201cWhen trees become scarce in one place, or authorities strengthen controls, the shady networks quickly move to another country and the deadly cycle of corruption, violence and forest destruction starts anew,\u201d said a <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/report/cycles-of-destruction\">statement from Environmental Investigation Agency</a> (EIA), a Cites participant. </p> <p>China imported 2m cubic metres of logs and wood in 2014, according to the EIA. This is equivalent to millions of rosewood trees as only the dark, dense heartwood is used: 70-80% of the tree is often wasted. </p> <p>The devastated forests left behind also no longer provide the charcoal and traditional medicines used by indigenous communities. \u201cIt is at the heart of our rural communities,\u201d said Niger\u2019s Cites delegate. \u201cThe demand from Asia threatens directly threatens their livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa Handy, at the EIA, said: \u201cWe are really thrilled [with the new Cites protection]. It\u2019s really in the nick of time to save them from extinction. The trade has exploded exponentially in the last decade. Now it really comes down to enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of protecting the entire Dalbergia genus of rosewood is that criminals can no longer pass off illegal rosewood as one of the previously unprotected species. \u201cOfficials have great difficulty in distinguishing between species,\u201d said Guatemala\u2019s delegate to Cites. \u201cIt is very difficult for people who are not experts, and even sometimes for the experts themselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis [summit] will be remembered for rosewood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">pangolin protection</a>,\u201d said Brazil\u2019s delegate, who said there would have been nothing left within three years without action.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d091a4e2faadc567ccd2f8b0e2d6ba2df33ae45c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d091a4e2faadc567ccd2f8b0e2d6ba2df33ae45c/0_323_5220_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong customs officials with confiscated Honduras rosewood log\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong customs officials with confiscated Honduras rosewood logs, part of a 92 tonne shipment found in four 40ft shipping containers originating in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Hofford/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Cites summit also applied new protection to an African rosewood from another genus, known as Kosso, which grows in the dry forests of west Africa. It was barely exported in 2009 but exploitation has since soared and it is now is now the main rosewood timber imported by China. \u201cThe forests have been emptied,\u201d said Benin\u2019s delegate to Cites.</p> <p>Some rosewood species can still be logged under the new rules, but will require permits that should only be granted if it is deemed sustainable. The rules could be revisited in the final Cites session next week, but this is unlikely. Rosewood is also used to make some musical instruments, such as guitars, but the new rules will not prevent musicians travelling with their instruments.</p> <p>The new protections enter into force in 90 days, but need action by individual nations to have an impact. In 2013, Cites gave similar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/12/protection-madagascar-trees-logging-trade\">protection to every rosewood species in Madagascar</a>, where rampant logging was taking place.</p> <p>However, the EIA says the Madagascan government has failed to carry out its enforcement commitments and, in May 2016, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on Madagascar to end corruption and \u201cfight the illegal trafficking of natural treasures\u201d.</p>",

The community group that gets together to revive a street market or establish an urban garden, or the penniless artists who turn a leaky warehouse into a gallery, are indirectly responsible for catalysing the very forces they are usually determined to prevent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/24/the-bubble-that-turned-into-a-tide-how-london-got-hooked-on-gentrification\">The bubble that turned into a tide: how London got hooked on gentrification</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such amenities increase the \u201clocational value\u201d of properties in the area, attracting buy-to-let investors, land speculators and estate agents who feature these very community assets in their glossy brochures. The arrival of the allotment and the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/uk-makerspaces-data\">makerspace</a>\u201d puts into motion a sequence of events that will ultimately drive them out: the cast-iron rule of gentrification is that the things that make an area attractive will be displaced or destroyed.</p> <p>A land value tax shifts this dynamic. Rather than taxing property, it taxes the value of the land itself \u2013 determined by its location, not what is built on it. The rise in value that results from neighbourhood improvements is therefore captured and returned to the community, to be reinvested in the area.</p> <p>Such a tax also penalises those who hoard vacant plots of land with no intention to build, while driving inflated land values down by taking into account the value of future levies that will be applied.</p> <p>In short, it would mean the next time you see a bearded hipster wheeling his sourdough trolley to the local festival of sustainable street art, you could take solace in the fact that the perceived value he is creating will not be siphoned off by a developer, or lead to an increase in your rent, but ultimately generate more revenue to make your neighbourhood a better place to live.</p> <p><em>Are you experiencing or resisting gentrification in your city?

If you target only 1% of China\u2019s population, that\u2019s 14 million people \u2013 so it\u2019s already almost two Londons.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting in his office overlooking Hong Kong\u2019s skyscraper-dotted Victoria Harbour, Li estimates that just 3% of potential Chinese investors in overseas property have so far been found \u2013 meaning a virtually untapped goldmine lies over the border in mainland China. \u201cChina is a big market, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cThey are getting wealthier and wealthier.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"96a400034ecdf8a49484e2f0fd3dd54dca508ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a400034ecdf8a49484e2f0fd3dd54dca508ba2/0_110_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Li in his Hong Kong office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Li in his Hong Kong office</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rich Hong Kong investors have been ploughing money into British bricks and mortar for decades, snapping up off-plan apartments at weekly property fairs that can then be rented, flipped, held as investments or used as second homes.</p> <p>\u201cI have one [London property] in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/canary-wharf-timeline-london-building-docklands-thatcher\">Canary Wharf</a>, one in <a href=\"http://www.londoncityisland.com/\">City Island</a>, one in Wembley Park, one in Elephant and Castle,\u201d said one investor matter-of-factly at a recent expo in Hong Kong\u2019s chic Mandarin Oriental Hotel, as he eyed a new development near the Thames Barrier in E16.</p> <p>But many real-estate agents and property experts in east Asia believe a new wave of investment is just getting under way, as mainland investors develop a taste for international real estate, including postcodes up and down the UK.</p> <p>\u201cOur thesis \u2013 and this is supported by quite a lot of evidence \u2013 is that in many ways the international Chinese investment journey is probably just starting,\u201d says Charles Pittar, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.juwai.com/\">Juwai.com</a>, a website that aims to pair mainland buyers with property developers in places such as Australia, the US and the UK.</p> <p>Pittar\u2019s company, which lists 2.5 million properties and calls itself China\u2019s largest international real-estate website, estimates that in 2014, Chinese outbound investment into residential and commercial property was more than $50bn (\u00a338bn). </p> <p>\u201cI guess the key is: what is it going to become?\u201d Pittar says. \u201cOur view is that \u2026 it could be growing to somewhere around $200bn [annually] over the next 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>And Britain, despite its decision to leave the EU, is expected to be one of the key focuses, he adds. \u201cThe UK market, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/london-property-house-prices-brexit-overseas-buyers-first-time-eu-referendum-housing-market-a7108026.html\">particularly post-Brexit, is really picking up</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Pittar traces mainland China\u2019s hunger for overseas property back to the turn of the century, just before <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/s7lu_e.pdf\">China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organisation</a> signalled the latest phase of its integration into the global economy. But the outflow of money has gathered pace over the past decade, and is set to grow further as middle-class investors from second- and third-tier cities get in on the game.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big market now, but it is likely to be anywhere from two to four times the size in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d Pittar says. \u201cThe exciting thing about China is that there are 168 cities with more than a million people.

It\u2019s lots of saving,\u201d he says with a grin.<br></p> <p>According to Pittar, Chinese who buy property overseas have four main motivations: investment, lifestyle, emigration and education. Many are looking for a foothold in the UK, where they hope their children will go on to study.<br><br>\u201cSome people are buying for their family to use it,\u201d says Li, \u201csome are buying to diversify, some are buying because they want to own a property for investment \u2013 and some people are buying for prestige, to say: \u2018I own a piece of property in London.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Crucially, he says, London is also seen as a secure place to store money that investors want to move out of China, to guard against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/perils-of-china-currency-devaluation-yuan-renminbi\">devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan</a>. \u201cPeople in mainland China, they want to get their money out ...

Earlier this year he bought two more.</p> <p>Song says the UK is \u201cvery attractive to Chinese property investors\u201d, largely because it does not have the high duties that have been introduced in Canada and Australia targeting foreign buyers.</p> <p>High prices in London make it \u201ctoo risky\u201d to buy there, he adds.

  "<p>Themes of body swapping, the search for love and a frantic quest to save a town from imminent destruction have combined to propel a Japanese animated film  to box office gold, and prompted talk that the country has found its successor to the globally acclaimed director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki\">Hayao Miyazaki</a>.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRfHcp2GjVI\">Your Name</a>, Makoto Shinkai\u2019s fantasy about two teenagers drawn together by gender-swapping dreams, has been seen by more than 8 million people since its release in August, beating the hugely popular Godzilla Resurgence to become the highest-grossing film in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan </a>this year, and the ninth highest of all time.</p> <p>It has earned more than 10bn yen (\u00a377m) in box office receipts, an anime milestone previously achieved only by Miyazaki\u2019s films.</p> <p>The film has made the 43-year-old Shinkai an obvious candidate to continue the anime legacy left by Miyazaki, the 75-year-old creator of global hits such as Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro and Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. Miyazaki announced in 2013 he would stop making feature films at his Studio Ghibli.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRfHcp2GjVI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hRfHcp2GjVI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Your Name.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Reviewers have attributed Your Name\u2019s popularity to Shinkai\u2019s success in combining exquisite animation with a storyline centred on two deeply sympathetic characters: Mitsuha Miyamizu, a teenage girl living in a picturesque but unexciting village, and Taki Tachibana, a Tokyo schoolboy.</p> <p>The fateful events that bring the pair together begin when they appear in each other\u2019s dreams, even though they have never met. Much of the film\u2019s charm derives from their attempts to make sense of their situation and, ultimately, to find each other.</p> <p>Your Name is Shinkai\u2019s homage to the body-swapping themes of Japanese literature, centuries before they became a Hollywood staple. The director cited <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torikaebaya_Monogatari\">Torikaebaya Monogatari</a>, a 12th-century tale about a brother and sister whose mannerisms are those of the opposite sex, as his main inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cI was on the verge of tears at the end,\u201d said one 45-year-old woman, who identified herself only as Ai, after an early-morning screening in Tokyo this week. \u201cI have to admit I had never heard of Makoto Shinkai until this film came out, and I always thought of anime as something for children, but this was really impressive. And the scenes of Tokyo were breathtaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee12b0d808776cb0524dbf27d3d4682b10f6e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee12b0d808776cb0524dbf27d3d4682b10f6e89/0_158_3219_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Makoto Shinkai may finally step out of the shadow of legendary animation master Hayao Miyazaki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Makoto Shinkai may finally step out of the shadow of legendary animation master <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki\">Hayao Miyazaki</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eli Gorostegi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shinkai\u2019s painstaking recreations of everyday Tokyo scenes have prompted hordes of fans to descend on locations from the film, forcing production staff to plead with them not to disturb local residents following complaints about their behaviour.</p> <p>Shinkai, who based the film on his million-selling novel of the same name, has described Your Name as his attempt to understand, and perhaps relieve, teenage angst. \u201cQuite a lot of them feel distressed because their lives revolve around school and home,\u201d Kyodo News quoted him a saying. \u201cThat\u2019s why they turn to manga, novels and video games. I wanted to create something for the generation of young people who crave stories like this.\u201d</p> <p>The film is laced with gently comic moments induced by the awkwardness of adolescence. Some, though, risk being lost in translation when the film is released outside Japan, such as Taki\u2019s use of the Japanese feminine word for \u201cI\u201d when chatting to male classmates. More universally appreciated will be his confused affections for an older woman at the coffee shop where he works after school.</p> <p>Your Name\u2019s dark backdrop feeds into a familiar Japanese anxiety. The threat of natural, and nuclear, disasters has also informed Japanese filmmaking, from Godzilla\u2019s radioactive awakening to the self-explanatory Tidal Wave, a 1973 movie based on Sakyo Komatsu\u2019s novel Nihon Chinbotsu, in which a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions sink the entire Japanese archipelago.</p> <p>Your Name\u2019s climax is provided by the arrival of a comet targeting Mitsuha\u2019s hometown of Itomori, a place inspired by Shinkai\u2019s upbringing in Nagano prefecture. The comet\u2019s descent is described as a once-in-a-thousand-year event, the same catastrophic status afforded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\">magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami</a> that destroyed much of Japan\u2019s north-east coast in March 2011.<br></p> <p>The film is set for release in the UK in November and is expected to appear in the US and more than 80 other countries in the coming months, the sort of exposure previously reserved for Miyazaki\u2019s anime.<br></p> <p>The veteran Japan-based film reviewer Mark Schilling believes Shinkai is entitled to emerge from Miyazaki\u2019s shadow to be recognised as a supremely talented director in his own right. \u201cMiyazaki would not have made this film, but Makoto Shinkai did,\u201d he wrote in the Japan Times. \u201cHopefully, just maybe, he will lose the \u2018new Miyazaki\u2019 tag forever.\u201d</p> <p>Shinkai has said he wants to make two more films for the Your Name distributor Toho before he turns 50. \u201cI can never stand unrivalled like Miyazaki, but if I have been given the privilege of making films \u2026 I am confident of delivering something others can\u2019t make.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The number of mortgages being approved fell in August, figures show, in the latest sign that the housing market has cooled since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The Bank of England said mortgage approvals, seen by economists as one of the early indicators of housing market activity, had dropped to the lowest level since November 2014. </p> <p>There were 60,058 mortgages approved for house purchase last month, down from 60,925 in July and slightly fewer than the 60,150 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.</p> <p>However, the figures also showed unsecured borrowing by consumers, such as on credit cards, continuing to grow, echoing other signs that British households have so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/uk-consumers-keep-up-summer-spending-retail-sales-\">largely shrugged off</a> the EU referendum result and not allowed any worries they have about the economy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/31/uk-consumer-confidence-rebounds-post-brexit-vote-figures\">curb their spending</a>. Consumer credit rose by \u00a31.57bn in August, beating economists\u2019 expectations of a \u00a31.4bn increase.</p> <p>Scott Bowman from consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cAugust\u2019s UK money and credit figures suggest that the housing market continues to cool, but appetite for debt hasn\u2019t taken much of a hit.\u201d</p> <p>However, he pointed to other indicators, which suggest that confidence is returning to the housing market after an initial post-Brexit vote wobble. The <a href=\"http://www.rics.org/Global/8._WEB_%20August_2016_RICS_UK_Residential_Market_Survey_tt.pdf\">latest monthly report</a> from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that for the first time since April, surveyors expect house prices to increase over the next three months. <br></p> <p>Contrasting that report with the decline in mortgage approvals, Bowman said: \u201cThe Rics survey measure of new buyer enquiries picked up sharply in August, implying [that] this trend won\u2019t last too much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the decrease in approvals in August would not have been entirely down to the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cStripping out the extent to which this is a consequence of post-EU referendum uncertainty, as opposed to other factors, including tax rises on buy-to-let properties earlier this year and ever more expensive housing, is problematic,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>The Bank\u2019s data chimed with figures from the British Bankers\u2019 Association earlier this week, which showed that the number of homebuyer mortgages approved by UK banks was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/26/mortgage-approvals-fall-by-fifth-british-bankers-association-bba\">down by 20%</a> year on year in August, but consumers\u2019 appetite for unsecured borrowing remained strong.<br></p> <p>Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures showed that \u201cconsumers were clearly prepared to continue borrowing and spending in August,\u201d but warned that households may soon begin to feel the pressure from rising inflation and the jobs market weakening.</p> <p>\u201cWe suspect that the fundamentals for consumers will become less favourable over the coming months, with purchasing power likely diminishing and the labour market softening,\u201d Archer said. \u201cOn the one hand, this may make people more cautious over borrowing, but on the other hand, it may increase the need for some people to borrow.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Gulf states are among the most water-scarce in the world.

She was fascinated by the beauty of the chess pieces, and by the concentration on the children\u2019s faces as they played. That initial encounter led her to become entranced with the game, and she went on to become the women\u2019s junior champion of Uganda three times. In 2012, at the 40th chess Olympiad, Mutesi was named Woman Candidate Master, one of the country\u2019s first female players to win such a title. </p> <p>With money earned from championships, Mutesi has moved her family out of the slums and into a new home, leaving behind the unmarked two-roomed building on a dirt road where she learned her skills.</p> <p>At the academy, the chessboards are balanced on wobbly wooden benches and everyone observes the unwritten rule that if someone loses a game, they give way to another player. The centre is supported by a US-based charity, <a href=\"http://www.sportsoutreach.net/\">Sports Outreach Ministry</a>. Most of the children who play chess at its centres are unable to pay for their education, so the organisation sends them to formal schools.</p> <p>Robert Katende, the academy\u2019s founder, says it gives young people the chance of a new life.

He found a place in Katwe where the children could meet daily to play, and started up the academy. It began with five children, but the number has since swelled to more than 300. Aged between five and 23, the chess players gather daily across five separate slum locations around the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2729ef67bc36502d30395acc785eea9a8f56763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2729ef67bc36502d30395acc785eea9a8f56763/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children take on each other at the Katwe chess academy in Kampala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play chess at the Katwe academy in Kampala</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alon Mwesigwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The academy opens in the afternoon and any young person can drop in for a game.

  "<p>With <a href=\"http://time.com/4452330/millennials-republican-rock-the-vote/\">only 20%</a> of millennials identifying with the GOP, being a young Republican has never been quite so unfashionable. But following fashion has never really trended with those leaning right. Pearls, blazers and super-straight hair for the young ladies; sweater vests, chinos and helmet hair for the gentlemen. You could call it GOPcore: a fashion-backward uniform of uniformity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/27/millennials-voters-turnout-2016-candidates-reno-nevada\">'I don\u2019t like this election': will millennials, the biggest generation, turn out to vote?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But are these just stereotypes, or do young people really dress differently based on their political affiliation?

Further, YDs are more likely to say they \u201cfollow the latest trends and fashion\u201d while YRs are more likely to say they \u201ctend to stick to classic items that are timeless rather than go for whatever is \u2018in-fashion\u2019\u201d.</p> <p> So, what timeless classics are hanging in conservative closets? According to the data it\u2019s an unsurprising cast, including Brooks Brothers, LL Bean, Clarks, Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch and Herm\u00e8s.

In another parallel with the GOP, Wet Seal has been struggling to stay relevant with the young lately, closing almost <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wet-seal-layoffs-20150108-story.html\">two-thirds of its stores</a> last year.

  "<h2>Heather, 48 \u2013 Austin, TX: \u2018Clinton will say anything to get power, Trump will just say anything\u2019</h2> <p>The reason I am undecided is because no candidate deserves my vote. </p> <p>I\u2019m a single mother of two, full-time employed, yet living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m insulted that women think I\u2019m obligated to vote for Clinton because she\u2019s a woman, just as I bristled at Sarah Palin as a viable choice. </p> <p>I am frustrated by the lack of candid discussion about the real issues my family and I face. Instead we waste time on gender-neutral bathrooms and whether Trump is a rude man. I lived in New York for years. He\u2019s obnoxious like a lot of New Yorkers. She\u2019s smug and patronizing, implying that I, a female voter, should just trust that she knows what is best for me. </p> <p>Neither deserves my trust (Clinton because she\u2019ll say anything to get power, Trump because he\u2019ll just say anything) and I\u2019m thinking of abstaining. It\u2019s so depressing. There should be more quality options. </p> <p>Skipping election day is an awful example to my children (both teens), but I can\u2019t stomach either candidate. As they say in sports, it\u2019ll likely be a game-day decision. </p> <h2>Drew, 33 \u2013 Brevard County, FL: \u2018Is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m not undecided between Trump and Clinton. My indecisiveness lies between Clinton and Jill Stein. </p> <p>I consider myself very progressive. I agree with 97% of Stein\u2019s policies (that number is verified by multiple tries of an online quiz \u2013 haha). According to the same quiz I agree over 90% with Clinton, but I can\u2019t bring myself to vote for her. I simply don\u2019t believe her. </p> <p>I believe her instincts are slanted towards conservatism. I believe she\u2019ll say anything to get elected. Deep down, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s liberal enough and in the end, she won\u2019t come through on what she promised. </p> <p>My indecision stems from living in Florida and knowing my vote is important. </p> <p>I hate Trump and his band of racist drones. He personifies everything that\u2019s wrong with America. If I vote for Stein that could ultimately mean victory for Trump. But then, is it my fault the Democrats chose Clinton over Bernie?</p> <p>Is my vote a wasted one if I vote for Stein \u2013 or are progressive votes for Hillary the truly wasted ones?</p> <h2>Brexton, 19 \u2013 San Diego, CA: \u2018Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m undecided because I want to vote for a viable candidate but right now, I can\u2019t do that in good conscience. </p> <p>Climate change is far and away the number one issue and Jill Stein is obviously the best candidate to address that. In terms of policy proposals and electability however, Clinton has the lead. </p> <p>Since Bernie was defeated I have been trying really hard to like Hillary. Every time I come to terms with voting for her despite her long and discouraging past, she does one more thing that\u2019s exactly opposite of what liberals and progressives want, like her choice for vice-president or her continual ignoring of the #1 issue, climate change.</p> <p>Everyone always says a vote for Stein is a vote for Trump and that if he gets elected it would be third-party voters\u2019 faults. I ask why is it not Hillary\u2019s fault for not taking the few steps necessary to earn our vote. Bernie did it, now Stein\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s not hard.</p> <p>Hillary needs to make climate change and the environment a focal point of her campaign. She needs to prove that she isn\u2019t still in the hands of big money. She has only been proving the opposite again and again. I want to vote for Hillary. I just need a reason to do so.</p> <h2>Kate, 51 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above\u2019</h2> <p>There is no one for whom I can vote with a clear conscience. <br></p> <p>To me, Hillary Clinton represents the establishment, and her election will, at best, bring four more years of government of Goldman, by Goldman, and for Goldman. Clinton is a vote for more of the same, a vote for the post-2008 status quo. Clinton is a vote for more wasted years. </p> <p>Trump, of course, isn\u2019t even remotely qualified to be president. Trump would be, I believe, a disaster, and we\u2019d finish up even worse off than we are today. Not to mention the racism, sexism and viciousness he\u2019s actively encouraged in his supporters, traits that would be amplified with his ascension to the White House. Trump is a vote for chaos. I won\u2019t vote for Trump.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s left? Jill Stein? No, too frivolous.</p> <p>Gary Johnson? No. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have a candidate in this race, but I feel like I have to vote because 2016 demands it. And it\u2019s so late in the cycle, now, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything that can convince me to vote for any of the above. Most likely I\u2019ll vote for Bernie, writing his name next to \u201cOther\u201d with a bold, black sharpie. </p> <h2>Chris, 50 \u2013 New York, NY: \u2018Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve always leaned \u201cprogressive\u201d even when it wasn\u2019t in vogue. I identify loosely as a democratic socialist. So when Elizabeth Warren failed to run and Bernie Sanders picked up the mantle I was ecstatic. My enthusiasm grew the better Bernie did. I\u2019m very proud of him fighting for the $15 minimum wage, fighting for universal healthcare, making public universities free for students, putting a stop to fossil fuels, and taking climate change seriously. Perhaps most important of all, taking to task the one percenters and making them pay their fair share of taxes. Even though Bernie Sanders had difficulty connecting with the African American voter, his overall message resonated with me. It seemed quite clear that helping the economic working class would by default be helping African Americans and all minorities in this country.</p> <p>Unfortunately Bernie came up short. However, he did much better than <em>anyone</em> expected him to. One point of contention with Hillary Clinton is that she seems to take progressives and millennials for granted. Yes, she\u2019s absorbed some of Sanders\u2019 rhetoric and for that I\u2019m grateful, but there seems no conscious effort to capture the progressive zeitgeist that has captured the energy and passion of at least half the party. Also as an African American I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take her husband\u2019s policies to task. \u201cSuper-predator\u201d comments aside, they\u2019ve been incredibly damaging to African American families, from welfare to prison reform. I don\u2019t care about emails. </p> <p>Trump is a racist fascist so I can\u2019t vote for him. But Hillary comes across as untrustworthy, elitist where the rules don\u2019t apply and a insincere panderer.</p> <p>Clinton needs to swing more to the left and really speak to the supporters of Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>Clinton needs to come up with clear solutions to stop rampant police assassinations of black lives in this country. </p> <p>Maybe then she\u2019ll get my vote. Because I\u2019m liable to Just. Stay. Home.</p> <h2>Buck, 62 \u2013 Houston, TX: \u2018I want a government that does what a government should do, and nothing else\u2019</h2> <p>We live so far below our potential because most American voters are ignorant and apathetic about their government. And they vote for a person instead of an idea. I want a government that does what a government should do for its citizens, and does that fully and well, but nothing else.</p> <p>To me that is somewhere between Libertarian and the Green party. Libertarian in general but with futuristic education, healthcare, and welfare systems covering all citizens while proactively protecting our environment. We could afford that, and a fantastic national infrastructure too, if we got out of the war business, brought all our troops home, and stopped subsidizing everyone else\u2019s foreign wars that cost us trillions.</p> <p>Most of these conflicts revolve around whose imaginary friend is the best (religion), so there\u2019s nothing really being resolved by them anyway. The money we have wasted, and continue to waste on them could be put to much better use here, and we could really lead by example, but neither the Dems or GOP are \u2013 they\u2019re still just talking.</p> <h2>Bo, 22 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA: \u2018People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019</h2> <p>I am afraid of voting for someone I genuinely support \u2013 Jill Stein. She is woefully underrepresented in the media, and there is endless fear-mongering to dissuade anyone from expressing interest in third-party candidates. Our votes get dubbed \u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cspoiler\u201d votes. </p> <p>I am at a loss. People say a vote for Jill is a vote for the GOP. I don\u2019t know what to do. No other candidate addresses the enslavement of millennials (via student debt) and the debilitating social conditions of everyday life (racism, corporate domination, low-income wage slavery, police brutality, a world of total-work, inadequate healthcare, etc) as comprehensively as Stein. Her emergency Green New Deal is just about the only thing that gives me hope for any kind of future.</p> <h2>Julian, 40 \u2013 China, TX: \u2018I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein\u2019</h2> <p>Here\u2019s the dilemma \u2013 I don\u2019t live in a swing state and due to the electoral college, my presidential vote is basically meaningless when it comes to casting for a Democrat or Republican. It might be hard to understand, especially to outsiders, but I am torn between Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. It\u2019s not because I prefer Johnson, but because the vote would have greater visibility than Stein.</p> <p>Being the two major party candidates are so incredibly disliked, I felt that for the first time, alternate parties could finally break through to the mainstream and end the two-party system that has been so disastrous for the nation; both major parties put the interests of the power elites and Wall Street above the rest of the country.</p> <p>I was very enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. Despite his history of calling third-party candidates spoilers for the presidential races, I really hoped he would join the Green ticket if he lost the Democratic nomination as Stein offered, or at least endorse her. I think his campaign did massive damage to a huge number of his younger followers in regards to future voter participation by endorsing Clinton. He had the perfect opportunity to break up the Democratic party if he\u2019d only fought on after he lost the nomination.</p> <p>If Bernie advocated for the Green party, far more aligned with his policies and mine than the Democrats, then I would vote for the Green party candidate this year.</p> <h2>Olivia, 27 \u2013 San Antonio, TX: \u2018Hillary, show me that you are not a \u2018My way or the highway\u2019 candidate</h2> <p>I\u2019m a millennial allied to no specific party. Both candidates seem determined to alienate \u2013 even demonize \u2013 moderate and independent voters like myself.</p> <p>Future Madame or Mr President, here are my terms:</p> <p>Donald, prove to me that you are not eager to incite a war with our neighbors, or relive the mistakes of Hoover\u2019s isolationist policies which led up to World War II.</p> <p>Hillary, show me that you are not a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d candidate, as some of your virulent advocates make you appear. Demonstrate that those who do not share all your views on a specific topic such as gun control will nevertheless be respected as equals.</p> <p>Donald, prove that you and your physically violent advocates will not spawn violent, racially charged chaos across the country and world.</p> <p>Donald and Hillary, both of you repeatedly demonstrated a shocking disdain for the integrity and even sacred role of the freedom of the press. Prove to me that you will entrust journalists with truth, and not \u201cspin\u201d. The day independent journalists are encouraged, even empowered, to question your authority is the day I may trust you. </p> <h2><br></h2>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s energy agenda \u2013 which includes pledges of \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, making coal great again and ditching the Paris climate deal \u2013 is drawing bipartisan fire from industry analysts, former members of Congress, and even one coal mogul.<br></p> <p>All of them, to varying degrees, fault the billionaire\u2019s basic premises and call his promises farfetched and at times contradictory. <br></p> <p>They say the Republican presidential candidate uses faulty math to tout his vision of America\u2019s energy independence, fails to understand energy economics in his pledge to revive the coal industry, and is peddling a big myth by claiming that global warming is a hoax.</p> <p>Some energy analysts also observe that Trump\u2019s energy prescriptions, including big regulatory cutbacks that have long been industry wishes, are politically expedient and unrealistic. In making his promise to \u201csave the coal industry\u201d, for instance, Trump has backed slashing environmental rules, taking that message to West Virginia earlier this year, when he pledged that the state\u2019s miners, as well as those in Ohio and Pennsylvania, \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2c55cd2496a14bdd98bcf84ccdb34810/ap-fact-check-bringing-coal-jobs-back-appalachia\">are going to start to work again, believe me</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at Brookings for energy security and climate issues, told the Guardian that \u201ccoal jobs aren\u2019t coming back and for Mr Trump to say they\u2019re coming back is erroneous and fanciful\u201d. Noting that cheap natural gas has been the primary driver behind years of decline for the coal industry, Ebinger added that Trump seems to be \u201cpandering to coal miners\u201d.</p> <p>Other analysts concur. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s promise to revive the US coal sector can only be realized by reining in hydraulic fracking,\u201d said Jerry Taylor, the president of libertarian thinktank the Niskanen Center. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because low-cost natural gas (courtesy of fracking) has done far more to shut down coal-fired power plants and, correspondingly, reduce demand for US coal than has EPA regulations. Given that he promises exactly the opposite \u2013 moving heaven and earth to increase US natural gas production \u2013 Trump\u2019s promises are empty.\u201d</p> <p>Even Trump backer and coal mogul Bob Murray, who runs Murray Energy, which has given $100,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac, says that the coal industry won\u2019t ever be great again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a thriving industry ever again,\u201d Murray told an energy publication this year. \u201cThe coal mines cannot come back to where they were or anywhere near it.\u201d </p> <p>Likewise, Trump used dubious data when he spoke at an energy event in May in North Dakota arranged by fracking billionaire Harold Hamm, a key Trump policy adviser who has been mentioned as a possible energy secretary and recently hosted a big campaign fundraiser.</p> <p>Echoing some of Hamm\u2019s priorities, Trump pledged to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas, to revoke policies that limit new drilling technologies and to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement.</p> <p>Trump also promised \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d, a bullish commitment since about a quarter of US energy needs are met by imports, and one that relied on flawed projections of proven oil reserves. Trump stated that the US had 1.5 times the oil of all Opec countries combined. But at the end of 2014, the US had proven reserves of just under 40bn barrels, while Saudi Arabia alone had proven reserves of 268bn barrels.</p> <p>Similarly, Trump claimed that constructing the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 which, unlike Hillary Clinton, he backs \u2013 would create and support 42,000 jobs. But industry projections suggest that building the pipeline would yield about 6,000 jobs directly, and another 7,000 jobs indirectly.</p> <p>Ex-Conoco Phillips lobbyist Don Duncan compared Trump\u2019s energy proposals to those of an \u201cold snake oil salesman\u201d, saying: \u201cTrump\u2019s energy cures are based on a lot of numbers that clash with energy industry data and scientific studies.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s penchant for ignoring facts and hard evidence is also underscored by his attacks on global warming and the Paris accords.</p> <p>Trump famously <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">tweeted</a> in 2012 that the \u201cconcept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing less competitive\u201d. Taylor called this \u201crisible\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cNot one scintilla of evidence exists to back the charge up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of his willingness to say anything at all \u2013 no matter how ridiculous or dishonest \u2013 to justify the know-nothingism of his base.\u201d</p> <p>Trump <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">denied</a> during Monday\u2019s presidential debate having said such a thing, but in a speech last December he referred to global warming as a \u201choax\u201d three times in one sentence. </p> <p>Former US congressman Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who runs a group promoting free enterprise climate change ideas, said Trump\u2019s global warming views were dangerous. \u201cPeople who presume to be leaders by offering false hope and inflaming passions are disqualifying themselves for leadership.\u201d</p>",

And so those fortunate enough to listen to Scully at any point during the roughly 9,000 games he called will feel a stinging void in their lives after his final game on Sunday in San Francisco.</p> <p>Technology had brought my father the last few years of Scully to late east coast nights, and now we were in Los Angeles as our own personal tribute to Scully and to hear him address the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, you made me cry once tonight,\u201d said Scully to the crowd.</p> <p>Fans in the stands were crying with him. We cried because we were part of an audience of baseball fans that helped his own dreams come true. Because we were losing the comfort of his storytelling. Because after 67 beautiful seasons, there were no more tomorrows for baseball\u2019s familiar voice.

The baseball world cried because he was just 24. Because he fought so hard to get here from Cuba. Because, unlike Scully, he\u2019ll never get to take his potential to the next level or live out his dream to completion. Because he will never be a father to his daughter. Because he left so many behind that loved him.

To give their tributes to a player that meant the world to them, and to witness a pitcher who impacted their lives in some way, shape or form.

New York\u2019s aging ballclub, defined by Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira type, suddenly became youthful and promising. A-Rod was ushered out, while prospects were promoted and acquired after shipping away the likes of Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller and Carlos Beltran. Then the Yanks somehow managed to hang in the playoff race, with great thanks to Gary Sanchez\u2019 historic home run streak.

They suffered through a 3-26 stretch, and will end 2016 with their worst record since they lost the \u201cDevil Rays\u201d moniker nine years ago. </p> <p><strong>Kansas City Royals</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"640de978c910c559018c01835309dd86c3c1b2fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/640de978c910c559018c01835309dd86c3c1b2fd/0_44_2399_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Injuries poured cold water on the Kansas City Royals title defense.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Injuries poured cold water on the Kansas City Royals title defense.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Riedel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The champs lost Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain and Alex Gordon to injuries for chunks, and their contact-based offense crashed out, falling to 14th in the league. While starter Danny Duffy was superb, the big-picture formula of mediocre starting pitching bridging to a blistering bullpen didn\u2019t pan out this time around. They ranked 12th in ERA, just as they did last season. Except this in 2016, that translated to a quarter run more per game. With a thin offense, wins were elusive, Ned Yost seemed less genius, and the champs surrendered their crown.<br></p> <p><strong>Chicago White Sox</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"677c7ec1e04e672007528a017255b9d6e90c5af6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/677c7ec1e04e672007528a017255b9d6e90c5af6/0_95_3434_2061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Sale doesn\u2019t seem too cut up about wearing this alternate White Sox jersey, does he?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Sale doesn\u2019t seem too cut up about wearing this alternate White Sox jersey, does he?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Banks/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They look pretty good early on, until they didn\u2019t. From 9 May on, the 23-10 start, the six-game lead, the lights-out bullpen, the surprising starting pitching from Mat Latos and the improvement of Avisail Garcia all went away. They released Latos, picked up James Shields, whose ERA is approaching seven, watched Todd Frazier either strike out or hit a home run, and marveled at the tailoring skills of Chris Sale, who provided their most memorable moment of 2016 by far. <br></p> <p><strong>Minnesota Twins</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"616e87785af72647b8461e01b4c7fe6a4bbac4b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/616e87785af72647b8461e01b4c7fe6a4bbac4b0/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Babe, I mean, Brian Dozier stunned fans by setting a single season record for home runs by a second baseman in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Babe, I mean, Brian Dozier stunned fans by setting a single season record for home runs by a second baseman in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Osentoski/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their 33-58 first-half mark was the second worst in franchise history. That\u2019s the kind of start that gets your GM fired, which is what happened in July when Terry Ryan got the axe and all the good of their surprise 2015 season was evaporated by May. The Twins lost over 100 games while starting 11 pitchers this season: just one, Ervin Santana, had an ERA of below five. Too bad, because, overall, the offense was a tick better than last season, even if some of their younger players, Byron Buxton and Eddie Rosario didn\u2019t capitalize on their playing time and Miguel Sano struck out over 170 times. Brian Dozier is the bright spot, cracking 42 home runs in a season where second baseman out-slugged outfielders for the first time in history. <br></p> <p><strong>Houston Astros</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faccc8738a3a9a41b75518d112bf289216ae568f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faccc8738a3a9a41b75518d112bf289216ae568f/0_32_3433_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Houston Astros hit a wall while playing the Texas Rangers this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Houston Astros hit a wall while playing the Texas Rangers this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Levey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like the Yankees, the Astros are on the cusp of elimination. Should they not come up with what would be nothing short of a miracle, Houston can look at their play against the Texas Rangers as one of the main reasons why they\u2019ve failed to make the playoffs for a second straight season. Their AL West rivals to the west whipped them in 15 out of 19 contests all season long. Yes, you can also blame the poor play of the outfielders: Colby Rasmus struggled and Carlos Gomez stunk it up while Jake Marisnick and Preston Tucker failed to pick up the slack. And Dallas Keuchel did fail to approach the production of his 2015 Cy Young season. But really, all Jose Altuve and company really needed was a few more measly wins against Texas and they would be in the thick of it heading into the final weekend. </p> <p><strong>Los Angeles Angels</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0601f79dfddfc6c2f0a4113d024d6452f16f0947\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0601f79dfddfc6c2f0a4113d024d6452f16f0947/0_92_2124_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Los Angeles Angels continue to slide despite the presence of the best player in the world in Mike Trout on their roster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Los Angeles Angels continue to slide despite the presence of the best player in the world in Mike Trout on their roster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary A.

Is it time for Scioscia to move on after 17 seasons? Quite possibly, but when your rotation is so banged up that you need to test-drive Tim Lincecum mid-season, it becomes harder to blame the manager. Garrett Richards, Andrew Heaney Tyler Skaggs and Matt Shoemaker all missed time, while CJ Wilson, who was supposed to return from surgery, woulnd up undergoing another surgery. It\u2019s messy, and it may be that way for awhile. Meanwhile Mike Trout, the best player on the planet, rots in the orange groves. <br></p> <p><strong>Oakland Athletics</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d9d10162e03e67495982b6ab0589bf05ca451bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d9d10162e03e67495982b6ab0589bf05ca451bb/0_113_3056_1834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This didn\u2019t happen much in Oakland this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This didn\u2019t happen much in Oakland this season</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neville E.

Like so many other rotations across baseball, injuries caused significant issues and only Rich Hill was able to combine health and quality. As with most Beane teams there is a developing core: this season starter Sean Manea, third baseman Matt Chapman and shortstop Franklin Barreto have emerged to show promise, while Jharel Cotton, one of three prospects acquired in Hill\u2019s eventual move to the Dodgers, has looked good in a handful of starts. Yes, the A\u2019s slumped in 2016, but there\u2019s always tomorrow in Oakland. <br></p> <p><strong>Arizona Diamondbacks</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"381642e16a4d137bb2c8bc293dcf5ef3ae302c9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/381642e16a4d137bb2c8bc293dcf5ef3ae302c9f/0_56_2206_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No team looked worse while losing in 2016 than the Arizona Diamondbacks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No team looked worse while losing in 2016 than the Arizona Diamondbacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Mills/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arizona looked as bad as their deep grey uniforms during a 2016 season that blew up early. Winter acquisitions Zack Greinke and Shelby Miller, dealt for No1 pick Dansby Swanson from Atlanta, were shelled regularly before Miller was sent to the minors. Prior to their roasting, star outfielder AJ Pollack suffered an injury in spring training that would keep him out until September. So really, it was all over before it began. Tony La Russa recently fired senior VP of baseball operations De Jon Watson, and La Russa and GM Dave Stewart <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/disappointing-diamondbacks-fire-vp-tony-121116925.html\">could be next</a>. Bright spots were with the bats: as always, Paul Goldschmidt was superb, while Jean Segura, Jake Lamb and young Brandon Drury, whose crazy September OPS of over 1.000, brought some measure of solace to Chase Field. <br></p> <p><strong>San Diego Padres</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae4496a2e9140aef927c8dbec91d3292350f40a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae4496a2e9140aef927c8dbec91d3292350f40a1/0_273_3244_1948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It was that kind of season in San Diego.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It was that kind of season in San Diego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Carlson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was the good AJ Preller: turning a breakout season from Drew Pomeranz, and solid performances from Fernando Rodney, Matt Kemp and Melvin Upton into strong prospects, moves that could ultimately become a successful reversal of the failures that followed their aggressive off-season of 2014-15. The bad AJ Preller got caught withholding medical information during in his dealings with the Boston Red Sox in the Pomeranz deal: the controversial GM got a wrist slap 30-day suspension, the Pads got a stain on their season. In between, minor league afterthoughts Ryan Schimpf, a second baseman, and reliever Ryan Buchter become legitimate big league players, while rule 5 pick Luis Pedromo showed promise as a starter despite never pitching above Single-A ball. <br></p> <p><strong>Colorado Rockies</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb190fd80be4299e1437b6d92921a920d6acde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb190fd80be4299e1437b6d92921a920d6acde1/0_110_4221_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nolan Arenado was Superman in 2016 but the Colorado Rockies failed to turn the corner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nolan Arenado was Superman in 2016 but the Colorado Rockies failed to turn the corner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Moloshok/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rockies rode a 14-5 hot streak ride out of the All-Star break and into wild card contention. Then they lost 10 of 12 games and that was that. Still, 2016 seemed positive, even if Coors Field always makes winning difficult. They actually pitched reasonably well, away from home of course, posting the sixth best road ERA in the NL. At home? Well, at least Arizona finished with a worse team ERA. Offensively, DJ LeMaheiu will win the batting title, Nolan Arenado is an MVP candidate and rookie Trevor Story surprised all by homering in seven times of his first eight games. The two Tyler\u2019s, Chatwood and Anderson pitched well despite their environment and the Rockies were competitive and fun, more than their fans bargained for this season. <br></p> <p><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8df74e3cfc40e983468f884d2131779446e45cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8df74e3cfc40e983468f884d2131779446e45cd/0_165_4938_2963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Kemp proved he could be a centerpiece in the Atlanta Braves 2017 lineup after being acquired from San Diego.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Kemp proved he could be a centerpiece in the Atlanta Braves 2017 lineup after being acquired from San Diego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Davis/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time the season was done, Atlanta didn\u2019t look like a 90-loss team, finishing with a flash, torturing the Mets and compiling a 16-9 mark down the stretch. That was mostly thanks to a lineup featuring a formidable one through five lineup that includes former No1 pick Dansby Swanson who was fleeced from Arizona and proved he was ready for the bigs and h hot Freddie Freeman on a 30-ga,e hitting streak. The mid-season acquisition of Matt Kemp also worked out well with the vet posting strong numbers and defense in left field. The bullpen has a handful of elite arms while the Braves GM John Coppolella says they\u2019ll have $50m to upgrade the team, including the rotation, which is led by Julio Teheran. With few starters available, look for Atlanta to take on salary via trades as they gear up for opening day in their new Cobb County ballpark. <br></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia Phillies</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ecf7ec7d2ecba98b9cf73da856652896de1e22a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ecf7ec7d2ecba98b9cf73da856652896de1e22a/0_124_2030_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Philadelphia Phillies saw their luck run out by June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Philadelphia Phillies saw their luck run out by June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mitchell Leff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pete Mackanin\u2019s Phillies couldn\u2019t have had lower expectations coming off a 99-loss season, but by 18 May they were 4-0 in extra innings, had won 11 games by scoring three runs or less, were 15-3 in one-run games and were just a half game out of first place in the NL East, all despite being 14th in NL runs scored. Their lucky streak would soon end and the sort of losing that a rebuilding franchise can expect took over. There are signs that the growing pains of a youthful starting rotation group \u2013 Vince Velasquez, Aaron Nola and Jared Eickhoff \u2013 will eventually yield a steady core. When prospects including JP Crawford, Mickey Moniak, Nick Williams, Roman Quinn are ready to join the likes of current Phills Maikel Franco and Odubel Herrera, Philly could potentially become one of the more complete offensive clubs in the NL, <em>could </em>being the key word. It won\u2019t happen next season, or perhaps the season after that, but at least a blueprint is in place: all that\u2019s needed is plenty of patience. </p> <p><strong>Miami Marlins</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2824f6a919811eb188911c1c3d503730f26a8686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2824f6a919811eb188911c1c3d503730f26a8686/0_83_2552_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tragedy struck Major League Baseball when JJos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez was killed in a boating accident on Sunday morin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tragedy struck Major League Baseball when JJos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez was killed in a boating accident on Sunday morin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasen Vinlove/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2016 will always be remembered for the tragedy surrounding the death of Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez. His loss continues to overwhelm Miami and the baseball world as we struggle to understand how a young person can be gone, just like that, long before his time is up. The frustrations of an organization struggling to compete for a post-season spot matter little at the moment, and so any mention of their on-field issues are for another time.</p> <p><strong>Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2033e5f67dd7159042fffd989f9641032ef19fc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2033e5f67dd7159042fffd989f9641032ef19fc6/0_154_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pittsburgh Pirates waved goodbye to the playoffs in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pittsburgh Pirates waved goodbye to the playoffs in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took 20 long years for the Pirates to find a place into the playoffs: the question now is, how long will it take for the Buccos to get back to the post-season? Holes require filling in the starting rotation: in 2016, fairy dust flew off Francisco Liriano, Jonathan Niese flopped, Gerrit Cole managed just 21 starts and JA Happ put up ace like numbers, for the Blue Jays. Offensively, Andrew McCutchen declined for the second straight year, but Starling Marte, Gregory Polanco, Jung Ho Kang provided enough offense, and really, a half-decent rotation would\u2019ve been enough to get them to a fourth consecutive playoff appearance, considering the competition. Instead, Bucs fans are left wondering if their two tough wild card game losses will remain the legacy of this era. </p> <p><strong>Milwaukee Brewers</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9125dd4af2d1c0b2e3ede5a109dd90ab370a77c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9125dd4af2d1c0b2e3ede5a109dd90ab370a77c2/0_101_4145_2487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Ryan Braun be a Milwaukee Brewer when 2017 opens?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Ryan Braun be a Milwaukee Brewer when 2017 opens?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Wierzbicki/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Brewers continued to sell during their rebuild, dumping catcher Jonathan Lucroy, relievers Jeremy Jefress and Will Smith for promising prospects including catcher Andrew Susac. Ryan Braun, one of the last vets on the roster, nearly wound up in Los Angeles before a deal for Yasiel Puig fell through. Milwaukee won more games than they did a season ago and rather amazingly, drew over 2.3m fans in 2016. Shortstop Jonathan Villar is flirting with a historic tally of 20 homers and 60 stolen bases, while utility-man Hernan Perez became a bona fide regular, Zach Davies showed signs of breaking out and Keon Broxton was an athletic and productive contributor. Still, any turnaround is distant and Miller Park will continue to be a safe place for Cubs fans in 2017. </p> <p><strong>Cincinnati Reds</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6adb3bcb1150e47894a28a74646b549b4534f683\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6adb3bcb1150e47894a28a74646b549b4534f683/0_85_2536_1522/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cincinnati Reds 2016 season was, at times, hard to watch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cincinnati Reds 2016 season was, at times, hard to watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Sabau/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just when you thought that a 6.25 April ERA amongst Reds relievers was rock bottom, along came May where the bullpen topped seven. And while injuries continued to derail catcher Devin Mesoraco, and Homer Bailey bombed after returning in July, there was Anthony DeSclafani emerging to post a sub-3.50 ERA, Joey Votto approaching a .400 post all-star break batting average, Adam Duvall breaking out with over 30 homers and the emergence of 22-year-old shortstop Jose Peraza. Still, despite a decent set of prospects seasoning in the minors, competing in a division with Chicago, the Cardinals and Pirates should bring more misery in 2017. </p>",

The fact that the region is under the watch of one of the largest peacekeeping forces in the world, and that earlier this month Sudan\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/omar-al-bashir\">Omar al-Bashir</a>, proclaimed that peace had returned to the troubled region, make Amnesty\u2019s findings all the more galling.</p> <p>After all, we are talking about the same types of war crimes that first catapulted Darfur into the world\u2019s consciousness in 2004. But this is 13 years later; and the attacks we\u2019ve documented happened between January and September 2016. The most recent was on 9 September 2016; just a few weeks ago and the day after Bashir\u2019s lofty proclamation.</p> <p>And if the use of chemical weapons is confirmed, this would represent a new level of barbarity in the conflict, and a new depth to the range of suffering endured by the Darfuri people. One woman described how her baby was still sick some six months after exposure to what she described as \u201cpoisoned air\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe baby is not recovering \u2026 he is swollen \u2026 he has blisters and wounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe [medical staff] say he will get better if he drinks [breast] milk \u2026 but it is not working.\u201d</p> <p>Chemical weapons have been banned for decades at the international level in recognition of the fact that the suffering they cause can never be justified. Credible evidence that Sudan\u2019s government might now repeatedly be using them simply cannot be ignored.</p> <p>More than a decade ago, the international criminal court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/south-africa-to-fight-omar-al-bashirs-arrest-warrant-sudan\">(ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Bashir</a> on three counts of genocide, five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes. And yet, the president has since won two elections and travelled regularly, including to Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. As signatories to the <a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/intro/585\">Rome statute which created the ICC</a>, each of these countries had a duty to arrest Bashir on his arrival. None of them did.</p> <p>Absolutely no effective measures have ever been put in place to protect civilians in Darfur despite being under the watch of a joint <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unamid/\">African Union and United Nations peacekeeping mission</a> (Unamid). Peace talks and agreements have brought no security or respite for the Darfuri people.</p> <p>The response of the international community in the last 10 years has been utterly deplorable and in the face of such an ineffective reaction, it is little wonder that Al-Bashir\u2019s hubris has grown.</p> <p>In the light of this shocking new evidence, and on the eve of the UN security council meeting in New York, we are calling on it to do more to protect the children, men and women of Darfur.</p> <p>It can do this by applying political pressure on the government of Sudan to ensure that the Unamid peacekeeping force, as well as humanitarian agencies, can access parts of Darfur such as Jebel Marra, where some of the worst abuses appear to be happening. There need to be more peacekeeping bases, and they must be able to conduct proactive patrols deep into these remote areas.</p> <p>There also needs to be an urgent investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Jebel Marra and, if there is sufficient evidence, prosecutions of all those suspected of criminal responsibility must follow.</p> <p>Bashir must learn that there are consequences when crimes under international law are committed. There has been 13 years of catastrophic violence and recurring human rights violations; it\u2019s time the world set its focus, once more, on Darfur and act.</p>",

People think these cups are recyclable but they\u2019re not, and a charge similar to that for plastic bags could dramatically reduce the number that end up in landfill as waste.\u201d</p> <p>But the government has said it has no plans to force coffee shops to put a charge on cups.</p> <p>The Cardiff research showed that the bag charge gave people in England an increased environmental awareness, and greater willingness to accept other waste policies too, such as a 5p charge on plastic bottles. </p> <p>\u201cThe success of the plastic bag charge in effectively changing plastic bag use and increasing support for other charges to reduce waste suggests that similar policies could also be successfully implemented, such as a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles or a charge on disposable coffee cups,\u201d the authors wrote.</p> <p>But lead author Prof Wouter Poortinga conceded that a coffee cup charge would be trickier. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the same. It\u2019s easier to adapt to a bag charge by bringing your own bag than by bringing your own cup.

It\u2019s the very real, very tragic tale of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/deepwater-horizon-film/2016/sep/21/deepwater-horizon-anatomy-of-a-disaster\">2010 oil rig explosion that killed 11 people</a> and caused an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">environmentally catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a>.

Poor Sully lands an airplane on the Hudson river, no one dies, and he still gets chastised by those damn bureaucrats (please read in gravelly Clint Eastwood voice) when he gets home.

I lobbied my editors for a page break, just in case, but I was denied.</p> <p>The Imitation Game is but the most recent addition to the grand tradition of the British based-on-a-true-story film. Imitation Game\u2019s hero, brilliant mathematician Alan Turing, is also a reluctant hero, as in the American tradition. He suffers the slings and arrows of a system that does not understand him nor is willing to recognize his contribution to the war effort. His cracking of the Enigma code is crucial to the Allied cause, but because he was gay, the military history books relegated him to footnote status <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/jun/19/theenigmaofalanturing\">until very recently</a>.</p> <p>So, what\u2019s different between Alan Turing and Sully Sullenberg besides differing tastes in facial hair? First of all, Alan Turing knows he\u2019s brilliant. What propels him to continue working on the machine that would help break the code and to defy superiors who doubted his efforts is self-belief. Turing\u2019s lack of social graces in the film means that he often says what he is thinking, which is that he knows better. It\u2019s safe to say the protagonist of Deepwater Horizon lacks this rarefied air. This is not to say that the average British hero is some strutting peacock and the American is a stern puritan. It\u2019s notable only in that it\u2019s a subversion of audience stereotypes and expectations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b0c1c1ef6c58bf0b3fc34cc5b952399339afa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b0c1c1ef6c58bf0b3fc34cc5b952399339afa2/0_311_4849_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Made in Dagenham glorifies the unionization of labor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made in Dagenham glorifies the unionization of labor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more pressing in this analysis is the contrast between the man of action and the man of principle, or in the case of the 2010 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/30/made-in-dagenham-film-review\">Made in Dagenham</a>, the woman. Made in Dagenham does not have explosions, gunfire or sweaty dudes covered in grease. Sally Hawkins stars as a fictional character plopped into the true story of a workers\u2019 strike at a Ford motor company sewing plant in the Dagenham area of London. Note that a protagonist was invented for the purposes of dramatizing this story. In order to make a movie out of a collective social action, a person had to be invented. Similarly, the Sally Field film <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/04/culture.features\">Norma Rae</a>, an American film about the labor movement, fictionalized Crystal Lee Sutton.</p> <p>Norma Rae is something of an outlier in American film in that it\u2019s a movie that glorifies the unionization of labor rather than exalting the \u201clone survivor\u201d story that we Yankees crave, while the British routinely revel in films like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984\">Pride</a>, about LGBT activists who get involved in the 1984 British miners\u2019 strike. Pride is an unabashed ensemble piece about how collective action can uplift people of all stripes. Modern Britain does seem to be becoming less and less amenable to progressive ideas, but there still remains that kernel of the European fascination with democratic socialism. In these British films, the system is still the enemy, but it can only be defeated with a group effort. </p> <p>When the story is one of individual effort, British film tends to focus on the criminal figure \u2013 Roger Daltry in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/10/last-days-of-prison-breakout\">McVicar </a>or more recently, Tom Hardy as the Kray brothers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/legend-review-tom-hardy-on-double-duty-in-cartoonish-krays-biopic\">Legend</a>. It\u2019s no coincidence that British true-story films that do well in America are usually ones that narrow their focus to one transcendent figure \u2013 King George VI in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/06/the-kings-speech-review\">The King\u2019s Speech</a>, Margaret Thatcher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/05/the-iron-lady-film-review\">The Iron Lady</a>, or Alan Turing.

Glenn on Wednesday said that it was the FA\u2019s job as regulator and governing body to uphold the game\u2019s integrity and as such it was impossible for the 61-year-old to continue as England manager.</p> <p>There is already a range of views \u2013 from those who feel the FA was weak in caving in to those who feel it had no other option \u2013 but it is hard to argue that it did not act in a swift and reasonable fashion.</p> <p>The role that Glenn, the former United Biscuits chief executive who entered Wembley in a whirl of restructuring activity, imagined for the FA \u2013 a noble upholder of the game\u2019s standards \u2013 and led to its decision to cut Allardyce loose is no longer the case, if it ever was. The huge global expansion of the game, lubricated by billions spent by fans and the ambitions of thrusting individuals, companies and entire countries, has ushered in a world that has spun far beyond the FA\u2019s control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/fa-chief-sorry-sam-allardyce-england-job-lifetime\">FA chief felt sorry Sam Allardyce lost England job of a lifetime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The way the Quest investigation in the middle of the last decade \u2013 when Allardyce, who denied wrongdoing, was implicated \u2013 was passed around various stakeholders before being kicked into the long grass by Fifa is instructive.</p> <p>Even the agents themselves agree, even though it would be foolish to necessarily take them at face value and self preservation may be one motivation. \u201cThe global move to deregulation has not worked and it has allowed the system to be more open to manipulation and abuse,\u201d said the Association of Football Agents on Wednesday.</p> <p>In his recent book, First Artist\u2019s Phil Smith wrote of a \u201clawless world of secret agents\u201d. \u201cThere is more money disappearing out of the game through agents operating with impunity, but the authorities do not want the fight,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>The real dangers to the integrity of the game come less from the sort of old-fashioned extras referred to in the latest round of newspaper reports than the vast unregulated web of offshore companies, third-party ownership models (supposedly banned, still rampant) that buy and sell portions of players like chattels, the power that has distilled into the hands of a handful of so-called super agents and their associates and so on and on. The game has stayed the same but the methods and sums involved have changed. Brown paper envelopes in service stations are out, complex cross-border transactions and offshore models are in.</p> <p>We have the illusion of some transparency \u2013 the amount spent by clubs on agents\u2019 fees is now published quarterly, for example. Fifa\u2019s Transfer Matching System logs the details of overseas transactions and publishes the huge sums involved once a year. But large amounts of money continue to move around the world in largely unregulated fashion and too much remains unknown about where it ends up. Certainly, football\u2019s governing bodies do not have the tools or the will to police it properly.</p> <p>In some ways it is a microcosm of the way the globalised, tax averse, opaque world of big business and corporate finance has gone in general. Only occasionally, as with the Panama Papers or the FBI\u2019s Fifa probe, is there a glimpse of one portion of it before the waters close over again. If the FA wants to reassert its long-relinquished position as football\u2019s moral compass, it would do well to unapologetically reclaim its role as the game\u2019s regulator.</p> <p>Some of this goes back to the dry governance issues that have remained unresolved for decades \u2013 making the FA Council more representative, the FA executive more effective, properly separating out its disciplinary function.</p> <p>If Glenn and Clarke want to show that the FA upholds the standards that apparently led them to conclude that Allardyce had to go, then making a definitive move to at least try to attempt some oversight of the vast sums of money now swilling around the top end of the game might be a good place to start.</p>",
  "<p><br>When <a href=\"https://www.internationalanimalrescue.org/\">International Animal Rescue (IAR)</a> staff found Didik, he was emaciated and near death. The 18-month-old orangutan, who had been dumped at a local store in Ketapang, Indonesia, had a bullet in his shoulder and had very likely seen his mother killed by the same people who put it there. </p> <p>\u201cOur team deals with so many cases like Didik\u2019s in which the baby has ended up as someone\u2019s pet but the true fate of the mother remains unknown,\u201d said Lis Key, communications manager for the IAR, adding that \u201corangutan mothers are very protective of their babies and wouldn\u2019t let go of them without a fight.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Didik was found alone almost certainly means his mother is dead, according to the IAR. In the wild, orangutans live with their mother for seven to eight years, longer than any other mammal except humans. </p> <p>Didik was rushed to the orangutan facility where the IAR team spent several weeks focusing on Didik\u2019s recovery from severe malnutrition. Once he was strong enough, the team operated on the young orangutan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1f33d87c230983a28d2731e185aa126581c1dd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f33d87c230983a28d2731e185aa126581c1dd1/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vet Sulhi Aufa examines Didik pre-op as he clings to one of the team\u2019s vet nurses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vet Sulhi Aufa examines Didik pre-op as he clings to one of the team\u2019s vet nurses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Animal Rescue</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFortunately the bullet was lodged close to the surface of the skin so it was a straightforward procedure to remove it,\u201d said IAR vet Ayu Budi Handayani. \u201cNo one could call Didik lucky after all he\u2019s been through but certainly he was fortunate to suffer only a fairly superficial wound.\u201d</p> <p>Didik is now on the road to recovery and the centre hopes to soon introduce him to other baby orangutans in their care.

No one knows for certain how many Bornean orangutans survive today, but experts estimate the population has dropped from around 288,500 individuals in 1973 to just over 100,000. Moreover, experts believe that around 2,000-3,000 orangutans are killed in Indonesian Borneo every year. Unfortunately, the Bornean orangutan\u2019s closest relative, the Sumatran orangutan, is also categorised as critically endangered. <br></p> <p>The island of Borneo \u2013 split between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei \u2013 has undergone drastic change in the last few decades. Industrialized logging came to the island in the 1970s, decimating ancient rainforests. Then came palm oil: over the last few decades large swathes of the island have been planted with vast oil palm plantations. <br></p> <p>Since the 1970s, Borneo has lost around 40% of its forests in total. Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/29/rate-of-deforestation-in-indonesia-overtakes-brazil-says-study\">deforestation rate</a> is higher than Brazil\u2019s. <br></p> <p>The destruction of much of Borneo\u2019s forests has pushed orangutan populations into increasing contact with humans, frequently leading to conflict. Orangutans, many of which have lost their food resources, are forced into palm oil plantations where they are viewed as pests and often shot. Orangutans can be destructive to the young palms, but the exotic palm fruit is also not enough to sustain a great ape which in the wild consumes hundreds of different types of fruit. Orangutans are often found stuck in plantations slowly succumbing to starvation and dehydration. </p> <p>Whether or not Didik was a victim of the palm oil industry or simply caught by poachers in a forest remains unknown. But as the orangutan crisis goes on, year-after-year, facilities like IAR\u2019s are filling up with orphans and injured adults. <br></p> <p>\u201cSadly there has been no let up in the number of young orangutans coming into our rehabilitation centre and, should there be more fires in Indonesia in the near future, our team could be kept busy once more in the months ahead,\u201d said Key. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/may/22/chimps-losing-lives-and-limbs-to-the-landmines-of-the-forest\">Chimps losing lives and limbs to the 'landmines of the forest'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, large areas of Indonesian Borneo burned.

Experts estimate that the country lost 2.1m hectares, much of it rainforest and peat forest, to the fires. </p> <p>Dry conditions, likely exacerbated by climate change and El Ni\u00f1o, worsened the crisis and covered much of the country in a yellow, toxic pall.

  "<p>Before the vehicle that she was travelling in flipped over and trapped her right leg, Leakhena Laing was a happy teenager who enjoyed climbing trees and playing football with friends. After her limb was amputated, she could only sit and watch. </p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult to even get a glass of water. I felt hopeless, very sad and embarrassed to be around other people,\u201d says Laing, who was forced to abandon school after the accident nearly four years ago.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>She used crutches for two years, before receiving a below-knee (transtibial) prosthetic plaster limb, which improved the quality of her life, although it meant regular visits to a clinic in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u2019s capital, nearly 30 miles away from her home in Borset district, for refittings.<br></p> <p>Today, aged 18, Laing\u2019s part of a ground-breaking trial by the Canadian non-profit social enterprise <a href=\"http://niatech.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nia Technologies</a>, aiming to produce high quality mobility devices for children and young people more quickly than the conventionally produced plaster cast method \u2013 using a 3D printer and other 3D technology.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation estimates that 30 million people in low-income countries need prosthetic limbs. There is hope that 3D scanning and printing may be able to help.</p> <h2>Pioneering techniques</h2> <p>\u201cOur project leap frogs current developed world fabrication techniques by using 3D printing to produce devices that are actually being used by patients,\u201d says Dr Matt Ratto, Nia\u2019s chief science officer. In the trial that 60 Cambodian children and young people, including Laing, are participating in, Nia is testing \u201c<a href=\"http://niatech.org/the-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3D PrintAbility</a>\u201d, which combines scanning, modelling and printing technologies to produce two types of mobility devices: transibial (below-the-knee) sockets and ankle foot orthoses (AFOs or leg braces). </p> <p>The computer process enables medical staff to save work (digital files), share them with colleagues for review and keep a digital record of a patient\u2019s history of devices. As Ratto describes, \u201cwhat that literally looks like is a Google docs for prosthetists, where they upload the digital model they made.

He estimates total spending on 3D printing, including printers, materials and services, will reache around USD $947m in 2016, and jump to $1.6bn by 2018. </p> <p>\u201c3D printed prosthetics development is being used more and more in hospitals and clinics worldwide,\u201d says Kempton. \u201cIt is becoming more common than not for orthodontist clinics to make use of 3D printing, and this will only continue to grow in the future.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe ability to quickly repair and adapt any part of the prosthetics is incredibly useful, especially as the body changes.\u201d</p> <p>In Cambodia, Laing is hoping new technology could build upon what a plaster cast has already given her, that is the ability to \u201ccook for myself, fetch water for my family, walk and do other things\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am very happy to be part of this study,\u201d says Laing. </p> <p>She still dreams of what she intended before her accident, to become a beautician. </p> <p>\u201cI want to continue my education and open a salon,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong><br></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a large branch of televisual entertainment that relies on people doing strange and disconcerting things, either as some kind of challenge or ritual humiliation, or as the price you pay for being allowed to call yourself a celebrity when you aren\u2019t really. Then there are those folks who do odd things off their own bat, because they\u2019re odd. You don\u2019t have to give them reasons or offer them money. You just have to find them.</p> <p><strong>World of Weird</strong> (Channel 4) is a&#xa0;series that does just that, and it\u2019s a very sturdy formula. The only possible difficulty its producers might have faced is a global shortage of weirdness, but once they tracked down the man who paints pictures with his penis, I\u2019m sure they felt they were away.</p> <p>Tim Patch \u2013 AKA Pricasso \u2013 lives in Queensland in a house he built himself. He wears an outsize pink top hat and matching bow tie when he works, and not much else. He produces, he reckons, about 1,000 canvases a year, mostly on commission, although success in his particular discipline comes at a&#xa0;price. \u201cI go through a lot of skin,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It has been said that half an hour spent in the company of someone who is good at his job is never wasted. As a&#xa0;corollary to that, I would suggest that 15 minutes spent watching a guy paint with his dick will make you feel a lot better about how you waste your own time, with the possible exception of the preceding 15 minutes.</p> <p>To say that Pricasso paints with his penis isn\u2019t completely accurate; he also paints with his balls and arse. He has a method for doing the canvas edges he calls \u201cthe credit card swipe\u201d that, I&#xa0;must confess, I\u2019m still a little haunted&#xa0;by.</p> <p>Pricasso\u2019s paintings are mostly portraits, either of famous people or paying sitters. The best thing I can say about them is that they\u2019re not bad, considering. Presenter Joel Dommett had a go at producing a still life using only his member, which proved, if nothing else, that it\u2019s harder than it looks. I&#xa0;thank&#xa0;you.</p> <p>World of Weird also turned our jaded attentions to Texan vampire Michael Vachmiel, who is part of a&#xa0;subculture dedicated to combining gothic fashions with total nonsense. The programme claimed there might be as many as 5,000 vampires in the US, although I would suggest the true figure is much closer to zero.</p> <p>Vachmiel calls himself a \u201csanguinarian\u201d, which means he drinks blood. His source \u2013 a \u201cblack swan\u201d in pretend-vampire parlance \u2013 is a 29-year-old woman who goes by the name of Blut Katzchen. It\u2019s a consensual relationship, although it was unclear what she got out of it, and even less clear after she explained. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a spiritual thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exchange of energy.

  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s a mystery,\u201d mountain guide Fernando Santamaria says, as we peer through an arched doorway. The \u201cmystery\u201d is an ancient throne made from slate, inside a boxy stone building in the remote desert of Salta in north-west Argentina. \u201cIt could have been used by an Inca general as their meeting room, or for religious ceremonies.\u201d But it could also have been used as a bathroom. \u201cFor washing,\u201d Fernando says quickly emphasising that it\u2019s not that kind of \u201cthrone\u201d.</p> <p>The throne room is part of the Sill\u00f3n del Inca archeological site, the ruins of a town that was one of the most southerly parts of the Inca empire. No one is claiming that it\u2019s the new Machu Picchu, but it is a significant \u2013 if virtually unknown \u2013 spot, recently recognised as a Unesco heritage site, and the cherry on the cake of a brand new, four-day, 48km trek. The high-altitude route has been put together by three local companies as Salta\u2019s own \u201cInca trail\u201d, a chance to explore this underrated, little-known region close to the borders of Chile and Bolivia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c49371ad2f3bb45248e63acd3c0459c65c5a0dd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c49371ad2f3bb45248e63acd3c0459c65c5a0dd0/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the mysterious throne room at Sill\u00f3n del Inca\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a seat \u2026 the mysterious throne room at Sill\u00f3n del Inca</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Green/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After an acclimatisation day in Salta city, we start out from the roadside near Maury station in the Quebrada del Toro gorge. I can feel the thinness of the air as we start from 2,360 metres and climb for three hours up steep switchbacks, the dusty trail cutting through the arid hillside\u2019s giant candelabra cacti. \u201cThis path was used by the Incas,\u201d Fernando tells me. \u201cThen, the Spanish, and now local people.\u201d And now us.</p> <p>A guanaco watches from the ridge above as we reach the 3,260m top of the trail and start our hike through a remote, silent valley. Dramatic hills the colour of sand and cement surround the valley, sculpted smooth by time and weather, striped with layers of red and yellow rock. Tall, two-pronged cacti look like they\u2019re sticking two fingers up at the sky for not giving them more water.</p> <p>\u201cThis valley is called the Quebrada da Incahuasi,\u201d says Angel Vilte, who\u2019s leading the mules carrying our gear. We descend into the abandoned Inca city, where waist-high walls mark out where houses and other buildings stood. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a pre-Inca ruin,\u201d Fernando tells me. \u201cThe Incas arrived here in the 1400s and before that, the houses were circular; the Incas brought the right angles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt its most developed, the Inca empire ran from the south of Colombia and Peru to Mendoza in Argentina,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe arrival of the Spanish in the 1530s stopped their expansion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5addfa5ee91417d7914f08d931399d126e9a957e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5addfa5ee91417d7914f08d931399d126e9a957e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Layers of coloured rock above Quebrada da Incahuasi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Layers of coloured rock above Quebrada da Incahuasi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Green/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As ancient archaeological sites go, it\u2019s pretty low key. We\u2019re the only people here, though some locals have built homes inside the city walls. Cows lumber about. \u201cThis place would have supplied goods to passing caravans,\u201d Fernando says. \u201cIt was a big city, an important military, residential and administration centre.\u201d</p> <p>We pause for a guessing game of thrones at the Inca\u2019s seat, Fernando pointing to holes in walls that would have housed religious statues. There\u2019s hope there could be more of interest below the ground, including artefacts, if the government or anyone else chooses to investigate.</p> <p>With hot sun and a hard wind on our backs, and a fat round moon rising over the ridge ahead, we make slow progress up a hillside where sheep and guanaco are grazing. My lungs feel tight, my legs sapped of energy from hours of hiking at such a high altitude. The <em>puesto</em> (small ranch) where we\u2019re staying is a welcome sight as daylight starts to fade: it\u2019s just a few mud-and-stone buildings around a courtyard where dogs and chickens wander. Tents are pitched, while Berta Vilte, Angel\u2019s sister, calls the sheep in for the night. Smoke from the kitchen fire billows into the night as we pass around warming cups of <em>mate</em> tea. The stars and moon are so bright they light up the mountainside. Even if there were no ancient Inca site out here, you\u2019d come for this feeling of absolute wilderness.</p> <p>A rooster that clearly doesn\u2019t understand the term lie-in starts us on our way early next morning. We hike through cow pastures, past frozen mountain streams and up to the highest point on the trek, Abra de la Cruz at 3,457m, marked by a cross. Below us is an ocean of cloud, the kind of view you usually only see from an aeroplane window.</p> <p>\u201cThis really is like trekking to the clouds,\u201d Fernando says, as we descend. It\u2019s actually trekking inside the clouds, as we\u2019re enveloped by a ghostly grey-white mist. We use GPS to keep us on track as Fernando sings \u201cIn the middle of the cloud\u201d, a pastiche of the Billy Joel song.</p> <p>A black dog greets us the next evening at Puesto Pascuala, a small ranch with a donkey\u2019s skull hanging in the courtyard. Pascuala Cruz, who lives there, is slowly milking a pen full of goats as we set off in the morning, hiking down into a green valley towards the confluence of two rivers. Four condors circle high above us, soaring in and out of the cloud. A group of semi-wild horses roam freely on the hills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9748418ca33ccbf408312b14141aa44bb00a62a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9748418ca33ccbf408312b14141aa44bb00a62a1/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A goat at Puesto Pascuala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A goat at Puesto Pascuala</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Green/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having dropped 1,000m, we reach the warm floor of the gorge and cross a rushing river. After a tough uphill stretch, the bleating of goats announces that we\u2019ve arrived at Puesto Sarapura. In the yard, a gnarly tree trunk has been carved into a regal-looking throne by owner Vicente Burgos. This time, I\u2019ve no doubt what it\u2019s for: a nice sit down after a long hike.</p> <p>We stop on our way out next morning to see a new lamb, born overnight, shakily clutching its mother\u2019s side and struggling to find its legs. Up in these hills, he\u2019s really going to need them.</p> <p>Our final day takes us into Salta\u2019s Yungas, an area of tropical rainforest. The thick greenery and fast-flowing streams feel a world away from the dry desert landscape we started from days before, as we make our way up to a vantage point high above sprawling Salta city.</p> <p>After a long, knee-busting downhill, our peaceful wilderness hike ends in the busy Quebrada de San Lorenzo nature reserve, where couples are posing for selfies and children run about, the first city folks we\u2019ve seen in days. Skrillex-style music blasts from a cafe\u2019s stereo.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome back to civilisation,\u201d Fernando grins.

  "<p>Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn\u2019t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French.</p> <p>And then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\">17 million people voted to leave</a>. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife\u2019s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn\u2019t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed \u2013 or thanked, depending on your view \u2013 for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window \u2013 the remedy of leaving \u2013 in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost,<strong> </strong>a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. \u201cLike the monks on Iona,\u201d as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, \u201cilluminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.\u201d</p> <p>And no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence \u2013 fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. \u201cHere I am, Ishmael,\u201d he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. \u201cEvery man\u2019s hand is against me.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who has done more on this,\u201d he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU \u2013 \u201cbut Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-membership element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-long-read-live-at-the-hospital-club-27192843527\">The Long Read live at the Hospital Club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hannan\u2019s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. \u201cWhen I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,\u201d Carswell told me recently, \u201cI thought, \u2018Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.\u2019\u201d Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was \u201cradicalised\u201d, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. \u201cOn the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn\u2019t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. \u201cThe broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,\u201d said Michael Gove. \u201cThey took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren\u2019t.\u201d Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan\u2019s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. \u201cYou have got to have hard arses,\u201d the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, \u201cwho are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don\u2019t mind being unfashionable.\u201d<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his own way, he is an idiot savant.

The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">posters about Turkey joining the EU,</a> were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit \u2013 mostly about deregulation and sovereignty \u2013 was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. \u201cIn his own way, he is an idiot savant,\u201d said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSo locked up in his world that he can\u2019t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks \u2013 like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide \u2013 and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/775996023873429504\">If you\u2019re told that \u2018Brexit was all about immigration,\u2019 you can be almost certain that you\u2019re talking to a Remain voter,</a>\u201d ran a sample, recent tweet.</p> <p>For the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers \u2013 a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century \u2013 will always be a breathtaking thing. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge of the nerd,\u201d one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. \u201cI was in awe of it.\u201d But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. \u201cNone of these people are builders, they are destroyers,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThey are frightening people. They are like arsonists.\u201d If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life\u2019s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself. His term as an MEP runs out in 2019, and he plans to leave politics after that \u2013 the work of a singular, premeditated career complete. \u201cMission accomplie,\u201d Hannan quipped to me, on two separate occasions. \u201cAs we like to say in Brussels.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e3623ac582e6143c798af55787e54198e6e3c5/0_94_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Cerles/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Once Britain became part of the European<strong> </strong>Economic Community, the idea of leaving it went away. A few old-stagers from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/05/referendum-eec-europe-1975\">1975 referendum on membership</a> fought on \u2013 isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods \u2013 but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1988/sep/21/emu.theeuro\">Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate</a> on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. \u201cWe have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,\u201d she said. The \u201cBruges speech\u201d established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against.</p> <p>Hannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen\u2019s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street.</p> <p>\u201cI remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,\u201d he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest.</p> <p>The CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. \u201cThere were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,\u201d she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. \u201cHe was clearly the leader,\u201d said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. \u201cI mean this in the fondest possible way,\u201d said Littlewood, \u201cyou could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a129928c4c38ecdfc4af8363d09d8e5c665c5d/0_353_2731_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher deliver her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 19xx.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher delivers her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 1988 in which she warned against a European superstate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan\u2019s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate.</p> <p>Hannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight.<strong> </strong>Britain in 1979 was a revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in Peru spoke like that.\u201d Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan\u2019s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher,<strong> </strong>first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. \u201cThe expat mentality is belonging to the old country,\u201d Scruton told me, \u201cand the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.\u201d</p> <p>At Oxford, Hannan\u2019s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan\u2019s speeches \u2013 as his writings are now \u2013 were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King\u2019s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world\u2019s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. \u201cA Hannan soundbite does stick with you,\u201d said Littlewood. \u201cHe does make you think.\u201d</p> <p>The Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary.</p> <p>In Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson\u2019s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\">European Foundation</a>. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. \u201cDon\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,\u201d said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. \u201cThis was a radicalised streak of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>The job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. \u201cFor us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,\u201d Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. \u201cHe was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,\u201d Gove told me. \u201cSome people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.\u201d Hannan was 24 years old.</p> <p>For all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum.</p> <p>Largely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave\u2019s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees \u2013 led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. \u201cBusiness for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,\u201d Theresa Villiers told me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/72_0_3474_4342/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/accuracy-is-for-snake-oil-pussies-vote-leaves-campaign-director-defies-mps\">Dominic Cummings</a>. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. \u201cThis was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.\u201d</p> <p>Business for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. \u201cWe did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,\u201d said Hannan.</p> <p>Eighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling\u2019s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. \u201cIt is funny,\u201d she told me. \u201cAlmost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life\u2019s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Business for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols \u2013 the Queen\u2019s head on a fiver \u2013 that touched the nerves of millions of people.<strong> </strong>Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn\u2019t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of \u201creform\u201d; \u201cfundamental reform\u201d if they were feeling brave. \u201cWhatever weasel words,\u201d Reckless told me. \u201cDan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan\u2019s age \u2013 he was now 26 \u2013 and his polished,<strong> </strong>bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. \u201cI was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to come out if we can\u2019t,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Conservative party activists loved it, but Hannan\u2019s bold language alarmed party headquarters. <strong>\u201c</strong>I was told that he was a fanatic,\u201d said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan\u2019s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams.

A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and \u201cthe more naughty stuff\u201d of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan\u2019s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim,<strong> </strong>but he did not relent. \u201cI was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,\u201d he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan\u2019s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. \u201cThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,\u201d Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White, an MEP from Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular, told me. \u201cThere is something in his life that probably affected him.\u201d</p> <p>From day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People\u2019s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron \u2013 then a leadership contender \u2013 that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.)</p> <p>Concentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. \u201cOur goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,\u201d Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. \u201cIt should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.\u201d But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards \u2013 even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. \u201cThe view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,\u201d said Gove. \u201cWhatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.\u201d</p> <p>One new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.\u2019\u201d Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to \u201centryists\u201d and \u201cTrots\u201d for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain\u2019s lost place in the world. \u201cThey are grammar-school imperialists,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cA hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan says such insults have never bothered him. \u201cIt passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,\u201d he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. \u201cI think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.\u201d Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America\u2019s \u201cEuropean\u201d drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom &amp; Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta.</p> <p>Operating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George\u2019s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as \u201ctuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring\u201d. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the \u201csupreme exemplar of that in his generation\u201d.</p> <p>For years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/04/conservatives.speeches\">William Hague\u2019s so-called \u201cforeign land\u201d speech </a>in 2001. The speech\u2019s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party\u2019s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: \u201cThere is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don\u2019t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it all by stealth,\u201d he thought, \u201cand they will get to where they want to go.\u201d<strong> </strong>Cameron\u2019s new-look party was determined \u201cto stop banging on about Europe\u201d and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories.</p> <p>In November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron\u2019s office to resign from his duties in Brussels \u2013 he was the party\u2019s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. \u201cI said \u2026 I just think you\u2019ve made the most terrible mistake,\u201d Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. \u201cI\u2019m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,\u201d Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5f2d8db8bf0e04c7ca8ce5f2ac657283e5888d/0_0_3228_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009.

He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: \u201cWho will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?\u201d He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People\u2019s Pledge.</p> <p>Like other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People\u2019s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party \u2013 it had mainly Labour staffers \u2013 and didn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People\u2019s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors.</p> <p>Europe was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. \u201cOh God, so annoying,\u201d is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. \u201cConstantly demanding to see the prime minister.\u201d Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People\u2019s Pledge, and Hannan\u2019s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. \u201cMore and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.\u201d</p> <p>With the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People\u2019s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg\u2019s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think offering the referendum was a good idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/brexit-how-a-fringe-idea-took-hold-tory-party\">Brexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach \u2013 the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum \u2013 on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron\u2019s ability to reform the EU.</p> <p>\u201cDan was basically, \u2018He is not going to do it. Don\u2019t believe him,\u201d Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning \u201cno\u201d side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system \u2013 an impressive-sounding \u00a3250m \u2013 and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,\u201d Hannan said.<strong> </strong>But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, \u201cNo to A/V\u201d won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than \u00a3650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in \u00a320,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around \u00a3220m. \u201cCrispin,\u201d as a friend told me, \u201chas the common touch of a Medici.\u201d)</p> <p>The new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. \u201cWe needed each other,\u201d he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a28eb54e4ebe706d764066461832ed76d88f3f30/0_133_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless \u2013 Hannan\u2019s closest friends in politics \u2013 celebrate Reckless\u2019s byelection win for Ukip in 2014.

Dan in a sense provided us with that message.\u201d Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, while the deliberately crude figure of \u00a3350m per week, to describe Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott\u2019s successful A/V strategy.</p> <p>Hannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip \u2013 one month apart \u2013 in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage\u2019s dominance of the party.<strong> </strong>A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. \u201cI spoke to Boris and made my pitch,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.\u201d (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At least three of Gove\u2019s memorable soundbites \u2013 including people being \u2018fed up with experts\u2019 \u2013 were thought up by Hannan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan\u2019s work was more or less done. \u201cTwenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,\u201d said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave\u2019s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. \u201cDan would often express views that I had myself,\u201d said Gove, \u201cwhich he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.\u201d At least three of Gove\u2019s more memorable soundbites \u2013 about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists \u2013 were Hannan lines.<strong> </strong>Villiers borrowed freely from her friend\u2019s speeches. From needling and courting one or two \u201couters\u201d in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit.</p> <p>He took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. \u201cDominic is very puritan about these things,\u201d said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V \u2013 \u201cWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d \u2013 substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn\u2019t go to bed until midnight the following day.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the Monday after the vote, at around six o\u2019clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. \u201cThe story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. \u201cYou guys have been shouting \u2018racist\u2019 for so long,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t listening to what we were actually saying.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivOOM0PbNps\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ivOOM0PbNps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Christiane Amanpour interviews Daniel Hannan</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. \u201cHe was very uncomfortable and very angry,\u201d Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/for-the-first-time-in-my-life-i-feel-ashamed-to-be-british/\">\u201cHe has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,\u201d Parris wrote.</a> \u201cI find him a bit scary,\u201d he said, when we spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.\u201d</p> <p>Hannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. \u201cCan you see how patronising that is?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, remainers are saying basically, \u2018These thicko, working-class bigots weren\u2019t listening to you. And let me now tell you \u2013 having ignored them \u2013 let me tell you what they really think.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the \u201coffshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrep\u00f4t\u201d that he longs us to be. Hannan\u2019s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market.<strong> </strong>He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/how-remain-failed-inside-story-doomed-campaign\">How remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan\u2019s gift. \u201cEven if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,\u201d said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan\u2019s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. \u201cI think we are in the calm before the storm,\u201d she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn\u2019t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. \u201cTalking to people who voted leave \u2026 \u2018back\u2019 was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, \u2018I want to take our country back.\u2019 Back to what?\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent \u201ca personality change\u201d.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the have-nothings \u2026 They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren\u2019t the same as us, are detached from us.\u201d</p> <p>Like Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union \u2013 around trade and sovereignty and democracy \u2013 in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what most people are bothered about,\u201d he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don\u2019t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.\u201d Farage said he didn\u2019t hear much about Hannan\u2019s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. \u201cIt is another disconnect isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. \u201cIt was the independence issue,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the idea of self-government.\u201d I told him that \u2013 as a citizen of the same country \u2013 I still didn\u2019t really get it. I couldn\u2019t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. \u201cIt\u2019s a big philosophical difference,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBetween the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of \u2018trust the people\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be rude. \u201cWe are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.\u201d</p> <p>We were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan\u2019s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. \u201cIt is the great migration of our time,\u201d said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. \u201cHow many of them are on benefits?\u201d, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply.</p> <p>After lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn\u2019t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard.\u201d And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.\u201d Hannan paused. \u201cCheer up my friends.\u201d The lunchers laughed. Sunshine poured in. The cataclysm could not be felt. \u201cListen to the drone of the bees in lavender, and ask yourself where in the world would you rather be?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2016.

She was readmitted to the party after an investigation.</p> <p>Corbyn used the speech to stamp down his authority by offering no apology for his pro-immigration stance.</p> <p>Faced with criticism from Labour colleagues who believe he is offering the wrong response to the Brexit vote, he said: \u201cIt isn\u2019t migrants that drive down wages ...

  "<p>On Wednesday, something very unusual happened: the entire state of South Australia lost power. Known as a \u201csystem black,\u201d it\u2019s something the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) had only prepared for in theory \u2013 never having the unfortunate opportunity to put \u201cblack start\u201d procedures into place.</p> <h2>What caused the blackout?</h2> <p>The cause was very clear. And it was not due to renewable energy (see next section).</p> <p>One of the worst storms to hit South Australia in 50 years knocked out <a href=\"https://www.electranet.com.au/some-power-supply-restored-after-severe-weather-event-but-restoration-efforts-remain-ongoing/\">22 high-voltage power pylons</a>. The lines on those pylons carry electricity generated near Port Augusta to the rest of the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/28/south-australia-braces-for-storm-that-could-be-most-severe-in-50-years\">South Australia blackout: entire state left without power after storms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When they went down, a cascade of automatic safety switches appear to have been flipped, in order to protect the rest of the SA power network \u2013 and indeed the rest of the National Electricity Market.</p> <p>Besides creating power, generators also affect the voltage and the frequency of the electricity network, which need to be carefully maintained to protect everything that\u2019s connected to it.</p> <p>Aemo carefully models how that is likely to change in the short, medium and long-term, so that the networks can then make sure it\u2019s sitting at the right values.</p> <p>When the 22 high-voltage power pylons were blown over, a huge chunk of power generation was cut off from the rest of the network.</p> <p>Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute says the market operator can\u2019t prepare for very rare events like this.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re black swan events,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they did plan for this, then there still might be something else that could happen, like an earthquake. A system capable of dealing with this would be very expensive.\u201d</p> <p>To protect generators and equipment in SA, the whole high-voltage power system was cut, which in turn removed supply from the local distribution networks.</p> <p>In addition, to stop the voltage and frequency fluctuations affecting Victoria, the lines connecting SA to Victoria (the \u201cinterconnectors\u201d) were also shut down.</p> <p>The result was that at about 4.20pm, the entire state of South Australia lost power.</p> <h2>What did wind power have to do with it?</h2> <p>Nothing. Nick Xenophon, Barnaby Joyce and others have been out blaming wind power for the blackout. But it is simply not true.</p> <p>Just before the blackout occurred, windfarms were producing about half the state\u2019s electricity demand \u2013 they were not shut down as a result of the high winds. And ElectraNet, the owner of the downed high-voltage lines, made clear the blackout <a href=\"https://www.electranet.com.au/power-to-adelaide-cbd-restored-after-severe-weather-event-but-restoration-efforts-remain-ongoing/\">was caused</a> by the storm damage to their network.</p> <p>If the recently closed Port Augusta coal power station was still operating, it would have been cut off by the downed distribution lines too. And that would have likely made the disruption worse, since it would have created an even bigger sudden change to the network.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t stop politicians and most media outlets reporting the false information.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said on Sydney radio station 2GB this morning: \u201cObviously we know that South Australia has had a strong desire to become basically all renewable energy and the question has to be asked does this make them more vulnerable to an issue such as what happened last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you turn power into just a complete social policy and say well we are going to save the planet one state at a time and in so doing you create vulnerability to your state, so that if it comes under stress with a severe lightning storm, as they did, that this makes it more likely that you will have a total blackout,\u201d Joyce said.</p> <p>South Australian senator Nick Xenophon, who has often expressed anti-wind sentiments, also jumped on the bandwagon. \u201cWe have relied too much on wind rather than baseload renewables, rather than baseload power, including gas which is a fossil fuel but it is 50% cleaner than coal and a good transitional fuel,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The irony is that if anything, more wind energy might have actually made the system more robust against this sort of rare event. The disruption occurred because of a sudden change to the network\u2019s generation. And that happened because so much power was cut off at once. If there was more generation distributed around the state, it might have limited the impact of the loss of the transmission lines. </p> <h2>How did the system cope with the outage?</h2> <p>Remarkably well, it seems.</p> <p>While smaller blackouts occur reasonably frequently around the country, this appears to be the first time that any state has experienced a complete blackout.</p> <p>Since the National Electricity Market was first established, it\u2019s had procedures for how to turn a system on from a complete \u201csystem black\u201d but it has never done it before.</p> <p>That plan was put into action quickly and as of 11:42am this morning, about 80,000 South Australians were still without power. Aemo and the network operators were moving to progressively and safely restore power everywhere. Below is a map of which areas were experiencing blackouts at 11am.</p> <p>McConnell says doing that is no simple matter, and the fact Aemo started to get power generation back into the network within hours was a great feat.</p> <h2>Map: number of people affected by power outages in SA</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/sep/outages/map\" data-alt=\"Map: Number of people affected by Power Outages in SA\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/sep/outages/map\">Map: Number of people affected by Power Outages in SA</a> <figcaption>People affected by power outages as at 11am Thursday, according to <a href=\"http://sapowernetworks.com.au/\">SA Power Networks</a></figcaption> </figure>",

It works when wind is [at] its mildest.

Many photos show young children covered in lesions and blisters. Some were unable to breathe and [were] vomiting blood. </p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to exaggerate just how cruel the effects of these chemicals are when they come into contact with the human body. Chemical weapons have been banned for decades in recognition of the fact that the level of suffering they cause can never be justified. That Sudan\u2019s government is now repeatedly using them against their own people simply cannot be ignored and demands action.\u201d</p> <p>The report alleged that hundreds of survivors suffered symptoms including severe gastrointestinal conditions, bloody vomiting and diarrhoea, blistering and rashes on skin that was later lost, eye problems \u2013 including a complete loss of vision \u2013 and respiratory problems, reportedly the most common cause of death.<br></p> <p>A woman in her twenties, injured by shrapnel when a bomb that emitted a toxic cloud of smoke fell on her village, said she and her baby became sick and are still suffering six months later.</p> <p>\u201cWhen [the bomb] landed there were some flames and then dark smoke,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately it caused vomiting and dizzying \u2026 My skin is not normal.

He told Amnesty he had been helping to care for victims of the conflict in Jebel Marra since it began in 2003, and had never seen such ailments before.

The then minister for the environment Greg Hunt said at the time:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The debate this week has been an attempt by some to misuse tragedy and suffering and hardship and nobody should do that. </p> </blockquote> <p>The new minister for the environment, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/renewable-targets-'bring-challenges'-to-stability/7887280\">Josh Frydenberg, admitted</a> that the blackout was entirely due to the weather event.

Change in how we produce electricity is coming and an anti-renewables campaign will only slow it and make the transition more difficult.</p> <p>Rather than attack renewables, the government should be putting in place policies that help with the transition. The economics of renewable energy and the reality of climate change mean that it is inevitable that we will leave fossil fuel electricity generation behind. The question is how can we move to the new energy future in the smoothest way possible?</p> <p>Renewable energy targets, system changes that make it easier to install battery storage, and a moratorium on new coal mines will all help.</p> <p>Attacking renewables in the wake of a massive storm might help some people\u2019s political agenda but it will do nothing to help South Australians build a reliable and resilient energy system.</p> <p><em>Matt Grudnoff is the Senior Economist for The Australia Institute.</em><strong><br></strong></p>",
