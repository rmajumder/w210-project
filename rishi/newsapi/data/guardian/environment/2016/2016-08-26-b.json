They don\u2019t necessarily matter to everyone but they have undoubtedly played a part.</p> <p>Ken Parish, a law lecturer and former Labor MLA, said the chaos of the CLP\u2019s term was probably not much greater than that during the Rudd and Gillard Labor years, and voters were just equally sick of it.</p> <p>\u201cMy perception is that the big issues for Territorians are the chaos, dysfunction, disunity, the revolving door, members leaving and getting down to a minority, the successful leadership coup, followed by the unsuccessful coup because Giles refused to go, and then a succession of tawdry misdeeds by assorted people culminating in Mr Barrett, and \u2026 the privatisations were a big thing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Privatisation</strong></h2> <p>The 99-year lease of the Darwin port made national headlines and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/19/malcolm-turnbull-shrugs-off-us-concern-over-darwin-port-lease-to-chinese-firm\"> put the wind up the White House,</a> but closer to home people are much more upset about the CLP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/northern-territory-election-adam-giles-admits-failures-over-insurance-privatisation\">sale of the Territory Insurance Office</a>. </p> <p>The sale of the last state-owned insurance company caused huge distress among Territorians needing affordable insurance against natural disasters in a small and uncompetitive market. </p> <p>Parish said the port, TIO, and the Darwin bus service privatisation were all things the government \u201chad really little or no mandate for, hadn\u2019t really consulted about, and people didn\u2019t consent to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey might well have been sensible economic decisions, but people I think certainly felt and still feel like the CLP were high-handed and didn\u2019t take notice of what people wanted.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/27/northern-territory-detention-inquiry-must-address-racism-say-indigenous-advocates\">Northern Territory detention inquiry must address racism, say Indigenous advocates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Giles concedes they did not bring the people along with them in making the decision, and has pledged \u2013 several times over the last two years \u2013 to become more consultative. On Thursday he said he would resign if a CLP government sold the Power and Water company.</p> <h2><strong>The economy</strong></h2> <p>The Northern Territory is facing tough times with shrinking GST returns, a falling housing market, predicted unemployment rises, and the winding down of the major Inpex resource project.</p> <p>The CLP campaign has largely centred on the Territory\u2019s financials, spruiking the government\u2019s reduction of \u201cLabor debt\u201d, and its plans for jobs, almost a third of which they said would come from an expanded onshore gas industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there are heavy economic challenges coming,\u201d Giles said on Friday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe spent the last four years getting the budget back on track, paying back debt and getting an economic plan to go ahead. And we have tabled our plan for 24,000 new jobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLabor has not tabled any plan on bringing any investment dollars to the Territory. They have not brought forward a plan to grow private sector jobs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way that the Territory won\u2019t go into recession under Labor.\u201d</p> <p>Labor has promised a surplus by 2019-20, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/labor-win-in-northern-territory-would-mean-delay-or-cuts-of-223m-in-projects\">provided it can find enough savings to cover the extra $223.5m needed</a> to cover their election commitments, pledging to \u201cmake the tough decisions\u201d on funding projects instead of going over budget.</p> <p>It plans to consolidate public service departments, axing 26 executive roles to save $9m annually in salaries, and redeploying another 80 positions.</p> <p>It has also labeled the CLP jobs promise \u201cmisleading\u201d and containing exaggerations of the gas industry\u2019s projected jobs figures.</p> <h2><strong>Personality</strong></h2> <p>This is unavoidable. During the campaign Giles has repeatedly said the public is sick of \u201cpersonality politics\u201d, but has it ended?<br></p> <p>Giles has been implicated in many of the CLP scandals, but his inconsistent messaging has also tired voters. It was near impossible to keep track of his position following the Don Dale footage, and he has backtracked on a number of statements, sometimes within days. On Thursday he told the people\u2019s forum he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/25/adam-giles-says-he-wont-support-sexuality-element-of-safe-schools-program\">would not introduce the Safe Schools program</a> to prevent bullying of LGBTQI kids, a week after he told a social services debate that he would.<br></p> <p>The well-documented individual clashes dominated the narrative of parliamentary sittings and were behind more than one resignation from the CLP. </p> <p>Two of the CLP\u2019s most controversial figures, David Tollner and John Elferink, are leaving politics at this election. </p> <p>The CLP instability began just seven months into the term, when Giles rolled chief minister Terry Mills, in a move ABC election analyst Anthony Green described as \u201creminiscent of politics in newly emerging African nations in the 1960s\u201d.<br></p> <p>Mills returned as an independent just a few weeks ago, vowing it had nothing to with revenge.</p> <p>Delia Lawrie, the former Labor leader who was replaced by Gunner after she lost credibility over a union scandal, is also running as an independent, as is ex-CLP member and parliamentary speaker Kezia Purick, and former CLP minister Robyn Lambley.</p> <p>Indigenous activist and artist Jack Green is running on an anti-fracking platform for the seat encompassing his home town of Borroloola, but faces tough competition.</p> <p>Trevor Jenkins, rubbish warrior, is having another tilt.</p> <p>Alison Anderson, former Atsic commissioner, former member of Labor, the CLP, Palmer United, and current independent, announced she would not contest the election and was then pictured in a Labor T-shirt helping with the campaign.</p> <p>And who knows what <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/5v2f4?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Larisa Lee</a> will do if she retains her seat.</p> <p>The ballot paper holds a record number of candidates, including a significant proportion of independents, but as is evident many of them are people who abandoned one of the majors. 1Territory, founded by two former CLP presidents, touts itself as an alternative conservative party but with policies such as legalising marijuana.</p> <h2><strong>Indigenous affairs</strong></h2> <p>The 2012 election was won on the \u201cbush vote\u201d, but how the Northern Territory\u2019s Indigenous population has or will vote this time is unknown. The small electoral population and low enrolment mean seats could be swung on a strong family or community network, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/19/political-leaders-urged-to-reform-ways-of-dealing-with-northern-territory-youth-offenders\">issues such as juvenile justice, housing and jobs hit particularly hard in remote communities</a>. </p> <p>The CLP got rid of the Indigenous affairs portfolio when it took office, and then reintroduced it last year. It introduced a number of programs including \u201ccommunity champions\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/03/crocodile-eggs-and-3d-printing-could-these-be-champions-of-the-top-ends-indigenous-communities\">mentor small business ventures in remote communities</a>. Both parties have made promises on remote housing and employment programs. </p> <p>Labor accused the CLP of an \u201coutrageous, cynical betrayal\u201d when it released costings showing far less than their promised $1.6bn for remote housing, after most remote-living Territorians had already voted.</p> <h2><strong>The environment</strong> </h2> <p>It\u2019s the nature of the Territory that environmental and economic concerns often overlap and sometimes compete. The cattle industry is a lifeblood industry, but then<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/23/timing-of-nt-governments-secret-deal-with-tri-star-coal-company-queried\"> so is the resources sector</a> and tourism. </p> <p>The environmental defenders office (EDO) NT scored the available written policies of four parties \u2013 the CLP, Labor, the Greens, and 1Territory. The CLP failed, scoring just 12.5/36, with a noted lack of transparency, climate change policy, and commitment to enforce planning law breaches. </p> <p>Labor and the Greens policies scored 31 and 25 respectively, and 1Territory was given 22.</p> <p>The CLP faced criticism in the last week of the campaign over a perceived lack of action over an oil spill in Darwin harbour, but Giles said it was his party to establish the \u201cpoliceman-like\u201d Environmental Protection Agency, a move the EDO called a step forward.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/19/tiwi-islands-port-project-needs-no-environmental-risk-assessment-epa\">embarrassment of Port Melville on the Tiwi Islands</a>, which was built without environmental assessment, both major parties have pledged to close the legislative loopholes which allowed it to happen.</p> <p>They part ways significantly when it comes to fracking. Labor has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/fracking-northern-territory-referendum-labor-delia-lawrie\">promised a moratorium</a>, followed by either a ban or a highly regulated industry to be decided in its first term. The CLP has pegged a third of its jobs plan to onshore gas.</p> <h2><strong>Law and order, alcohol, and Don Dale </strong></h2> <p>Is Don Dale a factor?</p> <p>Yes and no. The entire country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/northern-territory-youth-detention-no-excuse-for-not-knowing-of-abuse\">shocked by the footage broadcast on Four Corners</a>, but Territorians have also been dealing with high rates of property and violent crime, particularly by young offenders. It has meant that the CLP\u2019s continued push for a \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach, once they had made appropriate noises about the royal commission, played relatively well. So did some of the attacks launched against Four Corners.</p> <p>Parish said the report horrified people but it was more a \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d for the CLP, further highlighting \u201cdisunity and incompetence\u201d.</p> <p>The cost of the commission is an unknown for the next government, with a possible $32m payable by the NT. Gunner referred to it a \u201clegacy issue\u201d because it wasn\u2019t sorted out before caretaker period stepped in.</p> <p>The royal commission is also looking into child protection, a fraught issue in the NT with an overworked and frequently criticised Department of Families and Children struggling to deal with the rates of children at risk. The ALP, CLP and Greens were all given a tick by the NT council of social services for policies to outsource out of home care services and to establish an Aboriginal-controlled service.</p> <p>As part of its \u201ctough on crime\u201d measures the CLP government will introduce a bill to remove the presumption of bail for repeat offenders, and Labor has pledged to focus on early intervention and rehabilitation. </p> <p>The two parties are split on alcohol policy, another highly contentious and divisive NT issue. Labor has pledged to bring back its Banned Drinkers Register in concert with a suite of complementary measures, and to end mandatory alcohol treatment. The CLP says its temporary beat locations policy is working, but critics say it\u2019s too resource-heavy on police, and impossible to implement in places such as Darwin with multiple bottleshops.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/22/northern-territory-political-parties-called-upon-to-address-justice-crisis-\">Making Justice Work campaign</a> said Labor and two independents, including Lawrie, were most aligned with their vision for reform.</p>",

  "<p>For Victor Wanyama, it was a statement of respect and ambition. When the Kenya midfielder joined Celtic in 2011, he asked to be given the No67 shirt. It was a move that acknowledged the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/23/hapoel-beer-sheva-celtic-champions-league-qualifier-match-report\">European Cup</a>-winning team of 1967, the fabled Lisbon Lions and, also, one that advertised his dream to emulate them.</p> <p>By any reckoning, it was a bold decision from an unheralded player who had arrived from Germinal Beerschot in Belgium for \u00a3900,000. Wanyama was 20 at the time. Was he setting himself up for a fall? \u201cI am somebody who is not afraid to try because I believe that failing is just when you are not willing to fight,\u201d he says. \u201cI was ready to fight. That\u2019s why I was not scared to take the shirt.\u201d</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/23/tottenham-complete-signing-victor-wanyama-southampton\">\u00a311m summer signing from Southampton</a> speaks in soft tones as he outlines his hopes for the future which, once again, involve the Champions League. But there is a conviction to his words, and it only reinforces the physical aura of a man Mauricio Pochettino described last week as \u201can animal\u201d and \u201ca beast\u201d.</p> <p>Wanyama thrived at Celtic and one of his best performances came in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/07/celtic-barcelona-champions-league-report\">2-1 Champions League group stage win</a> at home to Barcelona in November 2012. He headed the opening goal and he remembers Rod Stewart, the singer and lifelong Celtic fan, blubbing uncontrollably in the stands. Wanyama won the league title in each of his two seasons at Celtic and after three positive years at Southampton \u2013 the first under Pochettino \u2013 he intends to kick on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/mauricio-pochettino-unimpressed-by-erik-lamela-showboating-against-palace\">Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino takes dim view of Lamela\u2019s showboating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The connection to Pochettino was one of the attractions of the move to Spurs and it says much for Wanyama\u2019s work ethic that he was prepared to sign up for another dose of the Argentinian\u2019s punishing pre-season training regimes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you go through it but, afterwards, you can feel how important it is because when you go into games, you are so much fitter and you do more,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cYou can see that it pays off. I know the manager from before; he signed me at Southampton [for \u00a312.5m]. He always focuses on the small details and that\u2019s what improves players.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama talks a good deal about improvement, in a personal and collective sense, and his primary target for the season is to improve upon what Tottenham achieved last time out, which will not be straightforward but, according to him, is possible. He has started brightly and it was his goal that secured the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/20/tottenham-hotspur-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">1-0 home win over Crystal Palace</a> last Saturday. Then, there is the Champions League. Thursday\u2019s group-phase draw has made it feel real and there was excitement and optimism when the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/25/champions-league-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-barcelona-leicester-city\">pulled CSKA Moscow, Bayer Leverkusen and Monaco</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ec65872c205d1d56f21c2f71c1beda13ff3f886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec65872c205d1d56f21c2f71c1beda13ff3f886/0_18_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Wanyama rises above Jordi Alba of Barcelona to score for Celtic in the Champions League in November 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Wanyama rises above Jordi Alba of Barcelona to score for Celtic in the Champions League in November 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wanyama is ready to fight. He always has been, since his formative days in Muthurwa, a neighbourhood in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which is the sort of place, Wanyama says, that stays with people. It was rough and, as a child, he saw terrible things.</p> <p>\u201cYou would be walking along or playing football and you would see thieves snatching things or someone taking a knife out to stab the other one because something had happened \u2013 he took his money, maybe. For a young kid, seeing what I saw was a bit of a torture, I would even say.\u201d</p> <p>Football was his salvation; his pathway to a \u201cbetter life\u201d. Wanyama dedicated himself to the game. At the age of 11, he played for a local team called Country Bus and, together with his team-mates, he would walk for miles in his bare feet to get to away fixtures. He cites the club\u2019s coach \u2013 a man known as Amigo, who has since died \u2013 as an inspiration.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes, we would walk really far, like, say, the distance between Tottenham\u2019s training ground in Enfield and White Hart Lane [seven miles],\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d have to walk back. It was a hell of a journey but, sometimes, it was fun, because you were in a big group and we were young. We would play against teams who might bring older boys but we were not scared.</p> <p>\u201cI was distracted by football, it was important for me because it passed my time and made sure that I did not get involved in other things. Amigo was really committed to helping the youth and he loved to train us, although we were playing with balls that were hand-made out of paper and elastic bands.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama played barefoot and when he won his first pair of boots at an under-12 tournament, he found them so uncomfortable that he had to take them off. \u201cThe pitches were not great and you\u2019d hit your toe and there would be blood everywhere,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut you just continued. They were the surfaces we had at the time and it was fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217432598b4ce16203347c13db67032cf8dc29ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/217432598b4ce16203347c13db67032cf8dc29ec/0_79_3756_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Wanyama celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game against Crystal Palace last weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Wanyama celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game against Crystal Palace last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wanyama\u2019s parents worked for Kenya Railways and he describes his family as \u201cneither rich nor poor\u201d. He adds: \u201cWhere we lived was OK. My parents provided what they could but they could not buy football shoes for me. There was not any day where they wanted to see me go to sleep without eating. So I was getting food.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama is not the only famous footballer in his family. His father, Noah, played for the AFC Leopards and won caps for Kenya while his older brother is McDonald Mariga, who has played for Parma and Internazionale, among others, and is now at Latina in Serie B.</p> <p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s full name is McDonald Mariga Wanyama and I\u2019m Victor Mugubi Wanyama,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cIn Kenya, the family name comes last and I like to use my family name on my jersey. McDonald has always had Mariga on his shirt. It\u2019s just a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Mariga has a Champions League winners\u2019 medal from his time at Inter \u2013 he was an unused substitute for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team in the 2010 final against Bayern Munich although he featured off the bench in the earlier knockout rounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-inter-live\">including the semi-final</a>, second leg at Barcelona.</p> <p>He was the family\u2019s trailblazer in Europe and when he was at Helsingborg in 2006-07, he persuaded the Swedish club to admit his brother to their academy. Wanyama was 14 when he arrived and having coped with the culture shock, he enjoyed an invaluable experience.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really strange, at first, because I didn\u2019t understand any Swedish but I enjoy languages and after three or four months, I was getting there with it,\u201d Wanyama says. \u201cHow is my Swedish now? Really bad. My Flemish is better, because I was at Germinal Beerschot for three years.</p> <p>\u201cHelsingborg really helped me. If I had stayed in Kenya, I wouldn\u2019t have got that experience of knowing how to be a pro. They didn\u2019t have the facilities in Kenya that I had in Sweden. I was really lucky to go there. I stayed with my brother and when he left for Parma in 2007, I went back to Kenya. I joined one of the academies called JMJ and after that I went to Belgium.\u201d</p> <p>Wanyama\u2019s interest in British football took hold at an early age. He would go to the cinema in Muthurwa to watch the big derbies, Glasgow, Manchester and north London, and his favourite players were Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Robbie Keane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"176aee300de684af2b919cc5e031db1b6ca24c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/176aee300de684af2b919cc5e031db1b6ca24c49/0_119_4523_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spurs will be playing their Champions League home matches at Wembley this season, and the club is committed to engaging with the local community in Brent.

He pushed for the transfer to happen in the summer of 2015, only for Southampton to block it. There was frustration, a measure of ugliness. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough when somebody wants you and the other club makes it difficult,\u201d Wanyama says.

In a context&#xa0;where France is still officially in a state of emergency following the recent terror attacks in the country, this is significant.</p> <p>It took France a long time to find the right balance between respecting the Catholic traditions of many of its people and implementing its 1905 law of separation of church and state. In recent decades, what has been unfolding \u2013 and has now taken on an increasingly hysterical dimension \u2013 is a new quest for a democratic notion of inclusiveness within French society for Muslims, especially French-born youngsters who feel disenfranchised. None of this has been made easier by the fact that France still has to come to terms with its colonial past, and that terrorism has made toxic passions swirl.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat gave no credence to claims that the burkini ban was necessary to uphold France\u2019s brand of secularism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1909, the Conseil d\u2019Etat had to rule on an issue not altogether different from today\u2019s burkini question. The city of Sens had at the time outlawed religious processions and even the wearing of cassocks on its streets. Anti-clerical sentiment was so high that the very public appearance of religious clothing was itself deemed disruptive.</p> <p>But the judges struck down the ban with arguments that strikingly echo today\u2019s ruling. And they included a reminder that the 1905 law was about freedom of conscience just as much as it was about ensuring the \u201cneutrality\u201d of the republic in all things religious (the latter point being, by the way, the reason&#xa0;for the 2004 veil ban in French&#xa0;state schools). Article 1 of the 1905 law guarantees the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of any faith, for which \u201crestrictions\u201d can&#xa0;only be made \u201cin the interest of public order\u201d.</p> <p>French politics today has been upended by the public order question: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\" title=\"\">Nicolas Sarkozy called this week</a> for the banning of all religious clothing in public areas \u2013 a message intended to court far-right and anti-Muslim voters ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xd6t\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2686545\"            data-video-name=\"Nicolas Sarkozy demands burkini ban across France \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57c031efe4b0fe30498a4fab\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/26/160826SarkozyBurkini1_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/aug/26/nicolas-sarkozy-ban-burkini-france-presidential-election-video\">Nicolas Sarkozy demands burkini ban across France \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Claims that the burkini is a threat to \u201chygiene\u201d or \u201cgood manners\u201d have been exposed as completely groundless, but it has been trickier to sweep aside claims that, in France\u2019s tense atmosphere, the burkini might set off scuffles or other violent incidents on French beaches. Many people reading this will&#xa0;immediately jump: applied to beaches in Britain, does that mean a Sikh wearing a turban, or any other person carrying \u201cconspicuous\u201d religious&#xa0;clothing, would represent some sort of risk?</p> <p>However, it is possible that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/nice-becomes-latest-french-city-to-impose-burkini-ban\" title=\"\">mayor of Nice</a> \u2013 a city still traumatised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/15/nice-terror-attack-truck\" title=\"\">July\u2019s terror attack</a>, and where there have been signs of inter-ethnic tensions \u2013 may have had reasonable concerns that racist&#xa0;people might want to attack a woman wearing the burkini. Of course, the first thing to say about this is that upholding public order should be the responsibility of the police \u2013 not of women, who must be free to choose their clothes.</p> <p>But the reason the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, recently shifted from talking about the \u201censlavement\u201d of women (as a way of explaining his support for the ban) to mentioning \u201cpublic order\u201d is that this offered a potentially more solid basis for his views \u2013 which this week led to a show of divisions within the government. Now the highest court has clearly ruled that neither \u201cpublic order\u201d nor \u201cemotions linked to terrorist acts\u201d can be invoked to legitimise the ban.</p> <p>President Hollande has carefully stayed away from the arguments, no doubt waiting for the ruling. But that does little to hide the fact that France\u2019s&#xa0;second socialist president under the Fifth Republic has failed to genuinely reach out to Muslims, especially the young, to reassure them&#xa0;that they will be considered equal&#xa0;citizens, and need not feel overlooked. Again, there is historical precedent: in the 1980s, when the Front&#xa0;National first reared its head, Hollande\u2019s predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/mitterrand-study-ambiguity-philip-short-review\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand</a>, also missed an opportunity to convey that sense of inclusiveness, despite many slogans heard at the time (such as <em>touche pas \u00e0 mon pote</em>, for those who remember).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/france-burkini-ban-secularist-equality-muslim\">France\u2019s burkini ban exposes the hypocrisy of its secularist state | Iman Amrani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The roots of France\u2019s republican model go back to the battle between church and state, and also to its colonial past.

It will hopefully restore common decency and the rule of law, and emphasise that the burkini does not in itself threaten public order. If that had been the case, then France\u2019s state of emergency would have meant that, officially, citizens of different backgrounds or faiths could no longer safely sit on a beach together. The ruling isn\u2019t the solution to all the issues that have to be dealt with \u2013 that\u2019s some way off. But hopefully it will give a troubled nation some breathing space.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone knows in theory that earthquakes wreak appalling human and neighbourhood damage, wherever they occur. Yet those of us fortunate enough to live in a part of the world not generally threatened by them can become complacent. Humanity is indivisible, yet it can sometimes take an event close to home, even in the global media world, to lay bare the fear, loss and trauma of an unexpected catastrophe, after which nothing can be quite the same for a generation of survivors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/central-italy-earthquake\">The Italian earthquake</a> is such an event. Not only was it geographically near to Britain. It also took place in a place familiar to many British summer visitors to the Apennines. The suddenness of Wednesday\u2019s earthquake, and the scale of nighttime destruction and death in Amatrice and the surrounding area will be eclipsed by much worse events in other parts of the world. But this is not a competition. The deaths of at least 267 people, the collapse of so many beautiful buildings and the long painful aftermath which now begins cut to the heart with an unusual directness.</p> <p>Britain may have suffered few earthquakes, but it is not immune to unexpected death and destruction. The deaths along the coasts in recent days have been a reminder of that. Next week also marks the 350th anniversary of the start of the <a href=\"http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Great-Fire-of-London/\">Great Fire of London</a>. The fire of 1666 is such a famous event in British history and sits so snugly within the traditional narrative of the island story that it can require an imaginative leap to comprehend quite how shocking and disastrous it really was, especially in its impact on what was then a small country with only one really large city.</p> <p>Yet the bare statistics of the Great Fire are terrible by any standard. Around 13,200 London houses were burned down between 2 and 5 September 1666. Some 80,000 people were made homeless. Eighty per cent of London within the medieval walls was destroyed, including 86 churches, headed by St Paul\u2019s cathedral. The silver lining, a large one, was that human casualties were low; perhaps fewer than a dozen deaths. No firefighter perished, and most people had time not just to evacuate their houses, but to remove many of their belongings too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk//museum-london/whats-on/exhibitions/fire-fire\">An anniversary exhibition</a> at the Museum of London helps bring the fire scarily alive. It also underlines that the impact of disasters endures for years. The traditional narrative about post-1666 focuses on Christopher Wren\u2019s magnificent buildings. It does not dwell so much on the thousands of homeless who lived in tents outside the city for months and years after the fire. Or on the fact that, though appeals were generously supported, the lord mayor of London stole a lot of the money for himself. Great disasters can bring out the best in human beings as well as the worst, now as then, wherever they occur.</p>",

In it, his two boyhood friends, <a href=\"http://spitalfieldslife.com/2011/05/30/colin-obrien-photographer/\">Raymond Scallionne and Razi Tuffano</a>, pose moodily, as instructed by him, against a parked car in Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, central London. Soon afterwards, his uncle, Will, a cab driver, gave him a basic contact printing set that allowed him to develop his photographs without using a darkroom. As a boy, O\u2019Brien shot with a Brownie box camera on the bustling, working-class streets of Clerkenwell, his neighbourhood, which was then called \u201cLittle Italy\u201d because of the Italian immigrants who had settled there and opened cafes and food stores.</p> <p>From the start, he seemed to understand instinctively that his area, with all its everyday human dramas, reflected the energy of the surrounding city. He photographed his father, Edward, at the breakfast table before a shift at nearby Mount Pleasant post office, and his mother, Edith (nee Kelly), a housewife, making tea and shopping for hats, as well as neighbours and children as they went about their daily lives. One of his black and white photographs of a London skyline at night dominated by factory chimneys was used on the cover of the first edition of Alfie (1966), a novel by his friend Bill Naughton from his earlier play, which was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060086/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk2\">also made into two films</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"721f7f41dcf6308e30e025c8bc83d66ca0399622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/721f7f41dcf6308e30e025c8bc83d66ca0399622/0_0_2736_3648/750.jpg\" alt=\"Colin O\u2019Brien on the balcony of the flat in Clerkenwell, which he moved into with his parents when it was built in 1966.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin O\u2019Brien on the balcony of the flat in Clerkenwell, which he moved into with his parents when it was built in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Gentle Author</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a teenager, O\u2019Brien was a resourceful and imaginative photographer, shooting an extended series of images from the family\u2019s top-floor flat in Clerkenwell, which he later called \u201cmy first window on the world\u201d. From there, he photographed people passing by on the street below as well as Roman Catholic religious processions and even the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/26/london-life-review-colin-obrien-photography\">car accidents</a>. His images show the streets in bright summer sun and covered in winter snow. He often shot late into the night, capturing lone stragglers making their way home past hoardings advertising Guinness and Batchelors Peas.</p> <p>Inevitably, his wanderings took him further afield to Soho and the West End, where he often photographed at night, using a 1931 Leica purchased by his parents from a chauffeur, who claimed to have found it in the back of his car. In the 60s he also hung around outside football grounds, intent on capturing the faces of supporters pouring into the terraces or perching on walls and railings rather than the drama on the pitch. His snatched portrait of West Ham and England star <a href=\"http://unitg.london/gallery/product/bobby-moore-at-fulham-football-club-1975/\">Bobby Moore</a> is memorable for the crowd of children that surrounds him, each intent on their autographs. It captures a moment when English football began to shed its working-class roots for the glamour and riches of today\u2019s global, corporate game.</p> <p>In 1987, O\u2019Brien spent time among a community of <a href=\"http://www.spitalfieldslife.bigcartel.com/product/travellers-children-in-london-fields-by-colin-o-brien/\">Travellers in London Fields</a>, creating a gritty series that was later published as a book to critical acclaim. \u201cThose kids were so free,\u201d he said later. \u201cThey were impoverished but not unhappy. I think they\u2019re tender shots and there\u2019s a real sense of togetherness in some.\u201d</p> <p>The London that O\u2019Brien captured in the 1950s and 60s already looks impossibly distant in its mix of street traders, factory workers and scruffy children in short trousers and hand-knitted jumpers. The old-fashioned family shops have now been replaced by chains and purveyors of artisan goods. In the retrospective of his work, <a href=\"http://spitalfieldslife.bigcartel.com/product/london-life-by-colin-o-brien-published-by-spitalfields-life-books-on-june-18th\">London Life</a>, the photographs taken in the 80s and 90s chronicle the beginning of the hyper-gentrification of the capital that has rendered swaths of O\u2019Brien\u2019s East End virtually unrecognisable.</p> <p>Born and raised in Clerkenwell, O\u2019Brien rarely moved further afield than Hackney, in east London, where he settled in the 80s.

  "<p>In supporting Jean Jackson\u2019s plea (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/22/fragile-habitats-but-sturdy-ikea-flatpacks\" title=\"\">Letters, 23 August</a>), I think that too-clever-by-half crossword compilers invent new rules to preserve their self-awarded intellectual power. Too many see themselves as Araucaria or Ximenes, assuming every challenge to be for prizes for which there must be a limited list of winners. We cruciverbalists face barely conceived neologisms; foreign practice; topical proper and trade names; web-speak; and irrelevant whole words representing unrelated single-letter abbreviations not recognised in any glossary.</p> <p>We are expected to discover hidden themes, without being told that a theme exists \u2013 such as, last week, the names of the 1966 England World Cup team. That was totally unfair, presenting 11 unsolvable clues. Compilers should copy the Observer\u2019s Azed and publish the logic of the more knotty clues with the solution \u2013 as not all compilers share the same devious mindset.<br><strong>Ralph Gee</strong><br><em>Nottingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thank goodness other readers are finding the current crop of cryptic crosswords impossible. I thought it was just me. Perhaps we should form a support group and call ourselves Araucaria\u2019s Anonymous. It used to be fun and the clues had wit, but now it\u2019s a chore with impenetrable clues that go on forever and often with a four-word solution. I offer a possible way of dealing with the problem to my fellow sufferers.</p> <p>Many years ago I played Ariel in the Tempest at the Old Vic with John Gielgud playing Prospero. Every day in the rehearsal room during tea breaks and idle moments Sir John would sit quietly doing the Times crossword. Sometimes he would complete it and put it aside within 20 minutes or so. Everyone was terribly impressed. The Times crossword was, in those days, the toughest nut in the bowl.</p> <p>One afternoon after this had been going on for some weeks, one of the cast idly picked up the great man\u2019s paper \u2013 he had finished for the day and had gone off to the Garrick Club or somewhere to meet Sir Ralph or someone. Suddenly the actor who had been looking at the paper gasped and showed us the crossword. It was indeed all filled in, but apart from one or two correct answers the rest were just words that happened to fit the spaces and had no bearing on the clues. Needless to say none of us confronted Sir John with the discovery and he continued to complete the Time crossword every day with consummate ease.</p> <p>I offer this not as a luvvie dropping names and theatrical anecdotes, but as a frustrated Guardian crossword-doer.<br><strong>Michael Feast</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The cryptic crosswords are indeed becoming increasingly difficult and so solvers should not be 2 down on themselves.<br><strong>Adrian Brodkin</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019m so relieved I\u2019m not the only one struggling with the crosswords. I had blamed the clogging up of the brain cells, because until recently I\u2019ve enjoyed the Guardian\u2019s puzzles for more than 30 years. However, like Margaret Hopkins (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/23/theresa-may-tops-trump-when-it-comes-to-nukes\" title=\"\">Letters, August 24</a>), now I can be confident of completing only those by Rufus and Paul. The other compilers chuck far too much into their clues so that solving them prompts groans of misery not delight. Only Paul has a touch of the wit, elegance and economy of the blessed Araucaria.<br><strong>Susan Seager</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I now start at the bottom right-hand corner, as the clues seem to be easier there. Perhaps the setter is running out of fiendish clues by then, or just wants to get it over and done with. Whatever, it seems to work.<br><strong>Marjorie Clark</strong><br><em>Perth</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have to say I tend to finish them, albeit after a lot of research and Googling. However, the positioning of the crossword so close to the centrefold of the new puzzle page makes it very difficult to insert the answers in the top&#xa0;line. Very irritating.<br><strong>Pauline Wilson</strong><br><em>Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s a relief to know that others are also having trouble finishing the cryptic crosswords. For some time I have been assuring myself that they are getting more difficult, because I didn\u2019t want to face the alternative explanation.<br><strong>David Fielker</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jean Jackson, please take heart. I not only fail to complete it, I fail to start it.<br><strong>Ellen Hawley</strong><br><em>Crackington Haven, Cornwall</em></p> <p>\u2022 Having puzzled unsuccessfully over&#xa0;Picaroon\u2019s crossword (24 August), I\u2019m still at a loss with the solution in front of me.

Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04d6ce4b0486629890578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:17:03.350Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already?</p> <p>Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen.

Minutes from the most recent meeting revealed concern over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/public-confidence-in-uk-economy-recovers-after-brexit-vote-survey-finds\">Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union</a> and a potential slowdown in job creation. \u201cSeveral long-term global risks related to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/federal-reserve-interest-rates-brexit\">Brexit remained</a>,\u201d the minutes noted.</p> <p>In Jackson Hole, Yellen noted that in the absence of hikes, interest rates have remained historically low, which could hinder the Fed\u2019s ability to fight recession in the near future. By lowering interest rates, the Fed provides an incentive for businesses and consumers to take out loans and to spend money, thus fueling the economy. But as interest rates are already low, the Fed may not be able to lower them as far as it might have in the past. </p> <p>\u201cForecasts now show the federal funds rate settling at about 3% in the longer run,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIn contrast, the federal funds rate averaged more than 7% between 1965 and 2000. Thus, we expect to have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.\u201d </p> <p>She ended by saying that despite historically low interest rates, \u201cmonetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\" data-alt=\"US interest rates\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/interest-rates/\">US interest rates</a> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month, 95 economists <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-economy-poll-usa-idUSKCN10M1FI\">polled by Reuters</a> said there was only a 25% chance of a rise in September, and most expected just one rate hike this year.

That the benefit is ending soon is because arbovirus season in Texas and most of the southern part of the United States \u201ckind of ends by then, so this is the crunch time right now\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, if we could afford it, I would like to see free Deet provided for all women,\u201d Hotez said.</p> <p>He is particularly concerned for women who are low income but do not qualify for Medicaid, and may have difficulty getting to a doctor if their pharmacy requires a prescription. In the past, <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2529146\">Hotez has argued</a> that children may be equally susceptible to the disease. He suggested that monitoring cases of Zika to see where transmission occurred and control of <em>Aedes aegypti</em> are also critical measures.</p> <p>In Texas, 3.6 million men, women and children qualify for public health insurance under the state\u2019s very strict income requirements. As of October 2013, the most recent data available, about <a href=\"http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/research/MedicaidEnrollment/ME/201310.html\">134,000 of those people</a> were pregnant women. </p> <p>Because of the austere requirements, the majority of people covered under Texas\u2019s Medicaid program are probably already pregnant or are children. This could be problematic, as scientists believe the most dangerous time for a fetus to be exposed to Zika is in the first trimester. </p> <p>The only <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/young-adults-and-families\">able-bodied adults eligible for Medicaid</a> (who are not pregnant) are those who care for at least one child. For the parents of a family of four to qualify, the household needs to take home less than $227 a month.</p> <p>However, children in low-income families are far more likely to qualify, as are pregnant women. A child in a two-parent household would qualify if the parents made less than <a href=\"https://chipmedicaid.org/en/Can-I-Get-It\">$1,842 a month</a>. A single pregnant woman could qualify for Medicaid if she made <a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/health/women/pregnant\">$1,991 or less a month</a>, and would be covered until two months after the birth of her child. </p> <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services actually approved the use of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/01/feds-say-medicaid-has-pay-zika-prevention-diagnosis-and-treatment/85240846/\">Medicaid for mosquito repellent in June</a>, but states along the gulf coast didn\u2019t start the programs until August, after Florida had local transmissions. </p> <p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/florida-zika-cases-mosquitoes-miami\">first four domestically acquired cases of Zika</a> were identified in the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article97345352.html\">Wynwood neighborhood of Miami on 29 July</a>. The Mississippi division of Medicaid announced it would cover mosquito repellent on 1 August; by that time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/florida-zika-cases-transmission-neighborhood-miami-dade-county\">total number of infections had risen to 14</a>. </p> <p>Texas announced it would provide mosquito repellent through Medicaid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/04/florida-zika-virus-outbreak-miami-mosquitos\">two days later</a>. <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/08/080916-zika-update.html\">On 9 August</a>, when the number of locally acquired Zika cases in Florida hit 21, <a href=\"http://www.healthystartfv.org/repellent-available-through-medicaid-health-plans/\"> the state announced</a> it would provide mosquito repellent to Medicaid recipients, but people would need to call one of 15 providers to determine if they were eligible. </p> <p>One of the only gulf coast states\u2019 Medicaid programs to begin distributing mosquito repellent in June was Louisiana, though recipients there needed a prescription and could only obtain one can a month. </p> <p>In Texas, other gaps exist as well. Men on Medicaid will not be eligible for mosquito repellent, despite the fact that Zika can be transmitted sexually.</p> <p>The roughly 4.6 million Texans \u2013 or roughly 17% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 who don\u2019t have health insurance won\u2019t be able to obtain mosquito repellent as a benefit. Undocumented immigrants, who number roughly <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-illegal-immigration-but-didnt-know-who-to-ask/\">1.6 million</a> in Texas and who are eligible for neither <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/immigrants/coverage/\">Medicaid programs nor Obamacare</a>, will also not receive mosquito repellent as a medical benefit.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>THE BELGIAN FOR VA VA VOOM</strong></h2> <p>For reasons that we cannot quite pinpoint the Fiver has always felt a strong bond with Belgium, the birthplace of Tintin, a journalist who never actually has to write any articles and spends most of his time hanging around with a dog and a bearded drunk. Maybe the attraction is the fact that the country\u2019s top thinkers have always encouraged exploration of the absurd. From Rene Maigritte\u2019s thought-provoking paintings of smartly dressed bodies with misplaced heads to Marc Wilmots\u2019 wacky football teams with misbegotten notions of defending, it seems that no scheme is ever too preposterous for the residents of a country that regularly has no government but is never without beer and chocolate.</p> <p>So the Fiver was not at all surprised when, in the wake of a Euro 2016 campaign in which their national football team displayed an urgent need for discipline and defensive rigour, the country\u2019s federation declared that its new manager would be none other than Roberto Mart\u00ednez, a meticulous taskmaster commonly believed to impose a strict diet of pie in the sky. Get relegated with Wigan, get hired by Everton; get sacked by Everton, land one of the world\u2019s most coveted international gigs in the world; yes, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s curious career path made Belgium the obvious next destination.</p> <p>Today, with his debut match scheduled for next week against his native Spain, Mart\u00ednez announced his first squad since his appointment. It contained no shocks, Fifa rules preventing any call-up for Antol\u00edn Alcaraz. So most of the players who have been failing to form a coherent whole for the last four years have been recalled. But Mart\u00ednez did stun onlookers by revealing that his assistant, along with his longtime accomplice Graeme Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/26/theirry-henry-belgium-assistant-coach-arsenal\">will be Thierry Henry</a>, who will be charged with providing a lot more stimulus to Belgium\u2019s listless stars than he has been providing to viewers of Sky Sports since becoming the pundit most admired by taxidermists.</p> <p>\u201cThierry brings something completely different, he\u2019s someone who has been in the situation of having to develop a mentality in a team of chasing the dream of winning something special for his country,\u201d explained Martinez. \u201cHe is very much an important figure in our staff and we hope he will pass on his experience to the players,\u201d continued the Spaniard. At this point neutral observers may be wondering whether a Mart\u00ednez/Henry duet risks increasing the imbalance from which the Belgian team appears to have been suffering for years, but Mart\u00ednez showed that he is aware of the need to tighten up at the back by hiring not one but two goalkeeping coaches. And if any of the defenders need lessons in stubbornly fending off attackers in the face of seemingly impossible odds, then they\u2019ll only have to tune into one of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s press conferences after a defeat.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe must have faith in the masses and we must have faith in the Party.

From talking to youth workers in London there are at least six insights that might help us serve young people better in the future, while protecting us against the kind of implosion that brought down Kids Company.<br></p> <h2><strong>Local authorities still have a vital role </strong></h2> <p>The recent report by trade union Unison on <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2016/08/we-must-support-young-people-and-the-services-they-rely-on/\">funding for youth services</a> highlighted that the days of large-scale financial support are gone. But local councils\u2019 role in identifying need, supporting young people at risk, and coordinating provision \u2013 all things that Lambeth and Southwark delivered when Kids Company collapsed \u2013 are vital and should be enhanced.<br></p> <h2><strong>There is entrenched need in communities</strong> </h2> <p>For all its problems, there was no doubt that, at its heart, Kids Company was about meeting need. And that need hasn\u2019t gone away. With more than <a href=\"http://www.mayorsfundforlondon.org.uk/become-a-delivery-partner/\">half a million young Londoners estimated to be living in poverty</a>, the reality of inequality can\u2019t be ignored. <a href=\"http://londonfairnesscommission.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/London-Fairness-Commission-Final-Report-Exec-Summary.pdf\">The London Fairness Commission made clear recommendations earlier this year</a> (pdf) to tackle this challenge and we urge the new mayor, Sadiq Khan, to prioritise them.<br></p> <h2><strong>Community organisations foster long-term outcomes</strong> </h2> <p>When the state fails, or big players collapse, it is invariably local community organisations that step in. The government should match its investment in the valuable, but short-term, National Citizen Service with equivalent funding for long-term, community youth work providing fun and opportunity out of school.<br></p> <h2><strong>Quality services and strong outcomes don\u2019t need to cost the earth</strong> </h2> <p>It is ironic that St Matthew\u2019s \u2013 with annual turnover of less than \u00a3100,000, no celebrity supporters and largely volunteer-run \u2013 is still going strong, while Kids Company, with all its profile, pop stars and celebrity friends, is no more. St Matthew\u2019s has achieved London Youth\u2019s accredited standard of quality assurance for youth work; it is an FA Charter standard club; it measures its outcomes and is truly part of the local infrastructure. If we could reallocate the investment Kids Company enjoyed, think what more St Matthew\u2019s and others could do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/aug/19/private-partnerships-youth-services-funding-crisis\">Are private partnerships the answer to the youth services funding crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Governance is key, but undervalued</strong> </h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest lesson of all is the need for good governance. In a competitive financial environment, the pressure is often on charities to find board members with funding or business connections. But there are also broader skills needed that can be undervalued: local expertise, safeguarding skills and youth work knowledge. The inquiries into Kids Company have identified that at least some of these skills were missing from their governance. Charities must be willing to learn these lessons.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <h2><strong>The media need to be less cynical, but more inquiring of the sector</strong> </h2> <p>The way Kids Company\u2019s collapse was reported was symptomatic of a wider critique of charities over the past 18 months. Charities should not complain about this: public scrutiny is good, and people are entitled to ask questions when things go wrong. But there has to be more understanding of our world. While media outlets have specialist correspondents for everything from technology to the environment to transport, there are very few journalists with a strong knowledge of how charities work. </p> <p>In a world where we are getting used to things changing rapidly, and sometimes surprisingly \u2013 from voting to leave Europe to changing the prime minister \u2013 it is important that we do our best to learn from things that go wrong and target investment and effort where it is needed. Young people\u2019s pressures and aspirations change \u2013 but the need for great youth work to support them over the long term is constant. Let\u2019s agree on this, at least, and prioritise investment in community-based approaches in future.<br></p> <p><strong>For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\"><strong>join our community - it\u2019s free!</strong></a></p>",

The YouTube hits tell us which bits flew,\u201d he told an audience at the Edinburgh Television Festival.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The latest Corden clip taking flight is a freshly launched Carpool Karaoke featuring Britney Spears, which is set to become the 33rd YouTube clip from the show to crack 10m views since Corden took over from Craig Ferguson as the show\u2019s host.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Winston is rightly proud of the mini-format, in which singers and other celebrities sing along to their greatest hits and field unthreatening questions from Corden in the car.

My major ambition is just to stay relevant.\u201d</p> <p>Winston said he had no idea how much revenue CBS makes directly off the back of the video views on YouTube, but the global success of the digital strategy has allowed them to leverage far more lucrative deals than relying on pushing TV ratings numbers to advertisers.<br></p> <p>These include McDonald\u2019s paying a hefty sum to be the destination, and food, featured in Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke with Selena Gomez. The deal also included the show being promoted nationwide for six months on McDonald\u2019s products.<br></p> <p>\u201cBecause of our YouTube numbers we\u2019ve been able to make deals that fundamentally as a midnight show we wouldn\u2019t be able to,\u201d said Winston. \u201cWe are in 155 countries. If we weren\u2019t doing the numbers we do on YouTube I\u2019m not sure the commissioners and executives across the world would be wanting to buy the show. That makes it very, very profitable. We\u2019ve been able to work out a different way to monetise our show than maybe what CBS has done in the past.\u201d<br></p> <p>He admitted that the show was perceived as cool and they had to be careful about \u201cselling out\u201d. He said the decision about whether to tie-up with McDonald\u2019s, even though it was a subtle association, was debated for many hours.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs long as you invest in the digital side, have a huge presence in the marketing space there on the digital side, then that is how you speak to the new generation,\u201d said Winston. \u201cOtherwise I don\u2019t quite know how the networks will carry on in the way they are. The CBSs, NBCs, ABCs, Foxes need to, of course, get on board with the way TV is moving. A show like ours has shown they can do that.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Most viewed Carpool Karaoke segments </h2> <p><strong>1</strong> Adele \u2013 123m views</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Justin Bieber \u2013 90m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> One Direction \u2013 80m</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Sia \u2013 59m</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Jennifer Lopez \u2013 49m</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Selena Gomez \u2013 44m</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Michelle Obama \u2013 41m</p>",

  "<p>Inside Madison Square Garden dozens of MTV staff and hundreds of crew are busy preparing for the network\u2019s annual festival of the absurd, better known as the Video Music Awards. It\u2019s the show\u2019s first time at the arena and its preparation and load-in has been a massive undertaking. It was three years ago when producers first started discussing the idea to house MTV\u2019s crown jewel at the \u201cworld\u2019s most famous arena\u201d, and it\u2019s all about to coalesce on Sunday night when years of work result in a equally headline-grabbing and smooth-moving spectacle. Well, that\u2019s the plan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/25/mtv-vmas-greatest-awards-show-on-earth\">Why the MTV VMAs are still the greatest awards show on earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes you think the show\u2019s going to be one thing and then it turns into something else,\u201d explains Garrett English, one of the executive producers of this year\u2019s show, which sounds like code for: we don\u2019t know what is going to happen. He\u2019s been working in some capacity with MTV and the Video Music Awards for the past two decades, and is well aware that things can quickly spin out of control. </p> <p>\u201cWe create a pretty volatile environment that can be combustable at times, and that\u2019s part of what the show\u2019s about,\u201d English says about expecting the unexpected, no doubt a major component of the VMA\u2019s allure, whether it was that famous kiss between Britney Spears and Madonna, or the infamous interruption of Taylor Swift by Kanye West. \u201cThose are scary moments for a producer for sure, but it\u2019s something you can\u2019t manufacture.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately for English and producer Erik Flannigan, there are some things you can control. \u201cOur lineup of who performs is always a fluid situation,\u201d explains Flannigan, while the vast screen and lighting rig propped up on the stage behind him twinkles and flashes in preparation for this year\u2019s scheduled moments, including ballyhooed VMA return of Britney Spears (her first since 2007) and an epic medley by pop superstar Rihanna. \u201cI know who\u2019s opening, but won\u2019t say because that\u2019s all part of the fun. But everything else always changes. Last year when Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj started the show together, that was something that we only planned a few days out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"890283754a9e118a675cde7e113068fe2a65fc4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890283754a9e118a675cde7e113068fe2a65fc4a/151_157_5284_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"VMAs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian will be attending this year\u2019s VMAs, while signs point to Taylor Swift skipping out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Besides the show\u2019s musical moments, which are also poised to include rapper Future and a cameo-filled Nick Jonas performance of his new single Bacon at an as-yet undisclosed remote location, producers are also scurrying up a list of presenters, from comedians like former VMA host Jimmy Fallon to actors such as Ansel Elgort. There will be athletes in attendance as well, from Michael Phelps to the US women\u2019s gymnastics team. \u201cThe moment they won gold, we were like, \u2018We have to get them into the room,\u201d says Flannigan of Olympians Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, Madison Kocian and Aly Raisman. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be the biggest celebrities there, I swear to God. It\u2019s going to be Kim and Kanye wanting to take picture with the Olympians, not the other way around.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of West and his everlasting, publicity-generating feud with Taylor Swift, the talk this year is also swirling about who\u2019s not attending. While Yeezy himself will indeed be in the audience with wife Kim close by, all signs point to Swift skipping out on this year\u2019s festivities entirely. Fellow superstar nominee Adele, in the midst of a world tour, also won\u2019t be gracing the VMA stage. \u201cShe\u2019s had some great moments with us, but it was never a conversation of no Adele versus having her,\u201d says English. \u201cFor a variety of reasons, it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People enjoy watching because it\u2019s so rare to see talent behave like real people</p> <footer> <cite>Erik Flannigan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, one star which will be on full display won\u2019t be any one artist, but the building itself. After bouncing between locations such as The Forum in Los Angeles and Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center, the show lands at Madison Square Garden for the first time in its history. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure why it took so long,\u201d says English, as comedy duo Key and Peele begin to rehearse a comedy sketch slated for the show on an elevated stage near the arena\u2019s balcony. \u201cThe Garden\u2019s obviously been on our list for a while, but it\u2019s obviously a building that\u2019s hard to get into, creatively and otherwise.\u201d (MTV rented out the venue for 12 days, something a longtime security guard at the venue interjected was \u201cvirtually unheard of\u201d.) \u201cGetting here represents the pinnacle of an artist\u2019s career,\u201d according to English. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to figure out when was the right time for us to do that. The show has been in intimate environments and big rooms, and each year we try to reinvent what we do with it.\u201d</p> <p>The reinvention of the spectacle on an annual basis is something that\u2019s kept it fresh since the show\u2019s inaugural broadcast in 1984. (This year\u2019s performer Ariana Grande was still nine years away from birth.) Back then, Dan Aykroyd and Bette Midler hosted and the Cars took home Video of the Year accolades for their track You Might Think, somehow beating Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller in what would be the first of many VMA upsets. \u201cI think people enjoy watching because it\u2019s so rare to see talent behave like real people,\u201d muses Flannigan as this year\u2019s best new artist nominee Lukas Graham walks by flanked by his band. \u201cPeople are drawn to the controversial parts, but I think they\u2019re just as drawn to the moments of heart and artistic greatness. I think this Sunday will be much more about that stuff than it will be about who\u2019s going to interrupt who.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2016 because an earlier version said, erroneously, that Taylor Swift had been nominated for Video of the Year.</p>",
  "<p>Powerful, speedy, accurate, freely available and moderately priced chess computer programs, with ratings estimated at 3200-3500, far above the human world champion\u2019s 2882 peak, provide high-level training for any ambitious player. They have also significantly lowered the age at which young talents acquire master standard skills.</p> <p>The best prospects among children used to display exceptional ability around the ages of nine to 10 and to achieve consistent results at 12, as with England\u2019s all-time best pair. Nigel Short beat Viktor Korchnoi in a simultaneous match at 10 and made his British Championship debut at 12. Michael Adams won the Cornwall under-15 and under-18 championships at nine, playing simultaneously in different rooms. At 12, he appeared in the Lloyds Bank Open and only just missed his first international master norm.</p> <p>Such achievements have become routine in recent years as the top nations, Russia, China, India and the United States, seek to establish chess dynasties which will continue into the 2020s and beyond. There are now world and European titles for under-eights and these are serious contests. Awonder Liang won the world under-eight in 2011, the same year in which he became the youngest ever to defeat an international master and qualify as a US expert. Now he is an IM and rated 2465, the best 13-year-old in the world.</p> <p>Liang is one of three US teenagers well on the route to the world top 50. Jeffrey Xiong, 15, has just won the world under-20 junior title while Sam Sevian, 15, has growing achievements. All are backed by Garry Kasparov\u2019s foundation and receive personal training from the maestro and his top aides.</p> <p>Russia dominated global chess in the Soviet era but their current best teenager, Vladislav Artemiev, is already 18 and had to settle for the silver medal behind Xiong at the world junior. India boasts the world\u2019s youngest IM, R Praggnanandhaa, who qualified for the title at 10, two years after winning the world under-8. The concern for the Indians is that there are simply too many of them in mutual competition in a country where the legendary Vishy Anand has become a performance yardstick.</p> <p>China\u2019s Wei Yi, 17, remains the junior to beat. He had some uneven performances a few months back, but was included in last month\u2019s Bilbao Masters against the elite where he scored 50% and lost only to the world champion, Magnus Carlsen. China is ultra professional when it comes to spotting and developing very young talent.</p> <p>Wei Yi left home to live with his chess coach at seven, enrolled in a specialist chess academy at eight, became world under-12 champion then turned professional, training for seven hours a day and receiving a state salary. For all of them, Americans, Russians, Indians and Chinese alike, computer sessions studying openings and preparing for opponents are part of the daily routine.</p> <p>Thirty or 40 years ago England were the No2 nation in junior chess behind the USSR, and this speedily metamorphosed into silver medals at the biennial Olympiad, whose 2016 version starts in Baku, Azerbaijan, next Friday, with 180 nations expected.</p> <p>Junior chess remains popular here but the last English primary school children to emerge with potential to achieve 2700-rated elite GM standard were Gawain Jones and David Howell 15 years ago. The problem starts early. To reach top level now, you probably need a rating of at least Fide 2000/ECF 175, adult expert standard by 10 and the best English under-11s are currently some 150-200 rating points below that.</p> <p>It is not just the elite nations which have outstripped England. France and Germany also produce more early talents, leading on to GMs and IMs in their mid-teens. Germany\u2019s great hope is Vincent Keymer. Kasparov has called the 11-year-old \u201cexceptional\u201d, he has a 2350 rating close to IM level, and he showed he is the real deal this week with an impressive second prize in the strong Vienna Open. So it seems likely that only the emergence of an exceptional new young English player can reverse this negative trend.</p> <p>An English amateur overran a US grandmaster in the opening round of the current Abu Dhabi Open.

After all, it\u2019s much easier to horrify moderate voters \u2013 and motivate the party base \u2013 with Trump\u2019s plans to deport 11 million US residents, close the borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China and cozy up to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In this target-rich environment, who has the time or energy to go after his credibility?</p> <p>Why, Donald Trump does, of course.</p> <p>This week the GOP nominee managed to flip-flop on his signature issue: the one that got him through all those noisy primary debates. The one that allowed him to destroy most of his rivals and connect at a visceral level with the party\u2019s nativist core.</p> <p>Of Trump\u2019s top three opponents \u2013 Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush \u2013 two are Latino and one is married to a Latina. Trump tarred all three, despite their protestations, with the same brush of being soft on immigration.</p> <p>And then, out of sheer desperation or stupidity, Trump decided this week to copy them. At a town hall-style show on Fox News, hosted by his unofficial adviser Sean Hannity, the GOP candidate <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/08/24/trump-asks-his-supporters-to-weigh-in-on-deportation-policy/\">rolled out</a> his kinder, gentler immigration policy to a mixed response from the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cSo you have somebody that\u2019s been in the country for 20 years, has done a great job, has a job, everything else, OK. Do we take him and the family, her or him or whatever, and send them out? Are they gone?\u201d Trump mused out loud.</p> <p>\u201cOr when somebody really has shown \u2013 you know, it\u2019s called like the merit system \u2013 other than they did break the law in the first place, OK \u2026 So do we tell these people to get out, number one, or do we work with them and let them stay in some cases?\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass, with a rambling response on Fox News, that Trump demolished the foundation of his own campaign. Which naturally left his audience a little confused.</p> <p>Trump may have previously given the impression that he thought all these undocumented immigrants were little more than a gang of murderers and rapists. But now, after some reflection, he concedes there may be some decent families mixed in with the gangs of thugs. Under Trump\u2019s new plan, there would be no citizenship for these people, but there would be legal status after the payment of some back taxes.</p> <p>This plan is otherwise known as the Obama proposal for comprehensive immigration reform.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me,\u201d he explained on Fox News. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve said, Mr Trump, I love you, but to take a person that\u2019s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and the family out. It\u2019s so tough, Mr Trump. I mean, I have it all the time! It\u2019s a very, very hard thing,\u201d</p> <p>Then he turned to his crowd and asked, \u201cWho wants those people thrown out?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters. We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI do!\u201d responded one man.</p> <p>This is a natural response from the people who have fueled the rise of Donald Trump, and their dismay at Trump\u2019s total betrayal is only just emerging.</p> <p>Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the nativist Center for Immigration Studies, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-mixed-signals-on-immigration-cause-a-flap-1472169148\">told</a> the Wall Street Journal the Trump campaign was over. \u201cWhatever remaining chance he had to win the White House is gone,\u201d said Krikorian. \u201cThe fact now that he has betrayed his base on the signature issue that he ran on seems to me the death knell of his candidacy as a practical matter.\u201d</p> <p>You may be forgiven for thinking that Trump wanted to deploy a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to expel millions of undocumented immigrants. But when pressed about Trump\u2019s paramilitaries on CNN, his new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said meekly: \u201cHe has not said that for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Back in 2004, John Kerry\u2019s campaign was destroyed for pointing out obtusely that he had voted both for and against funding the Iraq war. This flip-floppery led to TV ads of him windsurfing back and forth to the tune of the Blue Danube. As a result, it was hard to think of a less manly American leader in the midst of the war on terror.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wondering what Team Bush thinks of Donald Trump\u2019s far more dramatic flip-flop, you don\u2019t have to look that far. Jeb Bush, the low-energy brother who was so easily dispatched by Donald Trump in the GOP primaries, told WABC radio that the nominee\u2019s reversals were \u201cabhorrent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like a typical politician,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAll the things Donald Trump railed against, he seems to be morphing into. I don\u2019t know what to believe about a guy who doesn\u2019t believe in things.\u201d</p> <p>If only he had been capable of such quips in the primaries, he might now be working on his transition to government.</p> <p>Of course, in later speeches and interviews, Trump suggested he might deport more people. Or fewer. Depending on the TV interview or crowd he\u2019s talking to at the time.</p> <p>Until now, honesty has been one of the very few areas where Trump has been running ahead of Hillary Clinton. While both candidates score poorly on such traits, Trump still maintained an edge, according to a recent NBC News/Survey Monkey <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-maintains-big-lead-voters-doubt-trump-s-temperament-n631351\">poll</a>. Even while losing badly overall to Clinton, Trump enjoyed a five-point advantage over Clinton on being honest and trustworthy. This is unlikely to last for much longer.</p> <p>The bottom fell out of the Trump campaign last month after a disastrous convention season. He picked a miserable fight with a Muslim American gold star family, and gave a series of TV interviews that would have got him fired from his own show.

Nor would tumbleweed now be blowing through high streets.</p> <p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/15/osborne-project-fear-budget-eu-refereundum-leave-scare\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d budget </a>\u2013 an attempt to dramatise the impact of weakening longterm economic growth on any chancellor\u2019s options \u2013 was over the top. But in the context of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs\" title=\"\">leave\u2019s specious NHS claims</a> it&#xa0;was no more than a misguided attempt to fight abusive statistical fire on the same terms.</p> <p>Stock market buoyancy is a function of sterling\u2019s weakness and of the Bank of England\u2019s \u201csledgehammer\u201d monetary response \u2013 itself born of the bank\u2019s own deep apprehensions of a \u201cmaterial slowdown\u201d. Thus, too, the current resilience of retail sales. But what matters is future intent. Here surveys of business and consumer confidence tell a more ominous story. The commercial property market and construction, where decision-makers are compelled to make longer-term assessments, are already experiencing sharply weakening conditions.</p> <p>Prospects over the next five years are sobering \u2013 even alarming. The British and European economies are inextricably interconnected, as you would expect after more than 40 years of EU membership. Much of what remains of our manufacturing industry is dependent on free movement of goods and people, of which the newly successful motor and aerospace industries are typical exemplars. Industries as disparate as higher education, agriculture and financial services have prospered directly from EU programmes and the single market. Unscrambling all these hard-won and valuable relationships is bound to have a deleterious effect.</p> <p>Further, the world\u2019s companies come here to enjoy the UK \u201caircraft carrier\u201d effect \u2013 exporting into the EU single market from an exceptionally business-friendly environment. Nearly 500 multinational companies have their European or global HQ in Britain \u2013 five times more than Germany \u2013 a major boost to our business services and commercial property industries alike.</p> <p>Now the \u201caircraft carrier\u201d is torpedoed \u2013 but until we know the details of Brexit nobody can tell whether it is badly crippled or sunk \u2013 along with the economic activity that derived from it. Is the end result likely to be Brexit-lite, with continued access to the single market and some compromise on free movement of people? The Tory right and their media allies will insist that is a sell-out, and will the Labour party want to be painted as a friend of immigration? In which case Britain will be compelled to negotiate trade deals with 27 EU countries, and another 52 deals with the countries with whom the EU has deals in turn. What will the resulting tariff \u2013 and indeed non-tariff \u2013 regime be? When will they be concluded, given they take on average seven years? Liam Fox trumpeting possible deals with Australia and Azerbaijan in a decade\u2019s time is no substitute for knowing the answer, or better still having free and uninhibited access to the vast market in our own continent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What will be the regime for agriculture, for science, for startups, for aerospace, for financial services?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the \u201cdust cloud\u201d of uncertainty of which the chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/14/monetary-policy-only-short-term-balm-for-uk-economy\" title=\"\">recently warned</a>. It can be partly ameliorated, certainly, but it can\u2019t be removed by an active fiscal policy and industrial policy. There will plainly be some increase in exports with a lower pound: but the response was desperately weak after sterling\u2019s fall in 2008-9. More importantly, who is going to make a major investment in the UK in these circumstances, even with a weaker pound? Two economists <a href=\"http://voxeu.org/article/britain-s-eu-membership-new-insight-economic-history\" title=\"\">(Nauro Campos and Fabrizio Coricelli</a> \u2013 yes, experts) calculate that foreign direct investment will fall by a quarter. And if or when the uncertainty lifts, will it be because we have a hard or soft Brexit? It was for these reasons that every reputable forecaster predicted Brexit would lead to output falling below what it would otherwise have been in the years ahead. Not lurid pictures of an Armageddon; rather a cool assessment of economic realities, casually dismissed as \u201cProject Fear\u201d.</p> <p>It could even be worse. Economies can get trapped in vicious downward spirals. Falling investment begets falling investment. A weakening commercial property market spells weakened bank balance sheets, and potential credit constraints. What kind of recovery will happen after the inevitable slowdown or recession next year? What will be the regime for agriculture, for science, for start-ups, for aerospace, for financial services? Who has confidence in Messrs Johnson, Fox and Davis putting the interests of the economy and jobs before their ideological predilections?</p> <p>We have been plunged into a mess. The EU never obstructed the vital structural changes to the British investment and innovation ecosystem that had to be made, in or out. Now we have to deliver those reforms beset by the disastrous uncertainty of leaving the world\u2019s greatest trading bloc. For what? Not to co-operate with our European neighbours in what, in my view, is a noble cause? To unleash the most disturbing outburst of anti-foreigner sentiment I have witnessed in my adult life?</p> <p>Of course opinions vary. As you may have seen last week, Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s current economic editor, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\" title=\"\">upbeat about Brexit</a>.

But regardless of whether there were or weren\u2019t any free seats available on the Virgin train from London to Newcastle, one thing stands out. The trip to Gateshead wasn\u2019t planned at the last minute, so why did no one think to reserve the four seats on the service?

Meanwhile, as environment, food and rural affairs secretary, Leadsom has the poisoned chalice of explaining to all those people in Cornwall and Wales who voted for Brexit why the government won\u2019t be matching the EU subsidies, as she promised in the referendum campaign. The dark horse, though, is Grayling. As the man behind May\u2019s ascent to No 10, he might have expected one of the great offices of state.

  "<p>Myra Crimmel woke up the morning of 7 September 2013 covered in cuts and bruises, her body sore. She had no idea how she ended up on the balcony of her UC Santa Barbara dorm. Or why she was naked \u2013 and with an older student and his friend. She guessed that they had drugged her. Over the next few hours, she claims, they would rape her in the shower and on her room-mate\u2019s bed.</p> <p>Months later, Crimmel filed a complaint against her college with the US Department of Education\u2019s office of civil rights. <a href=\"http://endrapeoncampus.org/\">End Rape on Campus</a>, an advocacy group that helped Crimmel and another woman from another school publicize their complaints, noted that both of their attacks occurred at about the same point in the school year. Crimmel and the other woman \u201chope to join over 70 colleges nationwide undergoing federal gender discrimination probes,\u201d a press release read, \u201cand to call attention to the \u2018red zone\u2019\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For colleges which undertake sexual assault prevention as part of orientation, their efforts may be coming too late</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The \u201cred zone\u201d is shorthand for the time at the beginning of the school year when a disproportionate number of campus sexual assaults take place. The Department of Justice has identified the period between students\u2019 arrival on campus in late August and Thanksgiving break as the stretch of time when a student is more likely to be assaulted than at any other point in her college career. During that time, the majority of assaults occur between midnight and 6am, on Saturday and Sunday mornings.</p> <p>Other research suggests the red zone is even more concentrated, and that assaults spike in the days before the school year officially begins. At colleges which undertake sexual assault prevention as part of freshman orientation, this means their efforts may be coming too late.</p> <p>Some of the theories that prevail in explaining the red zone are unsurprising. The red zone overlaps with a battery of back-to-school parties, where freshmen with little drinking experience and few friends to watch out for them are at their most vulnerable. In response, hundreds of colleges will spend the early weeks of this school year telling women how to avoid being preyed upon or requiring students to complete a short anti-violence tutorial.</p> <p>But a growing number of activists, researchers, and sexual assault prevention experts insist the usual methods are also least likely to work. </p> <p>\u201cFor so, so long we have tried to cram every little piece of violence prevention in a 45-minutes-or-less presentation to incoming freshmen,\u201d said Darcie Folsom, the director of sexual violence prevention and advocacy at Connecticut College. \u201cAnd it has not been the most successful.\u201d The red zone, many of them say, is a disquieting symbol \u2013 and perhaps even a result \u2013 of everything that\u2019s wrong with traditional approaches to preventing sexual assault.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even use the term \u2018red zone\u2019,\u201d said Lea Hegge, who is a trainer for a nonprofit, <a href=\"https://www.livethegreendot.com/\">the Green Dot</a>, which runs programs to deter sexual assault. The reason, she said, is that campuses aware that they have a red zone problem have tended, historically, to respond primarily with tips for avoiding assault. \u201cIt encourages this idea that there is a most dangerous time on campus, and if you only follow a list of what not to do in order to not get assaulted, you won\u2019t [\u2026] It\u2019s putting the onus on the victim for preventing their own assault.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The term 'red zone' encourages this idea that there is a most dangerous time on campus</p> <footer> <cite>Lea Hegge</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking back, Crimmel says her story is a brutal illustration of this \u2013 of why telling women to prevent their own rapes isn\u2019t effective. She followed the rules that supposedly safeguard a woman from being assaulted, she says, staying with friends and within familiar surroundings. \u201cIf you had asked me before it happened, could this happen? I bet I would say, \u2018Well I can look out for myself,\u2019\u201d she recalls. <br></p> <p>Additionally, she claimed in her complaint that with its lackluster investigations of campus assault, her school had created an environment in which sexual violence was more or less tolerated.</p> <p>The red zone, say advocates and researchers, is the result of many of these same factors. It persists where there is a history of apathy or even subtle tolerance toward sexual assault. It involves people who may be vulnerable for reasons beyond their control, and predators who know so. </p> <p>\u201cThe people who are facilitating sex assault on college campuses are aware of who they can take advantage of,\u201d said Hegge.</p> <p>Notably, \u201cred zone\u201d poses a particular danger to incoming freshmen. One study concluded that freshmen were two and a half times as likely as students in other years to be the victims of assault, a number which increased for rapes occurring at parties. \u201cThe take-home was, no matter how you break it down, no matter how you look at the statistics, freshmen are more likely to be the targets of predatory behavior, always,\u201d said Lisa Wade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/sex-on-campus-hookup-culture-student-journals\">a researcher who has studied sexual activity on campus</a>.</p> <p>A host of realities intertwine to make freshmen particularly vulnerable targets, including many outside anyone\u2019s control. They are new to campus, with few social ties, eager to fit in, and possibly drinking alcohol for the first time. Reacting to these factors, police and administrators often issue familiar suggestions for how to avoid being the victim of sexual assault: don\u2019t walk home alone at night. Go to parties with a group. Keep your drink in your possession.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we keep asking students not to do something that\u2019s completely normal to them, we will keep getting the same result</p> <footer> <cite>Barbara McCall</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many administrators are beginning to conclude that this advice is useless, or at least useless by itself.</p> <p>\u201cIf we keep asking young students not to do something that\u2019s completely, developmentally normal to them, we will keep getting the same result,\u201d says Barbara McCall, the director of health and wellness education at Middlebury College. \u201cIt\u2019s not a theory. It\u2019s reality.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not for lack of young women trying to heed it. At Penn State, Katie Tenny, a coordinator involved in reducing sexual assault, previously was a health educator in the university\u2019s risky-drinking reduction program. \u201cA lot of times, girls would talk about how they watched out for each other,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHow they had plans going into the evening,\u201d such as, stay together, keep an eye on your roommate, and leave with the same friends you arrived with.</p> <p>Somehow, though, the plans always seemed to break down. Crimmel herself has seen it happen. Once, at a party, she watched a man try to thwart a freshman woman\u2019s attempts to rejoin the group she came in with. \u201cThe guy said, \u2018You just met your room-mate two days ago, how do you know she\u2019s your friend?\u2019\u201d Crimmel recalled. \u201cThey use the fact that you\u2019re in a new place. They know the right words to tear you away.\u201d</p> <p>Normally, an administrator like Tenny might advocate for even stronger messaging of prevention toward young women. But Penn State and a handful of other colleges are attempting to emphasize a new approach, one in which they hardly focus on underclassmen. Instead, they lean on popular upperclassmen to intervene if they recognize signs of predatory behavior, putting the onus of preventing assault on those who are the least inherently vulnerable to its menace. Green Dot epitomizes this approach. </p> <p>Influential seniors and juniors \u201care much more likely to influence the values of the campus than I am standing in front of a room of 600 students\u201d, said McCall. \u201cIt helps us create a sustainable culture change, with the hope that we create an institution that doesn\u2019t tolerate acts of violence.\u201d</p> <p>Crimmel says a culture shift couldn\u2019t come sooner. \u201cPeople need to know that you aren\u2019t a man if you rape a girl,\u201d she said. On the Monday after her assaults, she says, she went to the school nurse for an examination. The nurse said she saw women who had been assaulted nearly every Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s not just my school,\u201d Crimmel said. \u201cIt happens in each school in America.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When I was 15 years old, in September 2004, I went to Sunday mass at my local church in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with my mother as I usually did. During the service a bat started flying around the church and members of the congregation began flapping at it. An usher eventually hit it with a prayer book and it fell to the floor. I could see it was only stunned, so, being an animal lover, I asked my mum if I could take it outside. I picked it up by its wings and it began screeching, so I hurried out. As I went to throw it into a bush it sank its fangs into my left finger and I felt a sharp pain. When we got home my mother dressed the wound.</p> <p>My dad wasn\u2019t pleased, but no one thought anything more about it. Three weeks later I noticed my left finger felt a bit numb, with some tingling, too. Within a couple of days I felt tired and nauseous. We thought I had flu. About 24 hours later I had double vision and my family took me to hospital. By the time I got there I was semi-delirious and vomiting. I was asked to stand on one leg, but I couldn\u2019t keep my balance. They began tests but couldn\u2019t find anything.</p> <p>Then we mentioned the bat bite. I was taken to the children\u2019s hospital, where rabies was diagnosed. At that point my memory is virtually blank. I later learned that I began producing masses of saliva and my arm started jerking. My parents were told I had hours to live.</p> <p>No one had ever survived rabies without a vaccination, but Dr Rodney Willoughby, a paediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the hospital, decided he had to do something. He consulted various books and used his experience to come up with an impromptu treatment. He made it clear he had no idea whether it would work and that there might be many other complications as a result, but my parents agreed to give it a go.</p> <p>I was put into a coma to isolate my brain and allow my immune system to fight the virus. I was also given ketamine to protect my brain, another drug to reduce its side effects and two antiviral medicines.</p> <p>A week later they slowly brought me out of the coma. I was too weak to open my eyes but when Dr Willoughby held my eyelids open and told me to look over at my mum, I did. Mum was elated because it showed that I was still \u201cin there\u201d. I had become the first known person ever to survive rabies without a vaccination; the treatment became known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_protocol\">Milwaukee protocol</a>.</p> <p>I spent 11 weeks in hospital, where I had to take 17 pills a day to help my recovery.

  "<p>How do you describe the taste and texture of a prawn? Sort of rubbery; elastic, even. Like chicken, only better. These unappetising phrases hardly capture what makes it so good\u2014the precise reason why prawns (called shrimp in the United States) are one of the most consumed seafoods globally. But now biotech startup <a href=\"http://www.newwavefoods.com/#start\">New Wave Foods</a> is on a mission to mimic the exact texture and taste of a prawn, in a product made entirely out of algae and plant ingredients.</p> <p>The small, orangey-pink whorls they\u2019ve created look uncannily like the real thing. But what do they taste like? That\u2019s a question for Dominique Barnes, CEO of California-based New Wave Foods. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a few blind taste tests\u2014unofficially, you know\u2014and until we tell people it\u2019s made of plants and algae they can\u2019t tell,\u201d says Barnes, who comes from a background in marine conservation. </p> <p>The company claims to have fully recreated the bouncy texture and fishy undertones of a real prawn: on the back of this success they recently secured seed funding from investors Efficient Capacity and New Crop Capital, which will help get the product off the ground. By next year, they aim to have it commercialised in the U.S.\u2014and already, their imitation prawns have passed the culinary test. When the company presented their product in March at Google\u2019s San Francisco caf\u00e9, the executive chef \u201cwas so impressed that he ordered 200 pounds on the spot,\u201d Barnes recalls.</p> <p>New Wave Foods sprang onto the scene in 2015 with a project aiming to produce artificial shark fin out of genetically modified yeast, in an attempt to make the controversial delicacy more sustainable. Now, the focus has shifted to replicating shellfish. \u201cI grew up in Las Vegas and I had a very bleak perspective on seafood,\u201d says Barnes, describing a place where 99c shrimp cocktails were abundant, despite the city\u2019s location mid-desert, hours from the sea. That\u2019s indicative of America generally, where shrimp can be absurdly attainable, steeped as it is in the country\u2019s culinary culture: it remains the most popular seafood in the United States, with an average <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/farmed-shrimp\">four pounds</a> consumed per capita each year. \u201cShrimp really stood out as this well-loved product, but also one with lots of problems,\u201d says Barnes.</p> <p>The prawn fishing industry has been at the heart of an environmental controversy for years. Ocean-going vessels are linked with multiple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2013/jun/10/fish-fishing\">ecological ills</a>, including bycatch, thanks to the unforgiving fine mesh nets used to scoop up prawns from the sea. Prawn aquaculture, carried out at industrial scales in countries like India, Vietnam, and Brazil, also results in widespread mangrove destruction and deforestation. Then there\u2019s the industry\u2019s shocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour\">link to slavery</a>: migrants unwittingly trafficked into the industry, typically in Asia, are forced to work on fishing boats and farms, enduring brutal conditions with little hope of escape. It\u2019s this backlog of human rights abuses that make prawns so abundant and affordable in many parts of the world. </p> <p>\u201cThere are many growing concerns associated with imported, farm-raised shrimp, as well as the devastating human trafficking on certain foreign shrimp vessels and farms around the world,\u201d says Kimberly Warner, senior scientist at ocean advocacy non-profit Oceana, who also <a href=\"http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/shrimp_fraud_brochure_final_lores.pdf\">produced a report</a> in 2014 on the widespread mislabelling of shrimp in the U.S. Barnes, who felt the solutions to these problems \u201cwere moving slower than we needed them to,\u201d sees synthetic prawns as a way to take some pressure off the oceans.</p> <p>The prawns are made completely without animal cells: the recipe blends plant ingredients with red algae, which gives the product its realistic coral hue. While the company can\u2019t share the finer details of their technique\u2014pioneered by the company\u2019s materials scientist and co-founder Michelle Wolf\u2014Barnes says it involves pinpointing the building blocks of the food they\u2019re trying to replicate, and searching for replacements in a wide range of algae and plants. \u201cIt\u2019s really about understanding what creates the texture properties of shrimp, and then looking for molecules that mimic that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In the lab, they use machines to rigorously test the tensile strength, elasticity, and texture of the synthetic prawn to make sure it comes as close as possible to the real thing. \u201cBut really there\u2019s no better tool to measure texture than a mouth,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of taste testing!\u201d </p> <p>Producing over <a href=\"file://localhost/docrep/fao/011/i0300e/i0300e.pdf\">6 million tonnes</a> annually, the global prawn industry is massive; of course, replacing the real thing with artificial prawns isn\u2019t going to solve the industry\u2019s myriad problems. It\u2019s also important that resources continue to be channelled into improving prawn fisheries and farming in the U.S. and elsewhere, Warner says. \u201cWild-caught, domestic shrimp has the potential to be a safe and sustainable choice if the U.S. seafood and fishing industries just make a few simple changes,\u201d she says\u2014like improving seafood traceability, and upgrading trawl nets so they snare less bycatch.</p> <p>Food forecasts indicate in any case that the future is ripe for animal protein analogues, whether as a replacement, or an addition to the real thing. But will a shrimp-obsessed nation be likely to welcome imitation shellfish into their homes? </p> <p>Barnes thinks so, though not necessarily due to shattering revelations of slavery and the industry\u2019s environmental impact, so much as the product\u2019s health benefits. \u201cGlobally, one of the top trends overall is people moving towards plant-based diets,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s more personal than your health, right? I think that benefit of the product will resonate with the most people.\u201d </p> <p>Next year, the company plans to debut commercially with small breaded prawns, known as the wildly popular \u2018popcorn shrimp\u2019 in the U.S. In the future, they hope to bring the product to other parts of the world, too. \u201cJust give people an easy way to make a change, and they\u2019re doing this for themselves and the environment,\u201d says Barnes.</p>",
  "<p>Walking beside me through a market town centre is a lean, healthy, 46-year-old man. \u201cSo, you wanted me to show you how I used to look?\u201d He draws in his stomach, rounds his shoulders, paws imaginary sweat from his cheeks, and suddenly I\u2019m looking at a junkie \u2013 jumpy, wheedling, begging for a fix. \u201cAnd this is how you walk when you\u2019re going to score heroin.\u201d Subtly hunched over a sunken midriff, he strides ahead, as fast as he can without breaking into a run. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the stomach,\u201d he grins when I\u2019ve caught up. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stomach cramps.\u201d</p> <p>For 14 years, Neil Woods would leave behind his wife and two young children, put on stained \u201ccharity-shop scally tracksuit bottoms\u201d, and turn up in a town somewhere in England as a drug addict. \u201cI was a sponge for colloquialisms and mannerisms. Street slang is very regionalised, even just specific to a town, so you have to adapt quite quickly. The biggest danger at the start of any job is that you\u2019ve landed from Mars \u2013 and who are you?\u201d Using a new cover story each time, the undercover drugs squad officer would gradually befriend destitute addicts, ingratiate himself with their dealers, buy drugs from them \u2013 and then have the whole lot sent to jail.</p> <p>It\u2019s a struggle to reconcile the faux junkie Woods used to be with the articulate ex-policeman taking me for tea and cakes. \u201cOh, but I loved the art of deception,\u201d he offers. \u201cAnd I loved the development of the skill. It\u2019s a great thrill to be able to successfully deceive people. Particularly when it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The dangers grew every year, as dealers cottoned on to undercover police tactics, and grew increasingly suspicious of a new face asking for drugs. One dealer tried to run Woods over, another held a knife to his groin, another pulled a 9mm Glock handgun on him. But the commendation awards kept piling up. Woods even helped formulate national guidelines for undercover operations, and trained officers all over the country in his skills. By his calculation, he consigned drug offenders to more than 1,000 years behind bars.</p> <p>He did feel guilty about jailing the hapless addicts who led him to the dealers. \u201cBut I told myself I was fighting the good fight, and that the ends justified the means.\u201d This moral justification seemed more compelling with each new assignment, due to the ever-escalating violence deployed by dealers to deter communities from talking to the police. In Northampton, Woods discovered a chilling new punishment for informants \u2013 gang rape of a girlfriend or sister \u2013 and every heroin addict in Brighton warned him that if the local dealers thought he had talked, the next hit of heroin he bought would kill him. Woods had wondered why heroin fatalities in Brighton were five times the national average. This wasn\u2019t an overdose epidemic, he realised, but dealers literally getting away with murder, making their victims\u2019 deaths look like just another accidental overdose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations\">The UN\u2019s war on drugs is a failure.

Although at least with the cold war you could knock a wall down, and de-escalate it. There\u2019s no wall to knock down with the war on drugs, is there?

When Woods came across corrupt colleagues in the drug squad, the senior ranks would shrug that this was inevitable, given the money involved. A criminal trade that is worth \u00a37bn could buy as many police as it liked.</p> <p>\u201cBut the public don\u2019t tend to see this, and it\u2019s not really very much talked about, is it? One of the big problems is the duty of chief constables to maintain public confidence \u2013 which is understandable, because if the public lose confidence in the police, anarchy can follow. But it means there is no openness about the extent of corruption from the drug supply. So the public don\u2019t know. Compare that with prohibition in America up until 1933. The headlines in the press were constantly about the corruption that was being caused by prohibition.\u201d</p> <p>The realisation that the career he had risked his life for was not merely futile, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/08/spice-synthetic-marijuana-drug-screenings-tests\">the chief cause of the misery he had witnessed</a>, plunged Woods into a psychological crisis. He felt as if he was losing his mind until doctors diagnosed PTSD; it was so severe that even today Woods is twitchy and restless. A tic jerks his neck into spasms when he explains that the memories tormenting him were of the harm he had done to vulnerable addicts. This form of PTSD, he learned, is called Moral Damage. \u201cIt\u2019s about having done bad things. And I have done really bad things.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to talking to colleagues, but they were having none of it. If drugs were legalised, they assured him, the dealers and gangsters wouldn\u2019t disappear, but simply diversify into other crimes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the greatest misunderstanding about crime. It\u2019s not criminals that cause crime, it\u2019s opportunity.\u201d No other crime presents the same opportunity for \u201cany 15-year-old\u201d to make anything like as much money as easily and with so little risk of being caught. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all about the demand as well. The government\u2019s own statistics say three million people in this country use cannabis. There is no such vast demand for any other type of criminality.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/prohibition-doesnt-work-uk-needs-enlightened-drugs-policy\">Prohibition doesn\u2019t work.

Alongside that, 50% of acquisitive crime is committed by less than 0.2% of the population. And that\u2019s problematic heroin users. If we undercut the criminal gangs, and prescribed heroin to addicts, most of that crime would disappear overnight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/01/switzerland-drugs-heroin\">The evidence is there in Switzerland</a>.

There\u2019s a limit on how strong spirits can be.

By now it\u2019s hard to remember that Woods was ever a policeman. He tucks into \u201cthis bog-standard reply\u201d as if it were a banquet. \u201cThere\u2019s two answers to counter that view. For one, burglars are a tiny number of people. As any police inspector or sergeant will tell you, you can decrease the amount of burglaries in a town of 25,000 people by half by catching two burglars. And by catching burglars, you reduce the demand for that crime, so to speak. But by policing drugs, you don\u2019t reduce the demand. You have no impact on the demand whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>He cites a global study, conducted by the coalition government, of the impact that punitive drug policies have had on drug use. Its unambiguous conclusion, he says, was that \u201chowever harsh your measures \u2013 the death penalty, 20 years in prison \u2013 they have no impact on drug use\u201d. Instead of wasting our time trying to reduce drug use, argues Woods, \u201cdrug policy should be about reducing not drug use, but drug harm\u201d.</p> <p>The second point, he continues, \u201cis that a burglary causes all sorts of devastation, so is wrong in itself. But the only reason why drugs are prohibited is because we made a decision.\u201d The impulse to temporarily alter one\u2019s mind is both natural and universal, and unless we think inebriation intrinsically immoral \u2013 in which case alcohol has to go, and probably coffee, too \u2013 to allow one method while banning another \u201cmakes no sense at all\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/24/war-on-drugs-40-years\">Nixon's 'war on drugs' began 40 years ago, and the battle is still raging</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following residential treatment for PTSD, Woods never returned to work.

Founded in the US, Leap hopes to emulate the success of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. \u201cI\u2019ve caused enormous harm and I think I\u2019m duty bound to try and put things right. I\u2019m also duty bound because I\u2019m in a unique position. With my experience and views, I have the opportunity to tell people, and there\u2019s only me that has my experience. I need to tell people. And people listen to me, because I\u2019m not a hippy. I was a police officer.\u201d</p> <p>Former friends in the force were immediately ordered to sever all contact with Woods, and although Leap receives Facebook friend requests and messages of support from serving officers \u201call the time\u201d, he accepts that, to his seniors, he is a traitor. To make matters worse, he has now written a memoir about his undercover career. <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1110612/good-cop-bad-war/\">Good Cop, Bad War</a> is a gripping expos\u00e9 of the disastrous reality of the drug war, which he hopes will help shift public opinion. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to write a memoir. I\u2019m an extreme introvert. But it\u2019s the best vehicle to get people to come with me on my journey, and realise what it was that made me come to the conclusions I did.\u201d</p> <p>Woods offers an analogy with the dramatic transformation in attitudes to homosexuality. \u201cThere was no particular revolution. Society just collectively thought: OK then, some people are gay. And then the laws changed. Well, things are changing rapidly with attitudes to drugs now.

  "<p>Much of England\u2019s best-loved wildlife remains in serious decline, according to the latest official assessment from the government. Birds and butterflies on farmland have continued their long term downward trend and 75% of over 200 \u201cpriority\u201d species across the country \u2013 including hedgehogs, dormice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/23/rare-dark-bordered-beauty-moth-faces-extinction-at-last-site-england-york\">moths</a> \u2013 are falling in number.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-natural-environment-indicators\">Natural Environment Indicators for England</a> also showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/15/englands-waters-to-remain-illegally-polluted-beyond-2021\">water quality has fallen</a> in the last five years, with just one in five rivers and lakes having high or good status, and the amount of time given by conservation volunteers has also fallen.</p> <p>However, the sustainability of fisheries has improved, as has the amount of carbon locked up in forests and litter in the seas has begun to decline. The indicators were established by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228842/8082.pdf\">Natural Environment white paper</a> in 2011, which said it would \u201cput right damage done in previous years\u201d by placing \u201cthe value of nature at the centre of the choices our nation must make\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis report paints a pretty grim picture of how our wildlife is faring in the countryside,\u201d said Sandra Bell, at Friends of the Earth. \u201cAdded to recent new evidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/high-pesticide-levels-on-oilseed-crops-harm-wild-bees-scientists-prove\">wild bees have been harmed by neonicotinoid pesticides</a>, it\u2019s clear that if we want to enjoy a thriving natural environment big changes are needed to our farming system. This must be a priority for the government as part of its Brexit strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher Price, at the CLA, which represents landowners, farmers and rural businesses, said: \u201cThis progress report is a tough read for all those who care about our countryside. As we prepare to exit the EU, it is clear that the new [farming and environment] policy must have greater ambition in how it supports farmers and land managers to deliver better environmental outcomes.\u201d On Thursday, a poll showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/25/british-wildlife-needs-new-laws-to-protect-it-post-brexit-poll-shows\">public strongly supports stronger post-Brexit environmental policies</a>.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which published the new report, said: \u201cWe have some of the most fantastic wildlife in the world and we are determined to protect our excellent natural resources.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are making good progress \u2013 over 100,000 hectares of habitat created or restored, targeted conservation increasing populations of once very scarce species, such as the cirl bunting, and schoolchildren helping to plant at least 10m new trees by the end of this parliament,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAlthough we have seen many clear successes, government cannot create a better natural environment alone \u2013 that is why we are working with businesses, farmers, land managers, and communities to achieve our shared ambition of better protecting our precious wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last five years, six of the 24 key indicators assessed were deteriorating and 10 showed little or no change, while eight were improving. Eighteen of the indicators were assessed over the longer term, 10 years or more, with seven deteriorating, 3 showing little or no change and eight improving.</p> <p>Farmland birds fell to the second lowest level ever recorded in 2014, the most recent year for which data was available, 56% lower than in 1970. Farmland butterflies reached their lowest point in 2012 and small increases in the next two years did not significantly alter the overall downward trend. Wintering water birds have also declined in the last five years.</p> <p>Christine Reid, at the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be positive about the state of our wildlife when reading these figures, which is why we need government to deliver a 25-year plan for the environment which can truly enable positive change.\u201d A comprehensive 25-year plan for the environment due to be published by the end of 2016 <a href=\"http://www.endsreport.com/article/53091/25-year-environment-plan-kicked-into-long-grass\">has been postponed by the Brexit vote</a>.</p> <p>Reid said: \u201cIt\u2019s about people power too. We saw the reaction when our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/17/forestry-sell-off-policy-u-turn\">public forests were at risk of being sold off</a> \u2013 people care about the environment \u2013 but it can take the threat of loss to motivate. So make a change now; create a wildlife habitat, help preserve a local conservation area or campaign for ancient woodland.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m sitting in the lobby of the Smyth Hotel in downtown Manhattan waiting for Roberto Dur\u00e1n, the man they call El Cholo, when I get a phone call from his assistant. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way,\u201d he says. \u201cJust to warn you, he\u2019s a little agitated.\u201d This is expected. Since May, Dur\u00e1n has been on a global press tour for Hands of Stone, a new biopic about the boxer\u2019s life and relationship with mentor Ray Arcel by Venezuelan director Jonathan Jakubowicz, which premiered at the Cannes film festival and had its New York premiere earlier this week. He is here with his wife of more than 45 years, Felicidad \u2018Fula\u2019 Iglesias, and his children and grandchildren.</p> <p>Minutes after he arrives Dur\u00e1n pleads with his assistant for some water. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, just give me one moment,\u201d he says in Spanish as he sits down. \u201cI\u2019ve been on my feet since last night.\u201d It\u2019s been a hectic ride for the 65-year-old retired fighter who speaks very little English, contending with the demands of a press junket alongside Robert De Niro, Usher and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, the Venezuelan actor who plays him in the movie. Once he finally settles, Dur\u00e1n\u2019s attention diverts once again as he keeps greeting his friends and family passing through the hotel lobby. His biggest concern is now an iPod he lost in his hotel room. \u201cAll my music is in that thing! We can\u2019t leave until I find it. It has 3,500 songs.\u201d </p> <p>Just as I\u2019m thinking the interview might take all day, it occurs to me that, even as a journalist, in order to get what you want from him you have to match his energy. You have to go in the ring with him. At this precise moment it becomes clear: he\u2019s never truly out of it. Dur\u00e1n is always fighting something.</p> <p>For Latinos, Dur\u00e1n is more than just an athlete or even a sporting legend. He is a mythological figure, a symbol who persists in Latin folklore decades after his fighting career because he represented the will and determination of a community who was fighting the social injustices of the times they were facing. Much like Ali stood up for the civil rights of the African-American movement in a segregated America, Dur\u00e1n was doing the same thing for the poor and underprivileged in Panama. The film, which alternates between Spanish and English, represents one of the rare chances where an American audience can witness a Hollywood movie where a Latino protagonist is not a crime lord or a drug kingpin. \u201cThis is an opportunity to change the Latino stereotype \u2013 we live in a world where you can call Latinos drug dealers and rapists and criminals and still have a chance at being president of the United States,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/harvey-weinstein-jabs-donald-trump-921932\">said Jakubowicz at the New York premiere</a>. \u201cThose are the stereotypes you see in American movies and TV shows, but now you\u2019re going to see a true legend: a Latino boxer who overcame all his demons and became an inspiration for an entire people.\u201d</p> <p>Roberto Dur\u00e1n Samaniego was born on 16 June 1951 in Guarar\u00e9, a four-hour drive south of Panama City, but was raised in El Chorrillo, a poor neighborhood on the water\u2019s edge in the capital and walking distance to the mouth to the Panama Canal. During Dur\u00e1n\u2019s childhood, tensions between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/06/story-cities-16-panama-canal-zone-history-us-run-divided-city\">the US and Panama were so hostile</a> that authorities decided to build a wall \u2013 sound familiar? \u2013 between the Canal Zone and the capital in order to alleviate the tumultuous relationship between Panamanian residents and Americans who lived and worked inside the zonal area. Dur\u00e1n, a poor kid from the streets, remembers having to break into the prohibited zone in order to get mangoes from the trees so he could sell them and feed his family. \u201cThe best fruit was on the other side, so I would use a pair of pliers, cut the fence and climb up the trees to get the mangoes.\u201d American soldiers, after noticing the eight-year-old breaking in, would fire shots of warning in the air to scare him away. \u201cThey knew we were kids so would only shoot blanks just to scare us.\u201d </p> <p>His mother, Clara, raised him and his siblings as his father, Margarito, a Mexican-American GI from Arizona who was stationed in Panama, left the family and returned to the states in 1954. After living almost his entire childhood without a father, it wasn\u2019t until 1976 in California when they would reunite. In a 1980 interview with the Evening Independent, Margarito Dur\u00e1n recalls the meeting. \u201cWe embraced,\u201d said Margarito. \u201cWe sat in a room at a hotel and it was no problem.\u201d Dur\u00e1n confirms the meeting and agrees it was an amicable encounter, but when I try to get him to talk more about his estranged father there is a sense of restraint, as if there is still a lot of resentment and pain still unresolved. He takes a photograph out of his wallet and shows it to me. It\u2019s a black and white image of a young Dur\u00e1n with his father from that hotel meeting. In the image, both men are hugging and smiling, as if all was forgotten in one frozen memory. \u201cThe only good thing that my father ever did,\u201d he says to me, \u201cwas that he once picked up a magazine and recognized who I was.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps this is where the fighter was born. Not in the streets where he had to clean shoes, or sell newspapers, or even at Neco de La Guardia gymnasium where he learned how to box thanks to Nestor \u2018Plomo\u2019 Espinosa, and later joined by the legendary Arcel, who made him world champion in four different weight classes. These are all vital pieces of the puzzle that created the fighter inside the ring, but the inner rage and the bull-like aggression he possessed, that is something that cannot be taught. It can only be experienced, and for Dur\u00e1n, it all began with his father. </p> <p>Dur\u00e1n is perhaps best known for the infamous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7aChC6U3Ks\">\u201cNo M\u00e1s\u201d rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980</a> after he\u2019d won their first meeting. Near the end of the eighth round Dur\u00e1n, clearly losing the fight, turns around and allegedly mutters the words, \u201cno more\u201d to the referee. There have been many pieces on the subject including a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0LxOwPwGdY\">30 for 30 documentary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/slip-the-jab/2014/jan/29/roberto-duran-sugar-ray-leonard-no-mas-conspiracies\">our own investigation</a>, and Dur\u00e1n himself, as he mentions in the ESPN doc, denies he ever said those words, but instead it was the ref, Octavio Meyran, who muttered them after Dur\u00e1n put his hands up and refused to fight. Either way, it was Manos de Piedra who was mentally beaten and stopped the fight, regardless whether the words were said or not. The movie also goes into detail, including the fact that he was in poor physical condition, had little time to make weight due to his ferocious appetite and that the fight was poorly scheduled between Don King and his promoter, the millionaire Carlos Eleta. </p> <p>Perhaps something that is more important and is often forgotten in the memory of the boxing fan is the close bond that Dur\u00e1n and Leonard have built since their bouts and how they became close friends. There was a beautiful moment at the New York premiere when right before the screening, Dur\u00e1n and Leonard embraced each other and the entire audience stood up and applauded. \u201cThis is something that people forget,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n. \u201cI never said \u2018no m\u00e1s\u2019 and me and Sugar are great friends.\u201d</p> <p>Dur\u00e1n wanted me to know that he was extremely proud of the film as it\u2019s a testament to how much people validate what he has done for the sport, but there are certain parts which he was less keen on. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the movie and Edgar Ramirez did a fantastic job. He\u2019s a great actor,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t always like the way they made me and my wife (powerfully played by Cuban-Spanish actress, Ana de Armas) look sometimes. There are scenes when she is smoking and drinking and she doesn\u2019t do either, she never has. Also, they often made me look like a womanizer and that I insulted Sugar\u2019s wife in front of her before our first fight. None of that happened.\u201d </p> <p>I asked the director Jonathan Jakubowicz about these concerns. \u201cFirst of all, there are stories about Jake La Motta and how he hated Raging Bull after seeing it for the first time, so if Dur\u00e1n\u2019s biggest problem with the movie is that Fula was smoking and drinking, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d jokes the 38-year-old director. \u201cBut to address the point, this movie is not just about Roberto Dur\u00e1n, it also examines Fula\u2019s story, specifically after that fight in New Orleans and how she had to deal with a depressed man, someone who didn\u2019t want to leave the house for three months or do anything. So it wasn\u2019t just Dur\u00e1n who was broken, it was also his wife. So for us, the smoking and drinking was a creative choice that was made because it showed the distance and depressed state that she was in at the time.\u201d </p> <p>Regarding the insults aimed at Leonard\u2019s wife which Dur\u00e1n categorically denies, Jakubowicz stands firm. \u201cListen, I want people to know that aside from a filmmaker I am also an investigative journalist and I interviewed Sugar Ray Leonard on this very subject. We talked about it on more than one occasion and every time he tells me this story you can see the anger building within him. I also talked to Angelo Dundee (Leonard\u2019s renowned trainer, who died in 2012) a few months before he sadly passed away and he also confirmed the story. I think Dur\u00e1n is perhaps repenting what happened and wishes to forget about it as it can\u2019t be easy to see your entire life \u2013 the good and the bad \u2013 on the big screen.\u201d</p> <p>We may never know the exact details of what happened nor we may truly be able to fully understand the complexities of a fighter who has been through so much both inside and out of the ring. One thing is for sure, Roberto Dur\u00e1n, the kid from the slums of Panama who became the greatest lightweight on the planet, has never been perfect as his temperament has always represented a double-edged sword, both his greatest ally and most dangerous enemy. \u201cDur\u00e1n is a man made of flesh and bones,\u201d says Jakubowicz. \u201cAnd all his demons are part of what made him a great boxer and in beating them is what specifically makes him a human being and a hero. And this is what Latin Americans need, we need someone who\u2019s made of flesh and bones, a hero who knows what it\u2019s like to also be imperfect. We need real heroes just like him.\u201d</p> <p>Just as we finish talking, Dur\u00e1n enters the room, elated because he has just found the famous iPod with 3,500 songs. \u2018You have no idea how happy I am to have found this,\u201d he tells us. \u201cDo you know how many songs it holds?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I do know, but I still want him to tell me. </p>",

Toby Vieira\u2019s voice in his first novel is fully formed: vivid and vigorous, laconic but chaotic.</p> <p>We are deep in Joseph Conrad territory, from the title namechecking his frequent narrator Charles Marlow, through the epigraph from <em>Lord Jim </em>(\u201cYou are so subtle, Marlow.\u201d \u201cWho? I?\u201d), to the postcolonial journey of the narrative. We follow the present-day journey of an unnamed accountant from Hull who has taken the opportunity to escape from his routine job with an Antwerp-based gem dealer. He is out for dinner with his employer\u2019s clients when a shady character called Goldhaven \u201csidles up like an old friend, all smiles\u201d, and asks our man to do a little job for him. Goldhaven wants him to go to Marlow\u2019s Landing, somewhere in the Caribbean, and collect \u201ca very, very big pink stone\u201d. His instant agreement is a mid-life cry. \u201cOnly suckers read Accountancy Today. Accountancy Today. Accountancy Tomorrow. And accountancy the day after that, and after that. Not if I can help it.\u201d</p> <p>And so he goes, upriver through \u201ccamouflage-coloured broth\u201d in a pirogue with a guide named Old Road, past \u201cbutterflies the size of paintings\u201d and insects with \u201ctiny jaws bearing saws and scalpels and drills\u201d. He is blithely unaware of his status as Goldhaven\u2019s \u201cdumbo idyot\u201d, the patsy in a paste scam, his desire for reckless adventure countering Old Road\u2019s warnings. \u201cThere\u2019s a bad man in Marlow\u2019s, he take your body and your soul, he tear you to bits.\u201d But they are all bad men in Marlow\u2019s Landing, each badder than the last, from Goldhaven to Russian thug Zog Shikzahl (who enters a room \u201cpreceded by a boom of bad vibrations\u201d) to the elusive Boss Macquarie.</p> <p>It\u2019s Goldhaven, \u201cthe Prince of Prices, the Lord of Last Laughs\u201d, who steals the show; he is given almost as much space, and much more authorial love, than our pale narrator. We see him dig deep into Africa (\u201cthat big generous bulge in the shape of an elephant\u2019s ear, the only continent worth looking at\u201d), glad-hand presidents, set up fake businesses. \u201cBoy would he like to get up close and cosy with these Angolans and their big shiny marbles.\u201d He is an exemplar of globalisation as modern colonial exploitation, a carrier of chaos. \u201cWars tend to happen with disproportionate frequency in places visited by Goldhaven. But so do outbreaks of Ebola, and endemic malaria, and structural illiteracy. Goldhaven has never knowingly started a war.\u201d In the new global economy, however, the balance of power is no longer stable, and the exploited may take revenge.</p> <p>The story flips from Goldhaven\u2019s past to our narrator\u2019s present, and from the Congo to the Caribbean. Like the tributaries we float down, it meanders; like the second-rate jewels palmed off on gullible characters, it is \u201cawash with inclusions\u201d. The impenetrability of the land, of the&#xa0;complex finances involved in Goldhaven\u2019s schemes, is reflected in the narrative. The voice holds it together. The outcome of the story may not be all that surprising, but the clash of the&#xa0;adventure and its zigzag structure makes it exhilarating. And the present- tense narrative, an increasingly common and derided choice in recent novels, is justified here because the unsuspecting narrator doesn\u2019t know what is going to happen until he tells us.</p> <p>Yet Goldhaven is not the only mysterious man in <em>Marlow\u2019s Landing</em>. Toby Vieira is equally shadowy, with little author information and no social media profiles; rarest of all, his book carries no dedication or acknowledgments. A modern miracle: he did it all by himself.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/marlow-s-landing.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Marlow\u2019s Landing</em></a> for \u00a310.65 (JM Originals, RRP \u00a312.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>We\u2019ve seen plenty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/04/london-tube-maps-underground-reimagined-alternative-in-pictures\">alternative maps</a> of the London Underground, from those plotting average rents by station, to those charting life expectancy at every stop. But what about sound? A group of musicians and sound artists have this week launched the <a href=\"http://citiesandmemory.com/thenextstation/\">first ever interactive \u201csound map\u201d of the London Underground</a>, capturing the shrieks, grinds and general patter of 55 tube stations across the capital.</p> <p>It\u2019s <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3895769.stm\">a noisy old world down there</a> \u2013 from the \u201cmind the gap\u201d announcements to Londoners\u2019 idiosyncratic curses and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/07/london.drugsandalcohol\">drunken late night conversations over illicit tinnies</a>. This is precisely what The Next Station project, the work of <a href=\"http://citiesandmemory.com/\">Cities and Memory</a> and <a href=\"http://www.soundsurvey.org.uk/\">The London Sound Survey</a>, spent three months earlier this year gathering. And as well as capturing the real-life aural experience, sound artists from around the world were then invited to remix and reimagine the field recordings and create an alternative sound map to complement the real one \u2013 you can <a href=\"http://citiesandmemory.com/thenextstation/\">listen to all of them in one interactive feature</a>.</p> <p>So why make a sound map of the places we would all rather spend as little time thinking about as possible? Stuart Fowkes, a sound artist and the project\u2019s creator, says London\u2019s underground noises are iconic: \u201cnot just nationally but on a global scale\u201d \u2013 for residents, tourists, and watchers of London-based films alike. The tube, Fowkes says, defines London in a way that public transport networks in other cities don\u2019t. </p> <p>Clicking through the sound map, you\u2019ll hear a surprising range of noises: a didgeridoo player at Stratford, someone offering free hugs at Brixton and a bagpipe busker at King\u2019s Cross \u2013 as well as all the announcements and clattering train noises that you\u2019d expect. \u201cYou might think that one underground station sounds much like another,\u201d says Fowkes, \u201cbut they\u2019re as characterful as pet dogs once you get to know them.\u201d King\u2019s Cross would be a yappy terrier, then. Brixton an affectionate labrador.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d921a56be08ce880abafc0add8c067d16e2e415f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d921a56be08ce880abafc0add8c067d16e2e415f/66_316_2028_1216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London tube map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London\u2019s tube stations: as \u2018characterful as pet dogs\u2019?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transport for London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And sound matters \u2013 what we hear every day on our commute is as much a part of our quotidian experience as our morning coffee. There\u2019s the impact loud noises can have on our ears, for one. An expert working in 2004 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3895769.stm\">recorded sound levels louder than a pneumatic drill</a> on parts of the tube \u2013 loud enough to damage the hearing. </p> <p>Then there\u2019s also the psychological impact of sound: though we might classify many of the noises on the tube as stressful, Fowkes insists they can be reassuring in their familiarity, keeping the whole system moving like clockwork: \u201cthe details like the intonation of the automated announcements communicate \u2018everything is well\u2019 to commuters subconsciously \u2026 the trundle of the escalators, the closing of the sliding doors are all as rhythmic as a heartbeat, and become part of Londoners\u2019 natural functions when they\u2019re underground.\u201d </p> <p>This idea of the importance of acoustic ecology is not new \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37315/biography\">R Murray Schafer</a>, considered the father of the debate around it, began talking about the (damaging) effects of sound, especially on people dwelling in the \u201csonic sewers\u201d he believed cities to be, back in the 1970s. \u201cNoises are the sounds we have learned to ignore,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/13/sounds-city-technology-urban-centres-peaceful\">he wrote.</a> So perhaps this focus on the tube\u2019s sounds will help Londoners occasionally listen, as well as simply hear, the underground aural landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b140e8d52d9fa1735c28e29ff23761e26d73b38b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b140e8d52d9fa1735c28e29ff23761e26d73b38b/0_253_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man shouts while boarding a central line train at Oxford Circus station on the night of the launch of the 24-hour tube service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man shouts while boarding a central line train at Oxford Circus station on the night of the launch of the 24-hour tube service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no blue plaque system for preserving important sounds\u201d, Fowkes says, even though \u201csounds change as much as visual cityscapes, and today\u2019s sounds are tomorrow\u2019s history.\u201d Perhaps it makes sense that we should be working to archive the soon-to-be-lost sounds of our cities.</p> <p>The remixed sounds on the London Underground sound map \u2013 added to \u201chelp people to appreciate how sound can form source material for some interesting art,\u201d Fowkes says \u2013 are intriguing, if a little high concept. With the field recording made at Piccadilly Circus, Swedish sound artist Anya Trybala has crafted a composition meant to be a meditation on Brexit. Composer and artist <a href=\"http://www.martinasmith.co.uk/about/\">Martin A. Smith</a> has reimagined Moorgate by mixing recordings the Northern line with the sound of cigales and church bells recorded in forests in Provence. </p> <p>And with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/20/london-night-tube-meet-people-travelled-first-night-sadiq-khan\">the tube now rumbling through the night into the early hours</a>, will we see this soundscape changing? \u201cFrom a field recording perspective, the night tube is really exciting,\u201d Fowkes says. He\u2019s planning to head out, recorder in hand, and capture some of these nocturnal tube sounds. Who wouldn\u2019t want to hear Londoners\u2019 late night, post-party deep and meaningfuls mixed over the sound of Proven\u00e7al cicadas?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/13/sounds-city-technology-urban-centres-peaceful\">What will our cities sound like in the future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cities and Memory is continuing to capture sounds, not just below ground, but also above ground in London and in other cities in 55 countries across the globe. Fowkes\u2019 ambition is to \u201chelp people appreciate the joy of the sounds that surround them every day.\u201d So maybe then we can stop grimacing at the shriek of the Victoria line as it passes through Pimlico?

  "<p>There has been a lot of hot air recently about the role of gas in Australia\u2019s future energy generation. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/19/gas-supplies-to-rise-and-secret-contracts-to-be-scrapped-under-coag-reform-plan\">last week\u2019s COAG meeting</a>, the overwhelming takeaway message from our newly minted energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, was that gas was good, not to mention vital for our future energy solution.</p> <p>For Frydenberg, gas is the key plank of Australia\u2019s solution to climate change: the low-carbon panacea that will help us meet our obligations under the Paris agreement. Indeed, he has so much faith in gas that he is applying pressure on Victoria to overturn its current moratorium on onshore drilling and give the industry a foothold in the Australian state with the highest population growth rate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/24/steve-wozniak-the-status-quo-doesnt-have-to-exist-we-can-come-up-with-solutions\">Steve Wozniak: The status quo doesn't have to exist. We can come up with solutions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This action would open up some of our most productive farmlands to a ravenous and destructive industry, and lock Australia into decades of dependence on fossil fuel energy when renewable energy is cheaper and more effective than ever.</p> <p>We have seen what gas has done in other parts of Australia and the US, where tap water becomes flammable, farmland is ruined and communities torn apart. As you can imagine, this is a move that is desperately unpopular with farmers, traditional owners and rural communities alike.</p> <p>So where does this new fervour for gas stem from? Especially from Frydenberg, who once loved coal so much, he called it good for humanity.</p> <p>As coal is seen as being increasingly toxic to the health of the planet \u2013 and communities \u2013 the gas industry sees a chance to capitalise in the new post-coal market. The role of coal in our future energy generation is facing challenges from other factors as well since the world agreed to step up on climate change in Paris in December.</p> <p>The share of renewable energy is growing in Australia and worldwide. Nationally, we have a plan for about 23% of all energy to be generated by renewables by 2020. This is the baseline, while states such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia have more ambitious goals on top of the national renewable energy target. The ACT is leading nationally with a plan for 100% renewable energy by 2020 and looks on track to achieve it.</p> <p>The increase of power coming from renewable sources means the manner in which energy and the grid interact has changed fundamentally \u2013 and will continue to do so. And this is helping to contribute to the end of coal power generation. If the wind suddenly stops blowing, or the sun stops shining and back-up power is needed, coal power plants take too long to fire up and fill the void: coal and renewables are not compatible.</p> <p>This is where gas feels it has an edge. Not only does it promote itself as a cleaner alternative, but it also has a much quicker response rate if power is suddenly needed. However, a recent report has suggested there may be difficulties in relying on gas. .</p> <p><a href=\"http://energy.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/2054132/SA_PRICES_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A recent report from the Melbourne Energy Institute</a> suggested that the Torrens Island power plant potentially gamed the South Australian market by deliberately withholding power until the last moment it was needed, and then charging massive amounts for it. If true, it was estimated power companies made upwards of $40m from this highly dubious practice, at the expense of South Australia power consumers.</p> <p>But by far the biggest argument against gas \u2013 along with the astounding damage it does to farmland and local communities in the process of extraction \u2013 is that more and more research is coming out to challenge the claim that gas is a cleaner option.</p> <p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coal-gas-seams-good-until-you-measure-the-methane-4490\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modelling conducted by the International Energy Agency</a> (IEA), shows that if the planet converted heavily to \u201cclean\u201d gas today, global temperatures would still rise by 3.5 degrees. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/25/the-grattan-institute-is-wrong-we-need-more-science-students-not-fewer\">The Grattan Institute is wrong. We need more science students, not fewer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If we raise the planet\u2019s temperature by 1.5 degrees, we can say goodbye to many of our Pacific neighbours, who would become a modern day Atlantis story. Raise it by 3.5 degrees and it doesn\u2019t bear listing here how horrific things will become. Suffice to say, the storms, droughts and extreme heatwaves we face today will pale in comparison.</p> <p>The social and political fallout from a world that is 2.5 degrees hotter than today\u2019s should be worrying to all of us. And yet that is the best case scenario if we give the gas industry a front-row seat in our energy mix.</p> <p>And I say \u201cbest case\u201d because the IEA\u2019s modelling doesn\u2019t factor in the gas industry\u2019s fugitive emissions. This is the methane pollution that leaks out of wells and pipelines at every stage of the production line. These leaked emissions are 105 times worse than CO2, which is why experts agree they cancel out any climate benefit gas may have been thought to offer.</p> <p>There is no accurate measurement of these emissions, so there is no way to know how much the industry is setting loose into the atmosphere \u2013 particularly in Australia where almost no independent studies have been carried out.</p> <p>Add that to the astounding startup and infrastructure costs of expanding the gas industry \u2013 the new plants and pipelines, not to mention cleaning it up to hopefully stop the fugitive emissions \u2013 and it quickly becomes apparent that the gas \u201csolution\u201d is a furphy our elected leaders are trying to hide behind to pretend business as usual is good enough on climate change. That somehow we can just switch from coal to gas, whack up a few wind turbines, and that is the problem solved.</p> <p>It just doesn\u2019t add up. Even the industry knows this \u2013 including Australia\u2019s largest power company and carbon emitter, AGL. The company is divesting many of its gas assets and has been calling on governments to work with the industry to come up with a coherent strategy to transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. </p> <p>Sadly Australia has lagged well behind other countries on the march to renewable energy \u2013 China has just passed 200GWs of solar and wind capacity and investment in countries such as the US, Germany, Denmark, Brazil, Canada and India has taken the share of the world\u2019s energy coming from renewable sources to 20% in 2015.</p> <p>The choice, quite genuinely, couldn\u2019t be clearer. Australia must join the rest of the world and start investing in the renewable energy systems we know will be required, and building them now. We simply can\u2019t afford to flirt with new gas infrastructure that the science says won\u2019t be able to run for even a third of its normal life.</p> <p>It\u2019s time our politicians stop their gas-is-good propaganda and instead roll up their sleeves, engage with the industry and start the difficult but necessary work of making our power systems transition to 100% renewable energy.</p>",
