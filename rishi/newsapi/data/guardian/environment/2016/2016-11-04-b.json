  "<p>I want to do something very simple this weekend to cut through the staging and the static in Canberra right now. I want to talk about what\u2019s happening rather than what people are saying.<br></p> <p>Over the next few weeks two things are likely to happen. The Turnbull government appears likely to unveil a deal that will allow some of the wretched souls detained in Nauru and Manus to finally be settled in other countries.</p> <p>Assuming no outbreak of extreme crazy (which is a big thing to assume in the current climate, I\u2019ll admit), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/australia-being-left-behind-by-global-momentum-on-climate-change\">it is also likely to ratify the agreement it signed up to in Paris last December</a>, the one that produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C.</p> <p>In normal political times, in that fantasy scenario where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull\">Malcolm Turnbull</a> won the July election resoundingly, banked his personal mandate and was permitted to act more or less consistently as the politician voters have seen in the past, these things could be just transacted and presented to the public on their merits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/31/could-a-mild-outbreak-of-humanity-be-behind-the-coalitions-cynical-new-asylum-politics\">Could a mild outbreak of humanity be behind the Coalition's cynical new asylum politics? | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Turnbull has two problems. The first is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party\">Labor</a> is within striking distance of government. When you can feel the hot breath of your opponent on your neck, the backroom wisdom in such circumstances tends to dictate that daily politics becomes about maximising the points of difference with your opponent. We can call this survivalist mantra \u2013 pick a fight, any fight.</p> <p>The second problem has been on full display since the prime minister failed to win the election in the convincing way he wanted to win. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/21/abbott-v-turnbull-pits-rightwingers-against-moderates-and-threatens-chaos\">Tony Abbott will play every point he thinks he can get away with</a>, and even some he can\u2019t get away with.

Nothing is straightforward.</p> <p>So instead of just producing these two developments, the third-country resettlement deal and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris agreement</a> ratification, as straightforward achievements, as statements of what kind of government the Turnbull government aspires to be \u2013 a government that won\u2019t tolerate offending a basic principle of liberalism by keeping people arbitrarily detained offshore when they\u2019ve committed no crime, and a government that knows we have to deal with the existential threat of climate change \u2013 they have to be presaged by bouts of extremism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/climate-change-australia-falling-behind-rest-of-world-on-emissions-cuts-says-report\">Climate change: Australia falling behind rest of world on emissions cuts, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hence the proposed bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/30/asylum-seekers-face-lifetime-ban-on-entering-australia-if-they-arrive-by-boat\">banning asylum seekers from ever setting foot in Australia for the remainder of their days</a>, because that will fire up the base, wrong foot your opponent and lull the Fox News Lite night shift on Sky News \u2013 just in case anyone had a transitory impulse to wonder if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton\">Peter Dutton</a> had suddenly gone soft \u2013 which could easily trigger an outbreak of cognitive dissonance from Ray Hadley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/18/scott-morrison-offended-by-hadleys-request-to-swear-on-bible-he-backed-abbott\">and then Dutton might have to find a Bible to swear on.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/malcolm-turnbull-says-labors-stance-on-renewable-energy-is-political-claptrap\">Then there\u2019s all the shouting about windfarms</a>, which makes absolutely no sense, given that Turnbull knows precisely what has to happen by way of transition to low-emission technologies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg\">Josh Frydenberg</a> is one of the brightest people in the parliament.</p> <p>Both of these characters know full well coal is on the way out, and Australia will need the much-maligned windfarms and the solar farms to decarbonise the grid in sufficient time to meet our international commitments, and to try to mitigate against the dangerous effects of climate change.</p> <p>Both were called out diplomatically, but comprehensively, on the political bollocks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/energy-security-not-about-locking-in-status-quo-says-chief-scientist?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet\">in a speech the chief scientist made on Thursday night.</a></p> <p>Turnbull and Frydenberg, and the renewables bull horn do make a bit more sense if we tumble to the fact the government has not yet ratified the Paris deal, and doubtless wants to be able to ratify the Paris deal with only the mildest tut-tut from the Quadrant corner, rather than the whole process triggering yet another bout of internal cage fighting within the Coalition about climate change and whether it\u2019s happening or not.</p> <p>Frydenberg and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, are going to the planned meeting of leaders in Marrakech, Morocco, which starts this week.</p> <p>This pow-wow has been convened to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions, which was the core of the Paris agreement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/sorry-shock-jocks-but-the-public-isnt-buying-into-a-renewable-energy-panic\">Sorry shock jocks but the public isn't buying into a renewable energy panic | Peter Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In no rational universe does the Australian government want to be in a position of going to that meeting and telling other countries we don\u2019t intend to ratify the Paris agreement, but nothing is done until it\u2019s done and the process isn\u2019t yet locked down with a cabinet ruling.</p> <p>Obviously, this whole play \u2013 \u201clook at those dreadful renewables and, oh look, here\u2019s the Paris agreement\u201d \u2013 is a lot more complicated than a simple game of bait and switch.</p> <p>But for a bit of light relief at the weekend, you could think of this as a drawing room comedy in which the lead character says, \u201cMy, aren\u2019t windfarms terrible, Rupert,\u201d while Rupert placidly signs another piece of paper guaranteeing a proliferation of windfarms into the future.</p> <p>Thanks, Rupert.

  "<p>Basking in the glow of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F20PyLcZVNU\" title=\"\">masterpiece match-winner</a> that was the talk of Europe this week, Mesut \u00d6zil made his way serenely, contentedly, back towards London. It seemed as if half of Bulgaria wanted a bit of him before he left. He gladly had time for everyone \u2013 finessing every photo, every signature, every word of appreciation with a special touch.</p> <p>It was not so long ago this particular player\u2019s body language was routinely picked apart. He was too languid. Too casual. Did not want to know. Wilted under pressure. All softness without the required substance. Too many big games passed him by ... but those criticisms have faded into the shadow of an emboldened talent who is relishing the spotlight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The \u00d6zil of today carries himself differently. The composure and confidence represents how he is enjoying the feeling of being centre stage. That is what is expected of him on Sunday, in the heat of the north London derby, where the early title credentials of both teams will undergo a particularly spicy examination. Tottenham have ruffled Arsenal at the Emirates in the last couple of seasons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/06/spurs-arsenal-alexis-sanchez-harry-kane-premier-league\" title=\"\">requiring late equalisers</a> from the home team to save face. It promises to be as frenetic and fierce as usual, which is not the stereotypical idea of \u00d6zil\u2019s favourite environment.</p> <p>Yet there is more obvious determination in him to want to influence games these days. \u201cHe pushes himself much more,\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger says. For a start he is much more muscular than the slender figure who arrived at Arsenal, discarded by Real Madrid, three years ago. It has been known for defenders to bounce off him this season, a far cry from the elegiac shrug he used to give when unsettled by some opposing hulk.</p> <p>His reinvention as a player who has added a striker\u2019s runs to his playmaking passes looks intriguingly transformative. \u00d6zil the goalscorer? Who would have thought it? Well, Wenger did. It took some time, and some encouragement but \u00d6zil\u2019s adjusted position, as a high 10 rather than a deep-lying creator, makes him an even more effective performer.</p> <p>\u201cI convinced him that he has it in his locker to score goals,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cHe was more focused on giving and looking. Today he understands he can have those qualities but as well be on the end of things. The timing of his runs is good. In training I noticed he is a very good finisher. When you have that in your locker you have to try to get it out. Slowly, he now realises that. Now he makes more runs to score goals. On top of that he has a fantastic attribute of a guy who is a good finisher \u2013 he is calm. You notice all the finishers are killers. That means they keep their nerve in front of goal and he has that.\u201d</p> <p>The old Dennis Bergkamp comparison has been aired recently. Wenger sees the similarities and is urging his current master of technique to do what it takes to earn the kind of status Bergkamp enjoyed at Arsenal. \u201cHe can be a legend if he commits,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cDennis Bergkamp committed for a long period, he played until he was 38. I wish we have 10 more years of \u00d6zil. To become a legend at the club you need to stay for a long time. If you stay two years you would not be a legend.\u201d</p> <p>Arsenal are doing their best on the contract front to secure an extension. \u201cWe work on it,\u201d Wenger said, accentuating the positive sign of how content \u00d6zil seems on and off the pitch. \u201cA player needs to meet his needs inside a club. It is difficult not to be happy in London and happiness that a player has when he plays comes out by his performance.\u201d</p> <p>It is typical of how \u00d6zil has come out of his shell that he is keen to be a face of the club more readily. In this weekend\u2019s buildup, he took part in a social media Q&amp;A session. The hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssistMeMesut?src=hash\" title=\"\">#AssistMeMesut</a> invited fans who needed some help with anything to ask Arsenal\u2019s No11. Some of the requests were unsurprisingly left-field. \u00d6zil filmed answers to a handful of questions, ranging from a Turkish restaurant <a href=\"http://https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/794278113073070080\" title=\"\">recommendation to relationship advice</a>. \u201cSo my friend,\u201d \u00d6zil told @theDjole, \u201cJust be nice to her, show her your qualities and I wish you all the best.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger remembers the day well when \u00d6zil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/mesut-ozil-arsenal-real-madrid\" title=\"\">arrived in a flurry of deadline day activity</a> in September 2013. \u201cIn fact on the day we signed him we played against Spurs,\u201d he says, breaking into a grin. \u201cWe won without him.\u201d It was a landmark signing for the club, at \u00a342m demolishing its transfer record.</p> <p>\u00d6zil has grown into life at Arsenal. Even for a player with his experience and the expectation that comes with such a high-impact signing, it was a slow burn. The efforts that have been a hallmark this season took some time to develop. Wenger acknowledges the Premier League was a bit of a culture shock for \u00d6zil. \u201cHe left some people sceptical \u2013 saying he didn\u2019t go too much into challenges or tough contact. [He punches his hand for emphasis.] He\u2019s a player who is more a guy whose strength is to get out of things but on the physical front I believe he\u2019s improved as well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/02/arsenal-spurs-derby-aaron-ramsey\">Arsenal in confident mood for Spurs derby showdown, says Aaron Ramsey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Wenger, the main difference between the \u00d6zil he signed and the one he will pick this weekend boils down to commitment. \u201cHe is 28, an age where he is more mature. The difference today is he focuses more on efficiency. When he arrived here he was more focused on playing. Today efficiency is more in his mind. Sometimes the trap for very talented players is it is easy for them. They know subconsciously they don\u2019t need to push themselves too hard to be efficient. It\u2019s so easy.\u201d</p> <p>The desire to push himself more is making a tangible difference to his game. \u00d6zil\u2019s increased runs, added to the indefatigable darts of Alexis S\u00e1nchez, make it that much more difficult for defenders to guard their area. Arsenal are less predictable and more punchy.</p> <p>Tottenham arrive at the Emirates as the league\u2019s dominant rearguard, with only five goals conceded, so Arsenal will need their front players to continue their lively form. S\u00e1nchez has scored eight, and \u00d6zil seven (Theo Walcott, who is hoping to return to fitness, also has eight and Olivier Giroud is trying to catch up), so Arsenal feel they have goals in them even against a resolute opponent.</p> <p>So has \u00d6zil changed enough to become the type of player determined to take a tough derby by the scruff of the neck? He excelled recently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 defeat of Chelsea</a>, and he will be expected to emulate that performance against Tottenham. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cOf course he can be dangerous but in big games there is always a lot of expectation from him. But I believe that depends more on the team performance. If the team performance is strong then \u00d6zil will always shine.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, touches down in Australia  for the first time since assuming the presidency, will human rights feature at all in the talks? Indonesian officials are already working overtime to control the agenda, with the defence minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu, warning Australia against \u201cinterfering in the West Papua issue\u201d and asking Australia to send a message to Pacific Island nations that support autonomy for Papuans. </p> <p>Ryamizard <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/jakarta-pressures-julie-bishop-on-papua/news-story/7558f2119d8ad1f800f1a45865ff4ea9\">told</a> an Australian journalist, with no apparent irony: \u201cThose countries better keep their mouths shut and mind their own business.

That insurgency has long been the excuse for significant military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including killings, torture, excessive or unnecessary use of force, and mistreatment of peaceful protesters.</p> <p>At least 37 Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful acts of free expression or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. All of this impunity is aided by reduced scrutiny of abuses as foreign journalists and human rights organisations face a half century-long restriction on visiting the province.</p> <p>Perhaps Indonesia feels especially confident in rallying Australian support, since it scored something of a coup in August with the Papua visit by the attorney general, George Brandis. He was the first Australian cabinet minister to <a href=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/ThirdQuarter/Visit-To-Papua-Province.aspx\">visit</a> Papua, and human rights were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/22/australia-continues-be-shamefully-silent-indonesias-human-rights-abuses\">glaringly absent</a> from all public statements he made about that visit.

Let\u2019s remember that Jokowi himself has previously called for <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/12/papuans-have-heard-jokowis-promises-president-listening\">greater respect for human rights in Papua</a> and for the Indonesian government to stop <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/05/jokowi-open-access-papua-foreign-journalists-int-l-organizations.html\">blocking foreign journalists and observers from visiting Papua</a>.</p> <p>Here\u2019s one suggestion that Turnbull could broach with Jokowi: if Indonesian officials are so keen to gain Australia\u2019s support on Papua, then why not allow a multi-party parliamentary delegation from Australia, accompanied by journalists, free access to visit the province? </p> <p>Australia\u2019s parliament has long had an interest in the region, with a Parliamentary Friends of West Papua group co-chaired by Jane Prentice MP and Senator Richard Di Natale. Such a visit, not a junket, should include a range of Australian politicians armed with expertise in trade, tourism, economic and social portfolios and include meetings with Papuan leaders, civil society, imprisoned activists and ordinary Papuans.</p> <p>In fact, when General Luhut Pandjaitan, then coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, visited Canberra in June he extended an invitation to the Australian government to visit Papua, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJfVIesb0k\">saying</a>, </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I ask also any member of the cabinet to join us to go there. We have nothing to hide. It is not the time to hide something. Let us work together to make it transparent. If you want to criticise Indonesia we are happy to receive that criticism. But please, give that criticism based on data, not rumour.</p> </blockquote> <p>A visit would help Australian politicians understand more about a region only a few hundred kilometres to our north that remains isolated and undeveloped. It would enable Australians to hear directly from Papuans about the issues affecting their lives \u2013 surely this is part of what Jokowi wants in trying to win the <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/10/21/papua-priority.html\">hearts and minds</a> of Papuans.</p> <p><em>Elaine Pearson is the Australia director at Human Rights Watch.</em></p>",

Russian ministry of defence footage showed warplanes taking off and landing on its deck. The Kuznetsov is carrying about 10 Sukhoi-33 and four Mig-29 fighter aircraft, as well as up to two dozen helicopters. Although the Su-33s have recently been adapted to drop bombs more accurately, the plane has never been used for ground attack. Only the Mig-29 is designed for that purpose.<br></p> <p> If the planes are used to bomb targets in Syria, it would mark the first time Russia has used its only aircraft carrier in combat. That lack of experience, however, may limit its usefulness. </p> <p> \u201cThere are very few carrier-trained pilots. In fact, there are more planes than pilots, and most of the planes on board are not made for ground attack.

It\u2019s posturing and secondarily adding capability in Syria.\u201d</p> <p> The visit of its flagship to the Mediterranean is also a morale-boosting demonstration of military capacity for the Russian navy, which has not played a significant role in the Ukraine or Syrian conflicts, but which is seen by Vladimir Putin as vital to Russian self-image as a global power. </p> <p> \u201cRussia\u2019s naval presence in the Mediterranean is as much about military posture and ability to project power beyond its region as much as the Syria campaign in general.

The ship has spent more time in port than at sea and will be out of action for several years for refurbishment from next year.</p> <p> It is accompanied by the Peter the Great, a massive battle cruiser, with a fearsome array of missiles, but which are designed to hit planes, ships and submarines rather than attack land targets. </p> <p> A more potent threat from the flotilla sent from Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet may have escorted the Kuznetsov under the surface. UK reports, quoting British government sources, say two nuclear-powered Akula-class and one diesel-powered Kilo-class submarine have been spotted trailing the battle group into the Mediterranean. </p> <p>At the same time as the Kuznetsov left Murmansk, two destroyers left Vladivostok, the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet. Those destroyers, the Bystry and the Admiral Tributs, are reported to be off the Gulf of Aden. Kofman said that they could be on call in case the Kuznetsov encounters engine trouble, \u201cpossibly a Plan B for nervous admirals\u201d. However, the Bystry, has the same unreliable propulsion system. </p> <p>The arrival of the Grigorovich and the Russian submarines armed with cruise missiles could add to the devastation being wreaked on eastern Aleppo, home to 275,000 people. However, if that was Russia\u2019s only aim, it could easily increase the number of planes it bases at Hmeimim air base, near Latakia. The flexing of naval muscle is about geopolitical image as much as military firepower, but it carries with it the risk of humiliation. The Russian naval base at Tartus is not equipped to host large ships like the Kuznetsov and there are no friendly naval bases nearby in case of breakdown.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dice roll,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cIf anything happens it will be a long tow back home.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 8 November 2016 to correct a misspelling of Admiral Grigorovich.<br></p>",

  "<p>Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state.</p> <p> The measure, known as <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Solar_Energy_Subsidies_and_Personal_Solar_Use,_Amendment_1_(2016)\">amendment 1</a>, has been criticized as \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America\u2019s sunshine state.</p> <p> The amendment would change Florida\u2019s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/the-solar-amendment/\">states</a> that the government should \u201censure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do\u201d.</p> <p> A group called <a href=\"https://smartsolarfl.org/\">Consumers for Smart Solar</a>, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida\u2019s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/06/debbie-dooley-tea-party-solar-energy-florida-environment\">The Tea Party leader taking a stand for solar energy: 'I will do what's right'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,\u201d said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. \u201cIt has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.\u201d</p> <p> Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already \u201cstunted\u201d in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. </p> <p> The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. </p> <p> Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of \u201ctrying to fool you\u201d into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d and an attempt to \u201cconstitutionalize the status quo\u201d.</p> <p> Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://polls.saintleo.edu/proposed-florida-constitutional-amendment-on-solar-power-facing-a-changed-landscape-among-voters-new-saint-leo-poll-finds/\">has recently plummeted</a> to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass.

Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions.</p> <p> The measure, called <a href=\"http://yeson732.org/\">I-732</a>, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington\u2019s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households.</p> <p> The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn\u2019t support I-732 because it \u201cdoes not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy\u201d, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income.</p> <p>The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state\u2019s revenue <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/oct/03/nations-first-carbon-tax-on-the-ballot-in-washingt/\">by $200m</a> a year.</p> <p>However, the measure does retain <a href=\"http://grist.org/election-2016/james-hansen-vs-naomi-klein-state-carbon-tax-splits-national-climate-hawks/?utm_campaign=daily-static&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=edit-daily\">some notable support</a>, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama.

  "<p>The US election matters as much to the world as it does to Americans. The overriding reason is that an immense and present danger hangs over multilateralism and the notion of a rules-based global order. A Donald Trump victory would immediately make the world more worrying and unsettled than it already is. The US may no longer be seen as the world hegemon, whether benign or threatening, but it is still the single most important power. Its behaviour has unique potential to either make solutions possible or to add to areas of chaos. A Trump presidency would be bad for the US and dangerous for the world. A vote for Hillary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it.</p> <p>Domestic politics and the clash of personalities have dominated this campaign. But the little that Mr Trump has said is enough to know where the foreign policy risks and promises lie in the 8 November vote. A Trump victory would severely damage US standing almost everywhere. His strongman antics are a liability, not an asset. They are as distressing as they are ridiculous. Believing a man-to-man approach with Vladimir Putin will instantly dissolve Russia\u2019s aggressive revisionism reflects more ignorance than it does bravado. Mrs Clinton has a reputation for a hawkish outlook, but this will be tempered by war-weary public opinion in the US. She recognises that in the 21st century, US power has more chances of attaining goals if it acts inclusively, and not with go-it-alone reckless tactics. She has already applied much of this as secretary of state \u2013 playing a key role in the historic deal with Iran, in pushing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-18/hillary-clinton-secretly-pushed-cuba-deal-for-years\">a new relationship with Cuba</a> and managing the complex US relationship with China. A Clinton presidency should rely on soft power in a smart way, a philosophy she touched upon in her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-dnc-transcript.html\">Democratic convention speech this summer</a>. She should pay close attention to climate change, development and working out fairer global trade arrangements. The US should also take the lead on international justice by signing up to the international criminal court \u2013 and Mrs Clinton has expressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/us-international-criminal-court\">\u201cgreat regret\u201d </a>about Washington\u2019s refusal to join.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5274f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2701797\"            data-video-name=\"Clinton: Trump's continual praise of Putin 'bizarre and astonishing' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d1895be4b013613fffb552\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/08/160908Hillary2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/08/clinton-trump-putin-video\">Clinton: Trump\u2019s continual praise of Putin \u2018bizarre and astonishing\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There are questions that Mrs Clinton\u2019s team, should they enter the White House, need to resolve. She\u2019s revealed precious little of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/17/hillary-clinton-supports-obama-keep-troops-in-afghanistan\">what she\u2019d do about Afghanistan</a>, a 14-year war that president Obama pledged to end, but that is still grinding on. If she sits behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/02/23/plan-to-close-guantanamo-bay/\">she will have to work out what to do with the</a> dozens of inmates remaining in Guantanamo Bay. When she talks of an intelligence surge, there are concerns<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/hillary-clinton-national-security-plan-isis-baghdadi\"> about what this means for the spying powers of the National Security Agency</a>. Mrs Clinton is a politician with the experience to tackle these matters. Mr Trump is not. He is more interested in pandering to dictators than in holding them accountable for crimes. He\u2019s spoken in favour of torture. His approach to trade is in line with his approach to immigration \u2013 the building of walls. He has portrayed global warming as a hoax. Mrs Clinton can be trusted with the nuclear button. Mr Trump cannot. A Trump presidency would be a leap into the unknown. His bigotry, his love of weapons, his impulsiveness and his America first-ism are all dangers. His victory would likely lead to more, not less, global confrontation.</p> <p>The most pressing issues are the burning crises of the Middle East. These will continue to hinder a US \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia. There are no easy answers here. Mrs Clinton may want to put as much emphasis on protecting civilians as on combating Isis \u2013 she has spoken of creating a no-fly zone in Syria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zones-russia-us-war\">a proposal that carries too much risk</a>. She will have to search for better leverage in the region; heftier diplomacy that perhaps includes coercion through sanctions.</p> <p>For Europe the stakes are high. Mrs Clinton is concerned about the old continent\u2019s prospects. Mr Trump plays on American isolationism \u2013 he supported Brexit and cares little for transatlantic security guarantees. Russian muscle-flexing means that, whoever becomes president, European nations can no longer rely on the US to do all the heavy lifting. Global governance is under increased strain. Geopolitical competition is rife. US leadership has a key role to play. Mrs Clinton helped turn the page on the disastrous George W Bush era. The diplomatic accomplishments of the past eight years should not be minimised. Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Obama could have anticipated the crises that befell them once they reached office. How a president reacts matters greatly. On this count alone Mrs Clinton deserves to be elected.</p>",
  "<p>After its success at mastering the ancient Asian boardgame of Go, DeepMind is planning to learn its next game \u2013 and it\u2019s about as different as it can possibly be.</p> <p>The London-based AI research firm, a subsidiary of Google, is teaming up with Californian gaming company Blizzard to take on the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.</p> <p>One of the most popular eSports in the world, StarCraft II meets many of the requirements for an interesting challenge for DeepMind to take on. Not only do the game\u2019s best players easily beat the top AI opponents, but it also introduces new domains for the DeepMind team to explore.</p> <p>Most importantly, StarCraft II is a game full of hidden information. Each player begins on opposite sides of a map, where they are tasked with building a base, training soldiers, and taking out their opponent. But they can only see the area directly around units, since the rest of the map is hidden in a \u201cfog of war\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPlayers must send units to scout unseen areas in order to gain information about their opponent, and then remember that information over a long period of time,\u201d DeepMind says in a blogpost. \u201cThis makes for an even more complex challenge as the environment becomes partially observable - an interesting contrast to perfect information games such as Chess or Go. And this is a real-time strategy game - both players are playing simultaneously, so every decision needs to be computed quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cAn agent that can play StarCraft will need to demonstrate effective use of memory, an ability to plan over a long time, and the capacity to adapt plans based on new information.\u201d</p> <p>The AI does have some innate advantages, however. One stat that top StarCraft players are ranked on is \u201cactions per minute\u201d (APM): essentially, the amount of times they click each minute. Lacking fingers, muscles, or the possibility of tendonitis, an AI can naturally outclick a human player, which could result in it winning not through strategic thinking but simply by reacting quicker. As a result, DeepMind will be capping the AI at what research scientist Oriol Vinyals describes as \u201chigh-level human\u201d speed. That also helps ensure the AI doesn\u2019t waste processing power making thousands of minor decisions a minute, and focuses it on the key points.</p> <p>Vinyals has long experience with StarCraft. In 2010, while an undergrad at UC Berkeley, he built an AI agent which could play the first game in the series better than any of the built-in AIs. But that bot was a simple scripted system, with each rule it followed lain down by hand, similar to how the best AIs played Go before DeepMind came along. In StarCraft II, as in Go, DeepMind wants to focus on machine learning, designing an AI that can teach itself to play the game.</p> <p>This time, the company\u2019s getting a helping hand from Blizzard, the developer behind StarCraft (as well as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Overwatch), and that help will filter down to any other AI researcher who wants to take on the same challenge. In the first quarter of 2017, Blizzard will be updating StarCraft II to introduce a new AI research environment to the game, offering an API that developers can use to pull out extra information from the game to teach their bots how to play.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iZlrBqDYPM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5iZlrBqDYPM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The end goal for DeepMind is still to build a computer that can play StarCraft the way a person can, by simply looking at the pixels on the screen and sending keyboard and mouse input to manipulate them. But in the short term, it\u2019s a lot easier for DeepMind to teach their system with a simplified view, that spits out low resolution images of the map and mini map, and breaks down the features into different layers, clearly showing detail such as terrain height, unit type, and health.</p> <p>The collaboration is a two-way street, with Blizzard hoping to use the findings to improve its own games. \u201cIs there a world where an AI can be more sophisticated, and maybe even tailored to the player?\u201d Blizzard\u2019s Chris Sigaty, executive producer of StarCraft II, said. \u201cCan we do coaching for an individual, based on how we teach the AI? There\u2019s a lot of speculation on our side about what this will mean, but we\u2019re sure it will help improve the game.\u201d</p> <p>But the aim isn\u2019t just to improve video games. Vinyals says that StarCraft II is a natural next step for the studio\u2019s eventual goal to use AI to solve real-world problems. The lack of perfect information, the realistic (for a certain definition of \u201crealistic\u201d) visuals, the requirement to develop memory and even a sort of imagination all are important skills for an AI trying to understand the real world. Games are a better way to understand the real world than the real world, he says. \u201cYou can run them fast, there\u2019s a clear score, or winning and losing. There\u2019s also a lot of signals we can get from the game, and it\u2019s refined by somebody else who thought it was an interesting challenge for humans to learn and master.\u201d</p> <p>When DeepMind turned its attention to Go, it had beaten the best AI players within a year, and the best human player within two. But neither Vinyals nor Sigaty are eager to stake their colours to the mast on how long it will take for AI to master StarCraft II. \u201cFrom a research standpoint, we might make great advances, but I think it\u2019s way too early to know whether we could beat the best,\u201d says Vinyals. </p> <p>Sigaty is slightly more confident. \u201cI stand by our pros. They\u2019re amazing to watch.\u201d</p>",

The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were&#xa0;an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, weren\u2019t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should&#xa0;be&#xa0;delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not&#xa0;unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way.</p> <p>Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they can\u2019t defend themselves. That\u2019s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so.</p> <p>The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer.</p> <p>They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our&#xa0;country.</p> <p>There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome \u2013 which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging.</p> <p>The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/04/labour-condemns-newspaper-attacks-on-judges-after-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">defend the judges</a>. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard.</p> <p>Truss\u2019s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn\u2019t care less about the constitution.</p>",

  "<p>In a previous life, I was the innovation manager of a division of a multinational consumer goods company. Now, I run an NGO dedicated to fighting hunger. Both organisations need innovation.<br></p> <p>I think civil society organisations can learn quite a bit from business, from its processes, its instruments, its focus on results. One such concept is \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d. I don\u2019t mean the panicky talk of making our NGO world redundant that\u2019s so fashionable in development circles these days. What I mean is something new that creates a new market, in our case a new type of impact. Think of how Southwest Airlines made air travel <a href=\"https://books.google.de/books?id=f8H4PMhK6AMC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=southwest+airlines+scott+anthony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rcZtJi_Qub&amp;sig=uybJfHiFPyw9L22IycZxXdPJB-s&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAiNn51PPPAhVGPhQKHa0UBgsQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=southwest%20airlines%20scott%20anthony&amp;f=false\">affordable to normal people</a>. None of the elements were new, but Southwest stripped the existing business model of flying down to the bare essentials of getting people from A to B. The concept of the low-cost airline was born, and a new market was created. The trick was not to focus on the perfect solution, but on the solution that was \u201cgood enough\u201d for the job at hand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/31/radical-thinking-reveals-the-secrets-of-making-change-happen\">Radical thinking reveals the secrets of making change happen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At my NGO Welthungerhilfe (one of Germany\u2019s biggest), we\u2019re using the same good enough approach. We have drilled boreholes and built wells for over 50 years now. As you would expect from a German organisation, our wells would make any engineer proud. They aren\u2019t always the cheapest, but they get the job done, and they last. But durability isn\u2019t always the main problem. Sometimes, the problem is that you simply can\u2019t ship in material from the outside. Or, if you do, you don\u2019t get spare parts easily if the well does need to be repaired. Or you need trained experts to do the maintenance. In these cases, sometimes there is indeed a better way. <br></p> <p>In our case the good enough solution was a driller and a water pump made solely of locally available material that we developed and scaled with our partner organisation EMAS: a plastic tube and valves, galvanised steel, glass marbles. Nothing fancy, nothing more. It\u2019s about minimal material investment and maximum output. At a fraction of the cost of a normal well (in fact, our well costs only 15% of a standard well), this opens up a new market for individual households as opposed to the communities who could afford wells before. It builds a new value chain for parts, assembly and maintenance in the region where the wells are being used. It is adapted to local standards, both financially and technology-wise. Yes, the well has limitations (it operates best in sandy soil), but where conditions are right, it\u2019s good enough. In fact, so good enough that in Bolivia alone, more than 50,000 wells were built. We talk about technology innovation a lot, and we often mean high-tech solutions. But sometimes, innovation can be decidedly low-tech, and our manual pump is a case in point.</p> <p>Another NGO taking the good enough approach is AFRIpads, a social enterprise based in Uganda. AFRIpads focuses on one very clear issue: the absence of sanitary hygiene for girls which leads to high drop-out rates at school. The normal solution would be to sell sanitary pads, but that is costly and impracticable in many hard to reach villages. AFRIpads found a new solution by going back to basics. They have created reusable sanitary pads manufactured locally in Uganda by women in a firm that operates as a social enterprise and channels proceeds back into the company. A standard pad may have been the technically perfect solution, but the reusable one was good enough. It created both a market and millions of opportunities for girls who would otherwise suffer from stigmatisation during their periods.</p> <p>About 90% of all innovations fail. Companies spend a lot of money to test and qualify, but the development world doesn\u2019t have those kinds of resources, and most donors like to fund ideas that are the least likely to fail. So, how can we improve the odds? Making a virtue out of necessity sometimes works best. If you eliminate \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d as an alternative, your chances of successful adoption increase. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/22/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-a-broken-water-pump\">How do you solve a problem like a broken water pump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here\u2019s how this worked for us in Sierra Leone. Welthungerhilfe had offered farmer field schools for a long time and with quite some success: we trained cocoa farmers to nurse, plant, harvest and market their produce. Then Ebola hit in 2011. Suddenly, gatherings of more than five people were forbidden. It could have been the end of our farmer field schools, but it forced us to think again. It forced us to go digital. We developed a digital farmer school for illiterate farmers that combined training with women empowerment, certification and market links. The result: costs per farmer decreased by 90%. A potential scaling up of this could reach millions of cocoa smallholder farmers in Africa. We have now reapplied the model in other countries. In Kenya, it formed the basis of an electronic marketplace for cattle \u2013 we call it \u201ceBay for cows\u201d. In Zimbabwe, the model was used to build a digital agriculture extension service.</p> <p>The lessons learned for innovation in the development sector? For me there are three: the first is that disruptive innovation, the one that creates new markets, is based on the concept of good enough. Rather than go for the perfect solution, go for the cost-effective, smarter, leaner one. The second lesson is that, in order to get traction and maximise the odds of success, it pays to look for real problems on the ground, build up from what already exists, and try to eliminate the business as usualoption as an alternative. And lastly, that business tools such as the notion of disruptive innovation can be really useful in a development context. They have been created to sell more soap. Let\u2019s use them to help us solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing social problems. Let\u2019s not leave the sharpest tools in the box to the capitalists. <br></p> <p>Dr. Till Wahnbaeck is the CEO of Welthungerhilfe.

Only the police showed any support.</p> <p>I had anxiety around public affection after that. I\u2019d have panic attacks on dates. So it was therapeutic for me to be publicly proposing with so much support. Saying that, as we got near the spot outside Hamleys on Regent Street where I&nbsp;knew Johnny would be, my nerves were something else. My body rushed with adrenaline.</p> <p>He saw me and waved excitedly; it\u2019s impossible not to be excited at Pride. An inspector stopped the parade. It was all done very precisely, very police-like. I walked towards Johnny. He had no idea. I couldn\u2019t see anything but him. I couldn\u2019t hear the crowd. I took my helmet off, so I\u2019d be able to see him when I was kneeling. I was trying not to rush it. The sergeant helping me beforehand had said, \u201cGo ahead. You\u2019ll be nervous, but don\u2019t rush it.\u201d I took Johnny\u2019s hand and got down on one knee. Then it clicked with him and it began to click with the crowd. I said: \u201cJonathan Sammons, will you marry me?\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd exploded. There was cheering and people started chanting, \u201cLove is love\u201d. I was aware I was still on duty, so there were limitations to what I could do. I was thinking, \u201cShould I kiss him?\u201d He\u2019d just agreed to marry me, which was a huge deal, so I just reacted and we kissed.</p> <p>Johnny\u2019s been instrumental in getting me comfortable with showing affection. My friends say, \u201cWhat\u2019s he done to you? You\u2019re holding hands in public. This isn\u2019t the Phil we know.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/14/leonard-cohen-baby-lucca-joy-barratt\">\u2018I started to bawl.

I had been told there wouldn\u2019t be any press, but there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jun/26/police-officer-proposes-to-boyfriend-at-londons-pride-parade-video\">a TV crew</a>, photographers and of course lots of people caught it on their phones.</p> <p>On the tube home, we heard people talking about it. A&nbsp;friend working with the Royal Ballet in Tokyo sent me a text saying we were on Japanese news. The UK papers went crazy. It was overwhelming.</p> <p>We can get a&nbsp;distorted view of life with all the horrible and tragic news stories. The reality is good things like this happen all the time. The backdrop of Brexit had some people worried that the UK was becoming less tolerant of our differences. But the positive reaction to the proposal shows the country is accepting and actually a really wonderful place, and we do celebrate diversity.</p> <p>We\u2019re getting married next year. It&nbsp;feels like a different life from where I was 10 years ago.</p> <p>\u2022 Are you in a notable photograph?

  "<p><strong>New York, NY, November 4, 2016</strong>: The <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab\">Guardian US mobile innovation lab</a> today announces the launch of the most dynamic 2016 presidential election results notifications that have ever been available through a news app, uniquely delivered directly to mobile lock screens for Guardian iOS and Android app users. </p> <p>The lab, working with the Guardian\u2019s in-house app development team, will bring real time updates not just to the web or within an app, but to the lock screen for the first time. The updating alert will deliver instantaneous, up-to-the-minute results with the latest Associated Press election data, automatically loaded directly to lock screens for Guardian app users who sign up. Readers will receive the latest information within one continuously updated notification, which will be always visible without additional taps, searches, or further access to a mobile app.<br></p> <p>Users will see the latest number of electoral votes won, how many states have been called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the top two candidates. The notifications will then allow users to open the alert and access a live data visualization of the results and have the option to tap through to the live blog or the full results pages.<br></p> <p><strong>Sarah Schmalbach, product manager for the Guardian US mobile innovation lab</strong>, comments: \u201cThis will be the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night results on mobile. We\u2019re the first to take advantage of this brand new mobile alert feature, that allows us to update the latest data straight on readers\u2019 lock screens. No news app, or any other mobile app, has said they\u2019ll be doing this on November 8th.\u201d<br></p> <p>The notifications for the presidential election build on the success of live data notifications tested as part of the mobile innovation lab\u2019s experiment during the UK referendum on EU membership in June 2016.<br></p> <p><strong>Sasha Koren, editor of the lab says</strong>: \u201cIn adapting the technology the lab has built, and by applying the lessons we learned during the Brexit experiment, our goal is to bring live results notifications to a larger stage and to serve a wider audience during the biggest news event of the year. By adopting these notifications formats, the Guardian is taking the opportunity both to innovate within news delivery and to bring US election results to mobile users in the most accessible way possible.\u201d<br></p> <p>US app users will be prompted to sign up for live results notification via an opt-in screen starting November 4th and the alerts will be available globally through the Guardian\u2019s app notification settings.

  "<p>There\u2019s a man in Colorado who, it\u2019s safe to say, is pretty irritated by the noise of aircraft approaching and leaving Denver airport, 30 miles from his house. How irritated, exactly? In 2015, he made 3,555 complaints out of 4,870 received by the airport, according to <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/publications/airport-noise-nimbyism\">a new research paper</a>. And he\u2019s not unique. Five people made 61% of the complaints about Portland airport, and in Washington, DC, \u201ctwo individuals at one residence\u201d clocked up 6,852 complaints in a year against Ronald Reagan Washington National airport. (About the noise, I mean. No word on how many complained about it being named after Reagan.)</p> <p>As an inveterate maker of official complaints myself, I confess to some admiration for these moaners. Yes, I know the adage that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly, while expecting different results. But there\u2019s a cosmic defiance here that I respect. The world may be enraging and absurd \u2013 yet at least someone has the self-respect to keep protesting against that fact.</p> <p>It won\u2019t make them happy, though. These findings illustrate how irritation and complaint are self-reinforcing: objecting to something you can\u2019t control brings a moment of catharsis, but mainly makes things worse, by increasing the attention you bring to the problem, which makes it more intrusive. You end up listening more acutely for the next noise and getting more irritated when it comes. It\u2019s stressful even when there\u2019s no noise, because you\u2019re on edge, waiting for the silence to be broken. No wonder a single complaint becomes hundreds: the complaining is nourishing the problem. This gets easier to see if you think about these minor irritations like a difficulty encountered in a relationship \u2013 in this case, between you and your environment. Railing against them is like falling out with your partner, then continuing, over and over, to pick further fights for the sake of it. And when has <em>that</em> ever helped?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/14/find-fun-least-expect-it-oliver-burkeman\">Find fun where you least expect it | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As so often, the Buddhists figured this out before most of us. The \u201cfirst noble truth\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/buddhism\">Buddhism</a> is often translated as \u201clife is suffering\u201d, but that\u2019s a&#xa0;bit melodramatic; it implies constant agony, when for most of us that\u2019s thankfully rare. The word in question, dukkha, means something closer to <a href=\"http://www.leighb.com/bummer.htm\">\u201cunsatisfactoriness\u201d</a>. Life can be wonderful, awful or somewhere in between, but there\u2019s always an undertow of not-quite-right-ness: either what\u2019s happening is unpleasant, or it\u2019s pleasant but you know it must end. The aircraft noise complainer is mired deep in dukkha, unhappy when a plane is passing, and unhappy when one isn\u2019t, because the silence can\u2019t last. <a href=\"http://www.lionsroar.com/the-myth-of-permanence/\">One big Buddhist insight</a> is that this dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t arise from our circumstances themselves, but from the way we try to attain happiness, by lining up our circumstances just right, then keeping them fixed in place for good. It\u2019s a quest that\u2019s doomed to fail, since nothing lasts. Planes come, planes go, and you\u2019re happy to the extent that you don\u2019t mind that fact. Though I think the Buddha did make an exception for that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5h411OcttA\">\u201cjaunty whistle\u201d Samsung ringtone</a>.

  "<p>The Daily Mirror was famous for promoting women journalists, such as Marje Proops and Felicity Green. Less well known, but just as significant, was Doreen Spooner, reputed to be the first female photographer to have a staff job on a popular paper.</p> <p>Now 88, and almost 30 years after retiring from the Mirror, she has just written her autobiography, Camera Girl (an ironic choice of title, as will become clear).*</p> <p>She tells of her various assignments, which included a variety of hard news stories, features portraits and fashion shoots. </p> <p>Spooner was as much at home taking pictures in Northern Ireland during the troubles as she was snapping scantily clad models in the studio.</p> <p>Newspapers were in her blood: her father, Len, was art editor of the Daily Herald. After a college course and a brief spell with a photo agency, she joined the Mirror in 1949 and soon after won an award for her portrait of playwright George Bernard Shaw at his garden gate. </p> <p>She left to freelance, first in America and then in Paris. She met and married another photographer, Pierre Vandeputte-Manevy, had three children and returned to London in the late 1950s. </p> <p>Marital difficulties, exacerbated by financial problems, persuaded Spooner to go back to work and she regained her Mirror position.</p> <p>It was in the summer of 1963, during the Profumo affair, that she landed her first front page scoop, a candid shot of Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies in a pub before they gave evidence in the trial of Stephen Ward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"80cefb32ef609065ea8f53651a9640543702518a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80cefb32ef609065ea8f53651a9640543702518a/1_0_853_1066/800.png\" alt=\"Spooner\u2019s scoop: 23 July, 1963.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spooner\u2019s scoop: 23 July, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DAILY MIRROR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She managed to get off just one shot before she realised the landlord had spotted her.

I\u2019d got the contrast of personalities\u201d.</p> <p>Spooner was also relieved that the byline no longer said, as it had when she first joined the paper, \u201cby Camera Girl Doreen Spooner\u201d. She said: \u201cThat was a bloody cheek. I think they thought it endearing, but I wasn\u2019t having it\u201d.</p> <p>She also talked of male-dominated Fleet Street being \u201cTestosterone Alley\u201d, saying \u201cI like to think I played a small part in changing attitudes \u2013 never waving a feminist flag, just by getting on with my job...</p> <p>\u201cThe excitement was intoxicating. I loved the buzz involved in creating a paper and getting it out to every corner of Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Among those jobs was coverage of the miners\u2019 strike, the Greenham Common protests and the Zeebrugge disaster in 1987 when the car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, capsized, killing 193 people.<br></p> <p>Spooner took pictures of \u201cpoor traumatised people, lying in their hospital beds, poleaxed by the horror that had befallen them\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ed68900814fdbb3801b53ccfa043d6c39c41fb9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed68900814fdbb3801b53ccfa043d6c39c41fb9a/0_45_342_428/342.png\" alt=\".\" width=\"342\" height=\"428\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirror Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is, naturally enough, happier to recall less stressful assignments in which she took photos of celebrities.

  "<p>When the world\u2019s nations sit down to talk nowadays, there is a distinct difference to the way diplomacy is done. Influence is no longer defined only by special relationships and old alliances, but which WhatsApp group you are invited into.<br></p> <p>The rise of WhatsApp diplomacy is transforming the negotiating chamber. There are countless groups of allies and virtual huddles, exchanges over policy statements and fine print, and fair amounts of banter and even emojis (Vladimir Putin is referred to by widespread use of a grey alien avatar).<br></p> <p>\u201cYou can form small groups of like-minded allies, take photos of annotated documents, ask people what they think without the whole room knowing,\u201d a senior western diplomat said. </p> <p>The tool is useful for communicating with allies who might not be sitting close to them, diplomats say, as well as for agreeing negotiating tactics during difficult sessions and for organising break-out huddles in a way that avoids offending those left out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"042dcfcef9c29a7ab8682ae1d8f6c16be11dc0c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/042dcfcef9c29a7ab8682ae1d8f6c16be11dc0c3/1076_0_2260_1569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"diplomacy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51d1463827caccb59e00300564b709ab1d1a05e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51d1463827caccb59e00300564b709ab1d1a05e6/0_0_720_600/500.png\" alt=\"diplomacy\" width=\"500\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">...and his emoji</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Whatsapp/Android</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One notable recent example of WhatsApp summitry occurred at last month\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/15/hfc-greenhouse-gases-emissions-coolant\">breakthrough talks in Kigali, Rwanda, about banning HFCs</a>. At these talks the instant messaging tool owned by Facebook was used widely to coordinate meetings, discuss strategy during talks and drum up support for different policy positions, said a consultant who was present.</p> <p>The adviser said the kinds of exchanges included: \u201cLet\u2019s meet outside to talk about x,\u201d or \u201cMake sure you interrupt now,\u201d or \u201cSpeak at the plenary in support of x.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might have a country making a proposition and then there\u2019ll be another opposing proposition, so you\u2019d line up your allies on WhatsApp to say \u2018make sure you express your view\u2019 so there\u2019s a lot of support. And if there are a lot of voices in favour of a proposition it can get through.\u201d</p> <p>The consultant first started seeing WhatsApp used at high-level diplomatic events two years ago but said that recently she has seen more diplomats and lobbyists using it, because of the availability of Wi-Fi and the app\u2019s convenience.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave the room to have a chat \u2018outside\u2019,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cIt allows some discretion if you don\u2019t have to be seen grouping in a corner.\u201d</p> <p>Used by a billion people worldwide, WhatsApp is tailor-made for modern diplomacy. It is as fast and intuitive as texting while the group feature, by which several users can share messages, allows for the formation of fluid informal alliances.

Furthermore a lot of business in these international settings is done inside large buildings with deep basements where there is no mobile phone reception but strong Wi-Fi signals, favouring WhatsApp over texting. </p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/internal-report-slams-culture-in-uk-foreign-office\">internal report</a> at the UK\u2019s Foreign Office this year found that rather than make use of specially tailored government encryption, many British diplomats use WhatsApp to discuss sensitive issues.</p> <p>There is a WhatsApp group for British diplomats working around the world on Syria issues, for example.</p> <p>\u201cEven 10 years ago the standard form of diplomatic lobbying would often start with a <em>note verbale</em>, a heavily scripted and formulaic diplomatic message sent from an embassy to a foreign ministry,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Tom Fletcher, a former British ambassador to Lebanon. </p> <p>\u201cThe ambassador would then wait for the response, and follow up with a meeting or occasionally a telephone call. Now, all of that can be short circuited by text message \u2013 or, more favoured by diplomats as it is seen as more secure \u2013 WhatsApp. </p> <p>\u201cMost of my day-to-day communication with Lebanese leaders was done in this way. Of course there is no substitute for the rapport and trust built up by face-to-face encounters. But a huge amount of diplomacy can now be handled in this way, and any ambassador who doesn\u2019t have the ability to WhatsApp key ministers will quickly fall behind.\u201d</p> <p>Fletcher, the author of Naked Diplomacy, that calls for a new generation of \u201cdigital interventionists\u201d abroad, added: \u201cThe smartphone is now as essential a part of the modern diplomat\u2019s armoury as courage, patience and a strong stomach. But it is also a threat to the diplomat \u2013 heaven forbid that leaders should start WhatsApping each other direct, without needing to go through their diplomatic envoys.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The challenge with text is people read into what\u2019s not there, and miss what is there</p> <footer> <cite>Jon Alterman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you are sitting around a table, negotiating a document, you are not necessarily going to be sitting next to like-minded countries.

The reason that bones, teeth and shells (and for that matter wood) are common as fossils is that they decay only very slowly. Carnivores and scavengers don\u2019t tend to eat bones (and if they do, the bones might still survive the process) and bacteria don\u2019t break them down effectively. As a result, they can hang around for decades or centuries and have greater opportunities to be buried and potentially turn into a fossil. Soft tissues tend instead to be eaten so would need to be buried soon after the animal died in order to have a chance to be fossilised (and even here the bacteria or fungi may get to them).

People of colour, in their thousands, confidently walked through the corridors and display rooms of a museum established to <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/g/great-exhibition/\" title=\"\">show off the booty of empire</a>. For once we could gather in such a space and view it not as a diminishment of our value, but rather a celebration of our worth.</p> <p>As part of the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/friday-late\" title=\"\">The V&amp;A\u2019s Friday Late programme</a>, the collective treated visitors to contemporary work being made by young people of colour. For the editor-in-chief and founder of gal-dem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/liv-little\" title=\"\">Liv Little</a>, the collective \u201cwanted to fill this space with a spread of work that is reflective of different lived experiences \u2026 with art forms that are not static but instead interactive.\u201d Work that is, in short, \u201cnever seen in traditional museum and gallery spaces\u201d. You could listen to the young women spearheading grime music in the grand entrance, or twerk to empowerment in the lecture theatre, or immerse yourself through dance in the culture of queer and trans women of colour, or listen to discussion on how we manage careers in arts, music and politics.</p> <p>By the museum\u2019s own estimation, more than 4,000 people turned up to take up space both as a celebration and an act of resistance. The majority of them being people of colour because here was art for us, by us. We strolled through exuding a sense of triumph and satisfaction that comes with taking what is rightfully yours.</p> <p>A day after gal-dem\u2019s historic takeover, Museum Detox, a group of BAME museum workers, <a href=\"https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/02112016-bame-museum-workers-conduct-flash-mob-at-museum-of-london\" title=\"\">staged a flashmob</a> at the Museum of London.

Collectives like gal-dem are evidence of that. \u201cOutsider art\u201d is now accessible on digital platforms such as Instagram and emerging artists are finding innovative ways of showcasing their work.

Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP and OGCI chairman, said: \u201cWe all absolutely realise the world will move to a low-carbon world. Don\u2019t worry, we got it. The technology to monitor and reduce fugitive methane [gas] emissions, that is an essential licence for us to advocate for natural gas.\u201d </p> \n<p>Dudley, whose own pay is higher than BP\u2019s contributions to the fund, said gas produced half the emissions of coal, the use of which is increasing in Asia. \u201cThe price of coal is low and people are choosing affordable energy not clean energy.

Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/fed-cut-interest-rates-recession-negative-inflation-targets\">Fed will have little room to cut interest rates if recession hits</a></p> <h2>The rise of the political meme</h2> <p>These shareable, sometimes pithy and often puerile units of culture have emerged as the lingua franca of the 2016 election, and have given the American people an entirely new way of articulating their beliefs.

  "<p>If you use Facebook, or Twitter, have a Wi-Fi connection, watch television or have been to an office Halloween party, you\u2019ve probably encountered them: internet memes. </p> <p>These shareable, sometimes pithy and often puerile units of culture have emerged as the lingua franca of the 2016 election, and have given the American people an entirely new way of articulating their beliefs.

Through memes, Ted Cruz was \u201cunmasked\u201d as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/09/ted-cruz-zodiac-killer-meme\">Zodiac killer</a>. Jeb Bush\u2019s limp plea for applause got him <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/iJrvE0H1e2h\">Vined</a> into oblivion. Bernie Sanders shared a moment with a bird that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ILProgNet/status/713538359713357824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">blossomed</a> into something out of Walt Disney\u2019s long-lost Marxist phase.</p> <p>Memes can be fun, or they can be dumb \u2013 but as an emerging medium, they haven\u2019t provoked a lot of debate or analysis. In fact, they seem to defy scrutiny.</p> <p>And slowly, before anyone can even take note, memes are ruining democracy.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0281b947d2e3173aed5e44f62f38e6c6c83b36b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0281b947d2e3173aed5e44f62f38e6c6c83b36b/0_0_598_605/494.jpg\" alt=\"A meme presenting Ted Cruz as the Zodiac Killer.\" width=\"494\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meme presenting Ted Cruz as the Zodiac killer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Faust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Memes \u2013 from the Greek for \u201cthat which is imitated\u201d \u2013 were once defined as being self-replicating units of culture. This included anything that could be learned, remembered and spread from one brain to another, such as the concept of god all the way to the popular Budweiser \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDTZCgsZGeA\">Wazzup</a>\u201d catchphrase.</p> <p>Through the internet, the idea moved from the conceptual sphere into the viscous reality of data and pixels, transforming it into something more traceable: a segment of media that is copied rapidly. This includes images, text, video, a combination of all three and sometimes real-world actions.</p> <p>Political memes have always existed. Recall Ronald Reagan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/20/255819681/the-truth-behind-the-lies-of-the-original-welfare-queen\">Welfare Queen</a> or Howard Dean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0\">euphoric howl</a>. And of course, more recently, we had <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Yes+We+Can&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLj-Kr6ozQAhVijlQKHdPkAq4QsAQIPg&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=674\">Yes We Can</a>. </p> <p>What\u2019s novel here is an inversion of control \u2013 political memes are no longer rare flashes of uncensored personality or intensely manicured visual messages. They are now born from the swamps of the internet in real time, distributed from the bottom up. They have grown into a form of anarchic folk propaganda, ranging from tolerable epigrams to glittering hate-soaked image macros akin to a million little rogue Pravdas.</p> <p>Like me, you probably have more than a few Facebook friends who make it their life\u2019s work to circulate political memes in hopes of influencing how you see the world. They are our deadbeat uncles, former co-workers and long-forgotten high school acquaintances. They are agents of nowhere, apparatchiks of nothing in particular. And through the raw power of mass replication, even their most insipid ideas are able to surface from below. By typing some text on an image and sharing it with friends, they too have a voice capable of reaching a critical mass.</p> <p>The reason why it is now possible for Darryl from Accounting who hates \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d to have the same communicative power as a television network is down to the DNA of the medium: speed and lack of gatekeepers. Memes thrive on a lack of information \u2013 the faster you can grasp the point, the higher the chance it will spread. </p> <p>They also favor extreme perspectives: a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285414041_Impact_of_status_and_meme_content_on_spread_of_memes_in_virtual_communities\">recent study</a> from Texas University found that individuals who are socially isolated and more likely to be characterized as \u201con the fringe\u201d have a greater chance at creating a successful meme.</p> <p>In order to grasp why this is so significant, we need to go back to the last time we were making similarly grandiose proclamations about how the internet changed everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ILProgNet/status/713538359713357824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FeelTheBird?src=hash\">#FeelTheBird</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BirdieSanders?src=hash\">#BirdieSanders</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BheazM1KSv\">pic.twitter.com/BheazM1KSv</a></p>&mdash; ILProgressiveNetwork (@ILProgNet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ILProgNet/status/713538359713357824\">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Picture yourself in the year 2010. </p> <p>The possibility of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series is as depressingly remote as ever. Barack Obama still has that new car smell and is being hailed as the first \u201cinternet president\u201d. The world is awash in a fresh wave of tech-centric optimism and the Middle East\u2019s Twitter revolts have yet to burn to a cinder.</p> <p>It was a more innocent time, when Uber and AirBnB were still known as Ubercab and Airbed and Breakfast and neither had been blamed for homelessness, unemployment and the wholesale destruction of the working class yet.</p> <p>I was a staff writer at Adbusters Magazine at the time \u2013 a radical, anti-consumerist magazine based out of Vancouver, British Columbia, that bills itself as the journal of the mental environment and got famous off their 1990s \u201csubvertisements\u201d.</p> <p>The art director, a few graphic designers and myself would often spend long nights in the office drinking beer and churning out content to fill the spaces that would be traditionally used for advertisements. We created memes, but not just any memes \u2013 political ones meant to trigger paradigm shifts that would upend the prevailing logic of late capitalism, such as this one:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/533ea821b0ebaa4fe609b20102e9319c4f565c09/0_0_915_1232/743.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters memes\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We called it \u201cmeme warfare\u201d, a term that was originally coined by social change activist Andrew Boyd. </p> <p>\u201cSocial movements cannot live by meme alone. Yet memes are clearly powerful \u2013both analytically and operationally,\u201d Boyd wrote in his essay <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://andrewboyd.com/truth-is-a-virus-meme-warfare-and-the-billionaires-for-bush-or-gore/\">Truth is a Virus: Meme warfare and the billionaires for Bush (or Gore)</a>. \u201cA vital movement requires a hot and happening meme. Truth is a virus whose aim is to subvert the corporate mememachine with a sly guerrilla war of signs.\u201d</p> <p>Much of what we produced was mischievous, maybe even poignant, much of it verged on self-satire but most of it was strictly for the LOLs; in-jokes to keep the blood pumping through those long and sedentary pizza-filled production nights. But every once in a while, the Adbusters office turned out something that proved to be profoundly effective. </p> <p>For instance, the <a href=\"http://pismowidok.org/index.php/one/article/viewFile/162/290/2088\">black and white image</a> of a ballerina gracefully perched atop the charging bull of Wall Street, while masked figures charged forward from the background. \u201cBring tent\u201d, it read underneath, alongside the now famous hashtag that sparked the Occupy movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b6ba602941927fee2355ac206af8148fac3b90/0_0_1000_1515/660.jpg\" alt=\"Adbusters meme\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Back in 2010, the idea of using memes to political ends was still housed within a fairly slim leftist-activist corridor \u2013 it was a tool that seemed entirely of our own creation, and entirely under our control. We viewed memes as a vehicle through which activists could speak truth to power \u2013 they were molotov Jpegs to be thrown at corporate hegemony\u2019s bulletproof limousine.</p> <p>Never in our most ironic dreams did we the think that the spirit of our tired, lager-fueled pisstakes would end up leading to a resurgence of white nationalism and make the prospect of a fascist America faintly realistic.</p> <p>But the internet is weird like that. It takes things and twists them.</p> <p>At their most basic, meme warfare presented an opportunity for individuals to seize control of the means of media production from corporate interests. It was a viral and open-source medium that would allow individuals to compete for attention against the all-consuming hydra of advertising, marketing and public relations. </p> <p>This line of thinking was, in retrospect, breathtakingly naive. It assumed that the act of meme generation by a non-corporate entity would be innately good. Like many instances of the tech-centric idealism, it would unravel in spectacular fashion. It\u2019s not that anti-corporate activists were wrong about how the internet could be leveraged to change politics \u2013 it\u2019s that they were terribly right.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a straight, causal line connecting the Occupy movement and its many slogans with the neo-Nazi image macros that have been frogmarched out of 4chan to spread hate across the internet in support of Donald Trump. But they share some conceptual DNA. They are both indebted to Guy Debord and the Situationists, specifically the practice of <em tabindex=\"-1\"><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement\">d\u00e9tournement</a></em>: hijacking expressions of the capitalist system and its media culture against itself. They both also share a deep cynicism about the mainstream media. But this is where the similarities end.</p> <p>When appropriated by the emerging alt-right, memes become a different weapon. They <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/05/04/meme-magic-donald-trump-internets-revenge-lazy-entitled-elites/\">call it \u201cmeme magic\u201d</a> \u2013 a phenomenon which has helped vocalize and activate the more extreme wings of the Trump base and introduce white nationalism to a new generation of disaffected nerds. Meme magic is almost identical to meme warfare in that it attempts to use shareable images and ideas in an effort to engender real political change. </p> <p>To date, their most effective memes have been those questioning Hillary Clinton\u2019s health status. Google image search \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Zombie+Hillary&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzgu_j8YzQAhXHDJAKHR1ZCkUQ_AUICigD&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=674\">Zombie Hillary</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Hillary+Short+Circuit&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXsuuJ8ozQAhXLF5AKHWukBoQQ_AUICigD&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=674\">Hillary Short Circuit</a>\u201d and you\u2019ll be treated to a series of imagery made up of equal parts blood and robotics.</p> <p>As explained by Andrew Anglin, publisher of The Daily Stormer, a faux-contrarian neo-Nazi blog, meme magic \u201ccomprises not only an attempt, but a successful attempt, to formulate a new culture for ourselves, separate from the mainstream culture, which is largely the result of Jewish social imperialism\u201d.</p> <p>In a post-truth landscape where distrust of the media has gone mainstream, nickel-and-dime propagandists like Anglin are able to resonate with an audience because they trade in the allure of dark fantasies that appeal to alienated young white men.</p> <p>When the activist left decried corporate control over media, its strongest arguments leaned heavy on well-plodded reasoning. Noam Chomsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent\">Manufacturing Consent </a>instantly comes to mind, in which he painstakingly examines the New York Times\u2019 coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.</p> <p>The alt-right, on the other hand, is far less interested in thoughtful critiques and far more concerned with control. This mirrors the classic left/right divide of analysis versus action. While the left is typically comfortable with endlessly analyzing what\u2019s wrong with the reality, the right seeks to impose their own reality, currently existing reality be damned.</p> <p>Traditionally, mass media have provided a protective membrane between the public and overly toxic ideas. The mass effect of this delivered a relatively standardized view of politics and world events. For a number of reasons \u2013 a decades-long lowering of journalistic standards, the deterministic effect of ratings and clicks, and the generalized paranoia created by the internet, to name a few \u2013 this membrane has broken down.</p> <p>The recent #draftourdaughters meme provides an instructional example.</p> <p>On 16 May of this year, Hillary Clinton<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/hillary-clinton-women-draft-register-224390\"> voiced support</a> for legislation that would require women to register for the draft. This was largely received as a rare instance a bipartisan support for a purely symbolic gesture, aimed at promoting gender equality in the military.</p> <p>For a maverick like Ted Cruz, it was a chance for him to put on his daddy hat, lambasting the bill because it would \u201cforcibly conscript young girls into combat\u201d. To the paranoiac mind it fed into a conspiracy theory that the next world war is imminent. For the alt-right, it was a perfect opportunity to launch a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59uczc/draftourdaughters_is_weapons_grade_persuasion/\">weapons-grade persuasion</a>\u201d campaign.</p> <p>The result has been a series of <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/157933/will-hillary-draft-women-inside-draft-our-daughters-a-fake-ad-campaign-from-the-alt-right#.WKMo62xuY\">widely shared fake campaign ads </a>meant to promote the idea that Hillary wanted to send young women to their deaths in a war against Russia. The imagery had a distinctly feminist flavour, with slogans like \u201cHe died for his country. Now, it\u2019s her turn\u201d and \u201cMen make up 97% of combat deaths. It\u2019s time to end the combat gap.\u201d</p> <p>Those orchestrating the campaign instructed their followers to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59uczc/draftourdaughters_is_weapons_grade_persuasion/\">\u201cRemind folks when they say it\u2019s fake \u2026 It\u2019s real\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeneralTsoTofu/status/791978959739166720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WithHer?src=hash\">#WithHer</a>? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DraftourDaughters?src=hash\">#DraftourDaughters</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vk1EXMx560\">pic.twitter.com/vk1EXMx560</a></p>&mdash; Deplorable Tso Tofu (@GeneralTsoTofu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeneralTsoTofu/status/791978959739166720\">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Perhaps this is all a just a garbage mirage brought about by this election cycle\u2019s hate-bubble. But regardless of their long-term viability as a fringe pantomime, those meme creators are at the vanguard of a broad directional trend, and seem to be exploiting it with some measure of success.</p> <p>Irrespective of your personal political leanings, for anyone who thinks sensible dialogue is a critical component to a functioning democracy, there is a large problem to solve here. </p> <p>In his 1946 essay Politics and the English language, which scrutinized the connection between ideology and the proliferation of empty language, George Orwell said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Political language \u2013 and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists \u2013 is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.</p> </blockquote> <p>We face a similar challenge, albeit one that is punctuated with reaction gifs. If you look at the latest iOS keyboard update, complete with a massive repository of looping imagery, we can see how intimately memes have meshed with language, and how we face a far more daunting challenge than Orwell ever did.</p> <p>The tools we use to communicate are becoming counterproductive to actual communication. It\u2019s only getting easier to spread lies and respond with shrugs. The internet has become an endless theatre of virtual conflict, one in which we are all either willing or oblivious participants, and like it or not, it is on this battlefield that the nature of our reality will probably be decided.</p> <p>There\u2019s no clear answer to this dilemma save for one basic fact: those who value truth desperately need to find a way to make the truth more plausible.</p>",
  "<p>For as long as David Olusoga has been writing and broadcasting on black British history (almost two decades), he has received infuriated letters from the public. Nowadays, there are tweets too, which employ the same fulminating tone.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of people who say, \u2018I\u2019m sick of hearing about slavery\u2019, or \u2018black people are always talking about slavery\u2019. My response to them is \u2018Name a British plantation. Name a slave trader. Name a British slave ship.\u2019 Normally they can\u2019t, because we don\u2019t know that much about slavery. It\u2019s not a central part of our national story.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga\u2019s new book, <em>Black and British: A Forgotten History</em>, is not about slavery as such, but it is a radical reappraisal of the parameters of history, exposing lacunae in the nation\u2019s version of its past. Domestic history cannot be separated from the vast former empire building, he argues, which was inextricably bound to the economics of global slavery. Joining up history at home and abroad makes it harder to gloss over Britain\u2019s part in the slave trade.</p> <p>It also becomes harder to ignore the legion of black Britons who have lived on the Sceptred Isle since Roman times, rarely acknowledged in mainstream textbooks, but whose presence proves that there was never a \u201cyear zero\u201d or a lost idyll of ethnic purity to which modern day nativists can hark back. \u201cBlack history is a series of missing chapters from British history,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to put those bits back in.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga, 46, who started out at the BBC in 1998 as a researcher on Radio 4, is surely a \u201ccelebrity historian\u201d in the making. He arrives in the hotel lobby for this interview fresh from Delhi, on his way to Mexico, in a sharp suit and with luggage in tow. He has an easy eloquence that is made for TV, speaking in perfectly formed, modulated sentences. His second book, <em>The World\u2019s War</em>, won a Political Book award for <a href=\"https://www.politicos.co.uk/posts/political-book-awards-winners\">\u201cWorld War One Book of the Year\u201d</a> in 2015, no mean feat for a book published in the previous, centenary year (his first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/04/kaisers-holocaust-olugosa-erichsen-review\"><em>The Kaiser\u2019s Holocaust</em></a>, looked at Germany\u2019s colonial rule in Namibia). Meanwhile, his BBC2 series,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/23/britains-forgotten-slave-owners-review\"> <em>Britain\u2019s Forgotten Slave Owners</em></a>, earned a Bafta this year. Having just finished book three, he has put the next one (about the global history of slavery) on hold in order to co-present <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/27/civilisations-mary-beard-simon-schame-david-olusoga-television\"><em>Civilisations</em></a> alongside Simon Schama and Mary Beard. It is a 10-part remake of Kenneth Clark\u2019s landmark documentary series on the history of western art and thought, due on our screens next autumn.</p> <p>There has not been much sleep in the past four months, the time it took to write <em>Black and British,</em> in between filming the tie-in TV series. It was first conceived two years ago, when former BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow approached Olusoga. He could not have known then how the national climate would change. \u201cIs the TV series and book being delivered in the same country that it was commissioned for?\u201d he wonders. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d</p> <p>It is, he agrees, a fortuitously timed post-Brexit vote book. In it, Olusoga lists the flash points in modern black British history, from the unrest in 1919 when thousands in the country\u2019s ports targeted local non-white communities, to the Cable Street riots attacking black sailors in London\u2019s docklands, to the Notting Hill riots of 1958, and beyond. On each occasion, white communities turned on their black minority counterparts. Are we heading towards another flare-up of this kind? \u201cI think we have the strength and the resourcefulness to confront parts of our history that are difficult and painful, but there\u2019s also a dark side to British history and there was a flash of it this summer. We don\u2019t know how deep or how serious it is yet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b5ff6460948ddcb7b7da9060dea4dcf1eac6a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78b5ff6460948ddcb7b7da9060dea4dcf1eac6a9/0_141_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Olusoga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Olusoga meeting school children in Cumbria during filming for <em>Black and British: A Forgotten History</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change in tone, and chill in the air towards people of colour, has certainly been felt by him. \u201cI\u2019ve received tweets that I suspect people wouldn\u2019t have sent in 2015. Is that a changed country or is that people who are unpleasant feeling emboldened to speak? We don\u2019t know at the moment. As a historian, I always think you know what a moment was 20 years later.\u201d</p> <p>Olusoga was born in Lagos to a white British mother and a Nigerian father who met in Newcastle as students. His parents separated when he was two years old and his mother returned with him and his three siblings to her home<em> </em>town in the north-east, to work as a linguist. A mixed-race family was a rarity in Newcastle in the early 80s, and Olusoga felt under attack every day, at school, on the streets: \u201cPeople used to shout \u2018National Front\u2019 at us. And \u2018wogs out\u2019. It was routine, ubiquitous. There were men who would spit and shout. When we came out of school, we\u2019d go to the bus stop and if there wasn\u2019t a white person waiting, we\u2019d walk to the next one because we knew the buses wouldn\u2019t stop for black people. Sometimes we\u2019d end up walking all the way home.\u201d</p> <p>But one summer, when he was 14, the violence went off the scale. A brick was thrown into the family\u2019s home wrapped in a note telling them to go back to Africa. A police officer had to be stationed outside their door for protection, until the family was eventually rehoused. \u201cIt was the summer from hell,\u201d he says. \u201cAfterwards, I think we did that thing you do when you\u2019ve been through something together as a family \u2013 we stopped talking about it, because it was over, we\u2019d got through it.\u201d</p> <p>For this book, he opened up that conversation again and found some catharsis. It is heartening for him that his youngest siblings, born much later, can barely believe what it was like to be black and British then. \u201cAt my lowest moment, I wanted to leave the country. But it is no longer 1984. There has been too much integration. I was on a beach a few years ago, in the south of England, and I saw this guy who had bulldog tattoos, England flag tattoos \u2013 the sort of person I\u2019d be really frightened of as a child \u2013 and he was with this mixed-race child who was clearly his granddaughter. It was such an amazing sight.\u201d</p> <p>That summer didn\u2019t scar him, Olusoga reflects, because his was a strong, close family and his mother pushed them hard to succeed at school, and at life. They moved to another council estate (which appears briefly in the film <em>Get Carter</em> \u2013 \u201cI saw it many years later when I was a student, I was amazed to see Michael Caine wander past my bedroom window\u201d) and their lives returned to normality.</p> <p>He later realised how the study of world history could help him make sense of that personal experience. He had always loved \u201cgreat stories\u201d, but over the years history \u201cbegan to explain why things had happened to me and my family. It had answers. It made sense of the world and not just of my experiences but also why the north-east was the way it was, why those industries were there, why people felt the need to drive you out of your home, why some people could never accept the idea that I could be of this country, and be British.\u201d</p> <p>He went to Liverpool University and then to Leicester for a master\u2019s degree before rejecting the idea of a PhD \u2013 \u201cbecoming an academic, doing a PhD, felt to me like never leaving school\u201d. He joined the BBC instead, met his partner in the canteen (she is a producer at the Natural History Unit), and wound up in the job of his dreams.<strong> </strong>\u201cI only ever wanted to do history, and make documentaries.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Olusoga wants to do more than rehabilitate lost or forgotten individuals. \u201cI was trying to look at black British history beyond just biography,\u201d he says, arguing that historians in the past have focused on the lives of black \u201cheroes\u201d, who remain on the margins. These exhumed figures need to be incorporated into mainstream history.</p> <p>One excavation that resonates with him is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%27s_Column#/media/File:Nelson%27s_column_-_Death_of_Nelson_at_Trafalgar.JPG\">image of a black sailor</a>, on the south-facing bronze relief panel at the bottom of Nelson\u2019s column in Trafalgar Square. The panel shows Nelson mortally wounded and the sailor standing close by, musket in hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been there since the 1840s,\u201d says Olusoga. \u201cThink of all the things that have happened in Trafalgar Square since then \u2013 the mass union meetings, Keir Hardie\u2019s speech, the CND marches, the poll tax riots. He was there to witness all that history and he\u2019s there because he\u2019s a representation of a norm \u2013 black sailors in the British navy. I think about what he\u2019s witnessed, looking out at the changing world, watching Britain change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49bcf2fc83bfb27cc7dd4a0102c45eaf2320dd60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49bcf2fc83bfb27cc7dd4a0102c45eaf2320dd60/0_0_2979_4048/736.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Barber\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sketch of Francis Barber, a servant to Samuel Johnson, dating from around 1750</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is indelible proof for Olusoga \u2013 carved into a monument to heroic nationalism \u2013 that black Britons belong inside British history, not on its side-lines. There are other memorable figures, such as the third century\u2019s sub-Saharan African woman who grew up in East Sussex, and John Blanke, a trumpeter at Henry VIII\u2019s coronation. He hopes one day that TV dramas or documentaries on the court might incorporate, even incidentally, the black Tudors we know were there. As part of his TV series he places plaques in various locations to commemorate moments or figures in black British history, including a plaque at Bunce Island in Sierra Leone, which was used as a slave fortress, and in Samuel Johnson\u2019s home in honour of his Jamaican manservant, Francis Barber.</p> <p>The way that history is taught in schools and universities is telling half a story, Olusoga believes. What happened inside Britain cannot be separated from its global identity. \u201cWe were the biggest empire the world had ever seen. The idea that you can have a domestic history apart from it doesn\u2019t make sense. Take the industrial revolution: the stories about spinning jennys and water frames are all part of our heritage. But where does the cotton being spun in those machines come from? At school, we went to mills and factories and nobody at any point in my education pointed out that the cotton processed in those mills was made by enslaved black Americans. When we talk about the history of the industrial revolution, the missing people in that revolution are the 1.8 million enslaved people who made that cotton. It was our biggest export and almost all of it came from the American deep south.\u201d To fail to tell the story of these black Americans is, he thinks, \u201cto tell a lie\u201d.</p> <p>So should we talk about the historical guilt and shame of the coloniser and colonised, passed down through the generations? \u201cNo. I want to excise the words \u2018guilt\u2019 and \u2018shame\u2019 from the conversation. There is no one alive today who is a slave trader or a slave owner. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about people feeling guilt or shame. It\u2019s about acknowledgment, and it\u2019s about truth and reconciliation.

  "<p>For adults, the news can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/bad-news-media-misery\" title=\"\">be shocking</a>. But our life experience enables us to mentally file it away in the \u201cVery sad but doesn\u2019t affect me\u201d box or the \u201cNot this again!\u201d box.

We are surrounded by news. There are 24/7 news channels, radio, newspapers, the internet and smartphones (the average age <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2386527/Children-mobile-age-seven-Youngsters-phone-years-earlier-decade-ago.html\" title=\"\">kids get their first phone</a> is seven and a half). The world is at their fingertips. Even if you have done a great job of activating all the parental controls (and your tech-savvy offspring hasn\u2019t simply switched them off again), chances are that bad stuff in the news will be the talk of the playground.

A throwaway comment among adults in the car about how Donald Trump being elected as president could result in world war three, or that Brexit will bring Britain to its knees, could silently terrify those in the backseat for weeks.

  "<p>The Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, has said the whole country should be grateful that Mark Carney is staying on as governor until 2019.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Broadbent also said the pound could rebound if the economy continued to surprise on the positive side. </p> <p>Carney ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/mark-carney-may-announce-decision-to-quit-thursday-bank-of-england\">speculation</a> about his future earlier this week by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">agreeing to stay on</a> until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. This means he will serve an extra year, but that is still two years short of a full eight-year term.</p> <p>Broadbent said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy that the current governor is staying. I think the whole country should be grateful that he is.\u201d</p> <p>When asked whether he would like to be the Bank\u2019s next governor \u2013 Paddy Power is offering odds of 7-4 on this happening \u2013 Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist, said: \u201cHe [Carney] is staying on another almost three years. That is far too far away for me to think about what I\u2019m going to be doing then ... I haven\u2019t even thought about it.\u201d</p> <p>His comments came the day after the central bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">lifted its growth forecasts and warned households to expect a sharp rise in inflation</a> next year as the weak pound pushes up the cost of imports. It hinted that further interest rate cuts were unlikely because the economy has held up better than expected since the referendum, with consumer spending particularly strong.</p> <p>Broadbent said: \u201cIt is apparent that financial markets have taken one view and implicitly so far at least households so far have taken another. We don\u2019t know who is more right because we don\u2019t yet know how this process [Brexit] will unfold. </p> <p>\u201cPresumably at some point there will be something of a reconciliation and if it turns out better than financial markets are currently expecting for the economy over the longer run then you\u2019d expect to see the currency bounce back.\u201d <br></p> <p>He rejected criticism from the Brexit camp that the Bank was out of touch with the real economy. \u201cIt\u2019s always the case that we have to revise our view as news comes in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe widened our fan charts [growth and inflation predictions] in August following the result of the referendum precisely because of the more uncertain environment we are now confronted with.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank has come under heavy criticism recently, including from the prime minister, who at the Conservative party conference criticised the \u201cbad side effects\u201d of ultra-low interest rates and the Bank\u2019s money creation programme.</p> <p>Broadbent responded: \u201cWe live in a democracy. People can comment on the way all our policies are conducted. It is our job to be open and transparent about what we do. For our part we\u2019re just focused on our job. We have a remit given to us by parliament and we look at all the economic evidence and as economists regarding that remit we take the best possible decision we can at any point in time.\u201d</p>",

The key risk to the investment case following the downgrades in August to 2016 forecasts are margin expectations from Generics that have disappointed since the acquisition of Roxane, which completed in early 2016.</p> <p>A third quarter update is expected next week and in the short term, a reduction to group revenue expectations for 2016 would be a disappointment, but in the absence of competition for Glycopyrrolate, view this as unlikely. A further reduction in margins for generics in 2016 is entirely possible, although we would argue this is now in the price.</p> <p>We take a more cautious stance on Generic margins into 2017, and reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 13% to 136c (consensus 156c). We see third quarter results on 10th November and the \u201cMeet the Management\u201d event on 15th November as the catalysts for a re-rating.

  "<p>Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has announced that work on the Clyde to build a new generation of warships will start next summer after months of delay.</p> <p>He is due to visit BAe Systems\u2019 shipyard at Govan on Friday to confirm that cutting steel for the first of eight Type 26 global combat ships will begin in summer 2017, guaranteeing a 20-year long programme for the yard.</p> <p>In an advance statement, Fallon said: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s commitment today will secure hundreds of high-skilled shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde for at least two decades and hundreds more in the supply chain across Britain.\u201d</p> <p>His announcement follows heated disputes over the future of the frigate contract after defence trade unions and Scottish political leaders complained about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/clyde-shipworkers-glasgow-fear-for-jobs-mod-contracts-delays\">long delays and cuts in the size of the programme</a>.</p> <p>The multibillion pound project was a major bargaining chip in the 2014 independence referendum. The anti-independence campaign warned it would be lost, in effect ending shipbuilding on the Clyde and closing one of the city\u2019s largest employers, if Scotland left the UK. </p> <p>David Cameron, the then prime minister, said the contract was evidence of a valuable union dividend, with thousands of Scottish jobs secured by UK military spending. The UK government promised a programme of 13 vessels, with work due to start this year. </p> <p>In the event, Glasgow still voted yes to independence and the continuing delays and uncertainties over the Type 26 contract has continued to fuel complaints from nationalists and yes campaigners.</p> <p>With a second independence referendum again high on the agenda after Scottish voters opted to remain in the EU, David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the contract was proof of the merits of staying in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cThe UK government is backing jobs on the Clyde and in its shipyards \u2013 and this investment is only possible because of the broad shoulders of our strong UK defence budget,\u201d Mundell said.</p> <p>Unions welcomed Fallon\u2019s announcement, but warned there were still significant doubts about the future of a second defence shipyard at Rosyth in Fife, and the uncertainty about a proposed Type 21 warship being built on the Clyde.</p> <p>Gary Smith, of the GMB union, said Fallon\u2019s announcement was \u201cfantastic news for the upper Clyde\u201d. A study for the union by economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute found 6,000 jobs relied on shipbuilding at BAe, which in turn supported \u00a3163m in wages in the area.</p> <p>\u201cFrom that perspective, it\u2019s great news,\u201d he told BBC Radio Scotland. \u201cThe truth is that the government hasn\u2019t delivered on all of its promises. We were told that there would be a \u2018frigate factory\u2019 on the Clyde.\u201d </p> <p>But Fallon had not delivered on all those promises, Smith said. \u201cMichael Fallon was dragged kicking and screaming to make this announcement today after we exposed that the government was planning to move some of the work down south.\u201d he added.</p> <p>The MoD should guarantee that Rosyth and other UK yards were awarded a contract to build three new Royal Navy support vessels. Construction of a current contract for support ships being built in Korea was hit by delays and cost overruns, Smith said.</p> <p>The defence secretary said the Govan yard was also being awarded work on two far smaller offshore patrol vessels and was favourite to win the contract to build new, lighter Type 21 vessels that would give the navy a larger fleet than it now had. </p> <p>The results of a national shipbuilding review to decide on the Type 21 programme was due to be announced by Sir John Parker with this autumn\u2019s Treasury spending statement later this month. </p> <p>\u201cBAe will be in pole position [for that contract]. They\u2019re the principal warship builder,\u201d Fallon told BBC Radio Scotland. \u201cNobody is short-changing the Clyde. This is a huge moment for the Clyde today. On the contrary, we\u2019re confirming we\u2019re going ahead with the steel cut next summer, and quite a bit earlier than some had suggested, of the first of the eight Type 26s that we pledged in the strategic defence review last year.\u201d</p> <p>BAe Systems said Fallon\u2019s announcement gave the company the confidence to intensify efforts to sell the Type 26 to foreign buyers, including the Canadian and Australian navies. The company did not say that meant they would be built in the UK. <br></p>",
  "<p>The significance of the Paris agreement coming into force today is easy to miss: it may seem like an anti-climax, given the travails that led up to its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">signing last December</a>.</p> <p>But the moment is of huge importance. This is the first time that a legally-binding agreement, signed by all of the world\u2019s functioning governments, has laid down a commitment to limit the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with the goal of preventing global warming exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels. </p> <p>This figure was not plucked out of the increasingly carbon-rich air. It is the limit of what scientists regard as safety, beyond which climate change will run out of control, unstoppable in its damaging effects.</p> <p>There are caveats. The Paris agreement is legally binding in forcing governments to accept and cater for the 2C limit. But the commitments on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with that goal are not legally binding. This means incoming governments can renege upon them. There are no sanctions for governments that flout the goals.</p> <p>The outcome of the US presidential election will be key. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate whose polling has improved markedly in recent days, has vowed to cancel the US\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement. Russia has also failed to ratify the agreement, along with several other nations. China has ratified, but if US participation is not forthcoming under a future Trump government, that may be off.</p> <p>So while the agreement should be hailed as a massive and historic step forward in international efforts to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, it is potentially fragile.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the signs of danger are growing increasingly strong. This year is almost certain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/2016-locked-into-being-hottest-year-on-record-nasa-says\">according to Nasa</a>, to be the warmest on record, following last year\u2019s record-setting temperatures. This gives the lie to the claims of warming-dismissers that the upward march of global temperatures has \u201cpaused\u201d.</p> <p>Next year may not set records, but the trend is clear. We are on a trajectory that may lead to warming that is unprecedented and potentially irreversible. While there are other encouraging signs - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">the growth in renewable energy use around the world</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/01/global-carbon-intensity-falls-as-coal-use-declines\">small reductions in emissions in some major economies</a> - we should be in no doubt.

  "<p>A daughter of revolution born to a new world father and an old world mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.art\">Flora Tristan</a> had little power in early 19th-century France. Women\u2019s rights remained limited, and as a teenager Flora was pressured into marrying a Montmartre artisan with whom she suffered a life of \u201cendless torture\u201d. But in 1825, Flora left her husband and exerted her independence: she travelled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/peru\">Peru</a>, wrote feminist pamphlets, and while visiting Britain sneaked into the House of Commons dressed as a Turkish man. Her \u201caudacity\u201d outraged her ex-husband, who kidnapped their child and shot Flora on a Parisian street in 1838. She survived, but died of typhoid in 1844. Her most enduring essay connected women\u2019s rights and socialism, and exhorted the oppressed to unite: \u201cUnion,\u201d she wrote, \u201ccreates power.\u201d</p> <p>In his sweeping new history of Europe between 1815 and 1914, Richard Evans does not seek to offer a new \u201cgrand narrative\u201d, but instead traces a unifying thread. Nineteenth-century Europeans sought power above all else: over themselves, over each other, over nature and even over the wider world. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\">the previous volume in the Penguin History of Europe</a> detailed the 18th-century\u2019s \u201cpursuit of glory\u201d, it was the pursuit of power in its many forms that permeated European society between the defeat of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/napoleon-bonaparte\">Napoleon</a> and the outbreak of the first world war.</p> <p>Tristan\u2019s struggles for power illustrate this age of contradictions, her life playing out between revolution and reaction, freedom and oppression, scientific advance and premature death. To some it was a period of enormous progress and improvement, the birth of \u201cmodernity\u201d; to others it was a time of repression, imperialism and destructive industrialisation, setting the scene for the 20th century\u2019s descent into hell.</p> <p>It is a vast story, but Evans uses individual narratives to open his chapters, reminding us of the \u201chuman dimension\u201d and allowing \u201ccontemporaries to speak for themselves\u201d. Alongside Tristan is the German stonemason and soldier <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Walter\">Jakob Walter</a>, tossed across Europe by Napoleon\u2019s wars, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/emmeline-pankhurst\">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, whose militant activism and abusive punishment embodied a mass politics tottering between violence and democracy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While many cultural shifts were situated in towns and cities, Evans reminds us that most Europeans were still peasants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Evans is particularly skilful in charting the continent\u2019s political development from the <a href=\"http://historyrevived.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/blood-and-iron-1848-european-spring.html\">\u201cEuropean Spring\u201d of 1848</a> to the tinderbox of 1914, connecting it with cultural and social changes. While many of the political and cultural shifts were situated in the expanding towns and cities, Evans reminds us that most Europeans were still peasants, and are too often absent in our histories of the century.</p> <p>Some of his most interesting characters come from this hidden world. The Russian Savvy Purlevsky went from illiterate peasant to successful city bar manager via an extraordinary adventure featuring river-rafting escapes and self-castrating religious sects. The Viennese aristocrat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermynia_Zur_M%C3%BChlen\">Hermynia zur M\u00fchlen</a> was so shocked by the poverty of her Baltic landowner husband\u2019s peasant tenants that she allowed them to steal food from the estate. (She also defiantly played \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d at the piano, and handled her husband\u2019s conservative newspaper only with fire tongs.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e429ee44e58fb5f50691eda3ea4781396339c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e429ee44e58fb5f50691eda3ea4781396339c79/0_0_2399_2548/942.jpg\" alt=\"Buffalo and artillery cross the Zand river during the second Boer war.\" width=\"942\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buffalo and artillery cross the Zand river during the second Boer war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The emancipation of such oppressed people \u2013 serfs, peasants, religious minorities \u2013 was the century\u2019s central social transformation. Tens of millions gained power over their own lives. Yet freedom was \u201conly ever partial and conditional\u201d: some peasants were still paying compensation to their former masters well into the 1900s, rural dependency gave way to the inequalities of industrial wage labour, and women remained deprived of power. The wife of even the most oppressed man, Tristan wrote, was still \u201cthe proletarian of the proletariat\u201d.</p> <p>There were revolutions, too, in industry and work, and Evans persuasively emphasises the spread of human power over nature. Technology helped Europeans tame the wild, blacken the skies, shrink distance and even make time by disciplining society to the standardised clock. Plague and famine were increasingly banished, but again the march of science and industry was not without contradictions: the century still saw millions die of hunger (not least in misruled Ireland and Russia), and disease stalked the cramped and desperate urban poor. Still, by 1914, Europeans were living far longer, healthier, wealthier lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Evans\u2019s indictment of imperialism is scathing. 'Violence lay at the heart of the British empire,' he points out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such progress was inextricably tied to the continent\u2019s pursuit of global power. Evans\u2019s indictment of imperialism is both scathing and authoritative. \u201cViolence lay at the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">British empire</a>,\u201d he points out, and wider European hegemony was established and maintained through killing: hundreds of thousands died in the French conquest of Algeria and the German repression of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanganyika\">Tanganyika</a>, while the Belgian exploitation of the Congo was particularly brutal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1901/sep/26/mainsection.fromthearchive\">The Boer wars</a> began with the British governor of <a href=\"http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/capecolony.htm\">Cape Colony</a> calling for the \u201cextermination\u201d of the Xhosa people, and ended with tens of thousands of Boer civilians in British concentration camps. British rule in India brought \u201cdisaster\u201d for the population, exacerbating famines in which millions died.</p> <p>Evans is clear that ideas about racial superiority were central to the imperial project: in 1895, the secretary of state for the colonies called the British \u201cthe greatest governing race the world has ever seen\u201d, while schoolbooks described the \u201csubject\u201d peoples as \u201cugly\u201d, \u201cfilthy\u201d and \u201csavage\u201d. The white man\u2019s empires were a burden on the colonised, Evans writes, not the other way round.</p> <p>Europeans, however, imagined a future of imperial domination and \u201copen-ended improvement\u201d, ignoring the warnings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/05/why-we-still-dont-know-what-to-make-of-kipling\">Rudyard Kipling</a>\u2019s 1897 poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/46780\">\u201cRecessional\u201d</a> that they might be \u201cdrunk with sight of power\u201d. From our own time it is hard not to be alarmed by how such delusions, along with extreme nationalist politics, and the actions of irresponsible, out-of-touch elites, sent Europe crashing towards catastrophe.</p> <p><em>The Pursuit of Power</em> offers both a compelling big picture and a flavour of the time. Evans conveys the era\u2019s \u201cstrangeness and familiarity\u201d, revealing the many faces of a much-misunderstood century whose imperialism and revolutions remain influential. The last line of \u201cRecessional\u201d is ubiquitous, but its warning about the transience of power and the dangers of ignorance illustrates the timeliness of Evans\u2019s work: \u201cLest we forget.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 To order <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pursuit-of-power.html\"><em>The Pursuit of Power</em></a> for \u00a328.70 (RRP \u00a335) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

  "<p>It\u2019s midday, and the meat stalls in Turin\u2019s open-air food market, Porta Palazzo, are crowded with customers browsing the beef, salami and prosciutto on offer. Shopping for meat is an everyday ritual in the capital city of Piedmont, a region of Italy with a rich culinary history \u2013 but this could all be about to change.</p> <p>In the summer the new mayor Chiara Appendino \u2013 of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) \u2013 announced plans to make Turin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/21/turin-mayor-italys-first-vegetarian-city-five-star\">Italy\u2019s first vegetarian city</a>. The exact details of Appendino\u2019s five-year plan have yet to be fleshed out, but the city is expected to set up educational projects in schools to teach students about animal welfare and nutrition. There are also plans to create a vegetarian map of the city for tourists, and introduce a weekly meat-free day.</p> <p>\u201cThe promotion of vegan and vegetarian diets is a fundamental act in safeguarding our environment, the health of our citizens and the welfare of our animals,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20160721/new-mayor-wants-to-turn-turin-into-italys-first-vegan-city\">the programme said in a launch statement</a> in July. \u201cLeading medical, nutritional and political experts will help promote a culture of respect in our schools, teaching children how to eat well while protecting the earth and animal rights.\u201d <br></p> <p>But the plans are proving divisive. While environmentalists and vegetarians welcome them, others argue they contravene the culinary tradition of the region. The local butchers\u2019 association has responded by telling the mayor\u2019s office it is privileging one form of nutrition over another upon which they are economically dependent. The association has also opposed a meat-free day, saying if this happens they would want a meat-only day too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The vegan choice is only part of the plan to make our city more sustainable and promote environmental issues</p> <footer> <cite>Stefania Giannuzzi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The response is similarly negative among the venders in Porta Palazzo. The open-air food market where they work has been active since the 19th century, selling a range of products sourced locally from farms around the city. Fabio, a meat seller who has worked in the market for two decades, offers a brisk response: \u201cI am not happy, of course. I sell meat!\u201d He took over the stall when his father retired, but says it\u2019s less popular these days. \u201cIn the last few years my sales have dropped by maybe 40-50% and I believe that this is partly because being vegan has become so fashionable \u2013 there\u2019s a message nowadays that meat is bad for you, it\u2019s all over the TV and media.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769d742f024f78c4be44e2bb97b7be2be3ea4aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/769d742f024f78c4be44e2bb97b7be2be3ea4aa3/0_43_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Proscuitto stall\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some meat sellers are worried they are losing business with the increasing popularity of veganism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the corner, Giannona Vito, 60, says that good quality meat will always have a place in this city. \u201cI don\u2019t think that people will stop eating meat or go vegan no matter what you do, but the younger generation are pickier. They want less but what they do get has to be of a high quality.\u201d</p> <p>But Stefania Giannuzzi, a new councillor for the environment and deputy mayor, believes there has been a misunderstanding, mainly caused by the media, about what they are trying to achieve. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about forcing people to eat a certain way and we don\u2019t want to clash with the meat industry. Instead, it\u2019s about raising awareness and showing people that there is an alternative if they are interested. The vegan choice is only part of the plan to make our city more sustainable and promote environmental issues,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Some people believe that this shouldn\u2019t be a priority, however, and there are other issues that need to be addressed more urgently. Barbara Stancati, a local parent, says they need to sort out the quality of the food in schools before introducing lessons on animal welfare and sustainability. \u201cThe schools in Italy have a lot of problems. I find it strange that the local government wants to tell people to change their eating habits and become vegan when they don\u2019t even have enough money for toilet paper in the schools. They tell us to bring it in. They should focus on that instead. There are much bigger issues for the city.\u201d</p> <p>She says of plans to introduce a vegan festival, \u201cwhy not?\u201d but adds that there should be more focus on the cultural losses that have hit the city recently \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/turins-top-museum-official-quits-five-star-mayor-chiara-appendino-manet-sponsor\">a major sponsor of a proposed \u00c9douard Manet exhibition backed out</a> of hosting the show in Turin, favouring Milan instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df6161b790f937bd541142984823e153a0313c46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6161b790f937bd541142984823e153a0313c46/0_145_5572_3343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomatoes on sale at the open air market of Piazza della Repubblica, Turin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it possible to balance vegetarianism and the famous meat-producing industry of Piedmont?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Harding/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all the resistance there is also support. Egidio Dansero, an academic who teaches culture and politics at the University of Turin, says: \u201cThis could be a really positive step in cultural and economic terms. We can embrace both diets.

That\u2019s a rise of just 0.4% over the previous year, but still one of the fastest rates of change anywhere in the world. In Turin, according to Corriere Della Sera, there are now <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2016/07/26/will-turin-become-italys-first-vegan-city\">more than 30 vegan and vegetarian restaurants</a>, many of which have sprung up in recent years.</p> <p>One of those restaurants, Ratatouille, which opened three years ago, can be found near the river Po. Inside, the owner, Silvia Voltolini, says that veganism has been rising long before the mayor stepped in: \u201cEvery year more and more people are coming through the doors. I cannot say the exact number, but it\u2019s definitely something I have noticed; and they are not all vegans but also people interested in trying a plant-based diet.\u201d</p> <p>Claudia Giacometti, 26, who works at Rattatouille, is vegan and welcomes Appendino\u2019s attempts to educate people on this choice. She believes that the tide is changing in terms of what people eat as this diet becomes more popular. \u201cAt first it was something that was hard for my family to accept but now I live alone it\u2019s fine. I come from a big Italian family and my mum has tried to eat like me but my sister isn\u2019t into it. When I go home I prepare vegan food for the whole family now.</p> <p>The rise of veganism in Italy appears to be driven by the young, according to Giacometti who says that people are becoming vegan for environmental reasons. She notes that when older people convert it tends to be about their health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d27fcc22f5a3b7170a73eec811e30320bb0a38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d27fcc22f5a3b7170a73eec811e30320bb0a38/0_72_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia and Marika in Ratatouille.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ratatouille is one of many vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Turin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Marsh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The response to this decision, however, may be premature as five months after the announcement nothing has happened. Giuseppe Ientile, 32, owner of Manz\u00f2, a popular steak house feels it never will. \u201cMeat is especially important for the tradition of the area and Piedmont in particular is known for meat. I am not worried about the popularity of the vegan diet, it\u2019s just fashionable at the moment and the mayor wants to win the vote. I believe that her vegan stuff is part of this and for publicity.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Michelangelo Conoscenti, who teaches English Language and Linguistics in the Department of Culture, Politics and Society at the University of Turin, agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t think this vegan plan is part of a larger plan to bring tourism to the area but rather vegetarians have been recognised as an important part of the electorate and it\u2019s about getting votes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/16/milan-fight-against-food-waste-ugly-fruit-grassroots-world-food-day\">Milan leads fight against food waste \u2013 with ugly fruit and Michelin-starred soup kitchens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deputy mayor Giannuzzi indicates, however, that it\u2019s much more personal. She doesn\u2019t eat meat herself and it\u2019s something she believes in. She says that this is part of a much bigger plan about sustainability \u2013 a global issue, not just one affecting Turin or even Italy. \u201cThe main thing here is really focusing on the fact that this isn\u2019t about imposing a dietary change or ethics on people, but it\u2019s about raising awareness that there are other possibilities that can have a positive environmental impact. We all need to think healthier for our environment and ourselves. This isn\u2019t just an issue affecting Italy it affects the world.\u201d</p> <p>She admits that it\u2019s gong to be a long process: \u201cI don\u2019t think that we will have an impact straight away \u2013 it\u2019s the start of a long process to change sensibilities.\u201d</p> <p>But the mayor\u2019s office could be underestimating the challenge they face in Turin. Conoscenti says: \u201cI don\u2019t see Turin as the city to lead this cultural change, because people come here to drink our regional wines and eat good meat. The Catholic church has already made Friday a free-meat day (fish can be eaten instead), but it is rare for families to comply with this rule. We don\u2019t even eat that much meat anyway and we don\u2019t like to be told what to do in terms of our diet.

  "<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-development-aid-do-it-better-but-do-it\">Guardian editorial</a> wondered why NGOs were giving the government a free ride over its latest regressive step in international development policy. \u201cThe positive case for aid is not being made,\u201d it said and ended by urging international NGOs to \u201cget their act together\u201d.</p> <p>On this point, I wholeheartedly agree. But tragically, it\u2019s not quite that simple. What the writer seems to be unaware of is the fact that the rights of civil society, including the right of our NGOs to challenge government policy, are slowly being eroded. And this is what gives our government, and Priti Patel, the secretary of state for international development, the free ride they so desperately want. Democracy and a healthy civil society demand free and open debate. Both legally and practically, this is what we may no longer have. </p> <p>It has happened relatively quietly. In 2014 the government passed the Lobbying Act which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/28/lobbying-bill-passes-house-lords\">imposed restrictions</a> on how much charities and NGOs were able to spend on campaigning in the run up to national elections. </p> <p>Then, earlier this year the \u201canti-advocacy clause\u201d was brought in by the government. Added into the contracts of NGOs who receive government funding, the clause imposes restrictions on how that money can be spent. Specifically: \u201cthe following costs are not Eligible Expenditure: Payments that support activity intended to influence or attempt to influence Parliament, Government or political parties, or attempting to influence the awarding or renewal of contracts and grants, or attempting to influence legislative or regulatory action.\u201d There was a <a href=\"http://blogs.ncvo.org.uk/2016/02/06/anti-advocacy-clause-is-counter-productive/\">chorus of protest</a> from NGOs and the government said they would \u201cpause\u201d the policy - although no timeframe has been set for this \u201cpause\u201d. But the clause is already in a large number of NGO contracts and no one is particularly clear about what a \u201cpause\u201d means in legal terms. </p> <p>On its own, this hasn\u2019t necessarily gagged civil society voices. Several individuals from NGOs have argued to me that they still campaign, they just do so with different pots of funds. Others have stated that instead of jumping on the critical bandwagon, and enabling the likes of the Daily Mail to further trash aid, they are instead awaiting the outcome of the DfID civil society review (due out today), something that will determine their relationship with the department in the years to come. </p> <p>It\u2019s when you take these two together, alongside other measures taken by the government and the fact that many NGOs receive government funding to deliver services, that alarm bells should ring. Whether by force or by fear, NGOs have started to self-censor, cautiously awaiting the government\u2019s next political move before speaking out. They fear being relegated to the likes of simple service deliverers, their years of insider influence now redundant. </p> <p>It is the beginning of a downward slope. Civicus, which tracks civic space worldwide, has found that the reduction of rights for civil society voices is a growing and worrying trend worldwide, moving from the usual suspects like China and Russia to liberal democracies, including the UK. In the UK, they point out that the space for civil society has narrowed, citing anti-terrorism laws and some restrictions on the right to assemble.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the less obvious tactics, such as contractual obligations that are passing virtually unnoticed, that are now sending the most chilling effects through civil society, according to research by the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-policy-and-campaigns/closing-space-report-2016\">Charities Aid Foundation</a> [pdf]. \u201cMost worrying are the restrictions being placed on advocacy and campaigning, with a climate of uncertainty ... that prevents organisations from speaking up on behalf of beneficiaries,\u201d they argue. </p> <p>International development NGOs are both a victim and a cause of the position we\u2019ve found ourselves in. Fifteen years ago, British NGOs were shouting from the rooftops to bring forward a progressive sea change in international development. Some of that campaigning has resulted in positive global shifts in policies on aid and debt. Yet in spite of political commitments to 0.7%, the so-called \u201cgolden years\u201d of development now seems to have given way to a darker, meaner era, one in which our politicians demand reciprocal benefits, for our own ends. Patel is leading the charge to see our aid budget provide benefits to the UK \u2013 straying very close to forms of \u201ctied\u201d aid that were dismissed, both legally and ethically, over 20 years ago. Like the Brexit campaign, she\u2019s riding the wave of Daily Mail aid haters, with glee.</p> <p>Advocacy is a challenging thing. It threatens those in power. But that\u2019s what it should do. British NGOs started their journey by holding those in power to account for letting poverty in the developing world go unnoticed. Regardless of what we think about the current rhetorical direction of aid policy, more important is that we fight to uphold our rights to dissent and campaign, and that we do so openly without fear. The government is trying to curb those rights and it has almost succeeded. Let\u2019s not wait until it is too late. The last thing we should be doing in response is meekly going about our business, cautiously awaiting their next move.</p> <p><em>Tell us about your own experiences and concerns for UK NGOs using the form below.

  "<p>Canada is broadening its horizons on aid, and that\u2019s just the way Marie-Claude Bibeau likes it.

Yet within this tapestry of ideas was something so elegant and elastic that it walks a path from then to now with ease \u2013 a unified theory of media that describes our relationship to its technologies in a single phrase; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha\" title=\"\">E=mc<sup>2</sup> of the information age</a>. The medium is the&#xa0;message.</p> <p>McLuhan starts with a simple thought, then spirals outward in surprising ways. His imaginative leap involved seeing the media we create as \u201cextensions of ourselves\u201d, whose primary importance is to change not what we know, but our relationship to the world and the processes by which we act upon it; how we think, behave, dream and connect with other people. The medium is its own message, enabling and constraining in and of itself. \u201cWe shape our tools and thereafter they shape us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Through the hallucinatory fug of 2016 I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about McLuhan \u2013 and never more than in the past fortnight, when the confluence of two apparently unrelated events suddenly struck me as significant. First a candidate for the American presidency threatened to repudiate an election result if he lost, opening a path to civil disobedience or violence on the part of his followers. I\u2019m working in Los Angeles at the moment, and hearing this reminded me of the way two separate Americans recently offered sympathy for my having to live under sharia law in the UK, commiserating with the way Birmingham is now off-limits to all but Islamic State members and Jason Statham. When I told them that, unless this had occurred in the fortnight since I\u2019d left, it wasn\u2019t true, they looked me coolly in the eye and insisted it was \u2013 that I, who live in the UK, was mistaken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddb77ad12d8bfb8171bf9bd56ac4e4e0f9a78f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddb77ad12d8bfb8171bf9bd56ac4e4e0f9a78f2e/0_32_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men helped popularise new entertainment outlets such as HBO and Netflix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How on earth to make sense of this?

At the end of 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/22/netflix-amazon-sky-uk-subscribers-streaming\" title=\"\">5m UK households paid for Netflix</a>, a figure projected to double by 2020. The company\u2019s constituency is disproportionately young and upscale, according to the Broadcasters\u2019 Audience Research Board.</p> <p>Praise be to Don (Draper), I thought. When in the US, shows by Netflix and competitors such as HBO, Amazon, AMC and Hulu are now <em>all</em> I watch; in the UK <em>almost all</em>, as even the BBC\u2019s willingness to take risks falls to a fragmenting audience, political pressure and the concomitant obsession with bums on seats. And this is good, n\u2019est-ce pas? People whose education/outlook/experience disposes them to look for surprise and originality in their media have a place to go. People who want the comfort of predictability have their places, too. On a personal level, how could anyone lament a situation held to have brought a \u201cgolden age\u201d of TV drama and panoply of diverse news sources, in which everyone gets <em>exactly</em> what they want?</p> <p>Pan back and the picture looks more complex. McLuhan began as an enthusiast for the \u201cnew electronic interdependence\u201d he saw TV and (subsequently) the internet creating. The \u201cglobal village\u201d, he promised, would mimic the intimacy and sense of community surrendered to the alienations of the mechanical age, until \u201c\u2018time\u2019 has ceased, \u2018space\u2019 has vanished\u201d and we live in a \u201csimultaneous happening\u201d. With broadcast TV, there was a case for this: early satellite pictures of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/general-vo-nguyen-giap\" title=\"\">notorious Tet offensive</a> are claimed to have turned public opinion against the Vietnam war in 1968, and the first moon landing a year later could not have made the impact it did but for TV.</p> <p>Citizens had to share the same few networks, tolerating others\u2019 programmes and uniting regularly over favourites, be it Morecambe and Wise or Top of the Pops, which though usually crap, almost everyone watched together.

We\u2019re becoming strangers to one another, and with hindsight this isn\u2019t surprising. When uptake of the pre-web internet began in the late 1980s, the global pooling of information \u2013 and wisdom \u2013 was much trumpeted. But if you talk to early adopters, most will say the net\u2019s real wonder was in allowing them to commune with like-minded people everywhere, unfettered by geography.</p> <p>If you were an avant-garde jazz fan in Billericay, now you could find other fans to talk to, until before long you had your own virtual \u201ccommunity\u201d. And unlike a physical space, you never had to leave this one, never had to interact with anyone you didn\u2019t want to. Twenty-five years later, net algorithms will feed you material based entirely on your past, with no notion of a potential future; of growth or challenge. We\u2019re all being reinforced, all the time, and it feels good \u2013 until we find ourselves on the sharp side of a Brexit vote.</p> <p>There seems little doubt that over two and a half decades, this atomisation has changed us \u2013 the medium has been the message \u2013 helping to create an environment in which superficially confounding phenomena such as Brexit and Donald Trump and the measurable rise of narcissism are perfectly logical, if not inevitable. Indeed, the provocative documentarian Adam Curtis goes one step further, suggesting in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/15/hypernormalisation-adam-curtis-trump-putin-syria\" title=\"\">new film HyperNormalisation</a> that the new technology, far from having caused the fragmentation we see and feel, merely amplified a model of \u201cradical individualism\u201d that had been evolving since the late 1960s and is now dominant. In this model \u2013 an understandable reaction to the misuse of power by leaders in the 50s and 60s \u2013 truth to self becomes the ultimate and only truth, with self-expression its conveyor and personal preference the lone arbiter.</p> <p>It\u2019s been said that with new technologies we tend to foresee the positives but be blindsided by the negatives. Can individual choice be a negative? When I set out to write my book Moondust, which involved tracking down the (then) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/24/biography.features\" title=\"\">nine surviving men who had walked on the moon</a>, one of my questions was why some had fared well upon returning \u2013 spinning off at delightfully surprising tangents \u2013 and others not.</p> <p>In retrospect, it seems to me that those inclined to see their feats not as individual achievements, but as merely the most visible part of a shared collective effort, were more likely to integrate their experiences into productive lives thereafter. So in my opinion, the most empowering, liberating feeling a human can have is that in the scheme of things they\u2019re unimportant, in service to something greater than themselves, with all the constraint to personal choice so entailed.</p>",
  "<p>Two developments this week should bring climate and sustainability-related issues to the top of company board agendas. </p> <p>The first was the <a href=\"http://cpd.org.au/2016/10/directorsduties/\">release</a> by the Centre for Policy Development and Future Business Council of a <a href=\"http://cpd.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Legal-Opinion-on-Climate-Change-and-Directors-Duties.pdf\">legal opinion</a> by Sydney silk Noel Hutley SC that found that directors who don\u2019t properly consider the material impacts of climate change on their business risk personal liability for breach of duty. This analysis builds on earlier work, most notably by instructing solicitor Sarah Barker at MinterEllison, highlighting that courts will take a dim view of directors who fail to perceive or respond adequately to foreseeable climate-related risks. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/04/hazelwoods-closure-was-inevitable-so-where-was-the-transition-plan\">Hazelwood's closure was inevitable.

Although Australia is yet to ratify the agreement, it is already law in many of our largest trading partners, committing them and much of the globe to ambitious carbon reduction targets and eventually a net zero carbon economy. </p> <p>The mindset of business leaders and regulators around the world has shifted \u2013 the business and financial risks climate change poses are not only real and significant but they are here now. As the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said in September, if climate change is a \u201ctragedy of the horizons\u201d then the Paris agreement \u2013 and the markets that are already pricing in major changes in business as usual \u2013 bring that horizon forward.</p> <p>These two developments were front of mind at a business roundtable I helped to moderate last month to discuss Hutley\u2019s opinion. </p> <p>I was struck there by how clearly directors now see this challenge. Hutley\u2019s opinion confirms we now have little choice but to understand how important climate change and sustainability risks are for us personally and for our companies, and act accordingly. The question directors should be, and now are, asking themselves is not \u201cshould we be considering this at all\u201d but \u201chow do we make sure we\u2019re doing this well enough?\u201d </p> <p>One positive to come out of Hutley\u2019s opinion and the Paris agreement is that there is only an upside for companies and directors that do it best.

The bureau needs adequate funding to provide robust, accurate data and that\u2019s clearly not currently the case.</p> <p>\u201cThese job cuts have been announced just weeks after the ABS admitted budget pressures were also forcing it to consider scaling back its collection of retail and housing data and scrapping altogether statistics ranging from prison and agricultural data to car sales and lending finance.\u201d</p> <p>The ABS spokeswoman said: \u201cWith the government\u2019s $257m investment to modernise the ABS\u2019s ageing IT systems and processes, the agency will achieve efficiencies and require fewer staff in coming years. As the ABS shifts from manual processes and identifies efficiencies, staff with skills that are not essential for the future [including staff in roles that are no longer required] may apply for packages.\u201d</p>",

Environmental groups urged governments to do more.</p> \n<p>Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: \u201cThe voices of the people who will be hit hardest by the devastating impacts of climate change need to be heard.

However, the deal is not enough to keep people and the planet safe.\u201d </p> \n<p>Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe Paris agreement is a major step in the right direction, but it falls a long way short of the giant leap needed to tackle climate change. Far tougher action is needed to rapidly slash emissions.\u201d Greenpeace said that while the deal needed strengthening, it was a \u201cmomentous occasion\u201d that it had come into force.</p> \n<p>Next week, governments will meet in Morocco under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss how to put the Paris accord into force, and meet its aims.</p> \n<p>Patricia Espinosa, the UN\u2019s climate chief, and Salaheddine Mezouar, foreign minister of Morocco, said in a joint statement: \u201cHumanity will look back on 4 November 2016 as the day that countries of the world shut the door on inevitable climate disaster and set off with determination towards a sustainable future. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year\">Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe Paris agreement is undoubtedly a turning point in the history of common human endeavour, capturing the combined political, economic and social will of governments, cities, regions and businesses and investors to overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lord Turner, former head of the UK government\u2019s statutory advisory committee on climate change, said: \u201cThe fact that this crucial UN agreement is coming into force within a year of signing is a hugely important achievement, and the good news is that agreement to the Paris deal is being matched by real progress in many countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, fossil fuel industries see continued opportunities for development within a low-carbon world. </p> \n<p>Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: \u201cFor many countries, coal will continue to play a significant role in economic development, industrialisation and urbanisation.

  "<p>Low-income parents will feel the financial squeeze at every stage of childhood if the government pushes through cuts to family payments and paid parental leave.</p> <p>What was once an effective family payments system \u2013 redesigned by the Hawke government to achieve a 30% reduction in child poverty \u2013 has been cut to the bone in recent years. Since 2009 alone, more than $12bn has been ripped out of the family payments system.</p> <p>Both sides of politics are responsible, with measures such as removing the link between family payments and wages (an effective cut of more than $10 a week), freezing eligibility thresholds, tightening income tests and abolishing bonus payments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/paid-parental-leave-most-australian-voters-want-end-to-double-dipping\">Paid parental leave: most Australian voters want end to 'double-dipping'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On latest figures, there are 731,000 children living below the poverty line, including more than 40% of children in single parent families. Now the Coalition wants to cut payments to these families more in an attempt to generate a budget surplus.</p> <p>The government\u2019s latest attempt to do so is currently before the Senate. If they succeed in passing the bill, single parent families with teenage kids will be the worst affected, by $60 per week for those with two teens.</p> <p>Families with very young children will not be spared either.</p> <p>Those thinking about starting a family cheered when the paid parental leave scheme was first announced in 2010. Finally, Australia took a tentative first step towards a proper paid parental leave scheme. An essential component of the scheme, developed by the Productivity Commission, was that it be in addition to existing employer-funded schemes. Offering a guaranteed minimum of 18 weeks leave at the minimum wage was an important first step towards meeting the World Health Organisation\u2019s recommended 26 weeks of paid parental leave to support breastfeeding and bonding between mothers and babies.</p> <p>The scheme is not generous by global standards. Our government paid parental leave scheme runs second to last among OECD nations, lagging well behind the UK and Canada.</p> <p>Any suggestion that new parents are \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d is just an attempt to give cover to what this is really about \u2013 budget savings. The proposed changes would reverse Australia\u2019s baby steps towards a universal paid parental leave scheme and entrench our reputation as an international laggard on gender equity.</p> <p>While the child care package will benefit many families in paid work, young children whose parents who are not employed will have their access to early education halved.</p> <p>In the name of cost-cutting, it seems, our pursuit of gender equality and child well-being have virtually disappeared as national government priorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/20/australia-does-not-have-a-welfare-problem-we-have-a-poverty-problem\">Australia does not have a welfare problem.

They should be working with the opposition to deliver these long overdue reforms.</p> <p>Stripping money from our poorest families should not be the default economic position of any civilised society.</p>",
  "<p>Providing free breakfast clubs for primary schools in disadvantaged areas boosted maths and literacy results even among those pupils who didn\u2019t attend, according to new research.</p> <p>The findings suggest that government funding of universal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/29/fall-in-proportion-of-pupils-getting-free-school-meals\">free lunches for children</a> in infant school in England may be more productive \u2013 and more cost-effective \u2013 if spent on breakfasts clubs instead.</p> <p>Kevan Collins, chief executive of the Educational Endowment Foundation which supported the work, said: \u201cThe government has committed to spending \u00a310m a year on healthy breakfast clubs, as part of their plan to tackle childhood obesity.
